leading cause of acute cardiac failure in young individuals. Over 300 mutations throughout β-cardiac myosin, including in the motor domain, are associated with HCM. A β-cardiac myosin motor mutation (R712L) leads to a severe form of HCM. Actin-gliding motility of R712L-myosin is inhibited, despite near-normal ATPase kinetics. By optical trapping, the working stroke of R712L-myosin was decreased 4-fold, but actin-attachment durations were normal. A prevalent hypothesis that HCM mutants are hypercontractile is thus not universal. R712 is adjacent to the binding site of the heart failure drug omecamtiv mecarbil (OM). OM suppresses the working stroke of normal β-cardiac myosin, but remarkably, OM rescues the R712L-myosin working stroke. Using a flow chamber to interrogate a single molecule during buffer exchange, we found OM rescue to be reversible. Thus, the R712L mutation uncouples lever arm rotation from ATPase activity and this inhibition is rescued by OM.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single molecule</kwd><kwd>cardiac myosin</kwd><kwd>optical trapping</kwd><kwd>optical tweezers</kwd><kwd>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</kwd><kwd>omecamtiv mecarbil</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL133863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forgacs</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name><name><surname>Winkelmann</surname><given-names>Donald</given-names></name><name><surname>Ostap</surname><given-names>E Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Yale E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CMMI:15–48571</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Yale E</given-names></name><name><surname>Ostap</surname><given-names>E Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanochemical defects of a β-cardiac myosin mutation that results in severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are reported and the heart failure drug omecamtiv mecarbil rescues these defects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (HCMs) affect one in 500 individuals and are the leading cause of sudden cardiac failure in individuals under 35 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marian and Braunwald, 2017</xref>). The disease is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte disarray, and interstitial fibrosis resulting in impaired diastolic function often with preserved or enhanced systolic function. Severity of HCM varies markedly, with severe cases resulting in cardiac arrhythmias and potential for sudden cardiac death. In congenital HCM, mutations occur in more than 20 sarcomeric protein genes including MYH7 (β-cardiac myosin heavy chain), the predominant myosin isoform responsible for active contraction in human ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marian and Braunwald, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spudich, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Over 300 mutations throughout the entire coding region of MYH7 have been associated with HCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Homburger et al., 2016</xref>), with many of these occurring in regions predicted to affect mechanochemical activity. Some mutations are clustered in a region of the myosin motor that interacts with the thick filament, termed the ‘mesa,’ that stabilizes a biochemically ‘off’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spudich, 2015</xref>). A widely cited model relating myosin function to disease proposes that HCM arises from myosin mutations that enhance activity yielding hypercontractile myocytes (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spudich, 2019</xref>). Many MYH7 mutations examined in biophysical and physiological studies have been found to cause changes in individual kinetic steps that impact the fraction of intermediates in force-producing states. While some confer apparent hypercontractile activity, no uniform kinetic signature for HCM has emerged from these studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ujfalusi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vera et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deacon et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is not clear if all HCM mutations in the myosin motor conform to the hypercontractile hypothesis. It is therefore important to perform experiments that assess the biochemical and mechanical activities of a range of HCM mutations to understand how missense mutations affect contractile activity.</p><p>R712L is a rare missense mutation in the motor domain of β-cardiac myosin that causes HCM and is characterized by sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sakthivel et al., 2000</xref>). R712 forms a salt bridge with E497 that is in position to stabilize the mechanical interaction between the converter/lever arm domain and the relay helix in the motor, which couples the ATP binding site to the converter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Disruption of this salt bridge in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscle myosin resulted in impaired myosin ATPase and motility rates, and disorganized sarcomere assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kronert et al., 2015</xref>). Since the converter domain amplifies small conformational changes in the ATPase site into large lever arm swings, its disruption could decouple ATPase activity from the lever arm swing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Motility of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutant, R712L-myosin, is impaired.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon rendering of the β-cardiac myosin crystal structure (PDB: 5N69).

Although OM abrogates the working stroke of myosin, the prolonged attachment increases calcium sensitivity in muscle fibers via cooperative activation of the thin filament (TF) regulatory system, which activates the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Governali et al., 2020</xref>). At submicromolar concentrations, it has been shown to improve cardiac output in both animal models and in human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Teerlink et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cleland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Teerlink, 2020</xref>). We reasoned that the HCM mutation of R712 to a leucine (R712L), located adjacent to the drug binding site, might serve as a mechanistically informative target, and might alter the kinetics and step size of β-cardiac myosin in a similar manner to OM.</p><p>In the present work, we show that the R712L mutation in recombinant human β-cardiac myosin does not directly confer gain-of-function, but rather results in inhibited motility due to a 4-fold decrease in working stroke amplitude, while only marginally affecting actin-attachment kinetics. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the R712L structure suggest disruption of the R712-E497 salt bridge increases the compliance of the lever arm by reducing mechanical stability of the interaction between the converter and the relay helix in the motor domain. Thus, we propose that the reduced working stroke results from uncoupling the converter/lever arm motions from the ATPase-dependent changes in the motor domain. Surprisingly, addition of OM did not further suppress motility and the working stroke, but instead rescued activity in a concentration-dependent fashion. We designed a flow chamber that enabled exchange of buffers in real time while maintaining cross-bridge cycles with individual actomyosin pairs in 3-bead optical trap assays. These solution changes allowed us to show reversible rescue of single-mutant myosin molecules by OM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The β-cardiac myosin HCM mutant, R712L, has impaired actin filament motility</title><p>Human β-cardiac myosin wild type (WT-myosin) and R712L mutant (R712L-myosin) HMM constructs were expressed in C2C12 myoblasts and purified. We assessed five independent preparations of WT- and R712L-myosins and found no differences in expression levels and yield of these constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Comparable yields of the R712L proteins suggest no difference in the stability in this culture system. We next used in vitro gliding assays to measure the ability of WT- and R712L-myosins to move actin filaments. Myosins were adsorbed to a nitrocellulose-coated glass coverslip, and the proportion of filaments that moved and their speeds were determined as a function of the myosin concentration. R712L-myosin propelled actin filaments more slowly than WT-myosin at all concentrations tested, with maximum velocities of 1.46 ± 0.11 µm·s<sup>−1</sup> for WT-myosin and 0.29 ± 0.02 µm·s<sup>−1</sup> (mean ± SD) for R712L-myosin at loading concentrations 100 µg·mL<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

The R712L mutation has only minor effects on the individual rate constants of the ATPase cycle. There is a 2-fold increase in the actin-activated P<sub>i</sub> release rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) but little effect on attachment durations or ATPase rates compared to WT, indicating that phosphate release is not the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle of R712L-myosin.

This result is surprising, since normally the rate of ADP dissociation limits unloaded shortening velocity of the intact muscle, and thus a &gt;2-fold increase in ADP release would be expected to produce a higher velocity in the gliding assay; yet, R712L-myosin has a 5-fold slower actin gliding rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The position of the myosin lever arm and converter fluctuates during a 100 ns simulation, but remains close to the orientation found in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The interface between the C-terminal end of the relay helix remains stably coupled to the β-sheet at the base of the converter domain. This coupling is mediated by stable charge interactions of R712, T761, and K762 of the converter with E497, E500, Y501 and E504 of the relay helix. Additionally, the aliphatic chain of R712 forms a hydrophobic pocket with F709, F764, E500, Y501, E504, and I506 further stabilizing the interface (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, left).

The relay–converter interface subsequently opened 2–3 Å, allowing water molecules into the hydrophobic pocket.

There was little difference in the duty ratio calculated from these attachment durations for WT-myosin (0.095) and R712L-myosin (0.078), assuming the ATPase cycle time is given by V<sub>max</sub>. A minor component in the lifetime distribution (at 7.5 s<sup>−1</sup>) was statistically significant, but comprised only 3% of the amplitude. The distribution of R712L-myosin actin attachment durations was also well described by the sum of two exponentials, with the predominant component (70 s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) similar to WT.

At saturating OM concentrations, the actin gliding velocity driven by R712L-myosin (1.1 ± 0.26 µm·s<sup>−1</sup>) was near the WT-myosin velocity in the absence of OM. The half-maximal concentration for activation of motility is 30 µM, which is considerably higher than the EC<sub>50</sub> for inhibition of WT-myosin (0.1 µM). This result suggests that the R712L mutation affects the OM binding site, weakening the affinity. The addition of OM to R712L-myosin only moderately affects the kinetic parameters of the ATPase cycle. The exception is the value of K<sub>TF</sub>, the half-saturation actin subunit concentration for activation of the ATPase, which increases with OM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We found that individual myosin molecules would continue to interact with the actin dumbbell through exchange of solutions. Subsequently, the flow displaced the dumbbell slightly, in the amount expected from the Stokes drag at the fluid velocity, but the beads returned to their previous positions when the flow ended. Following this exchange, additional data were collected in the OM-free condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, red trace).

R712 is located in the converter region at the fulcrum of the lever arm in the myosin head and forms a salt bridge with relay helix E497, likely stabilizing the lever at a functionally crucial region of the motor and maintaining mechanical integrity when the converter and lever arm tilt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Given the importance of this region in the mechanochemistry of myosin, we investigated the effect of the mutation on key steps of the actomyosin ATPase pathway, in vitro actin gliding, and the working stroke displacement and kinetics. R712L-myosin has a drastically reduced actin gliding rate and a markedly reduced mechanical working stroke, despite minimal alteration of rates of the biochemical steps in its actomyosin ATPase cycle. The suppressed working stroke explains the reduced filament gliding velocity and presumably the suppressed cardiac performance in the disease. MD simulations support the concept that disruption of the R712-E497 salt bridge destabilizes the interaction between the converter domain and the relay helix, thereby decoupling ATPase activity from work output.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The working stroke of R712L-myosin is defective</title><p>Ensemble averages of single R712L-myosin interactions show a substantially smaller average displacement (1.3 nm) compared to WT-myosin (4.4 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Importantly, averages of R712L-myosin do not reveal a two-step working stroke, but rather show a single, small displacement immediately upon actin attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>—, red traces). Events synchronized at the end of attachment (reverse-ensemble averages) showed no kinetic rise before detachment, also supporting the absence of a second substep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In WT-myosin, an initial displacement (~3–4 nm) occurs upon strong actin binding and precedes release of orthophosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) from actin-myosin-ADP-P<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woody et al., 2019</xref>). This step is followed by a 1–2 nm displacement that takes place upon release of ADP from actin-myosin-ADP, which confers force dependence of actin detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woody et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Veigel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenberg et al., 2014</xref>). Because the R712L-myosin produces its small working stroke immediately upon attachment, and the P<sub>i</sub> release rate measured in biochemical experiments is not inhibited (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), we propose that the small working stroke in the mutant is linked to P<sub>i</sub> release rather than to ADP release. However, the smaller displacement and the absence of a second step indicate that the normal coupling between the active site and lever arm is substantially diminished. This loss of the second step may result in altered mechanosensitivity of myosin. Further characterization of R712L-myosin under load will be important to fully understand the mechanism of action of this mutation.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis for the observed smaller average displacement is that myosin alternates between a state having a normal displacement and a state with a defective working stroke.

Thus, the higher EC<sub>50</sub> for R712L-myosin may be the result of a disrupted OM binding site, thereby causing OM to bind only to the lower affinity post-powerstroke state. A surprising and counterintuitive finding of this study is that OM binding does not suppress the R712L working stroke, and it does not result in a prolonged time of attachment (SEPTA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Woody et al., 2018b</xref>). We suggest that SEPTA is the result of binding of OM to the pre-powerstroke state of WT-myosin.</p><p>How does OM rescue the R712L-myosin working stroke? We propose that OM binds to post-powerstroke state of R712L-myosin at the same site as WT-myosin, and its presence restores the mechanical integrity of this junction, reconnecting biochemical and mechanical activity. Binding of OM to R712L-myosin not only increases the size of the initial displacement that occurs upon actin binding, it also rescues the second substep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). MD simulations suggest that the R712L mutation may disrupt the OM binding site (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>) and alter the rigid coupling between the converter/lever arm and motor.

Intrinsic variability among optical trap recordings of working stroke displacements and kinetics is inevitable due to the probabilistic nature of the mechanical strain at time of attachment, caused by Brownian fluctuations of the bead-actin-bead dumbbell and, possibly, due to protein heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Steffen et al., 2001</xref>).

This assay allowed us to unambiguously demonstrate that the defective working stroke of a single R712L myosin can be rescued by OM binding, and that this rescue is reversible. Notably, at the intermediate OM concentration examined (&lt;50 µM), the average displacement of a single R712L-myosin molecule was in between the values obtained in the absence and presence of 50 µM OM, which suggests that OM was binding and dissociating during the acquisition of the trace.</p><p>Exchange of solutions is commonly applied in other single-molecule experiments, such as with DNA-binding proteins, where the sample can be moved into different flow streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gross et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forget et al., 2013</xref>).

To our knowledge, this is the first successful exchange of solutions while maintaining interrogation of an individual actomyosin pair with the three-bead assay. Further microfluidic improvements to the flow chamber should provide for more rapid comparison of conditions with increased statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The R712L mutation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</title><p>The R712L mutation very clearly results in suppression of motor function by uncoupling the ATPase activity of the myosin from its working stroke. We would expect that the contractility powered by a thick filament that contains R712L-myosins would exhibit decreased sliding velocity, force, and power output. Thus, simply considering the myosin activity, the R712L mutation does not fit into the paradigm expressed for several other mutations in which HCM mutations result in gain-of-function contractility.</p><p>Although a mechanism is not apparent, it is possible that disruption of force dependence in myosin may be a factor in the HCM phenotype, but further studies will be required to analyze this possibility. It is possible that in the context of the sarcomere of a heterozygous individual, the R712L mutation could result in a gain of function. As discussed above, we recently discovered that although OM inhibits the myosin power stroke and kinetics, at therapeutic concentrations it may act as a thin-filament sensitizer, allowing increased overall contractility at lower calcium concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Woody et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Governali et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, R712L-myosin could conceivably confer activating properties through the TF, or perhaps through the activation of other myosin heads from the thick filament, such as through alteration of the interacting heads motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spudich, 2015</xref>). Another likely possibility is that the gain-of-function concept is not universal in HCM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found that mutation of R712 to leucine leads to a defective working stroke in β-cardiac myosin, perhaps leading to defective cardiac contraction in this variant of HCM. OM rescues the defective working stroke of the mutant, and this surprising effect of OM is reversible upon exchanging buffers in individual myosin-actin dumbbell interaction sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Adenovirus manipulation</title><p>The human β-cardiac HMM (cHMM) encodes residues 1–1137 of the <italic>MYH7</italic> gene (GenBank: AAA51837.1) with a FLAG tag added on the C-terminus (1138–1146) of the S2 domain.

Two beams were produced by a polarizing beam splitter. The 500 nm beads were trapped, one in each beam, approximately 5 µm apart with trap stiffness of 0.05–0.07 pN·nm<sup>−1</sup> (as calculated via the power spectrum of each bead). Next, a fluorescently labeled actin filament of approximate length ~5–10 µm was tethered between the two beads. A pretension of ~3–5 pN was applied to the actin filament, and this bead-actin-bead ‘dumbbell’ was used to search for the presence of β-cardiac myosin on pedestal beads. Interactions with β-cardiac myosin could be detected by both a decrease in covariance of the two bead positions and power stroke deflection of the beads within the trap. Once a putative molecule was identified, the dumbbell was carefully positioned over the molecule such that it produced maximal deflections and interacted with the greatest frequency, and this position was maintained by a feedback system that stabilized the position of the stage based on images of the pedestal beads. We used custom-built programs (Labview, Matlab) to acquire data and calculate the feedback signal at 250 kHz. During acquisitions, we manually adjusted the position of the stage in steps of 6 nm axially along the dumbbell between acquisition traces to ensure even accessibility of actin-attachment target zones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Optical trap data analysis</title><p>We analyzed the optical trap data from force signals of the two beads as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Woody et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, we detected events by calculating the covariance of the two beads’ positions using an averaging window of 20–30 ms. The distribution of covariances from a 15 s recording of myosin interactions was well described by two Gaussian distributions. The first Gaussian peak at the lower covariance value is associated with the bound state of the actin dumbbell to the myosin molecule, while the second peak at higher covariance represents the covariance of the dumbbell beads while myosin was detached. The minimum detectable event time for each molecule studied (the dead time) was determined to be half of the covariance averaging window. This window was adjusted to be as low as possible while maintaining separation between bound and unbound peaks such that the unbound peak mean minus its standard deviation was greater than the bound peak plus its standard deviation. Molecules where this separation could not be achieved were not analyzed further.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Actomyosin binding events were identified and refined in a two-step process</title><p>First, in order to minimize false positives, events were selected where the covariance crossed from the average unbound covariance peak to the average of the bound covariance peak and back again. The start and end times were initially recorded where the covariance signal first crossed the average bound and unbound values, respectively. Next, as the covariance signal is a slightly delayed indicator of attachment and detachment, the event start was further refined by determining when the covariance trace first crossed below the value halfway between the bound and unbound peaks near the initial beginning marker of each event. ‘Near’ the originally detected event was defined as within 1.5x the instrument dead time or within the duration of the detected event, whichever was smaller. Event ends were refined similarly to the event beginnings, that the refined event ends were marked to the first point in time at which the covariance trace crossed above 80% of the way back toward the unbound peak. For display and further calculation, event starts and ends were shifted minus or plus 0.75x the dead time, respectively, to account for the effects of calculating the covariance using the finite averaging window.</p><p>Event durations were defined as the interval between these refined start and end times. Events shorter than the calculated instrument dead time were excluded from analysis. Ensemble averages were performed by aligning events at their refined beginnings (time-forward ensemble averages) or at their refined ends (time-reversed ensemble averages). To facilitate the averaging of events with various lengths, the displacement values for each of the interactions were extended forward or backward in time using the displacement of the interaction immediately before the event end or after the event start for time-forward and time-reversed ensemble averages, respectively. The total working stroke size was determined by subtracting the minimum position of the beads immediately prior to attachment from the time-forward extensions. The minimum value of the trace was determined with an 8 ms averaging window within +/− 0.2 s of the detected event start. The second substep of actomyosin displacement was determined by subtracting the total step size from the averaged extensions of the time-reversed ensemble averages. Signals were weighted such that each molecule contributed equally to averages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Attachment duration and step size parameter estimation</title><p>As previously described, we used MEMLET to estimate detachment rates and mean step sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Woody et al., 2016</xref>), which allowed us to perform maximum-likelihood estimation without the need for binning.

Holes were drilled in the 1 mm glass slides using a diamond-tipped drill bit, and PEEK tubing was inserted into the holes and sealed with UV-cured resin (Loon). Following insertion of the PEEK tubing, we used a razor blade to trim the tubing carefully to ensure the tubing was flush with the inner plane of the glass slide. Buffer A was used in the chamber, and a second buffer, ‘buffer B’, was prepared in a syringe and attached via PEEK tubing to the flow cell. Buffer B was the same as buffer A, but contained a different dependent (i.e., if buffer A contained OM, buffer B contained background DMSO, and vice versa). Volumes were carefully measured for each flow cell by addition of buffer A prior to sealing the chamber, and these volumes were used to adjust the flow rate of the syringe pump. The entrance syringe was loaded onto the ‘infuse’ side of a continuous flow push-pull syringe pump (KD Scientific 260 Legacy, Holliston, MA), and an oppositely oriented exit syringe was loaded onto the ‘withdraw’ side of the syringe pump. Data were first acquired with buffer A in the chamber, then the syringe pump was turned on to create a flow of ~0.5 chamber volumes per minute, which resulted in an average flow rate of ~0.5 mm·s<sup>−1</sup>. Due to the simultaneous motion of ‘infuse’ and ‘withdraw’ syringes, the buffer was gently exchanged with no change in pressure or volume. To fully exchange buffers, two full chamber volumes were flowed. After exchange, the pump was switched off, and acquisitions were restarted with the dumbbell in the same position over the pedestal bead. In the experiment where we partially reversed flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), the flow of the syringe pump was reversed flowing back 1.5 chamber volumes so that the chamber contained a mixture of buffer A and buffer B.

Mutations in β-cardiac myosin (MYH7) causes several cardiac diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). It has been proposed that HCM arises from mutations that enhance myosin activity, whereas DCM arises from loss-of-function mutants. Consistent with this view, omecamtiv mecarbil (OM), a drug in clinical phase III trials for the treatment of heart failure, was developed as a cardiac myosin activator. However, these authors and others in the field have recently shown that OM inhibits the velocity and force generation of native myosin, which disagrees with the predictions of the originally proposed &quot;gain of function&quot; model of HCM and suggests a more complicated mechanism for the molecular causes of these diseases.</p><p>The manuscript focuses on the R712L mutation, which is linked to severe HCM. R712 lies at the interface of the converter/lever arm and the relay helix and can form a salt bridge with E497. In many cases, HCM is classified as a hyper contractile phenotype but the report here demonstrates that this mutation is very disruptive of normal myosin function. Many mutations cause a mild dysfunction of myosin activity but are compensated by a disruption in the regulation of contraction which results in hyper contractile activity. Understanding how this severe mutation causes HCM could be very important in understanding the pathway from mutation to disease, which can take many years to develop.</p><p>Consistent with the location of the mutation, at the site of amplification of relay helix movement to the large swing of the lever arm, there is little disruption of the ATPase cycle but a loss of coupling between the ATPase and the mechanical events. This is shown by a loss of motility and step size while the ATPase remains normal. The mutation is also close to the site of OM binding. OM is a potential heart failure drug. Unexpectedly OM recovered some of the activity (motility and step size) when bound to the mutant myosin presumably by stabilizing the pre-power stroke structure allowing a more complete working stroke. Based on these results, the authors exclude the gain of function model for OM and propose a possible mechanism for how OM affects the force generation of myosin. Does this suggest that OM has potential therapeutic use for patients with this mutation? If so, it emphasizes the need to understand the molecular nature of the initial disruption to know which drugs may be useful to prevent disease progression.</p><p>Overall, this is an important paper with major implications for our understanding of HCM and the coupling of the ATPase and mechanical cycles in myosin. As always there are unanswered questions and the author could make some comments on these.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) One mechanism by which a severe mutation can still result in HCM could be through a low expression level of the mutant proteins. Is there any evidence of loss of stability – or lower expression levels in C2C12 cells compared to WT?</p><p>2) The authors briefly discuss how this disruptive mutation could result in activation:</p><p>&quot;Likewise, R712L-myosin could conceivably confer activating properties through the thin filament, or perhaps through activation of other myosins from the thick filament, although no mechanisms for those are apparent.&quot;</p><p>While it is not clear how this mutation could result in activation of the thin filament, the site of the mutation in the converter domain could conceivably disrupt the formation of the myosin interacting head motif by destabilizing the M.ADP.Pi pre-power stroke state. Again, the addition of OM could reverse this. The lower affinity of OM for the pre-powerstroke state is then the result of the binding energy required to stabilize the structure.</p><p>3) The apparent loss of the 2nd step in the laser trap assay (and its return in the presence of OM) brings up the question of the load dependence of the mutant myosin. Have the authors attempted to measure this in the motility assay or the laser trap?</p><p>4) While the Vmax of the ATPase remains unchanged for the mutant the KATPase value was ~ 4-fold smaller than WT. This seems unexpected in the context of the rest of the data presented. Similarly, OM does not change KATPase for the mutant but does appear to significantly increase KTF in the π release assay.</p><p>5) k-DAP and Vmax are of the same order for WT but k-DAP is 3 times Vmax for the mutant while KATPase and KTF are both very low. What is the predominant steady-state complex for the mutant – is it an actin attached step before π release? To phrase it a different way, how is π release accelerated &gt;2 fold for the mutant while keeping Vmax the same?</p><p>6) Following on from 4 and 5 have the authors measured the duty ratio for the mutant?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63691.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) One mechanism by which a severe mutation can still result in HCM could be through a low expression level of the mutant proteins.

We assessed 5 preparations each of WT- and R712L-myosin and analyzed the yield of purified myosin per unit culture dish for a fixed expression period, using a common infection protocol, comparable multiplicity of infection, and identical purification methods. Average yield of WT-myosin was 174 µg per p150 dish (range: 100 – 262) and 157 µg (range: 126 – 210) for R712L-myosin. SDS- PAGE analysis of each step from each purification from cell lysis through the final purified protein was performed to detect losses from individual steps. Comparable yields of the R712L proteins suggest no difference in the stability in this culture system. This information is now included in supplemental information (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) and is discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors briefly discuss how this disruptive mutation could result in activation:</p><p>&quot;Likewise, R712L-myosin could conceivably confer activating properties through the thin filament, or perhaps through activation of other myosins from the thick filament, although no mechanisms for those are apparent.&quot;</p><p>While it is not clear how this mutation could result in activation of the thin filament, the site of the mutation in the converter domain could conceivably disrupt the formation of the myosin interacting head motif by destabilizing the M.ADP.Pi pre-power stroke state.

However, measuring the load dependence of actin detachment is a substantial undertaking and is outside of the scope of the current work. We plan to further characterize this mutation in future studies, with load dependence being an experiment at the top of our priority list. The reviewer’s important point about possible effects of the loss of the second step on load sensitivity is now stated in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While the Vmax of the ATPase remains unchanged for the mutant the KATPase value was ~ 4-fold smaller than WT.

It is also surprising that the K<sub>ATPase</sub> values for R712L are small. However, without knowing which rate constants define the steady-state parameters, it is difficult to give a definitive prediction about the relationship of the V<sub>max,</sub>K<sub>ATPase</sub>, and K<sub>TF</sub> for the myosins +/- OM. What is surprising to the reviewer and to us, is that our results suggest the K<sub>ATPase</sub> is not defined by the K<sub>TF</sub>, which one might predict if phosphate release is rate limiting, but this is not the case. Previous work by White et al. (Biochemistry, 1997, 36:11828) has suggested that the Vmax is defined by a combination of rate and equilibrium constants, including phosphate release, the equilibrium constant for ATP hydrolysis, and the affinities of the M.ATP and M.ADP.Pi states for actin. This point is now discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) k-DAP and Vmax are of the same order for WT but k-DAP is 3 times Vmax for the mutant while KATPase and KTF are both very low.

We do not know the rate limiting step for this myosin. In the case of R712L, the phosphate release step must not be limiting since its rate is accelerated without an overall increase in the rate of ATPase cycling. Additionally, exit from the strong binding states is also not rate limiting (Table 3). Future biochemical experiments that further explore ATP cleavage (e.g., quenched flow) and the transition from the weak-to-strong binding states are required. Although such experiments will help us further understand the effects of the R712L mutation, they will not change the primary conclusions of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Following on from 4 and 5 have the authors measured the duty ratio for the mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>The duty ratio is the fraction of the ATPase cycle time (determined by V<sub>max</sub>) that myosin occupies the strong-binding states, which we determined from the actin detachment rate in the optical trapping assay (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> in Table 3). The calculated duty ratios in the absence of load are 0.095 for WT-myosin and 0.078 for R712L-myosin. We now include this information in the updated manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
