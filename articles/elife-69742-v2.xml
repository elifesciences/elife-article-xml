from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> that has been identified as a surface-exposed candidate antigen for meningococcal vaccines. However, this location for NmMetQ challenges the prevailing view that SBPs in Gram-negative bacteria are localized to the periplasmic space to promote interaction with their cognate ABC transporter embedded in the bacterial inner membrane. To elucidate the roles of NmMetQ, we characterized NmMetQ with and without its cognate ABC transporter (NmMetNI). Here, we show that NmMetQ is a lipoprotein (lipo-NmMetQ) that binds multiple methionine analogs and stimulates the ATPase activity of NmMetNI. Using single-particle electron cryo-microscopy, we determined the structures of NmMetNI in the presence and absence of lipo-NmMetQ. Based on our data, we propose that NmMetQ tethers to membranes via a lipid anchor and has dual function and localization, playing a role in NmMetNI-mediated transport at the inner membrane and moonlighting on the bacterial surface.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lipoprotein</kwd><kwd>ABC transporters</kwd><kwd>Neisseria meningitidis</kwd><kwd>methionine importers</kwd><kwd>single particle cryoem</kwd><kwd>fluorine solution nmr</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharaf</surname><given-names>Naima G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rees</surname><given-names>Douglas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NmMetQ is a lipoprotein that tethers to membranes via a lipid anchor and has dual function and localization, playing a role in NmMetNI-mediated transport at the inner membrane and moonlighting on the bacterial surface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The substrate-binding protein (SBP) NmMetQ from the human pathogen <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> has been identified as a surface-exposed candidate antigen for the meningococcal vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pizza et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequently, NmMetQ has been shown to interact with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kánová et al., 2018</xref>), potentially acting as an adhesin. However, the surface localization of NmMetQ challenges the prevailing view that SBPs reside in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thomas and Tampé, 2020</xref>), binding and delivering molecules to cognate ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters in the inner membrane (IM). Several questions arise from these studies: Has NmMetQ lost its ABC transporter-dependent function in the IM? How does NmMetQ become embedded in the outer membrane (OM) surface of the bacterium?</p><p>The ABC transporter-dependent role of SBPs has been well characterized for multiple ABC transporter systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hollenstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oldham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sabrialabed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Boer et al., 2019</xref>). These studies reveal conserved SBP-dependent characteristics, including that the SBP is largely responsible for substrate delivery to the ABC transporter, with concomitant stimulation of the transport coupled ATPase activity. Structural studies have shown that SBPs dock to the periplasmic surface of the transporter’s transmembrane domains, with the substrate-binding pocket juxtaposed with the translocation pathway of the transporter. While many SBPs have only been assigned ABC transporter-dependent functions, a few SBPs have also been shown to have both ABC transporter-dependent and ABC transporter-independent functions (often referred to as moonlighting functions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler, 1975</xref>). For example, the <italic>E. coli</italic> maltose SBP (MBP) binds and stimulates its cognate ABC transporter during the maltose import cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson et al., 1992</xref>). In addition, the MBP-maltose complex is also a ligand for the chemotaxis receptor, triggering the signaling cascade involved in nutrient acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hazelbauer, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manson et al., 1985</xref>). Other SBPs have also been assigned ABC transporter-independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Müller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castañeda-Roldán et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matthysse et al., 1996</xref>), including NspS from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, which has been shown to play a role in biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Young et al., 2021</xref>) and not transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cockerell et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, two MetQ proteins, <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> (Ng) NgMetQ and <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic> (Vv) VvMetQ have also been identified as putative adhesins, mediating bacterial adhesion to human cervical epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Semchenko et al., 2017</xref>) and to human intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2011</xref>), respectively. Evidence that these MetQ SBPs bind and stimulate their cognate ABC transporters, however, is lacking. Whether NmMetQ has lost its ATP transporter-dependent function or whether it plays roles at both the IM and OM cannot be determined through amino acid sequence alone and must be experimentally verified.</p><p>Since SBPs are not membrane proteins, the detection of NmMetQ at the cell surface of the bacterium suggests it must be tethered to the OM. In Gram-negative bacteria, the paradigm that SBPs translocate into the periplasm where they diffuse freely between the IM and OM can be traced back to early experiments by Heppel showing that the osmotic shock of Gram-negative bacteria leads to the release of SBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heppel, 1969</xref>). While many SBPs in Gram-negative bacteria have been identified as secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Willis and Furlong, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahlem et al., 1982</xref>), several studies have also identified a few lipid-modified SBPs (lipo-SBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tokuda et al., 2007</xref>). However, the presence of lipo-SBPs in Gram-negative bacteria has not been generally appreciated and the role that lipid modifications play in SBP surface localization remains unexplored.</p><p>Although ABC transporter-dependent functions of NmMetQ, VvMetQ, and NgMetQ are not well studied, the homologous SBP from <italic>E. coli</italic>, EcMetQ, is well characterized. Studies show that the <italic>E. coli</italic> methionine uptake system consists of EcMetQ and its cognate ABC transporter EcMetNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kadner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kadner, 1977</xref>). Structures of both EcMetQ and EcMetNI alone and in complex are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadaba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). EcMetNI comprises two transmembrane domains (TMD), which form a substrate translocation pathway, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD), which couple transport to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. In the absence of EcMetQ, EcMetNI adopts the inward-facing conformation, with the TMDs open to the cytoplasm and NBDs separated. The available crystal structures of EcMetQ reveal two domains connected by a linker that form the methionine-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Of note, EcMetQ has been experimentally verified to be a lipoprotein by radioactive palmitate labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tokuda et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, Carlson et al. found that wild-type EcMetQ remains associated with recombinantly expressed his-tagged EcMetNI when solubilized in detergent and peptidiscs but not when its N-terminal cysteine is mutated to prevent lipidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlson et al., 2019</xref>). This study shows that EcMetQ association with EcMetNI depends on its N-terminal lipid. Structures of EcMetQ are also available, however, the lipid modification is not present in EcMetQ structures. A structure of the EcMetQ:EcMetNI complex is also available and shows EcMetNI in the outward-facing conformation, with the TMDs and NBDs close together. In this structure, EcMetQ is docked to the periplasmic surface of the TMDs with the binding pocket open to the central cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). These structures, together with in vivo functional assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kadner, 1974</xref>), show that EcMetQ is intimately involved in EcMetNI-mediated methionine transport.</p><p>Although the interaction between EcMetQ and EcMetNI is well characterized, less is known about the corresponding system in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>. To date, there have been no biochemical or structural studies reported for NmMetNI. Recently determined structures of NmMetQ are in the ligand-free, L-methionine-, or D-methionine-bound states, and binding assays show L-methionine binds NmMetQ with greater affinity than D-methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). These studies were carried out with an NmMetQ protein that lacks the native N-terminal signal sequence, establishing that the N-terminal signal sequence is not necessary for ligand binding. However, NmMetQ is predicted to be lipoprotein based on the N-terminal protein sequence (Uniprot entry Q7DD63) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">UniProt Consortium, 2019</xref>). Experimental evidence confirming this modification, however, has not been reported. Thus, a full understanding of the post-translational modification of NmMetQ and its interactions with NmMetNI are lacking. To better understand NmMetQ and the role it plays in methionine transport, a detailed characterization of both NmMetNI and NmMetQ with its native N-terminal signal sequence is required.</p><p>In this work, we characterized NmMetQ and NmMetNI using multiple biophysical methods. Using mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that full-length NmMetQ, recombinantly-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, is a lipoprotein (lipo-NmMetQ). Functional assays showed that both lipo-NmMetQ and L-methionine are required for maximal stimulation of NmMetNI ATPase activity. NmMetNI was also stimulated to a lesser extent by pre-protein NmMetQ (a variant with an unprocessed N-terminal signal peptide) with L-methionine and by lipo-NmMetQ with select methionine analogs. We also determined the structures of NmMetNI in the presence and absence of lipo-NmMetQ to 6.4 Å and 3.3 Å resolution, respectively, using single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Using a bioinformatics approach, we also identified MetQ proteins from other Gram-negative bacteria that are predicted to be modified with lipids. This analysis suggests that the lipid modification of MetQ proteins is not restricted to <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose that lipo-NmMetQ, and more generally lipo-MetQ proteins in other Gram-negative bacteria, possesses dual function and localization: ABC transporter-dependent roles at the IM and a moonlighting ABC transporter-independent role (or roles) at the OM. Our findings highlight the complexity of the cell envelope and that much remains to be understood about the rules governing protein localization in Gram-negative bacteria and the moonlighting functions of SBPs on the surface of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>N. meningitidis</italic> MetQ is a lipoprotein</title><p>While lipoproteins and secreted proteins both must traverse the inner cell membrane during biogenesis, their maturation occurs through different mechanisms depending on the N-terminal signal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Lipoproteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm as pre-prolipoproteins, inserted into the IM, and then anchored via their N-terminal signal sequence to the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okuda and Tokuda, 2011</xref>). While tethered to the IM through the signal sequence, pre-prolipoproteins are subsequently modified by three enzymes: (1) phosphatidylglycerol transferase (Lgt), which transfers the diacylglycerol group preferentially from phosphatidylglycerol (PG) to the cysteine residue via a thioester bond of the pre-prolipoprotein, producing a prolipoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mao et al., 2016</xref>) (2) signal peptidase II (LspA), which cleaves the prolipoprotein N-terminal signal sequence to yield a diacylated lipoprotein with the N-terminal cysteine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hussain et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vogeley et al., 2016</xref>; and (3) apolipoprotein N-acyl transferase (Lnt), which N-acylates the cysteine residue preferentially using an acyl group of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to produce a triacylated lipoprotein. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Noland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wiktor et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to lipoproteins, secreted proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm as pre-proteins with an N-terminal signal sequence. These pre-proteins serve as substrates for signal peptidase I (Spase I), which cleaves the N-terminal signal sequence to yield the mature secreted protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paetzel et al., 1998</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of lipo-NmMetQ and NmMetQC20A proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Top) Schematic of lipoprotein maturation pathway.

An analysis of the peak fraction by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) revealed two major deconvoluted masses of 31,662 and 31,682 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

For peak 2, the deconvoluted mass was 30,840, which agrees with the theoretical intact mass of a secreted NmMetQ protein cleaved between Ala 19 and Ala 20 (30,839 Da) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom). The production of the secreted NmMetQ was surprising since we only expected the accumulation of the pre-protein NmMetQ. However, these data suggest that the Cys-to-Ala mutation created a noncanonical cleavage site, possibly allowing Spase I to inefficiently cleave the pre-protein to yield secreted NmMetQ. Together, these data clearly demonstrate that the major species of recombinantly-expressed NmMetQ is heterogeneously triacylated at Cys 20. Mutating Cys 20 to Ala prevents the production of lipoprotein NmMetQ, leading to the formation of pre-protein NmMetQ and secreted NmMetQ. The location of cleavage site, position of lipid attachment, and heterogeneous triacyl chain composition of NmMetQ in this study are consistent with previous studies characterizing other lipoproteins produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kwok et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>These data also reveal an interesting property of each DDM-solubilized NmMetQ variant: lipo-NmMetQ, pre-protein lipo-NmMetQ, and secreted NmMetQ proteins elute at different volumes despite their similar molecular masses (between 31 and 33 kDa). Specifically, lipo-NmMetQ and pre-protein NmMetQ proteins elute at much higher apparent mass than secreted NmMetQ on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 (GE healthcare) column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). To further investigate the properties of the NmMetQ proteins, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to measure their hydrodynamic radii (R<sub>h</sub>) and calculate their theoretical molecular weights assuming a folded globular protein. We found that the R<sub>h</sub> values and molecular weight estimates were larger for lipo-NmMetQ (R<sub>h</sub> = 7.9 ± 0.2 nm, Mw-R = 430 ± 20 kDa) and pre-protein NmMetQ (R<sub>h</sub> 7.7 ± 0.06 nm, Mw-R = 400 ± 7 kDa) than for secreted NmMetQ (R<sub>h</sub> 3.0 ± 0.013 nm, Mw-R = 43.0 ± 0.3 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These proteins were also analyzed using Size Exclusion Chromatography with Multi-Angle Light Scattering (SEC-MALS). For both lipo-NmMetQ and pre-protein NmMetQ, estimated molar masses were lower with SEC-MALS when compared to DLS, with lipo-NmMetQ measurements of 111 ± 0.3 versus 430 ± 20 kDa and pre-protein NmMetQ measurements of 105 ± 0.3 versus 400 ± 7 kDa, respectively. These data suggest that both lipo-NmMetQ and pre-protein NmMetQ aggregate and that the mass of the aggregate depends on the precise condition of the experiment. However, molar masses for the secreted NmMetQ protein were more similar (26 ± 1 versus 43.0 ± 0.3 kDa), suggesting that unlike lipo-NmMetQ and pre-protein NmMetQ, secreted NmMetQ does not associate with DDM micelles. Based on the size-exclusion chromatograms, DLS, and SEC-MALS data, we propose that both lipo-NmMetQ and pre-protein NmMetQ aggregate with DDM to form protein-DDM micelle-like complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The ATPase activity of NmMetNI is maximally stimulated in the presence of both lipo-NmMetQ and L-methionine</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that in the presence of 1 μM NmMetNI alone (black trace) and in the presence of 50 μM L-methionine (blue trace), the ATPase activity was low, demonstrating that L-methionine alone is not sufficient to stimulate NmMetNI ATPase activity. However, in the presence of both 1 μM lipo-NmMetQ and 50 μM L-methionine, a marked stimulation of ATPase activity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, green trace). To exclude the possibility that the stimulation of ATPase activity is mediated by either the lipid-moiety or the unliganded NmMetQ protein subunit, the experiment was repeated in the absence of L-methionine (NmMetNI and unliganded lipo-NmMetQ only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, magenta trace). Under these conditions the ATPase activity is low, showing that unliganded lipo-NmMetQ is not sufficient to stimulate NmMetNI activity. Given these findings, we conclude that NmMetNI ATPase activity is tightly coupled, requiring both L-methionine and lipo-NmMetQ for maximum stimulation. This result strongly suggests that lipo-NmMetQ plays a role in methionine-mediated NmMetNI ATP hydrolysis.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ATP hydrolysis of NmMetNI in the presence and absence of L-methionine and NmMetQ proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ATP hydrolysis was measured in the presence of 1 μM of DDM-solubilized NmMetNI alone (black trace), 50 μM L-methionine (blue trace), 1 μM lipo-NmMetQ (magenta trace) and both 50 μM L-methionine and 1 μM lipo-NmMetQ (green trace).

The same protocol was performed with pre-protein NmMetQ, which contains an N-terminal signal sequence but without the lipid modification. Addition of pre-protein NmMetQ also led to stimulation of ATPase activity, although to a lesser extent than observed for lipo-NmMetQ (orange trace). Addition of secreted NmMetQ, however, had little effect on the ATPase activity (cyan). Together, these data establish that the lipid moiety of lipo-NmMetQ is required for maximal NmMetNI stimulation, although the N-terminal signal sequence of pre-protein NmMetQ could partially mimic its stimulatory effect.</p><p>A comparison of NmMetNI’s ATPase activity with that of the previously characterized EcMetNI reveals that these transporters have different ligand-dependent ATPase activities. When L-methionine and SBP are absent, NmMetNI has no detectable basal ATP activity. However EcMetNI has a basal ATPase rate of 300 nmol Pi/min/mg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadaba et al., 2008</xref>). These transporters also differ in their response to L-methionine. In the presence of L-methionine, the ATPase activity of EcMetNI decreases due to the binding of L-methionine to the C2 domain, which is responsible for the regulatory phenomenon of transinhibition. For NmMetNI, however, no such effect was detected, as anticipated from the absence of the C2 autoinhibitory domain in NmMetNI.</p><p>A comparison of NmMetNI SBP-dependent ATPase stimulation to other ABC importers also reveals some similarities and differences. For NmMetNI, only liganded-SBP maximally stimulated NmMetNI ATP hydrolysis. Maximal stimulation by liganded-SBPs is also a mechanistic feature shared by the ABC importers EcMalFGK<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson et al., 1992</xref>) and EcHisQMP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ames et al., 1996</xref>). In contrast, for the ABC importer EcYecSC-FliY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sabrialabed et al., 2020</xref>), full stimulation of ATPase can be achieved in both the liganded-SBP and the unliganded-SBP. Although the origin of these differences are unclear, our data show that NmMetNI is tightly coupled and highlight the mechanistic differences between ABC importers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>N-formyl-L-methionine, L-norleucine, L-ethionine, and L-methionine sulfoximine are potential substrates for the lipo-NmMetQ:NmMetNI system</title><p>To identify potential substrates of the NmMetQ-lipoprotein MetQ system, we determined the relative binding affinities of several methionine analogs to NmMetQ. For these measurements, we used Fluorine chemical shift Anisotropy and eXchange for Screening (FAXS) in competition mode, a powerful solution NMR experiment that monitors the displacement of a fluorine-containing reporter molecule by a competing ligand. An important feature of FAXS is that fluorine modification of the competing ligand is not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dalvit et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalvit and Vulpetti, 2019</xref>). As previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerig, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalvit and Vulpetti, 2019</xref>), the fluorine nucleus has several properties that are advantageous for NMR: <sup>19</sup>F is 100% abundant, possesses a spin 1/2 nucleus, and has high gyromagnetic ratio, which results in high sensitivity (83% of <sup>1</sup>H). It also has a large chemical shift anisotropy (CSA), allowing higher responsiveness to change in molecular weight, such as those that occur during a protein-ligand binding event. Additionally, since fluorine atoms are not present in most commonly used buffer systems and virtually absent from all naturally occurring biomolecules, background interference in fluorine NMR experiments is minimal.</p><p>To optimize the FAXS experiment, we considered several factors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lipoprotein NmMetQ may multimerize, possibly through an association with the hydrophobic acyl chains, increasing its apparent molecular weight. Because FAXS is sensitive to the apparent molecular weight of the protein, we chose to use a NmMetQ construct lacking its native N-terminal signal sequence and is therefore not modified with lipids (referred to here as NLM-NmMetQ). Trifluoromethyl-methionine was selected as a reporter molecule and the fluorine signal intensity was monitored in the presence of NLM-NmMetQ and several methionine analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For these studies, we optimized the concentration of the reporter molecule, NLM-NmMetQ, and the relaxation time (T2) for the NMR measurement. A reporter molecule concentration of 2 mM was chosen here to decrease acquisition time. Additionally, 43 μM NLM-NMMetQ was chosen as a compromise between using less protein and increasing the fraction of reporter bound to the protein. The relaxation time T2 = 120 ms was chosen for its ability to strongly attenuate but not eliminate the reporter signal in the presence of 43 μM NLM-NmMetQ. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dalvit et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalvit and Vulpetti, 2019</xref>), for all experiments, two fluorine spectra (1D and Car-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) filtered) were acquired. The intensity signals of the reporter molecule measured in both spectra and the ratio -ln(CPMG/1D) were calculated. We anticipated that analogs that bind to NLM-NmMetQ would lead to the displacement of the reporter molecule, resulting in a decrease in the -ln(CPMG/1D) ratio.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Characterization of the interaction of methionine analogs with NmMetQ using FAXS and ATPase experiments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the FAXS experiment.

The plot shows the signal intensity ratio of the reporter molecule in the presence of each methionine analog. Since displacement of the reporter molecule by the analog correlates to the analog’s binding affinity, methionine analogs with higher affinity will be positioned toward the left side of the plot, while lower affinity methionine analogs will appear on the right side. As controls, we measured the -ln(CPMG/1D) ratios with the reporter molecule alone and reporter molecule plus NLM-NmMetQ. As expected, the reporter molecule alone has a low -ln(CPMG/1D) ratio, while the reporter molecule plus NLM-NmMetQ has a high -ln(CPMG/1D) ratio (less free reporter molecule due to NLM-binding).</p><p>Next, we carried out the FAXS experiments in the presence of various methionine analogs. We first added L-methionine, a known high-affinity ligand of NmMetQ (Kd 0.2 nM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). As expected for a higher affinity ligand, L-methionine completely displaced the reporter molecule. We then examined two methionine analogs with amino group substitutions: (1) N-formyl-L-methionine, which is used by bacteria to initiate translation and (2) N-acetyl-L-methionine, which is present in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>) and human brain cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, circles). Addition of these analogs led to the respective complete or near complete displacement of the reporter molecule, indicating that changes to the amino group do not dramatically affect the substrate’s ability to bind tightly to NLM-NmMetQ. D-methionine displaced less reporter than L-methionine, consistent with its lower binding affinity (3.5 μM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>), while N-acetyl-D methionine failed to displace the reporter molecule. These results suggest that modifications to both the amino group and stereochemistry lead to significantly weaker binding than the singly modified derivative.</p><p>Similar to our observations with D-methionine and N-acetyl-D methionine, changes to the carboxyl group resulted in less displacement of the reporter molecule than L-methionine. Specifically, L-methioninol, with the carboxyl group reduced to an alcohol, failed to displace the reporter molecule while L-methionine ethyl ester only partially displaced the reporter molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, circles).</p><p>Lastly, changes to the L-methionine side-chain exhibited varying effects. Methionine analogs with changes to the sulfur atom, including seleno-L-methionine, L-methionine sulfoximine, and L-norleucine were well tolerated, with a greater displacement of the reporter molecule than D-methionine, which has an estimated Kd of 3.5 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). However, L-ornithine failed to displace the reporter molecule, suggesting that binding of ligands with a charged amino group is energetically unfavorable. Side-chain length also plays a role in methionine analog affinity to NLM-NmMetQ. Increasing the side-chain length by an addition of a methylene group (L-ethionine) was better tolerated than decreasing the length by one carbon (S-methyl-L-cysteine). Shorter thiol derivatives (L-cysteine and L-homocysteine) were ineffective at displacing the reporter molecule. Together, our data establish that NLM-NmMetQ can accommodate variability in the binding of methionine analogs, including modifications to the amino group, D-stereochemistry, and changes in the side-chain (to a limited extent), while exhibiting little tolerance for variations in the carboxyl group.</p><p>To determine whether methionine analogs could serve as potential substrates for the lipo-NmMetQ:NmMetNI system, we measured NmMetNI ATPase activity in presence of lipo-NmMetQ and several methionine analogs. For these assays, we chose methionine analogs identified by FAXS to bind NLM-NmMetQ with an affinity similar or higher than D-methionine, a known substrate for <italic>E. coli</italic> NmMetNI. Since substrate-stimulated ATPase activity is a hallmark of ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bishop et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mimmack et al., 1989</xref>), we expected methionine analogs that are substrates for this system would stimulate NmMetNI ATPase activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows the results for the methionine analog stimulation of NmMetNI ATPase activity. As a negative control, we tested L-cysteine, where, as expected, no substrate-stimulated ATPase stimulation was detected. Our data show that the following methionine analogs led to substrate-stimulated ATPase activity: N-acetyl-L-methionine, N-formyl-L-methionine, L-norleucine, L-ethionine, and L-methionine sulfoximine. However, no correlation was seen between affinity to NLM-NmMetQ and NmMetNI stimulation. This data suggest that binding to NmMetQ is necessary to initiate transport; however, this step alone does not determine the magnitude of NmMetNI ATPase stimulation. Taken together, our FAXS and ATPase experiments suggest that N-formyl-L-methionine, L-norleucine, L-ethionine, and L-methionine sulfoximine are potential substrates for the <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> lipo-NmMetQ:NmMetNI system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structures of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> MetNI in the inward-facing conformation and <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> lipo-NmMetQ:NmMetNI complex in the outward-facing conformation</title><p>To gain insight into the role of lipo-NmMetQ in the NmMetNI transport cycle, we determined structures of NmMetNI in different conformational states by single-particle cryo-EM.

However, the presence of NmMetQ at the OM challenges the prevailing view that SBPs reside in the periplasm, freely diffusing between the IM and OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thomas and Tampé, 2020</xref>). To better understand whether NmMetQ has lost its ABC transporter-dependent function at the IM and how NmMetQ remains at the surface of the bacterium, we used multiple biophysical techniques to characterize the structure and function of NmMetQ and NmMetNI. Here, we show that NmMetQ is a lipoprotein that binds and stimulates the ATPase activity of NmMetNI.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose a model for NmMetQ localization that reconciles previous studies identifying NmMetQ as a surface-exposed candidate antigen and our study characterizing NmMetQ as a cognate SBP to NmMetNI. In our model, NmMetQ is a lipoprotein with dual function and localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). At the IM, lipo-NmMetQ plays a role in nutrient acquisition. Lipo-NmMetQ is then transported to the OM, possibly through the localization of the lipoprotein system (Lol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zückert, 2014</xref>), and then flipped to the surface of the cell via Slam (a protein involved in lipoprotein surface exposure in <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hooda et al., 2016</xref>). Lipo-NmMetQ then anchors to the OM cell-surface via its lipid moiety, playing a role in adhesion. The lipid modifications are central to our model, helping to explain how NmMetQ remains at the surface of the bacterium.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the cellular distribution of the <italic>N.meningitidis</italic> ABC methionine transporter proteins.</title><p>Lipo-NmMetQ tethers to membranes via a lipid anchor and has dual function and localization, playing a role in NmMetNI-mediated transport at the inner-membrane in addition to moonlighting on the bacterial surface.

We recognize that a key assumption in our study is that the <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> lipoprotein maturation machineries process the N-terminal signal sequences of lipoproteins in a similar manner. Since previous studies have successfully expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> lipoproteins with their native signal sequences from other Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hooda et al., 2016</xref>), including two lipoproteins from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fantappiè et al., 2017</xref>), we reasoned that these biochemical pathways are sufficiently similar between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> to justify this assumption.</p><p>Our ability to express and purify lipo-NmMetQ, pre-protein NmMetQ, and secreted NmMetQ allowed us to carry out in vitro studies investigating whether NmMetQ can function as an SBP for NmMetNI. Functional assays showed that both lipo-NmMetQ and L-methionine are required for maximal ATPase stimulation of NmMetNI. NmMetNI can also be stimulated, although to a lesser extent, by pre-protein NmMetQ/L-methionine, and lipo-NmMetQ with methionine analogs. Binding of lipo-NmMetQ to NmMetNI was also investigated by determining the cryo-EM structures of NmMetNI in the presence and absence of lipo-NmMetQ. Our structures show lipo-NmMetQ binds to the TMDs of NmMetNI, similar to what is observed with the well-characterized <italic>E. coli</italic> ABC methionine transporter system, EcMetQ:EcMetNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). Together, our data suggests that lipo-NmMetQ plays a role in NmMetNI-mediated nutrient acquisition.</p><p>The dual functionality of SBPs may help explain why the intracellular concentrations of SBPs are typically 20x that of their cognate ABC transporters, depending on growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). Of particular note, under many of the tested growth conditions, MetQ was the most abundant SBP in <italic>E. coli</italic>, present at up to nearly 30,000 copies per cell; for comparison MetNI was present at 1000 copies per cell. A tempting interpretation of this observation is that larger number of SBPs increases the efficiency of nutrient uptake. Given that methionine is a scarce amino acid in human nasopharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krismer et al., 2014</xref>), where <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> primarily colonizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stephens et al., 2007</xref>), and one of the most expensive amino acids to synthesize in terms of ATP requirement (as measured in <italic>E. coli</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaleta et al., 2013</xref>), having multiple copies of NmMetQ may enable <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> to more efficiently capture methionine from the nutrient-limited environment.</p><p>However, our study raises the possibility that higher SBP concentrations may also reflect SBP participation in ABC transporter-independent functions, including moonlighting functions at the surface of the cell. As a consequence, the stoichiometry of SBPs to cognate ABC transporters measured in Schmidt et al. may be misleading if SBPs are distributed between multiple locations, in addition to the periplasmic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). Our study also calls for caution in interpreting SBP gene knock-out experiments, since the deletion of SBPs genes may lead to phenotypes associated with the loss of either or both ABC transporter-dependent and -independent SBP functions.</p><p>While previous studies have shown that many SBPs of Gram-negative are soluble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heppel, 1969</xref>), our findings suggest that at least some SBPs may be modified with lipids. Since lipid modification may enable SBPs to localize to the surface in Gram-negative bacteria, we believe that future efforts should be made to experimentally determine which SBPs have lipid modifications, dual localization, and ABC transporter-independent functions. Studies aimed at determining the rules that govern protein surface-exposure will not only increase our understanding of bacterial physiology but will also help in the rational design of vaccines based on surface-exposed protein antigens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression, and purification of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> proteins</title><p>The protein encoding genes of MetQ and MetNI were obtained from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> virulent strain MC58, GeneBank accession number AE002098.

This work presents MetQ as a true dual function lipoprotein present in both the inner and outer membranes. This study will be of broad interest to microbiologists, as well as those studying infectious disease and mechanisms of membrane transport.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Characterization of the ABC methionine transporter from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> reveals that MetQ is a lipoprotein&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Trevor Moraes (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was general enthusiasm for this paper, with the reviewers finding that the stimulation of ATPase activity of NMetNI with the lipidated NMetQ is an interesting and important discovery.

At this point, we do not see any obvious (or even not so obvious) path forward to improve the resolution. We would also like to highlight a recent study by Liu et al., 2020 (see below for full reference) where three structures of a mycobacterial lipoprotein-SBP:ABC transporter complex were determined in different conditions at resolutions of 3.30, 3.44 and 3.78 Å. Despite the higher resolutions, no lipids were resolved in any of these structures. We are therefore not confident that a higher resolution structure of lipo-NmMetQ:NmMetNI will yield any more detailed information on how lipidation stimulates the ATPase activity.</p><p>Liu F, Liang J, Zhang B, Gao Y, Yang X, Hu T, Yang H, Xu W, Guddat LW, Rao Z.

The distance between these domains precludes the need for an autoinhibitory domain which prevent ATP turnover until SBP is bound?</p></disp-quote><p>Comparisons of various ABC importers (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2) demonstrates that the separation between the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) is influenced by the presence or absence of autoinhibitory domains. The connection between this observation and the basal ATPase rate is not clear, however. The autoinhibitory domain represents a regulatory mechanism that limits transport under conditions of high intracellular concentrations of methionine. It essentially functions as a two-state switch that either permits ATPase activity (low methionine conc) or prevents it (high methionine conc). Under the low methionine concentrations corresponding to our experimental conditions, the autoinhibitory domains should be in the &quot;on&quot; state, so that both EcMetNI and NmMetNI should be able to hydrolyze ATP. Experimentally, we find that NmMetNI is more tightly coupled than EcMetNI. It is tempting to attribute the higher basal activity of EcMetNI to the tethering together of the NBDs by the autoinhibitory domains, allowing them to come together more readily than the untethered NBDs in NmMetNI. While plausible, there is no conclusive experimental data to support or refute this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. For the FAXS experiment.. the methods section suggests that the reporter molecule is far in excess of the MetQ protein. If this were true, are you measuring the free F* (as the figure suggests) or the bound form? And would this be better informed with a titration of competitor?</p></disp-quote><p>An important aspect of the FAXS experiment is the requirement of a weak affinity reporter molecule. For weak affinity ligands in fast exchange on the NMR chemical shift timescale, a single resonance is observed whose population is the weighted average of the free and bound states. Therefore, the displacement of the reporter molecule by the competing methionine analog results in the increase of signal intensity due to an increase of the fraction of free reporter molecules and an accompanying decrease in the fraction of reporter molecules bound to NmMetQ. The overall signal intensity reflects the weighted average of both the free and bound populations of the reporter molecule.We agree that this experiment could be performed at different concentrations of competing ligands, but to obtain the relative binding affinities of the methionine analogs, only one condition is needed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
