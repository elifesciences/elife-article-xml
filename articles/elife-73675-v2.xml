different infectious, chronic inflammatory, metabolic and degenerative diseases. In chronic tendinopathic lesions, different non-resolving mechanisms produce a degenerative condition that impairs tissue healing and which therefore complicates their clinical management. Percutaneous needle electrolysis consists of the application of a galvanic current and is an emerging treatment for tendinopathies. In the present study, we found that galvanic current activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and induces an inflammatory response that promotes a collagen-mediated regeneration of the tendon in mice. This study establishes the molecular mechanism of percutaneous electrolysis that can be used to treat chronic lesions and describes the beneficial effects of an induced inflammasome-related response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>percutaneous needle electrolysis</kwd><kwd>tendon</kwd><kwd>tendinopathy</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>NLRP3</kwd><kwd>caspase-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2017‐88276‐R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelegrín</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2020-116709RB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelegrín</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007801</institution-id><institution>Fundación Séneca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20859/PI/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelegrín</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007801</institution-id><institution>Fundación Séneca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21081/PDC/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelegrín</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>614578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelegrín</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>899636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelegrín</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014440</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2020-113919RB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bueno</surname><given-names>Juan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cellular, genetic, and biochemical assays shows that the application of a specific type of currents in mouse tendons induces an inflammatory response that favors the regeneration of the tissue, being a treatment for chronic tendinopathy lesions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Galvanic current applied using a percutaneous needle is an emerging and minimally invasive technique that seeks to regenerate damaged tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valera-Garrido et al., 2014</xref>). The needle used to apply galvanic current is guided, using ultrasound equipment, into affected soft tissues by direct visualization and therefore is able to stimulate locally the cells in the damaged area. Percutaneous needle electrolysis consists of applying a galvanic current through an acupuncture needle and thus combining mechanical and electrical stimulation of the tissue that results in a local controlled microtrauma. This microtrauma in turn generates a local inflammatory response that makes possible and fosters the repair of the affected tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Valera-Garrido and Minaya-Muñoz, 2019</xref>). Galvanic current has been successfully used to repair chronic non-resolving lesions, such as tendinopathies developed after prolonged extreme exercise, which often establish a degenerative condition of the tissue that impairs healing and complicates clinical management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook and Purdam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Regan et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soslowsky et al., 2000</xref>). In randomized trials, anti-inflammatory therapies have shown to be ineffectual at treating these types of lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisset et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coombes et al., 2013</xref>) and application of galvanic currents by percutaneous needle alone has been found sufficient when it comes to regenerating the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bubnov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chellini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De-la-Cruz-Torres et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Margalef et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Valera-Garrido et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valera-Garrido et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Valera-Garrido et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Resolving inflammation promotes a response that recovers homeostasis by repairing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Medzhitov, 2008</xref>). However, chronic non-resolving inﬂammation can induce continuous tissue regeneration and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, which in turn leads to fibrosis of soft tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegre et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borthwick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaul et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wynn, 2008</xref>). Therefore, a balanced inflammatory response is required to recover homeostasis and successfully heal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borthwick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eming et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liston and Masters, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Medzhitov, 2008</xref>). In response to tissue damage, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain with leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is specifically activated over other inflammatory pathways and coordinates an inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>). NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex induced in myeloid cells after the detection of damage- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including elevated concentrations of extracellular ATP, changes in extracellular osmolarity or detection of insoluble particles and crystals, such as uric acid crystals or amyloid deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amores-Iniesta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Compan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heneka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martinon et al., 2006</xref>). These triggers specifically induce NLRP3 activation over other inflammasomes as they decrease intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration resulting in conformational change of NLRP3 structure and, therefore, active NLRP3 oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Munoz-Planillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tapia-Abellán et al., 2021</xref>). Active NLRP3 oligomers recruit the accessory apoptosis-speck-like protein with a caspase recruitment and activation domain (ASC) that favors the activation of the inflammatory caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). Caspase-1 proteolytically processes immature pro-inflammatory cytokines of the interleukin (IL)–1 family to produce the bioactive form of IL-1β and IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>). Caspase-1 also processes gasdermin D protein (GSDMD), and its amino-terminal fragment (GSDMD<sup>NT</sup>) oligomerizes in the plasma membrane forming pores, thus releasing IL-1β and IL-18 cytokines, as well as other intracellular content, including inflammasome oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baroja-Mazo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Prolonged NLRP3 activation occurs in different chronic inflammatory, metabolic and degenerative diseases such as gout, type 2 diabetes or Alzheimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daniels et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heneka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masters et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martinon et al., 2006</xref>), therefore selective small molecules that block NLRP3 are emerging as novel anti-inflammatory therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cocco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tapia-Abellán et al., 2019</xref>). However, in some pathological circumstances, a boost, rather than an inhibition, of NLRP3 would be more beneficial for reducing clinical complications, such as in immunosuppressed septic patients, who have high mortality rates due to secondary infections associated with a profound deactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-García et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The detailed molecular mechanism behind percutaneous needle electrolysis inducing an inflammatory response has not been yet described, so we studied if NLRP3 inflammasome could be activated via galvanic currents and if doing so would lead to tissue regeneration. We found that applying galvanic current via percutaneous needle electrolysis activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and induced the release of IL-1β and IL-18 from macrophages. Mice deficient in NLRP3 failed to increase IL-1β in tendons after percutaneous needle electrolysis and ended up with reduced TGF-β and type I collagen deposition with high dispersion of collagen fibers, which in turn resulted in tendons with decreased resistance. All this indicates that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the regenerative response of the tendon after application of therapeutically percutaneous needle electrolysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Galvanic current enhances macrophage pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype</title><p>We initially designed and produced a device to apply galvanic current to adherent cultured cells in six-well cell-culture plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), this device allowed us to explore the effect of galvanic currents in mouse macrophages derived from bone marrow. Applying 12 mA of galvanic current twice for 6 s each time to LPS stimulated macrophages increase the expression of <italic>Cox2</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, it did not affect LPS-induced <italic>Il1b</italic> or <italic>Tnfa</italic> pro-inflammatory gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, meanwhile <italic>Tnfa</italic> expression was upregulated with galvanic current alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), galvanic currents did not induce the expression of <italic>Cox2</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic> or <italic>Il1b</italic> genes on non-LPS-treated macrophages, or over IL-4-treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When macrophages were polarized to M2 by IL-4, galvanic currents decreased the expression of the M2 markers <italic>Arg1</italic>, <italic>Fizz1,</italic> and <italic>Mrc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); however, this decrease was small and non-significant for the M2 marker <italic>Ym1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These data suggest that galvanic current could enhance the pro-inflammatory signature of M1 macrophages whilst decreasing M2 polarization. We next studied the concentration of released pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages, and found that galvanic current did not increase the concentration of IL-6 or TNF-α released after LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but that it did significantly augment the release of IL-1β in an intensity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data indicate that the increase in <italic>Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnfa</italic> gene expression detected at mRNA level does not transcribe to higher release of IL-6 and TNF-α over LPS treatment, but that galvanic current could potentially activate an inflammasome that induces the release of IL-1β.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Galvanic current increases the M1 phenotype of macrophages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantitative PCR for M1 genes <italic>Cox2</italic>, <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic> and <italic>Tnfa</italic> expression from mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated for 2 h with LPS (1 μg/ml) or 4 h with IL-4 (20 ng/µl) as indicated and then 2 impacts of 12 mA of galvanic current for 6 s.

We found that <italic>Casp1/11</italic><sup>-/-</sup> macrophages fail to release IL-1β induced by galvanic current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then found that applying galvanic current to <italic>Pycard</italic><sup>-/-</sup> macrophages also failed to induce the release of IL-1β, which indicated that the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC is also needed to activate the inflammasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Since applying current could be considered a sterile danger signal, we next assessed the role of NLRP3 as an inflammasome sensor important for eliciting an immune response in sterile dangerous situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liston and Masters, 2017</xref>). <italic>Nlrp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and the use of the specific NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tapia-Abellán et al., 2019</xref>) impaired the release of IL-1β induced by galvanic current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), demonstrating that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated when galvanic current is applied. Similarly, galvanic current was also able to induce the release of IL-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), another cytokine dependent on the activation of the inflammasome. The use of MCC950 or macrophages deficient in NLRP3 failed to release IL-18 after galvanic current was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which confirms that galvanic current stimulates NLRP3 to induce the release of both IL-1β and IL-18. Similar results were obtained with controls using the specific NLRP3 activator nigericin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Mechanistically, the use of an extracellular buffer with 40 mM of KCl decreased IL-1β release induced by nigericin and galvanic current application, but not the release of IL-1β induced by <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> toxin B, which activates the Pyrin inflammasome, which is a K<sup>+</sup>-efflux independent inflammasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, two pulses of 12 mA of galvanic current for 6 s failed to decrease intracellular K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but increasing the number of pulses of galvanic current to eight did result in a significant decrease of intracellular K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data suggest that galvanic current slightly decreases intracellular K<sup>+</sup> when compared to the application of the K<sup>+</sup> ionophore nigericin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and this explains the smaller concentration of IL-1β that is released by galvanic current compared to nigericin application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). After applying galvanic current we were able to detect the generation of the active p20 caspase-1 fragment, and processed IL-1β and GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). MCC950 was able to abrogate caspase-1 activation and the processed forms of IL-1β and GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which suggests functional activation of caspase-1 and downstream signaling because of the activation of canonical NLRP3 and rules out the non-canonical NLRP3 activation that would result in GSDMD processing in the presence of MCC950. To ensure that the galvanic current was activating NLRP3, we used HEK293T cells that were stably expressing NLRP3-YFP protein, a method widely used to assess NLRP3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Compan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tapia-Abellán et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tapia-Abellán et al., 2019</xref>).

Two impacts of galvanic currents of different intensities (3, 6, 12 mA) for a period of 6 s (conditions that induce IL-1β release as we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) only induced a slight increase in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This increase in cell death was not associated with the activation of the inflammasome given that it was also present in macrophages deficient in NLRP3, ASC or caspase-1/11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which in turn suggests that it occurred independently of inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. Increasing the number or the length of time of 12 mA impacts of galvanic current on macrophages, resulted in a time-dependent increase in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which correlates with higher concentrations of IL-1β and IL-18 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, whereas IL-1β and IL-18 release was blocked by MCC950 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), LDH release was not dependent on NLRP3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This further corroborates the fact that the NLRP3 activation is dependent on the intensity and time of galvanic current application. Similarly, two impacts of 12 mA for a period of 6 s were unable to induce plasma membrane permeabilization measured in terms of Yo-Pro-1 uptake during a period of 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Yo-Pro uptake increased over 3 h in an intensity dependent manner (3, 6, 12 mA) when eight impacts were applied for 6 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This increase in plasma membrane permeabilization was not reversed after NLRP3 was blocked with MCC950 or when ASC-deficient macrophages were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). All these results demonstrate that doses of 3 or 6 mA of galvanic current for impacts of 6 s do not compromise cell viability but are still able to induce an inflammatory response dependent on NLRP3 activation, in contrast to current intensities of 12 mA which, if prolonged cause significant cell death independently of the inflammasome.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Galvanic current does not induce inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Extracellular amount of LDH determining cell membrane damage from mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated for 2 h with LPS (1 μg/ml) and then two or 8 impacts of different intensities of galvanic current (3, 6, 12 mA) for 6 or 12 s were applied as indicated.

In order to determine if the inflammatory response mediated by the NLRP3 inflammasome after galvanic current application is important for tissue regeneration, we measured <italic>Tgfb1</italic> expression as a key factor in inducing collagen production. We found that in vivo the expression of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> 3 days after the application of galvanic current in the calcaneal tendon of mice was dependent on NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Likewise, after 7 days of percutaneous electrolysis the levels of type III collagen were decreased, with a parallel increase in type I collagen when compared to needling alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, percutaneous electrolysis did not affect collagen fiber properties (width or length) when compared to needling alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). The increase in type I collagen 7 days after galvanic current application was reduced in <italic>Nlrp3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

All these results suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome controls the response of galvanic current thus inducing type I collagen production and arranging the collagen fibers. This controlled deposition of collagen fibers induced by galvanic current increased tendon stiffness and decreased the maximum tension supported by the tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). NLRP3 inflammasome was responsible for increased tendon stiffness after galvanic current application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

This is in agreement with the fact that the NLRP3 inflammasome is a key pathway for controlling inflammation in the absence of pathogenic microorganisms (in sterile conditions) by executing a pro-inflammatory type of cell death called pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liston and Masters, 2017</xref>). Here, we found that galvanic current application, a technique that has been widely used to resolve chronic lesions in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valera-Garrido et al., 2014</xref>), was able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and induce IL-1β and IL-18 release, but with very little associated pyroptotic cell death. This could be due to two potentially different mechanisms: (<italic>i</italic>) that after galvanic current application an alternative means of processing GSDMD occurs which is independent of NLRP3 and which could inactivate its N-terminal lytic domain, as has been previously found for caspase-3 processing GSDMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taabazuing et al., 2017</xref>); and/or (<italic>ii</italic>) that the small amounts of GSDMD<sup>NT</sup> found could create a small number of pores in the plasma membrane, thus facilitating their repair by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport machinery, which in turn leads to an hyperactive state of the macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evavold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rühl et al., 2018</xref>). During this state of the macrophage, IL-1β is released in the absence of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evavold et al., 2018</xref>). However, an increase in the intensity and the time of galvanic current application leads to an increase in cell death that was independent of the inflammasome and could be related to the technique per se. Therefore, clinical application of current intensities above 6 mA would probably lead to necrosis of the tissue and not to an efficient reparative process. Galvanic currents of 3 and 6 mA for 2 impacts of 6 s are both able to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro and lead to phenotypic changes in the tendon in vivo. This is in line with the fact that 3 mA of galvanic current is able to induce a clinically significant regeneration of lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Vidal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Margalef, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Medina-Mirapeix et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valera-Garrido et al., 2014</xref>). High-intensity doses for long periods of time or repeated impacts could induce massive tissue necrosis and are therefore not recommended for clinical practice.</p><p>The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induced by galvanic currents was found to be dependent on K<sup>+</sup> efflux, because extracellular high concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> were able to block IL-1β release, and high intensities of galvanic current decreased intracellular K<sup>+</sup>. This is similar to the effect of the well-studied K<sup>+</sup> ionophore nigericin, which dramatically decreases intracellular K<sup>+</sup> and releases IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Munoz-Planillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pétrilli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Próchnicki et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, the amount of IL-1β released from galvanic current activated macrophages was lower than when macrophages were activated with nigericin, which suggests that the NLRP3 activation is correlated with the decrease in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tapia-Abellán et al., 2021</xref>). The low NLRP3 activation induced by galvanic current application could result in a moderate inflammatory response in vivo that is beneficial for tissue regeneration. In fact, NLRP3 was important for inducing an inflammatory response in vivo with increased quantities of different cytokines including <italic>Il1b</italic> or <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, that conditioned the structure and functions of the treated tendons. However, NLRP3 deficiency does not affect <italic>Il6</italic> production or the infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells when galvanic currents are applied in vivo. This shows that NLRP3 induced by galvanic current is able to control a specific inflammatory program in vivo, but it probably do not affect the IL-6-mediated infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells in tendons.</p><p>Exacerbated NLRP3 activation could led to fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegre et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaul et al., 2021</xref>), which suggests that NLRP3 could control collagen deposition. The mild activation of NLRP3 found after galvanic current application was associated with increased production of <italic>Tgfb1</italic>, increased in collagen type I vs type III in tendons, and reduced structural dispersion of collagen fibers. This is associated with an increase in tendon stiffness, which is related to the resistance of the tendon to changes in length. Tendon stiffness is reduced during ageing and results in weaker tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krupenevich et al., 2021</xref>). This could explain previous clinical findings related to galvanic current therapy, such as the fact that almost all patients treated with galvanic current in tendon lesions had no relapses at long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valera-Garrido et al., 2014</xref>) and the fact that application of galvanic current in human tendon lesions in combination with exercise therapy achieved greater functional recovery compared to exercise alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moreno et al., 2017</xref>), and also compared to the combination of exercise with other rehabilitation interventions such as electrotherapy or mechanical intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodríguez-Huguet et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, our findings could help professionals to choose and combine rehabilitative and orthopedic treatments. However, a limitation of our study is that using animals restricts us to employing the ultrasound-guided puncture when applying galvanic current to the calcaneal tendon of mice, because it is the largest accessible tendon, whereas in humans galvanic current has been applied supraspinatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodríguez-Huguet et al., 2020</xref>), patellar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abat et al., 2016</xref>) and lateral epicondyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valera-Garrido et al., 2014</xref>) tendons. In all tendons, applying galvanic current was found to have a similar clinical benefit, but we cannot rule out the fact that the calcaneal tendon of mice would present a different response to galvanic current. In fact, different species have been reported to have different inflammatory tenocyte responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oreff et al., 2021</xref>), and although mice and humans present high overall similarities in their tenocyte responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oreff et al., 2021</xref>), it is necessary to apply galvanic current in the presence of specific NLRP3 blockers, such as MCC950, in additional animal models with species other than mice.</p><p>Therefore, this study reports how galvanic current is a feasible technique applied in vivo to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and induce a local inflammatory response to enhance a collagen-mediated regeneration process in the tendon, establishing the molecular mechanism of percutaneous electrolysis for the treatment of chronic lesions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, male)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NLRP3-deficient mice (<italic>Nlrp3<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) -

The number of polymorphonuclear cells was quantified by counting three different fields for each sample, and these cells were identified by their nuclear morphology. The number and area of tenocytes nuclei was evaluated using the FIJI macro based on a manual threshold to select nuclei and evaluating the different parameters measured with the ‘Analyze particles’ tool. Sirius red staining was performed in the slides using the Picro Sirius red stain kit (Abcam) following the manufacturer’s instructions and polarized light pictures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>) were used to quantify the type of collagen by converting pictures to SHG color and then using either a script based on the number of pixels of each color and calculating the percentage of type I or III collagen or the CT-Fire algorithm to calculate width, length, straightness and angle of collagen fibers in these pictures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).

The tendon sheaths were also maintained in order to preserve the natural anatomical structure and relative orientation of the individual tendon bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Gastrocnemius/soleus muscle fibers were then cautiously removed to expose the intramuscular tendon fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). All mechanical tests were performed with an Autograph AG-X plus 50 N-5KN machine (Shimadzu) with a speed of 0.1 mm/s and 1 kN load head. Specimens were clamped for testing with the calcaneus mounted to approximate a neutral anatomical position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Tendon area was calculated measuring tendon width in two segments, frontal and lateral. Tendon area and length were then used to calculate stiffness of tendons.

Unstained collagen molecules are able to generate second harmonic signal due to their natural structure with lack of a center of inversion symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fine and Hansen, 1971</xref>). The imaging instrument used combines a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser source and an inverted microscope. The laser system emits light pulses of 800 nm of wavelength at a repetition rate of 76 MHz. An XY scanning unit and a Z-motor attached to the microscope objective allow the sample to be scanned across the plane and depth location of interest. The second harmonic generation signal from the sample propagates back through the same objective used for excitation (dry long-working distance, 20 x, 0.8 N.A.), is isolated by a short-wave pass filter (400 ± 5 nm), and finally detected by a photon counting photomultiplier module. A home-made LabView software controlled the entire system. The average power at the sample’s plane was always below 100 mW. Second harmonic generation images were acquired at 2 Hz. To analyze the structural organization of the collagen fibers in the tendon, an algorithm based on the Hough transform was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bueno et al., 2020</xref>). The Hough transform is a mathematical procedure able to detect aligned segments of collagen fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>) within an image, and provide quantitative information on the degree of organization of the spatially resolved structures. On the basis of a pixel-by-pixel calculation, when a straight line is found, the corresponding polar coordinates are filed in the so-called 2D accumulator matrix. For each new detected straight line, the accumulator increases one unit. The local peaks (i.e. maximum values) in this accumulator space determine the preferential orientations found across the image. The standard deviation of these orientations is defined as the structural dispersion. A previously developed Matlab script was used for image processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bueno et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (Graph-Pad Software, Inc).

These findings could be better described in text and in the figure, as &quot;LDH release&quot; could be better communicated as &quot;cell membrane damage&quot; and Yo-Pro-1 could be described as &quot;cell viability&quot; for clarity to a more general audience.</p><p>Using in vitro knockout experiments, this study showed that galvanic current activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and this inflammatory response could be abbrogated by increased extracellular KCl. in vivo, galvanic current application also led to an increased expression of inflammatory markers and accumulation of inflammatory cells at acute post-puncture time points, which was enhanced by knockdown of NLRP3. However, the inflammasome response transcriptionally was diminished (using qRTPCR) by knockdown of NLRP3. These findings are a bit confusing and challenging to interpret.</p><p>The inclusion of functional and structural assessments (e.g., biomechanical testing, collagen alignment, collagen damage) associated with tendon strength and recovery would be valuable post-treatment to better understand how percutaneous electrolysis influences the tendon structure. This would strengthen the in vivo findings, which are primarily based on zoomed-in histological outcomes and biochemical assays of collagen.</p><p>Figure 7 includes patient data from a single patient, over time, as well as quantitative PCR data from NLRP3 ko mice. This figure is a bit confusing and difficult to understand on its own, considering it includes data from both clinical and animal studies without clear annotations in the figure to describe what is what. Additionally, the clinical data from a single patient is somewhat limited, and generally these data would be better supported and more rigorous if additional patients were included.</p><p>Lastly, the patient data are from the elbow, whereas the mouse data are from the calcaneal tendon, and there may be anatomical and biomechanical differences in how these tendons response to galvanic current. Explanations in the discussion could help here.</p><p>In general, this paper could use a more clearly articulated introduction describing (1) what is galvanic current therapy, and when and why is it used? (2) is there a known or unknown role of inflammation in improving or abbrogating tendon dysfunction, pain, and health? and (3) what about the NLRP3 inflammasome is unique or different from other mechanisms (and why would galvanic current treatment uniquely target this particular inflammasome)? Structuring the introduction to sequentially tell the story in this way will help to establish the premise of this work better.</p><p>Some of the data included in supplemental could be in the main text figures, and vice versa, considering each figure has a specific &quot;take home&quot; message that is being delivered that adds to the story. Some of the data and labeling in the figures (e.g. Figure 3) need to be revised as not all panels are clearly communicating their content (Figure 3F doesnt have a legend; and the bar chart beneath Figure 3F doesn’t have x-axis labels). Zoomed-in histology in Figure 4 may be misleading and a larger field of view to visualize tendon structure would be informative. Dot plots for Figure 4B/D would be helpful and in line with how all other figures in this manuscript are plotted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Peñín-Franch et al. report that galvanic current induces NLRP3 inflammasome-driven low-grade inflammatory response, which promotes collagen-mediated regeneration of the tendon. The data are clearly presented, and the narrative is in general comprehensible. However, the story is convoluted as in vitro data do not fully match in vivo findings, the mechanism of action of galvanic current through K<sup>+</sup> efflux is not convincing, the rationale on the focus of the experiments on bone marrow-derived macrophages instead tendon-resident macrophages is not provided, the omission of neutrophils for mechanistic insight, and the other inflammasomes are not explored. These concerns are outlined below.</p><p>Figure 1A: Concerns that cells in these experimental conditions are not very responsible to LPS as the induction of Cox2 expression by a high dose of the endotoxin (1 µg/ml) is modest.</p><p>Figure 1B: Need to show the expression of genes whose expression is not reduced by galvanic application to rule nonspecific effects.</p><p>Figure 1C: Why is IL-18 secretion not analyzed?</p><p>Figure 2A: Cells lacking the other inflammasomes such as AIM2, NLRP1, and NLRC4, some of which may not require ASC need to be studied.</p><p>The authors found that galvanic current failed to decrease intracellular K<sup>+</sup> levels; yet, they still argued that galvanic current affect K<sup>+</sup> efflux to some extent. This is confusing.</p><p>Figure 2A-D: LPS needs to be added to all graphs. The legends in B-D does not specify if cells were treated with LPS or not.</p><p>Figure 3A and B: Since galvanic current does not induced pyroptosis through NLRP3, the authors need absolutely to show the effect of the current on production of IL-18, another effector of the pathway.</p><p>The statement “Two impacts of galvanic currents of different intensities (3, 6, 12 mA) for a period of 6 seconds (conditions that induce IL-1b release) were only inducing a significant, but slightly increase of cell death (Figure 3A) (lines 157-162) is awkward.</p><p>The statement &quot;This increase in cell death was not associated with the activation of the inflammasome, since it was also present in macrophages deficient on NLRP3, ASC or caspase-1/11 (Figure 3B), suggesting that was independently of pyroptosis” is another reason to check the other inflammasomes.</p><p>Figure 4A showing that galvanic current increases the number of PMNs provides a strong argument for studying the effects of this treatment on cytokine and LDH release by these cells.</p><p>Figure 5: What is the relevance of these results since galvanic current increases the expression of some of these genes in vitro macrophages without affecting their protein levels (Figure 1)?</p><p>A great deal of the discussion revolves around the background of the inflammasomes (lines 249- 263) instead of discussing the results.</p><p>The discussion around the unexpected increased in PMN number in Nlrp3-deficient mice is not well articulated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73675.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The in vitro studies were major strengths of this manuscript, such as the rigorous evaluation of cell membrane damage (using LDH release) and cell death (using Yo-Pro-1).

Our results show that in vitro there are strong evidences to conclude that galvanic current activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, but in vivo seems that NLRP3 deficiency affects some inflammatory parameters (expression of Il1b, il1rn and Cxcl10), as opposed of the potentiation of other responses (infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells). At structural and functional level, the lack of NLRP3 has an effect on the tendons treated with galvanic currents, so we assume that the inflammatory programme controlled by NLRP3 has a role in the effects of galvanic currents applicated in vivo.</p><p>The fact of a response to galvanic currents dependent on NLRP3 and a response independent to NLRP3 in vivo was depicted in the diagram of Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Our data support the notion that in the tendons, NLRP3 do not affect PMN infiltration, but overall control IL-1-drived inflammatory response. We have rephrased discussion to clarify and ease with data interpretation, see page 14, lines 331-334:</p><p>“NLRP3 was important to induce an inflammatory response in vivo with elevation of different cytokines including Il1b or Cxcl10, that conditioned the structure and functions of the treated tendons. […] This highlight that NLRP3 induced by galvanic current is able to control a specific inflammatory programme in vivo, but it probably do not affect the IL-6-infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells in tendons”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The inclusion of functional and structural assessments (e.g., biomechanical testing, collagen alignment, collagen damage) associated with tendon strength and recovery would be valuable post-treatment to better understand how percutaneous electrolysis influences the tendon structure. This would strengthen the in vivo findings, which are primarily based on zoomed-in histological outcomes and biochemical assays of collagen.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now performed new experiments of tendon function and structure. By one hand we measured biomechanical properties of the tendons by using an universal testing machine for tensile tests, and by other we measured the structural organization of the collagen fibers in the tendons by employing state-of-the-art second harmonic generation microscopy.</p><p>We found that galvanic current increase stiffness of the tendon via NLRP3-inflammasome, but did not significantly affected maximum force of the tendon (new data on Figure 7E). The increase of the stiffness of the tendon is related with an increase in the resistance (i.e. PMID: 34483334 and 34510279), which is reduced for example during ageing and resulting in weaker tendons (i.e. PMID: 34274923).</p><p>This was further supported by studying the alignment of collagen fibers by second harmonic generation microscopy and applicating an algorithm based on the Hough transform, where structural dispersion of collagen fibers was higher in Nlrp3<sup>-/-</sup> tendons after galvanic current application compared to tendons from wild type mice (new data on Figure 7D and Figure 7— figure supplement 1E).</p><p>We have included these data in results, discussion and methods, showing that galvanic current application lead to a regeneration of the tendon via NLRP3 implication by increasing type I collagen, the arrangement of the collagen fibers and increasing the resistance of the tendon to change in length. These results clearly strength the conclusions of the study over our previous histological data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 includes patient data from a single patient, over time, as well as quantitative PCR data from NLRP3 ko mice.

Studies including additional patients have been already published (i.e. PMID: 25122629, 27854082, 32545583) and referenced in the text.

Now, figure 7 only show mouse-related data with the increase panels showing functional and structural assessments of the tendons as explained in the previous point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the patient data are from the elbow, whereas the mouse data are from the calcaneal tendon, and there may be anatomical and biomechanical differences in how these tendons response to galvanic current. Explanations in the discussion could help here.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we have discussed this issue in the revised manuscript. We cannot exclude differences among calcaneal and epicondyle tendons responding to galvanic current application, the calcaneal tendon in the mice was the only one big enough to apply the technique with a ultrasound-guided needling, and therefore we had a procedure limitation. However, clinical application of galvanic current has been successfully applicated in different body tendons, including supraspinatus tendinopathy (PMID: 32545583), patellar tendinopathy (PMID: 27854082) and lateral epicondylitis (PMID: 25122629). In all cases, a similar clinical benefit to galvanic current was found. This is now discussed in the revised manuscript in page 15, lines 353-356:</p><p>“A limitation of our study is that the animal model used restrict us to employ the ultrasound guided puncture to applicate galvanic current to the calcaneal tendon of mice, as is the larger accessible tendon, whereas therapeutically application of galvanic current in humans have been applicated in supraspinatus (Rodríguez-Huguet et al., 2020), patellar (Abat et al., 2016) and lateral epicondyle (Valera-Garrido et al., 2014) tendons. […] In fact, there have been described species differences in the inflammatory response of tenocytes (Oreff et al., 2021), although mice was presented a high overall similarities of tenocyte response when compared to human tenocytes, additional animal models applicating galvanic current in the presence of specific NLRP3 blockers, as MCC950, would be required”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, this paper could use a more clearly articulated introduction describing (1) what is galvanic current therapy, and when and why is it used? (2) is there a known or unknown role of inflammation in improving or abrogating tendon dysfunction, pain, and health? and (3) what about the NLRP3 inflammasome is unique or different from other mechanisms (and why would galvanic current treatment uniquely target this particular inflammasome)? Structuring the introduction to sequentially tell the story in this way will help to establish the premise of this work better.</p></disp-quote><p>We have structured the introduction as suggested by the reviewer, which we believe has improved the clarity of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the data included in supplemental could be in the main text figures, and vice versa, considering each figure has a specific &quot;take home&quot; message that is being delivered that adds to the story. Some of the data and labeling in the figures (e.g. Figure 3) need to be revised as not all panels are clearly communicating their content (Figure 3F doesnt have a legend; and the bar chart beneath Figure 3F doesnt have x-axis labels). Zoomed-in histology in Figure 4 may be misleading and a larger field of view to visualize tendon structure would be informative. Dot plots for FIgure 4B/D would be helpful and in line with how all other figures in this manuscript are plotted.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have fixed Figure 3F panel (the legend was on the right size of the graph) and we have added a larger view of the tendon in new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C. According to the reviewer, we also have moved Figure 7A to supplemental materials (now as Figure 7—figure supplement 1A) and part of the Figure 2—figure supplement 1B to main figures (now Figure 2E), as now we have included more galvanic current conditions. If the reviewer thinks additional panels could be swapped between main and supplementary figures, we will be happy to evaluate these further changes. Regarding dot-plot representation for Figure 4B and D, since it is a kinetic of different treatments that overlap in the time points assessed, if we do dot-plot representation, the graph is not clear as the dots of the different treatments overlap each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) .</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73675-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Therefore, we have opted to show this dot raw data plot representation in Figure 4 – source data file 2, but separating the different treatments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Peñín-Franch et al. report that galvanic current induces NLRP3 inflammasome-driven low-grade inflammatory response, which promotes collagen-mediated regeneration of the tendon. The data are clearly presented, and the narrative is in general comprehensible. However, the story is convoluted as in vitro data do not fully match in vivo findings, the mechanism of action of galvanic current through K<sup>+</sup> efflux is not convincing, the rationale on the focus of the experiments on bone marrow-derived macrophages instead tendon-resident macrophages is not provided, the omission of neutrophils for mechanistic insight, and the other inflammasomes are not explored. These concerns are outlined below.</p><p>Figure 1A: Concerns that cells in these experimental conditions are not very responsible to LPS as the induction of Cox2 expression by a high dose of the endotoxin (1 µg/ml) is modest.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to highlight that stimulation time with LPS in our study was 2h, and usually longer times (up to 24h) are normally used and that could explain why Cox2 expression is “modest”. In any case, the data shown in Figure 1A is presented as relative expression values (2<sup>-DCt</sup>) to be able to compare relative expression to galvanic current application. If we calculate fold increase (2<sup>-DDCt</sup>) of Cox2 gene we found an average of 107 with values from individual experiments ranging from 30 to 322 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73675-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Other similar studies reporting Cox2 expression levels on mouse macrophages report higher Cox2 induction (400 fold increase) but as stated used longer times of LPS (2h our study vs 24h) (PMID 26639663). However, other studies using 4h LPS stimulation but with a lower LPS dose (1µg/ml our study vs 100 ng/ml) reported a similar fold increase with an average of ∼150 (PMID: 25116357, 28962083). Therefore, this show that the macrophage used in our study were robustly responding to LPS similarly than in other studies. In any case, this is not the central point of the study and will not affect the overall conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1B: Need to show the expression of genes whose expression is not reduced by galvanic application to rule nonspecific effects.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we do now present the expression of the M2 marker Ym1 in Figure 1B that is not reduced by galvanic current application. However, please also note that in Figure 1A we show that the expression of Tnfa and Il1b do not change by galvanic current application.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C: Why is IL-18 secretion not analyzed?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1C we aimed to validate gene expression of cytokines measured by qPCR in panel 1A, and this was the reason why we did not show IL-18. We now show IL-18 release as a inflammasome-related cytokine in the new Figure 2C and found that as expected IL-18 was also being released by galvanic current in a NLRP3 dependent manner, since NLRP3 KO macrophages (new Figure 2C) and the use of MCC950 (new Figure 3C) also blocked IL-18 release.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A: Cells lacking the other inflammasomes such as AIM2, NLRP1, and NLRC4, some of which may not require ASC need to be studied.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer comment, however our data using both NLRP3 KO macrophages and the specific NLRP3 blocker MCC950 clearly show that NLRP3 is the inflammasome activated by galvanic current. If other inflammasome sensor would be also activated after galvanic current application, NLRP3-KO macrophages or MCC950-treated macrophages would still releasing IL-1b and IL-18. Therefore, we strongly believe that the study of macrophages lacking other inflammasome sensors would not give further insights into this study and are not needed to be studied.</p><p>In any case, and taking reviewer suggestion, we now have increased the insights that NLRP3 is the activated inflammasome after galvanic current application by using a recombinant system where NLRP3-YFP is expressed in HEK293. This system has been widely used to assess NLRP3 activation by us (i.e. PMID 22981536, 31086329, 34524838) and other groups (i.e. PMID 30487600). Galvanic current was able to increase the percentage of cells with an intracellular NLRP3 forming a punctum, and this was reverted by the use of the specific blocker MCC950. See data in new Figure 2G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors found that galvanic current failed to decrease intracellular K<sup>+</sup> levels; yet, they still argued that galvanic current affect K<sup>+</sup> efflux to some extent. This is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now measured intracellular K<sup>+</sup> in macrophages receiving increasing doses of galvanic current (where a robust IL-1b release was found), and now we were able to find K<sup>+</sup> efflux from the macrophages (see new Figure 2E), correlating with the ability of high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> to block IL-1b release after galvanic current application.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A-D: LPS needs to be added to all graphs. The legends in B-D does not specify if cells were treated with LPS or not.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we added LPS treatment to the graph legends in figure 2. This was also extended to figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3A and B: Since galvanic current does not induced pyroptosis through NLRP3, the authors need absolutely to show the effect of the current on production of IL-18, another effector of the pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show IL-18 release, that similarly to IL-1b, was induced by galvanic current and blocked by MCC950 (see new Figure 3C). The fact that galvanic current induces cell death independently of NLRP3 and also caspase-1 and caspase-11 (previous Figure 3B,C, now Figure 3B,D) suggest that this cell death is not pyroptosis and probably is a direct consequence of applicating the current to the cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statement &quot;Two impacts of galvanic currents of different intensities (3, 6, 12 mA) for a period of 6 seconds (conditions that induce IL-1b release) were only inducing a significant, but slightly increase of cell death (Figure 3A) (lines 157-162) is awkward.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize, as we did not explain correctly. We have revised the phrase (page 8, lines 183-186):</p><p>“Two impacts of galvanic currents of different intensities (3, 6, 12 mA) for a period of 6 seconds (conditions that induce IL-1b release as we show in Figure 1C) were only inducing a slightly increase of cell death (Figure 3A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statement &quot;This increase in cell death was not associated with the activation of the inflammasome, since it was also present in macrophages deficient on NLRP3, ASC or caspase-1/11 (Figure 3B), suggesting that was independently of pyroptosis&quot; is another reason to check the other inflammasomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Other inflammasomes will also signal through caspase-1 or caspase-11 (if there is an activation of the non-canonical inflammasome). The fact that macrophages doble knockout in caspase-1 and caspase-11 do not impair cell death induced by galvanic current strongly suggest that no other inflammasome is activated. For example, if NLRC4 would be activated, the casp1/11 KO macrophages would give a phenotype where LDH release was blocked. Therefore, we have strong results concluding that the application of galvanic current could kill the cell independently of caspase-1/11, and therefore independent of any inflammasome (Figure 3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4A showing that galvanic current increases the number of PMNs provides a strong argument for studying the effects of this treatment on cytokine and LDH release by these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We found reviewer comment very pertinent and following his/her advise we have now assessed IL-1b release and LDH on bone marrow isolated neutrophils upon galvanic current application.
