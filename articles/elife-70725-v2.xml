One of the main challenges in studying EVs is a lack of methods to quantify EVs that are sensitive enough and can differentiate EVs from similarly sized lipoproteins and protein aggregates. We demonstrate the use of ultrasensitive, single-molecule array (Simoa) assays for the quantification of EVs using three widely expressed transmembrane proteins: the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81. Using Simoa to measure these three EV markers, as well as albumin to measure protein contamination, we were able to compare the relative efficiency and purity of several commonly used EV isolation methods in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): ultracentrifugation, precipitation, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We further used these assays, all on one platform, to improve SEC isolation from plasma and CSF. Our results highlight the utility of quantifying EV proteins using Simoa and provide a rapid framework for comparing and improving EV isolation methods from biofluids.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>exosomes</kwd><kwd>diagnostics</kwd><kwd>biomarkers</kwd><kwd>size exclusion chromatography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NDCN Collaborative Science Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ter-Ovanesyan</surname><given-names>Dmitry</given-names></name><name><surname>Norman</surname><given-names>Maia</given-names></name><name><surname>Lazarovits</surname><given-names>Roey</given-names></name><name><surname>Trieu</surname><given-names>Wendy</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Ju-Hyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Church</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name><name><surname>Walt</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014895</institution-id><institution>Open Philanthropy Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ter-Ovanesyan</surname><given-names>Dmitry</given-names></name><name><surname>Norman</surname><given-names>Maia</given-names></name><name><surname>Lazarovits</surname><given-names>Roey</given-names></name><name><surname>Trieu</surname><given-names>Wendy</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Ju-Hyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Walt</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Measuring surface proteins on extracellular vesicles enables quantitative comparison of different isolation methods and optimization of size exclusion chromatography.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cell types and are found in biofluids such as plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). EVs contain contents from their donor cells, providing broad non-invasive access to molecular information about cell types in the human body that are otherwise inaccessible to biopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirshman et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the diagnostic potential of EVs, there are several challenges that have hampered their utility as biomarkers. EVs are heterogeneous, present at low levels in clinically relevant samples, and difficult to quantify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hartjes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shao et al., 2018</xref>). Due to these challenges, there is a lack of consensus about the best way to isolate EVs from biofluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coumans et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Konoshenko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Théry et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several techniques have been used in attempts to quantify EVs. These methods, such as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), dynamic light scattering, and tunable resistive pulse sensing, aim to measure both particle size and concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hartjes et al., 2019</xref>). A major limitation of these methods is that they cannot discriminate lipoproteins or particles of aggregated proteins from EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coumans et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sódar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Welton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Webber and Clayton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnsen et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, they are all physical methods that provide no information about the biological nature of the particles being measured. Since biofluids, and plasma in particular, contain an abundance of lipoproteins and protein aggregates at levels higher than those of EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sódar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Simonsen, 2017</xref>), these methods are ill-suited for quantifying EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkach et al., 2018</xref>). Lipid dyes have also been used to label and measure EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Osteikoetxea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Visnovitz et al., 2019</xref>), but these dyes also bind to lipoproteins and lack sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkach et al., 2018</xref>). There are also numerous efforts to apply flow cytometry to the analysis of EVs, but due to the small size of EVs, obtaining quantitative measurements using this approach remains challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lucchetti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuiper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Welsh et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>A feature of EVs that distinguishes them from both lipoproteins and free protein aggregates is the presence of transmembrane proteins that span the phospholipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Simonsen, 2017</xref>). The tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81 are transmembrane proteins that are widely expressed and readily found on EVs, often referred to as ‘EV markers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkach et al., 2018</xref>). Although none of these proteins is present on every EV, measuring three tetraspanins should be a reliable proxy for EV abundance in many contexts. We reasoned that by using immunoassays to compare the levels of tetraspanins from a given biofluid, as well as albumin as a representative free protein, we could quantitatively compare the purity and yield of different EV isolation methods.</p><p>The most commonly used method for measuring proteins in biofluids is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but this technique lacks the sensitivity to detect low-abundance proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coumans et al., 2017b</xref>). Single-molecule array (Simoa) technology, previously developed in our lab but now commercially available, converts ELISA into a digital readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rissin et al., 2010</xref>). Simoa assays can be orders of magnitude more sensitive than traditional ELISAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen and Walt, 2019</xref>), which is particularly useful for EV analysis as the levels of EV proteins are often low in clinical biofluid samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coumans et al., 2017b</xref>). We have previously applied Simoa to the investigation of L1CAM, a protein thought to be a marker of neuron-derived EV, showing it is not associated with EVs in plasma and CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Norman et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate the application of Simoa for relative EV quantification by comparing different EV isolation methods from human biofluids. In particular, we applied Simoa to compare EV isolation methods from human plasma and CSF using three of the most commonly used isolation techniques: ultracentrifugation, precipitation, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). By also measuring levels of albumin using Simoa, we were able to determine both relative purity and yield for each technique in the same experiment. We then applied these Simoa assays to screen several parameters of SEC and develop improved EV isolation methods from plasma and CSF, demonstrating the utility of this approach for EV analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Framework for quantifying relative EV yield and purity</title><p>We set out to quantify the relative difference in yield and purity for different EV isolation methods. Starting with aliquots of the same biofluid, we reasoned that by measuring the tetraspanins CD9, CD63, and CD81 using different isolation methods, we could directly compare EV yield. By also measuring albumin, the most abundant free protein in plasma and CSF, we could compare the purity of these methods. Using Simoa technology, an ultrasensitive digital ELISA, to measure all four of these proteins, we could compare EV yield and purity on one platform with high sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of experimental framework for EV detection using Simoa and size exclusion chromatography (SEC).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Different methods of EV isolation can be directly compared to assess yield and purity by measuring the three tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, and CD81) and albumin. (<bold>b</bold>) Single immuno-complexes are formed by binding the target tetraspanin protein on EVs to a magnetic bead conjugated to a capture antibody and a biotin-labeled detection antibody. Detection antibodies are labeled with a streptavidin-conjugated enzyme. The beads are then loaded into individual wells of a microwell array where each well matches the size of the magnetic bead limiting a maximum of one bead per well. Wells with the full immuno-complex (on wells) produce a fluorescent signal upon conversion of substrate, unlike wells with beads lacking the immuno-complex (off wells”). (<bold>c</bold>) EV and free proteins such as albumin in a biofluid sample are separated by SEC. Free proteins elute from the column in later fractions than EVs because free proteins are smaller than the pore size of the beads while EVs are larger and are excluded from entering the beads.

In Simoa, unlike in traditional ELISA, individual immuno-complexes are isolated into femtoliter wells that fit only one bead per well. In a given sample, there are many more antibody-bound beads than target proteins, and therefore Poisson statistics dictate that only a single immuno-complex is present per well. This allows counting ‘on wells’ as individual protein molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The percentage of ‘on wells’ can then be converted to protein concentration by comparing to a calibration curve of recombinant protein standard. We previously developed and validated Simoa assays for the proteins CD9, CD63, and CD81, showing that they are 1–3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than the corresponding standard ELISA assays with the same pairs of antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Norman et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Comparison of existing EV isolation methods</title><p>We started by using Simoa to directly compare EV isolation methods commonly used in biomarker studies. For each method, we used identical 0.5 ml samples of human plasma or CSF that were pooled and aliquoted, allowing us to directly compare the different methods. To separate EVs from cells, cell debris, and large vesicles, all samples were first centrifuged and then filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. We compared three methods and chose two variations for each method: ultracentrifugation (with or without a wash step), two commercial precipitation kits (ExoQuick and ExoQuick ULTRA), and two commercially available SEC columns (Izon qEVoriginal 35 nm and 70 nm).</p><p>SEC separates EVs from free proteins based on size; proteins enter porous beads and elute from the column later than the EVs, which are much larger and less likely to enter the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Whereas the ultracentrifugation and precipitation conditions each yielded a single sample (performed on 2 separate days and averaged; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we collected several fractions for SEC and analyzed each fraction to assess the distribution of EVs relative to albumin.</p><p>We quantified EVs by measuring the levels of CD9, CD63, and CD81 across the different EV isolation methods in both plasma and CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Since we are interested in all EVs, as opposed to subsets with a specific marker, we quantified EV yield by averaging the levels of the three tetraspanins. We first used the Simoa measurement (in picomoles, determined relative to a corresponding recombinant protein standard) to calculate EV recovery for each individual marker by normalizing the level of tetraspanin in each condition to the amount of that tetraspanin in fractions 7–10 of the Izon qEV 35 nm SEC column (the condition with the highest EV levels in plasma). Next, we averaged the relative tetraspanin recovery values across the three tetraspanins to calculate relative EV recovery.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of existing methods for EV isolation in plasma and CSF.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of experimental outline.

First, we designed an SEC stand that allows for reproducible collection of fractions and multiple columns to be run in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next took advantage of Simoa’s high throughput screening capability to help identify the EV-containing fractions in SEC. This enabled us to optimize EV isolation from 0.5 ml samples of plasma and CSF using SEC. We prepared our own columns to systematically test several parameters: column height (10 or 20 ml) and resin (Sepharose CL-2B, CL-4B, or CL-6B).</p><p>This comprehensive comparison led us to several conclusions. First, we found that resins with smaller pore sizes led to higher yields of EVs. To confirm this result with another technique, we also observed the same result with Western blotting for the tetraspanins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Sepharose CL-6B, which has the smallest pore size, gave the highest yield, although it was accompanied by higher albumin contamination. For all SEC columns, higher purity could also be achieved by taking a smaller number of fractions (e.g., 7–9 instead of 7–10), albeit at the expense of lower EV yield. Additionally, we found that doubling the height of any given column from 10 to 20 ml resulted in better separation between EVs and free proteins, leading to higher purity but lower EV recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). When we compared loading different sample volumes in a 10-ml Sepharose CL-6B column, we found that as expected, larger loading volumes led to lower purity in both plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of SEC methods for EV isolation in plasma.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Levels of tetraspanins and albumin in plasma after fractionation with 10 ml custom columns filled with Sepharose CL-6B (top), Sepharose CL-4B (middle), and Sepharose CL-2B (bottom).

Several techniques, such as NTA and other methods developed for analysis of synthetic particles, have been applied to EV detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hartjes et al., 2019</xref>). The utility of these techniques is hindered, however, by an inability to differentiate heterogeneous EVs from other particles with overlapping size, such as lipoproteins or aggregated protein particles. Thus, although previous reports comparing EV isolation methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lobb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Helwa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baranyai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Soares Martins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stranska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diaz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kalra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Serrano-Pertierra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gámez-Valero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brennan et al., 2020</xref> have yielded some useful insights, the lack of reliable EV quantification has made these studies difficult to interpret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tkach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coumans et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ludwig et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The measurement of EV transmembrane proteins overcomes the limitations of EV quantification with particle detection methods. Since the transmembrane proteins CD9, CD63, and CD81 are present on EVs but are not present in lipoproteins or free protein aggregates, these tetraspanins can be used for relative quantification of EVs. Although not every EV necessarily contains a tetraspanin protein, by detecting three different tetraspanins per sample with Simoa, we minimize the chance that we are measuring a rare subset of EVs. In the experiments reported here, we observed a strong correlation of the relative levels of the three tetraspanins in different SEC fractions. Since we compared isolation methods from the same starting sample, we were able to provide a direct quantitative comparison of tetraspanin levels between the different isolation methods.</p><p>We used Simoa in this study, which is particularly well suited for EV analysis due to the technology’s high dynamic range, throughput, and sensitivity. This sensitivity is achieved by converting ELISA to a digital readout via immuno-capture and counting of individual protein molecules in a microwell array. We used the commercially available Quanterix HD-X instrument, but our lab has also developed other digital ELISA methods using commonly available instrumentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), which could be similarly applied to EVs. One could also follow a similar approach to the one we present here with traditional ELISA or other protein detection methods, but we find that high sensitivity is often necessary for the low levels of EVs in human biofluids. We have previously shown in a direct comparison (using the same antibodies) that Simoa can detect EV markers in cases where traditional ELISA cannot, such as SEC fractions of CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Norman et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We used Simoa to directly compare the yield and purity of commonly used EV isolation methods. To obtain the purest EVs possible (and separate EVs from lipoproteins), it has been demonstrated that it is necessary to combine several techniques sequentially, such as density gradient centrifugation (DGC) and SEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karimi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, techniques such as DGC are not scalable to many samples and therefore not amenable to biomarker studies. Thus, we focused on EV isolation methods that are amenable to biomarker studies. After finding that commercial SEC columns compare favorably to ultracentrifugation and ExoQuick precipitation, we compared several resins and column volumes to further improve EV isolation by custom SEC columns. SEC requires no instrumentation and allows one to run many columns in parallel. The throughput can be further increased by using SEC stands (such as the one we designed) and preparing columns ahead of time. Although we used freshly prepared columns in this study, we found comparable performance to columns stored at 4°C for 1 week.</p><p>Our investigation of SEC parameters led us to improved methods for EV isolation; in particular, we found that Sepharose CL-6B, which is seldom used for EV isolation, yields considerably higher levels of EVs than either Sepharose CL-2B, the most commonly used resin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monguió-Tortajada et al., 2019</xref>), or Sepharose CL-4B. We attribute this result to Sepharose CL-6B beads having a smaller average pore size (reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hagel et al., 1996</xref>] to be 24 nm vs. 42 nm for CL-4B and 75 nm for CL-2B), leading to a lower probability that EVs will enter the beads. As there is a tradeoff between EV yield and albumin contamination, we envision different SEC columns will be suited for different applications. Using a 10-ml Sepharose CL-6B column for EV isolation from plasma or CSF is the best choice for downstream applications where maximum EV yield is needed and where some free protein contamination is not detrimental—for example, analyzing rare EV cargo or when further purification of EVs will be performed (such as immuno-isolation). On the other hand, if isolating EVs from plasma where minimal free protein contamination is desired (e.g., in EV protein analysis by Western blot), a larger 20 ml column with Sepharose CL-4B would yield better results. For CSF, which has much less protein than plasma, 10 ml columns are preferable to 20 ml ones.</p><p>By developing a Simoa assay to measure albumin (the most abundant protein in plasma and main contaminant when isolating EVs), we were able to assess the purity of EV preparations with respect to unwanted co-purification of free proteins. Our methods could be expanded to assess other contaminants that are less abundant than albumin but may, nonetheless, be problematic for some applications, such as lipoproteins. Adding a Simoa assay for ApoB100 (or other protein components of lipoproteins) would allow for the assessment of both lipoprotein and free protein contamination in EV isolation methods. Although lipoproteins are difficult to separate from EVs due to their overlapping size profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Simonsen, 2017</xref>), a recent study demonstrated that a chromatography column combining a cation-exchange resin layer with an SEC resin layer allows for efficient lipoprotein depletion using ‘dual mode chromatography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Van Deun et al., 2020</xref>). Simoa could be used to evaluate and help improve such techniques in the future.</p><p>The general experimental framework presented here could be easily applied to evaluate new EV isolation methods in plasma, CSF, or other biological fluids, such as urine or saliva. While we limited our study to human biofluids, similar methods could also be applied to compare EV isolation methods from cell culture media. As sensitivity of EV detection and specificity in differentiating EVs from contaminants are obstacles in all EV studies, we envision that ultrasensitive protein detection with Simoa will be broadly applicable to assessing EV isolation methods for both the study of EV biology and development of EV diagnostics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap

from BioIVT. The same pools were used for all main figures throughout the paper in order to ensure comparable analysis of methods. For all EV isolation technique comparisons, one 0.5-ml sample was used for each isolation method. Plasma or CSF was thawed at room temperature. After sample thawing, 100× Protease/Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology) was added to 1×. The sample was then centrifuged at 2000<italic>×g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged through a 0.45 μm Corning Costar SPIN-X centrifuge tube filter (Sigma-Aldrich) at 2000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min to get rid of any remaining cells or cell debris.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Simoa assays</title><p>Simoa assays were developed and performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Norman et al., 2021</xref>). A detailed protocol is available: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.protocols.io/view/simoa-extracellular-vesicle-assays-bm89k9z6">https://www.protocols.io/view/simoa-extracellular-vesicle-assays-bm89k9z6</ext-link>. Capture antibodies were coupled to Carboxylated Paramagnetic Beads from the Simoa Homebrew Assay Development Kit (Quanterix) using EDC chemistry (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Detection antibodies were conjugated to biotin using EZ-Link NHS-PEG4 Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For CD9, ab195422 (Abcam) was used as capture antibody and ab58989 (Abcam) was used as detector antibody. For CD63, MAB5048 (R&amp;D Systems) was used as capture antibody and 556019 (BD) was used as detector antibody. For CD81, ab79559 (Abcam) was used as capture antibody and 349502 (BioLegend) was used as detector antibody. For albumin, DY1455 (R&amp;D Systems) was used as both capture and detector antibody. The following recombinant proteins were used for CD9, CD63, CD81, and albumin: ab152262 (Abcam), TP301733 (Origene), TP317508 (Origene), and ab201876 (Abcam). On-board dilution was performed with 4× dilution for each of the tetraspanins, while manual 20× dilution was used for albumin. All samples were raised to 160 μl per replicate in sample diluent. For tetraspanin assays, samples were incubated with immunocapture beads (25 μl) and biotinylated detection antibody (20 μl) for 35 min. Next, six washes were performed, and the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of Streptavidin labeled β-galactosidase (Quanterix) and incubated for 5 min. All bead washes were performed with Wash Buffer 1 (Quanterix). After incubation, an additional six washes were performed, and the beads were resuspended in 25 μl Resorufin β-D-galactopyranoside (Quanterix) before being loaded into the microwell array on the Quanterix HD-X instrument. For the albumin assay, samples were incubated first with immunocapture beads (25 μl) for 15 min and then washed six times. Subsequently, 100 μl detection antibody was incubated with the beads for 5 min. Next, six washes were performed, and the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of Streptavidin labeled β-galactosidase (Quanterix) for a final 5-min incubation. After an additional six washes, the beads were resuspended in 25 μl Resorufin β-D-galactopyranoside (Quanterix) and then loaded into the microwell array on the Quanterix HD-X instrument.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Construction of SEC stand</title><p>The custom SEC rack was constructed from a total of 22 pieces using CNC milling tools. The rack is made of an aluminum frame (silver, Multipurpose 6061 Aluminum, McMaster-Carr) consisting of eight pieces, 4 sliding plates made from acetal (black, Wear-Resistant Easy-to-Machine Delrin Acetal Resin, McMaster-Carr), and 10 sliding plate grips made from UHMW Polyethylene (white, Slippery UHMW Polyethylene, McMaster-Carr). The rack frame is held together using 20 ¾″ screws (McMaster-Carr, 92210 A113), 20 ½″ screws (McMaster-Carr, 92210 A110), 10 0.375″ Dowel pins (McMaster-Carr, 90145 A470), and 10 0.5625″ Dowel pins (McMaster-Carr, 90145 A483), and includes 20 spring plungers (McMaster-Carr, 84895 A710) that allow the sliding plates to ‘click’ once aligned with the chromatography columns. Details for constructing the rack and SolidWorks files are included in the Supplementary materials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Preparation of custom SEC columns</title><p>The resins Sepharose CL-2B, Sepharose CL-4B, and Sepharose CL-6B (all from GE Healthcare/Cytiva) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The volume of resin was washed with an equal volume of PBS in a glass container and then placed at 4°C in order to let the resin settle completely (several hours or overnight). The PBS was then poured off, and an equal volume of PBS was again added two more times for a total of three washes. Columns were prepared fresh on the day of use. Washed resin was poured into an Econo-Pac Chromatography column (Bio-Rad) to bring the bed volume (the resin without liquid) to 10 or 20 ml. When the desired amount of resin filled the column and the liquid dripped through, the top frit was immediately placed at the top of the resin without compressing the resin. PBS was then added again before sample addition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Collection of size exclusion chromatography fractions</title><p>Once prepared, all columns were washed with at least 20 ml of PBS in the column. Immediately before sample addition, the column was allowed to fully drip out and, after last drop of PBS, sample (filtered plasma or CSF) was added to the column. As soon as sample was added, 0.5 ml fractions were collected in individual tubes. As soon as the plasma or CSF completely entered the column (below the frit), PBS was added to the top of column 1 ml at a time. Fraction numbers correspond to 0.5 ml increments collected as soon as sample is added. For Izon and 10 ml columns, fractions 6–21 were collected (since first few fractions correspond to void volume). For 20 ml columns, fractions 12–27 were collected (since void volume is larger for 20 ml columns than 10 ml columns). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, only fractions 7–10 were collected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Ultracentrifugation</title><p>Samples of filtered 0.5 m plasma or CSF were added to 3.5 ml Open-Top Thickwall Polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter), and PBS was added to fill tubes to the top. Samples were ultracentrifuged at 120,000<italic>×g</italic> for 90 min at 4°C in an Optima XPN-80 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) using an SW55 Ti swinging-bucket rotor (Beckman Coulter). Afterward, all supernatant was aspirated. Pellets were resuspended in PBS for the ‘Ultracentrifugation’ condition. For the ‘Ultracentrifugation with wash’ condition, the ultracentrifuge tubes were filled to the top with PBS, and samples were ultracentrifuged again at 120,000<italic>×g</italic> for 90 min. Supernatant was then aspirated, and pellets were resuspended in 500 µl PBS. For all ultracentrifugation samples, isolation was performed on 2 separate days and then resulting Simoa values were averaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>ExoQuick and ExoQuick ULTRA</title><p>Samples of plasma or CSF were mixed with ExoQuick Exosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences) or ExoQuick ULTRA EV Isolation Kit for Serum and Plasma (System Biosciences), and protocols were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For ExoQuick, 0.5 ml of plasma or CSF was mixed with 126 µl of ExoQuick and incubated at 4°C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 1500<italic>×g</italic> for 30 min. Supernatant was removed, and samples were centrifuged at 1500×<italic>g</italic> for an additional 5 min. Residual supernatant was removed, and pellets were resuspended in 500 µl PBS. For ExoQuick ULTRA, 250 µl of plasma or CSF was used in accordance with instructions, and Simoa values were corrected by multiplying by 2 to match the 0.5 ml volume used for other samples. For each sample, 500 µl of EVs was eluted per column. For all precipitations, isolation was performed on 2 separate days and then resulting Simoa values were averaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Western blotting for tetraspanins was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kowal et al., 2017</xref>), with minor modifications. 4× LDS was added to samples and samples were heated at 70°C for 10 min. Samples were run at 150 V for 1 hr on 4–12% Bolt Bis-Tris protein gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred using iBlot two nitrocellulose mini transfer stack (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 20 V for 3 min. Blocking buffer was made by dissolving milk powder (to 5% w/v) in PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked on a shaker for 30 min at 4°C, and then incubated with primary antibody overnight. The following antibodies and dilutions were used: 1:1000 BD (H5C6) for CD63, 1:1000 Millipore Clone MM2/57 (CBL162) for CD9 and 1:666 Thermo Fisher Scientific (M38) for CD81. Membranes were washed three times with PBS-T and incubated with 1:2000 human cross-adsorbed, anti-mouse HRP conjugated secondary antibody (Rockland) in blocking buffer for 2 hr. Membranes were washed three times with PBS-T and WesternBright ECL-spray HRP substrate (Advansta) was added. Images were acquired with a Sapphire Biomolecular Analyzer (Azure Biosystems).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>The authors have filed intellectual property related to methods for isolating extracellular vesicles</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>GMC commercial interests: http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/tech.html</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>DRW has a financial interest in Quanterix Corporation, a company that develops an ultra-sensitive digital immunoassay platform.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Y M Dennis Lo as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Qing Zhou (Reviewer #1); Julie A Saugstad (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most novel aspect of this work is the strategy for quantifying EV yield and purity after EV isolation. To allow the authors to claim the potential superiority of their method, parallel analysis with a number of other currently available techniques (e.g. NTA) are necessary. For example, it would be useful to test if NTA can detect EV yield change between different isolation methods, or whether western blotting could show the same protein level changes reported by Simoa. There is also insufficient data to conclude that 10 mL Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>6B column is the best choice for EV isolation from plasma and CSF.</p><p>2) A number of sub-conclusions are not solid enough. For example, whether different centrifugation speeds and time may affect the claim that SEC outperforms ultracentrifugation with regard to EV yield. It is well known that longer and higher speed centrifugation will increase the yield of EVs. Moreover, whether 10 mL Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>6B column would still be the best choice for EV isolation from plasma or CSF when extending contamination markers to lipoprotein markers. As the size of lipoproteins is much larger, the purity of 10 mL Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>6B column may be more affected than 10 mL Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>2B columns.</p><p>3) Assessment of contamination could have been bolstered by examination of one or more proteins, e.g. lipoproteins.</p><p>4) The rationale for choosing some of the methods for comparison are missing – why test with and without the wash step for UC? Why use exoquick? The error bars are missing from most figures, the reproducibility of a method should be an important factor for consideration as a good isolation method.</p><p>5) Figure 3 should be reformatted as a supplement.</p><p>6) Frozen-thawed samples, which are commonly avoided in studies on EV, were used in this work. Why were such samples used, and would such samples produce bias to the authors' data?</p><p>7) The pre-analytical collection of the plasma and CSF should be described more fully in the Materials and methods and a couple of sentences added to the results. The pre-analytical steps are important for understanding the downstream results. While we note that the authors had purchased the samples from a company, we would like to know more details on the sample collection process. Information that would be useful includes: i) were EDTA collections tubes used? If not, state what type of tubes (Streck, etc) ii) was the plasma spun once to separate from buffy coat, or was it spun twice to also reduce platelets? iii) were hemoglobin/hemolysis measurements taken for the pools?</p><p>8) Figure 1C should have a graphic of each method tested. The graphic for SEC is clear and easy to understand. There should also be a short graphic for the ultracentrifugation with the speed of spins and the time laid out in order. There should also be a graphic for the exoquick – though that one is a little less exciting as a picture, but should describe incubation times etc.</p><p>9) More details should be included in the results describing the assays chosen for isolation – qEV 35 vs 70 and ultraC with or without wash and the two exoquicks. Explanations should be included why each of these was examined and what potential differences they represented – for example between 35 and 70, etc.</p><p>10) In Figure 2, the emphasis should be on recovery, not contamination. Consider reordering the results at the bottom based on relative EV recovery rather than albumin concentration. So in this case, d and e and i and j would switch places and the order would go from left to right on EV recovery. It would be useful to add error bars for this figure. An important component of comparing these assays concerns their reproducibility.</p><p>11) In the results – the authors claim that SEC is superior, but exoquick performs well in CSF. The authors should provide a set of characteristics which would objectively demonstrate that SEC is indeed superior to exoquick. Why would Izon 35 or 70 work differently in CSF compared with plasma? What might be some of the contributing factors influencing the effects of pore sizes that might aid in choosing one of these – or for understanding the albumin contamination in CSF.</p><p>12) The construction of the SEC collection apparatus is more appropriately placed in the supplementary materials. Izon sells and automated fraction collector, a similar stand, though not as sophisticated. Indeed, almost every lab that has done SEC often fashions its own collection apparatus. Thus, while the apparatus is interesting and well-constructed, its details can be regarded as supplemental.</p><p>13) A more detailed description of the pore sizes for the Sepharose chosen is needed. The testing of the columns for different size Sepharose beads and different heights is informative. Figures 4 and 5, one would like to more directly compare the 10 and 20 mL columns and would prefer they were A and B while Izon was C. And if the authors could make a measure of relative yield for the EV recovery, as they did in Figure 2 – that would be a nice additional column.</p><p>14) It would be useful to readers for the authors to summarize the outcomes of the plasma and CSF studies presented herein as &quot;Recommendations&quot; or as a summary table indicating the best method for each.</p><p>15) In Methods, Simoa Assays, first paragraph: It would be helpful to the reader to include the name of the Tetraspanins and detector antibodies before the catalog # and company name.</p><p>16) In Methods, Simoa Assays, second paragraph: In the sentence &quot;Next, six washes were performed&quot; it would be helpful to readers to say what buffer was used for the washes, and if these were consistently used for all the following washes.</p><p>17) In Methods, Preparation of Custom SEC Columns: &quot;Columns were prepared fresh on the day of use&quot;. Can the authors comment in the Discussion whether the columns need to be prepared fresh on the day of use, or if they can be stored in the refrigerator, and if so, for how many days before use?</p><p>18) In Images, Figures 4 and 5, and Supplementary Figure 1: Please include higher resolution images.

Some data should be generated or discussed regarding abundance on different cell types or cell lines. It may be that these tetraspanins are expressed with different amounts in different contexts or cell types – or even on EVs released through different biogenesis pathways – in addition to not being present on every EV. The use of sensitive quantitative assays is very useful for understanding the purity and contamination with each method, though there are many papers out there already that do this with different assays and assess more EV components and contaminants.</p><p>Results</p><p>1) The pre-analytical collection of the plasma and CSF should be described more fully in the Materials and methods and a couple of sentences added to the results. The pre-analytical steps are important for understanding the downstream results. While you purchased the samples from a company – you can still report on the methods of collection. Information that should be included: 1) were EDTA collections tubes used? If not state what type of tubes (Streck, etc) 2) was the plasma spun once to separate from buffy coat, or was it spun twice to also reduce platelets? 3) were hemoglobin/hemolysis measurements taken for the pools? If aliquots remain in the freezer – you can add this information to the methods section on the samples.</p><p>2) Figure 1C should have a graphic of each method tested. The graphic for SEC is clear and easy to understand. There should also be a short graphic for the ultracentrifugation with the speed of spins and the time laid out in order.

To allow the authors to claim the potential superiority of their method, parallel analysis with a number of other currently available techniques (e.g. NTA) are necessary. For example, it would be useful to test if NTA can detect EV yield change between different isolation methods, or whether western blotting could show the same protein level changes reported by Simoa. There is also insufficient data to conclude that 10 mL Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>6B column is the best choice for EV isolation from plasma and CSF.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewers for these comments. We certainly agree that different methods for comparing EV isolation methods would yield different results. Since there is no perfect technique for measuring EVs, there is also no true positive control to compare to. In particular, NTA has been widely recognized to be problematic for quantifying EVs due to its inability to discriminate between EVs and the similarly sized but more abundant non-EV particles such as lipoproteins or protein aggregates (1-3). For example, Welton et al. demonstrated that there is poor overlap between particles measured by NTA and tetraspanin levels after fractionating plasma by SEC, leading the authors to conclude that &gt;70% of particles measured by NTA in plasma are not EVs (4). This was our motivation for using Simoa to measure tetraspanin levels, which overcomes this limitation of NTA and other particle counting methods. Of course, measuring specific proteins, which are not present on every single EV is a limitation of our approach, but since we are comparing EV isolation methods from the same starting sample of biofluid, Simoa enables an “apples to apples” comparison that is quantitative in a way that other techniques (such as NTA) are not. We have previously compared Simoa to ELISA and western blot (in Supplemental Figure 2) from the same sample (5). To show concordance between Simoa and western blot, we repeated the comparison of 10mL SEC columns with Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>2B, CL<sup>-</sup>4B, and CL<sup>-</sup>6B and evaluated the EV fractions (F7-10) by western blotting for CD9, CD63, and CD81. Our western blot results confirm that using CL<sup>-</sup>6B leads to the highest levels of tetraspanins and that SEC resins with smaller pore sizes lead to more EVs. We have added a supplemental figure with these results. Whether or not Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>6B is the best choice, as we state in the paper, depends on the goal. Using this resin yields more EVs, but also more albumin contamination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A number of sub-conclusions are not solid enough. For example, whether different centrifugation speeds and time may affect the claim that SEC outperforms ultracentrifugation with regard to EV yield. It is well known that longer and higher speed centrifugation will increase the yield of EVs. Moreover, whether 10 mL Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>6B column would still be the best choice for EV isolation from plasma or CSF when extending contamination markers to lipoprotein markers. As the size of lipoproteins is much larger, the purity of 10 mL Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>6B column may be more affected than 10 mL Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>2B columns.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewers for these comments. The purpose of our study was not to comprehensively compare all EV isolation methods, as there are many isolation methods (and many variations of each, such as different ultracentrifugation times). Our main goal was to propose a framework for rapidly comparing EV isolation methods using quantitative measurements. It has, indeed, been shown that increasing centrifugation time increases EV yield, but also free protein contamination (6). As we found SEC to be superior to ultracentrifugation in our initial survey of different isolation methods, and SEC is much higher throughput than ultracentrifugation, we decided to demonstrate the utility of our technique by applying it to the optimization of SEC. We certainly agree that albumin is not the only contaminant in EV preparations and there are other contaminants, such as lipoproteins. Additionally, separating EVs from lipoproteins is acknowledged to be challenging due to their overlapping size ranges (4, 7, 8). We agree that it is likely different SEC resins would have different effects on separation of lipoproteins and EVs. We chose albumin as it is the most abundant protein in plasma, and, thus, the main contaminant in EV preparations. As we mention in the Discussion section of our manuscript, for future studies, we plan to add other Simoa assays for ApoB100 or other protein components of lipoproteins and optimize the separation of EVs from both lipoproteins and free proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Assessment of contamination could have been bolstered by examination of one or more proteins, e.g. lipoproteins.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in #2, we agree with the reviewer’s comments that there is more than one type of contamination when separating EVs from plasma. Although we plan to develop Simoa assays for protein components of lipoproteins in future studies, this was beyond the scope of this study, which was to demonstrate the utility of Simoa to quantitatively compare EV isolation methods in terms of yield and free protein contamination. We chose albumin as it is the most abundant protein in plasma, and also a “model” contaminating, free protein. In subsequent studies, we hope to use Simoa assays to specifically optimize separation of EVs from lipoproteins. It would be interesting to build on the results of our study, for example, to see if we can incorporate Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>6B into improved “dual-mode chromatography” columns, which have been previously shown to deplete lipoproteins when combined with a cation exchange resin (9). We plan to explore these questions in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The rationale for choosing some of the methods for comparison are missing – why test with and without the wash step for UC? Why use exoquick? The error bars are missing from most figures, the reproducibility of a method should be an important factor for consideration as a good isolation method.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewers for these comments. We initially began by comparing the EV isolation methods that are most widely used in the context of biomarker studies for human biofluids. These commonly used methods are ultracentrifugation, precipitation (ExoQuick), and SEC (10). For each of these methods, we chose a common variation: ultracentrifugation is sometimes done with or without a wash step, ExoQuick has a new kit with an extra spin column step that the manufacturers claim gives higher purity (ExoQuick Ultra), and Izon offers two SEC columns (but it is unclear how the yield of EVs compares between the two). After performing a broad survey of these techniques to get a general sense of how they compare, we saw that the commercial SEC columns performed favorably, and we set out to further explore how the various parameters (resin type and volume) affect EV yield and purity using homemade SEC columns. All of these experiments were done using the same pooled and aliquoted batches of plasma and CSF. Using these samples allowed us to directly compare the Simoa measurements to each other. For the ultracentrifugation and precipitation-based methods (where one final sample is collected), we performed isolations on two different days and then performed two technical replicates on each isolation. Because there was a limit to how much pooled CSF we could obtain, and how many Simoa jobs we could reasonably run, we included SEC results from one column per condition, collecting all fractions with two technical replicates per measurement. Although we have performed many column comparisons with other batches of biofluids, we did not include those, as they could not be directly compared to the ones we included the manuscript. Instead, using a new batch of pooled CSF and plasma, we took the best conditions from the broad survey isolation methods, and redid the comparison of high purity and high yield EV isolation methods (shown in Figure 6). For that comparison, we did four replicates for each column, and two technical replicates of each condition, giving us enough data to include error bars. For figure 2, we did not feel that the low number of replicates warranted the addition of error bars. But to address variability, we have added additional supplementary figures: Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to show the variability of precipitation and ultracentrifugation performed on two different days and Figure 3—figure supplement 5 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3 to show the variability of technical replicates across all conditions tested in Figures 2-5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3 should be reformatted as a supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have moved Figure 3 to the supplement in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Frozen-thawed samples, which are commonly avoided in studies on EV, were used in this work. Why were such samples used, and would such samples produce bias to the authors' data?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that pre-analytical variables such as freeze-thaw samples are very important to consider when thinking about biomarker studies. In this case, we wanted to evaluate samples that were as close as possible to samples used in clinical biomarker studies. Since such samples always undergo at least one freeze-thaw cycle, we decided to use pooled CSF and plasma that was shipped to us frozen to mimic clinical samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The pre-analytical collection of the plasma and CSF should be described more fully in the Materials and methods and a couple of sentences added to the results.

We have expanded the Materials and methods section to include information about the type of plasma samples that we ordered from BioIVT (EDTA collection tubes). The plasma was spun once to separate from buffy coat prior to shipment to us. However, upon thawing, as mentioned in the Materials and methods, we performed an additional spin at 2000g for 10 minutes and filtered plasma (or CSF) through a 0.45um filter. Hemoglobin/hemolysis measurements were not taken for the pools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 1C should have a graphic of each method tested.

As mentioned in #4, we initially chose methods that were the most commonly used in context of EV biomarker studies. For each of these methods, we picked one common variation for each. For example, Izon offers two commercial columns and their website states that the 70nm columns is better for isolating large EVs relative to the 35nm column, but no additional information or data are provided. We omitted techniques such as density gradient centrifugation, for example, since this technique is not amenable to biomarker studies where large numbers of samples are used. We have added a few sentences in the Results section of our manuscript providing additional context for this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In Figure 2, the emphasis should be on recovery, not contamination.

We reordered the conditions in Figure 2 based on the recovery. As we mentioned in #4, We agree that reproducibility is important and have added two supplemental figures to address this. We added Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to show experimental variability of the non-SEC methods performed on two independent days with the same batch of plasma or CSF. We also added supplementary figures (Figure 3—figure supplement 5 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3) to demonstrate the variability (CVs) of technical replicates (same sample measured twice by Simoa) for all measurements performed in Figures 2-5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In the results – the authors claim that SEC is superior, but exoquick performs well in CSF. The authors should provide a set of characteristics which would objectively demonstrate that SEC is indeed superior to exoquick. Why would Izon 35 or 70 work differently in CSF compared with plasma? What might be some of the contributing factors influencing the effects of pore sizes that might aid in choosing one of these – or for understanding the albumin contamination in CSF.</p></disp-quote><p>We also found it interesting that some isolation methods showed a difference in relative performance in plasma compared CSF. Since plasma has a protein concentration that is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that of CSF, we think this is the most likely reason for the difference. Our data indicating that Exoquick works relatively better in CSF compared to plasma could be due to CSF having much less albumin than plasma. When comparing all of the techniques we tested in the initial broad survey (including the custom SEC columns), as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2, we found that Sepharose CL<sup>-</sup>6B had higher relative EV yield than ExoQuick in CSF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The construction of the SEC collection apparatus is more appropriately placed in the supplementary materials.
