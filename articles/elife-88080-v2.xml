CR’s metabolic effects, including decreased adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity, are important for its broader health benefits; however, the extent and basis of sex differences in CR’s health benefits are unknown. We found that 30% CR in young (3-month-old) male mice decreased fat mass and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, whereas these effects were blunted or absent in young females. Females’ resistance to fat loss was associated with decreased lipolysis, energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation, and increased postprandial lipogenesis, compared to males. The sex differences in glucose homeostasis were not associated with differential glucose uptake but with altered hepatic ceramide content and substrate metabolism: compared to CR males, CR females had lower TCA cycle activity and higher blood ketone concentrations, a marker of hepatic acetyl-CoA content. This suggests that males use hepatic acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle whereas in females it accumulates, stimulating gluconeogenesis and limiting hypoglycaemia during CR. In aged mice (18-months old), when females are anoestrus, CR decreased fat mass and improved glucose homeostasis similarly in both sexes. Finally, in a cohort of overweight and obese humans, CR-induced fat loss was also sex- and age-dependent: younger females (&lt;45 years) resisted fat loss compared to younger males while in older subjects (&gt;45 years) this sex difference was absent. Collectively, these studies identify age-dependent sex differences in the metabolic effects of CR and highlight adipose tissue, the liver and oestrogen as key determinants of CR’s metabolic benefits. These findings have important implications for understanding the interplay between diet and health, and for maximising the benefits of CR in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>caloric restriction</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>glucose homeostasis</kwd><kwd>healthy ageing</kwd><kwd>insulin sensitivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M021394/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cawthorn</surname><given-names>William P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/16/10/32375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tavares</surname><given-names>Adriana AS</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/19/34/34354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tavares</surname><given-names>Adriana AS</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4-year PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Benjamin J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sulston</surname><given-names>Richard J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship for Young Japanese MDs &amp;

CR extends lifespan and reduces the risk of age-related diseases in numerous species, ranging from yeast to primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Weindruch et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mattison et al., 2017</xref>). CR can have detrimental effects, including bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Villareal et al., 2016</xref>) and increased susceptibility to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Speakman and Mitchell, 2011</xref>), and therefore it may not be suitable for all individuals; however, trials of CR in humans show numerous health benefits, including the prevention of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammation, and risk of certain cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Most et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the ability of CR to promote healthy ageing is now also recognised in humans. In addition to these health benefits, many effects of CR reflect evolutionary adaptations that confer a survival advantage during periods of food scarcity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Speakman and Mitchell, 2011</xref>). Establishing the extent and basis of CR’s effects may thereby reveal new knowledge of healthy ageing and the interplay between food, nutrition, and health.</p><p>A key contributor to the health benefits of CR is its impact on metabolic function. Ageing is characterised by hepatic insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia, and excessive accumulation of white adipose tissue (WAT), particularly visceral WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barzilai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">López-Otín et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mancuso and Bouchard, 2019</xref>). The latter is coupled with adipose dysfunction, whereby WAT becomes unable to meet the demands for safe lipid storage. This results in ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver and other tissues, contributing to insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barzilai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mancuso and Bouchard, 2019</xref>). CR counteracts these effects, decreasing WAT mass, increasing fatty acid (FA) oxidation, preventing ectopic lipid deposition and enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Speakman and Mitchell, 2011</xref>). Notably, studies in rodents show that removal of visceral WAT, independent of CR, is sufficient to prevent insulin resistance, improve glucose tolerance and increase lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gabriely et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Muzumdar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tran et al., 2008</xref>). Visceral WAT loss in humans is also strongly associated with CR’s metabolic benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Larson-Meyer et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the ability of CR to decrease visceral WAT, and the resultant improvements in hepatic insulin sensitivity, are likely central to CR’s effects on metabolic function and healthy ageing.</p><p>This importance of adiposity and metabolic function raises the possibility of sex differences in the CR response. Indeed, it is now well established that metabolic homeostasis and adipose biology differ substantially between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mauvais-Jarvis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Oliva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Valencak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maggi and Della Torre, 2018</xref>); however, most preclinical rodent studies have used males only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Prendergast et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that much of the CR literature may have overlooked sex as a potential determinant of CR’s effects. Nevertheless, some clinical and preclinical CR studies from our lab and others have identified sexually dimorphic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Redman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cawthorn et al., 2016</xref>), whereby males lose fat mass to a greater extent than females. Oestrogens underlie many metabolic sex differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mauvais-Jarvis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Della Torre et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that oestrogen may contribute to females’ resistance to fat loss during CR. However, the extent and basis of sexual dimorphism in CR’s metabolic effects remains to be firmly established.</p><p>Herein, we first systematically review the CR literature to establish the degree to which sex has been overlooked a determinant of the CR response. To further elucidate the extent and basis of sex differences, we studied CR in male and female mice and humans at ages where oestrogen is physiologically active or absent. Together, our findings show that the CR field has largely overlooked sex differences and reveal that both mice and humans display age-dependent sexual dimorphism in the metabolic effects of CR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sex is routinely overlooked as a biological variable in the CR literature</title><p>One review of the recent CR literature found that most rodent studies use males only, with females typically used only to address female-specific experimental questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kane et al., 2018</xref>); however, the extent of this bias in earlier CR studies, and whether it applies to human CR research, has not been assessed. To address these issues, we first systematically quantified the use of males and females, and the consideration of sex as a biological variable, in mouse and human CR studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We focused on research published since 2003, when the European Commission first highlighted the importance of addressing sex as a biological variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee, 2018</xref>). We also excluded studies that necessarily focused on a single sex, such as those addressing effects of CR on female reproductive function, leaving only studies in which there is no scientific rationale for ignoring potential sexual dimorphism. We found that male-only studies predominated for mice, accounting for ~64% of all mouse CR studies since 2003 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is consistent with previous analyses of the more-recent CR literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kane et al., 2018</xref>). Fewer than 20% of studies used females only, while around 7.3% combined males and females, suggesting an assumption that sex would not influence experimental outcomes. In contrast,~60% of human studies combined males and females, while ~23% used only females and ~12% only males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Strikingly, by the end of 2021, studies that included both sexes and analysed data with sex as a variable were in a minority for both mice (~3.4%) and humans (~4.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Moreover, the proportion of studies using each sex or combination of sexes has remained relatively constant since 2003 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Thus, efforts to increase the consideration of sex in experimental design, as promoted by the European Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee, 2018</xref>), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>), appear to have had little impact on the field of CR research.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of sex differences in mouse and human CR research.</title><p>PubMed was searched using MeSH terms to identify research articles that studied caloric restriction in vivo in mice (<bold>A,B</bold>) or humans (<bold>C,D</bold>), published between 2003 and 2021.

We found that in males but not females CR decreased the absolute mass of gonadal (gWAT), inguinal (iWAT), mesenteric (mWAT), and perirenal (pWAT) WAT depots, as well as brown adipose tissue (BAT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). CR also tended to decrease the absolute mass of pericardial WAT (pcWAT) in males only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To determine if these changes were proportionate to changes in overall body mass, we further analysed the mass of each adipose depot as % body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This showed that the significant sex-diet interaction persisted for gWAT, iWAT, mWAT and pWAT. CR did not affect % BAT mass in either sex, although % BAT mass was significantly greater in males than in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, both in absolute terms and as % body mass, CR decreases WAT mass in males but not in females.</p><p>We next analysed the masses of other tissues to determine if this sex-dependent effect of CR is unique to WAT. CR significantly decreased the absolute mass of the liver, pancreas, kidneys, gastrocnemius muscle (gastroc), heart, spleen, and thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Significant sex-diet effects were detected for the liver and kidney, with CR causing greater decreases in males than in females; however, for each of the other tissues the CR effect was similar between the sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast to these effects on absolute mass, CR did not significantly affect the relative masses of each of these tissues, nor did sex influence the CR effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This indicates that the absolute masses of these tissues decreased in proportion to the changes in overall body mass. One notable exception is the adrenal glands, the mass of which was increased with CR to a greater extent in males than in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). Together, these data show that the sex differences in CR-induced loss of body mass and fat mass are driven primarily by decreased WAT mass in males, which females robustly resist.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Females resist adipocyte hypotrophy and lipolysis during CR</title><p>Differences in WAT mass can be driven by changes in adipocyte size and/or adipocyte number. Thus, given the marked sex differences in the effect of CR on WAT mass, we next investigated this effect at the level of adipocyte size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>).

This suggests that females resist lipolysis during CR. Consistent with this, CR increased plasma NEFA concentrations in males but not in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). To further assess adipocyte lipolysis, we analysed phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in iWAT. CR stimulated HSL phosphorylation in males but not in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>).

To do so, we used indirect calorimetry to analyse mice during week 1 and week 3 of CR, corresponding to periods of weight loss and weight maintenance, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This revealed that CR decreased total energy expenditure in both sexes, with greater decreases occurring during week 3 compared to week 1, and during nighttime compared to daytime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Notably, during week 1, CR females had lower daytime, nighttime, and total energy expenditure than CR males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), likely explaining females’ resistance to weight loss and fat loss during the first week of CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). The daytime diet differences disappeared when normalised to lean body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that they are driven primarily by the loss of lean mass and a consequent reduction in basal metabolic rate. In contrast, CR still decreased in nighttime and total energy expenditure even when normalised to lean body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In AL mice, RER peaked during the night, when most food consumption and physical activity occurs; in contrast, RER for CR mice peaked from 12.00 to 17.00 in the daytime, following provision of the daily ration of CR diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Thus, we further investigated if RER in the postprandial and/or fasted states differs between CR males and females. Postprandial RER, calculated as the average RER from 12.00 to 17.00, exceeded 1 in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>), indicating that CR mice use dietary carbohydrates for FA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruss et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, this postprandial RER was greater in females than in males, particularly during week 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Fasting RER, calculated as the average from 04.00 to 09.00, was below 0.8 for both sexes, indicating preferential oxidation of lipids rather than carbohydrates during this fasted state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Fasting RER was lower during week 1 than during week 3 of CR but, unlike for postprandial RER, no sex differences were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This suggests that relative lipid oxidation is greater in the first week of CR and is similar in males and females. However, given that females have lower absolute energy expenditure, we hypothesised that they would also have lower absolute FA oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruss et al., 2010</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>, CR increased absolute FA oxidation in both sexes during week 1, but not during week 3.

Thus, we further analysed DHCs and the ceramide:DHC ratio as potential mediators of CR’s sexually dimorphic metabolic effects. As for total ceramides, total DHCs were lower in females than in males; however, unlike for total ceramides, CR increased total DHCs in males only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Differential effects of sex and/or diet also occurred for the specific DHC species. A common pattern was for CR to increase DHC concentrations in males only, such that these were lowest in AL males but similar in CR males, CR females and AL females; this pattern occurred for 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 20:0, 23:0, 24:0, and 24:1 DHC species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Principal component analysis of this RNA-seq data identified AL males as the most transcriptionally distinct group, while CR males were more similar to AL or CR females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Volcano plots further revealed the substantial effects of sex and diet on hepatic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>): hundreds of genes were differentially expressed between males and females within each diet group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and between AL and CR mice, both within and across the two sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). To assess the metabolic implications of these transcriptional differences, we first analysed the expression of transcripts that encode proteins associated with gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, or the TCA cycle. Few significant changes were detected for individual transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and therefore we used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to assess higher-level transcriptional changes associated with these and other relevant metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Gluconeogenesis-related genes were significantly increased with CR in each sex, but, against our expectations, they were more highly expressed in males than in females during CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The greatest difference between CR males and CR females was for genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle, which increased with CR in males but not in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>); this was also apparent from the distribution of individual TCA-related genes in the volcano plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Glycolysis-related genes were also increased by CR, more so in males, whereas transcripts relevant to FA β-oxidation and FA biosynthesis were increased by CR in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). These gene expression profiles support the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>): during CR, both sexes increase FA β-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA and this is supported by increased FA biosynthesis. Males, more than females, also increase glycolysis for acetyl-CoA production; however, males utilise the acetyl-CoA to support increased TCA cycle activity and oxidative phosphorylation, pathways that are not increased by CR in females. If so, females should have greater hepatic acetyl-CoA levels than males during CR. To test this, we measured plasma ketone concentrations, which are a biomarker for hepatic acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Perry et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with our model, plasma ketones were significantly higher in females than males, particularly during CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Hepatic acetyl-CoA stimulates gluconeogenesis by activating pyruvate carboxylase; thus, despite transcriptional profiles suggesting increased gluconeogenesis in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), females’ higher levels of acetyl-CoA would be expected to cause greater stimulation of gluconeogenesis, thereby explaining why, compared to males, females are better at maintaining blood glucose during CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>CR exerts sexually dimorphic effects on hepatic gene expression and blood ketone levels.</title><p>Male and female C57BL6/NCrl mice were fed AL or CR diet from 9 to 13 weeks of age, as described for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

The latter indicates that, as for young mice, CR improves glucose tolerance in aged mice primarily by decreasing fasting glucose.

We reveal that 96.6% (mouse) and 95.7% (human) of published CR research overlooks potential sex differences, with most mouse studies using males only whereas most human studies combine data from males and females. We show that, in young mice, CR decreases fat mass and improves glucose homeostasis to a greater extent in males than in females, whereas these sex differences are blunted or absent when CR is initiated in old mice. Young CR females likely resist weight loss and fat loss by having lower energy expenditure, lipolysis and FA oxidation, and greater postprandial lipogenesis, than young CR males, The effects of CR on hepatic gene expression and sphingolipid content also differ between young male and female mice, highlighting the liver as a key mediator of CR’s sexually dimorphic metabolic effects. Finally, we reveal that humans also exhibit age-dependent sex differences in the CR response, with younger age groups showing greater fat loss in males than females whereas, with increasing age, CR-induced fat loss becomes similar between the sexes. Together, these data identify sex and age as factors that have a major influence on the metabolic health outcomes of CR.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Age-dependent sex differences in CR’s metabolic benefits</title><p>Our observation that young females resist overall weight loss during CR is consistent with some previous findings in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cawthorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Piotrowska et al., 2016</xref>), monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mattison et al., 2017</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Musante, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">O’Neil et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mauriège et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2017</xref>).

Many studies have included males and females but did not sex-stratify their analyses, thereby overlooking the potential impact of sex on these important metabolic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Larson-Meyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kraus et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, CR in monkeys and humans has been found to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity more so in males than in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mattison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wong et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with our findings in young mice.</p><p>Our observations fundamentally extend this previous research by demonstrating, for the first time, that these sex differences are age dependent. The novelty of this finding highlights that relatively few studies have investigated CR when initiated in aged subjects. In 2004, Dhahbi et al showed that CR’s health benefits persist even when initiated in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dhahbi et al., 2004</xref>), and subsequent research has compared the metabolic effects of CR when implemented in young vs aged animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rohrbach et al., 2007</xref>). Unfortunately, these studies did not include females, an oversight that has persisted in the CR field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Other notable research has comprehensively compared aged males and females, but only in the context of lifelong CR that was initiated in younger mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>). Two recent studies have also highlighted age-dependent sex differences in the effects of methionine restriction or time-restricted feeding, but these dietary interventions were limited to young vs middle-aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Forney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chaix et al., 2021</xref>). The most relevant previous research is perhaps from Brandhorst et al, who observed significant visceral fat loss in female mice fed a ‘fasting-mimicking diet’ from 16 to 20.5 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandhorst et al., 2015</xref>). While this is consistent with our observations in aged females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), it is limited by having not assessed glucose homeostasis nor including male counterparts for direct comparison. Thus, our study is the first to compare CR when initiated in young or old males and females and to thereby identify age-dependent sex differences in CR’s metabolic effects.</p><p>Our findings have several implications for interpreting previous CR research. Although most studies show that young females resist overall weight loss and fat loss during CR, such sex differences have not been universally observed. For example, in young female rats some studies report that CR decreases body mass and/or fat mass to a similar extent in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Porter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Valle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Valle et al., 2007</xref>), while others find fat loss to be even greater in females than in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hill et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hill et al., 1985</xref>). CR-induced fat loss has also been noted in young female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fenton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Varady et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zgheib et al., 2014</xref>), albeit in studies that lack males for direct comparison. Several human studies also show no differences in total fat loss with CR, even in younger women who are unlikely to be menopausal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Janssen and Ross, 1999</xref>). What are the reasons for these inconsistent results, and can they further inform the basis for sex differences in the CR response?</p><p>Considering our present findings, one possibility is that, even in younger subjects, age differences might have influenced the outcomes of these CR studies. Indeed, both Janssen et al and Das et al studied women who, while pre-menopausal, were significantly younger than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Janssen and Ross, 1999</xref>). Given that males’ fat loss decreases as they get older (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10H and K</xref>), this disparity could have undermined the ability of these studies to detect sex differences in fat loss. A related, broader issue is that much human CR research has studied females who are over 45 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Musante, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mauriège et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leenen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Evans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wirth and Steinmetz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Parker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Weiss et al., 2006</xref>). This is important because it is the age at which oestrogen levels typically begin to decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Diaz Brinton, 2012</xref>) and after which we demonstrate no sex differences in fat loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10K</xref>). Thus, our findings underscore the importance of properly age-matching males and females, and ideally confirming menopausal status, if the response to CR is to be reliably assessed.</p><p>While age is clearly an important variable, many animal studies still find no resistance to fat loss in young females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fenton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Varady et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zgheib et al., 2014</xref>), even when appropriately age-matched to male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Porter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Valle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Valle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hill et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hill et al., 1985</xref>). Therefore, other factors must also be influencing CR’s sexually dimorphic effects. One possibility is that males show a greater CR response because they are usually heavier and fatter than females at the onset of CR, and thus have more fat available to lose. Consistent with this ‘baseline adiposity’ hypothesis, during CR in rats Hill et al found total fat loss to be greater in young females than young males and, unlike in mice, pre-CR adiposity was greater in the females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hill et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hill et al., 1985</xref>). Moreover, we show that sex differences in baseline adiposity become less pronounced with ageing, such that % fat mass is similar in aged male and female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Therefore, this hypothesis could explain why CR decreases fat mass in the fatter, aged females, whereas young, leaner females resist this effect. However, three key points argue against this hypothesis. Firstly, we show that young females’ resistance to fat loss still occurs in obese and overweight humans, among whom % fat mass is greater in females than in males, irrespective of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is consistent with numerous previous studies of overweight or obese humans, in which CR causes more weight loss and/or fat loss in males than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Redman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Musante, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">O’Neil et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mauriège et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leenen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Evans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wirth and Steinmetz, 1998</xref>). Secondly, in our human study we show that the sex differences in loss of fat or fat-free mass are unrelated to baseline adiposity or BMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, in young, non-obese humans, sex differences in fat loss persist even after controlling for variation in baseline fat and body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, sex differences in the CR response are a not simply a consequence of baseline differences in these parameters.</p><p>A third possibility is that young females’ resistance to weight and fat loss can be overcome if the extent and/or duration of CR is great enough. Our CR protocol involves a 30% decrease in daily caloric intake over 6 weeks. In contrast, those studies reporting fat loss in young females typically used CR of a greater extent and/or duration. For example, Hill et al studied 60% CR for 11 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hill et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hill et al., 1985</xref>) while Valle et al used 40% CR for 14 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Valle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Valle et al., 2007</xref>). Others have tested CR of a similar extent to our studies (20–30%) but for longer durations, ranging from 10 weeks to 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Porter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fenton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>). It is now well established that the CR response is dose and duration dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Speakman and Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cawthorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dionne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhu et al., 2004</xref>), with the former having been systematically investigated in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mitchell et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mitchell et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mitchell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Derous et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, a key goal for future studies will be to determine how sex and age influence these dose- and duration-dependent effects.</p><p>A final important consideration is the distinction between total versus regional adiposity. Indeed, the CALERIE trial finds no sex differences in the loss of total fat mass but does show that, compared to men, women resist loss of trunk fat during CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2017</xref>). This is consistent with our data showing that fat loss in young male mice is greatest for the visceral depots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4G</xref>), and with previous observations for CR in obese humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Redman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leenen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Evans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wirth and Steinmetz, 1998</xref>). Some CR studies may therefore have failed to detect sex differences because they measured only total adiposity, missing out on possible site-specific differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ballor and Poehlman, 1994</xref>). Thus, any studies seeking to fully understand sex differences in CR’s metabolic effects, whether in preclinical models or in humans, should always aim to assess adiposity on both whole-body and regional levels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Basis for young females’ resistance to weight loss and fat loss</title><p>Our studies also shed light on the mechanistic basis for these sex differences. Previous murine CR studies show that females decrease total energy expenditure more than males, possibly resulting from greater suppression of BAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Valle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Valle et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this, we find that CR suppresses energy expenditure more in young females than in young males, at least during the first week of CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). In contrast, CR males and females have similar energy expenditure at week 3 of CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), similar to our previous findings at week 4 of CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Suchacki et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with this, BAT activity is similar between AL and CR mice after 6 weeks of CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, if using indirect calorimetry to understand the CR response, it is important to ensure that the calorimetry analyses coincide with timepoints at which the relevant CR responses occur.</p><p>Another advance over our previous calorimetry studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Suchacki et al., 2022</xref>) is that, by using the higher-sensitivity Promethion system, we were able to measure RER and thereby identify sex differences in lipid metabolism. We find that, compared to CR males, CR females have greater postprandial lipogenesis but lower FA oxidation and lipolysis. This confirms previous observations in male or female mice only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruss et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Varady et al., 2010</xref>) but extends these earlier findings by demonstrating key sex differences in these effects. It is also like the situation in humans, in which CR enhances WAT lipolysis in both sexes and females resist this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mauriège et al., 1999</xref>). Together, these differences in lipid metabolism likely explain why young females resist fat loss during CR. Whether ageing alters these sex differences in lipid metabolism remains to be determined.</p><p>A final consideration is how time of CR feeding influences energy homeostasis. In our morning-fed mice, CR decreases energy expenditure more at nighttime than in the day. In contrast, Dionne et al found that in nighttime-fed mice CR decreases energy expenditure in the day but not at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dionne et al., 2016</xref>). However, both we and Dionne et al show that CR decreases 24 hr energy expenditure, demonstrating that this overall CR effect occurs irrespective of time of feeding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Importance of visceral fat loss for CR’s metabolic effects</title><p>These effects on fat mass and lipid metabolism likely contribute to young females’ resistance to improved glucose homeostasis during CR. Human studies have shown that inefficient WAT lipolysis is associated with impaired glucose metabolism in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arner et al., 2018</xref>) and that, during CR, decreased fat mass is linked to the improvements in insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Larson-Meyer et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, studies of CR or lipectomy in animal models suggest that visceral fat loss contributes to CR’s broader metabolic benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barzilai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gabriely et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Muzumdar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Larson-Meyer et al., 2006</xref>). However, no previous research has investigated if this relationship between fat loss and insulin sensitisation differs between the sexes. Our work therefore supports and extends these previous studies by demonstrating that CR-induced fat loss coincides with improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in males and aged females, whereas young females’ resist these metabolic effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The liver as a key driver of sex differences in glucose tolerance</title><p>Several of our findings highlight the importance of the liver as a key mediator of CR’s sexually dimorphic metabolic effects. Firstly, our PET/CT data show that CR improves glucose tolerance without any marked increases in peripheral glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This includes the BMAT-rich distal tibia, suggesting that, although BMAT has high basal glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Suchacki et al., 2020</xref>), increased BMAT glucose uptake is not required for improved glucose tolerance during CR. Moreover, although CR does increase glucose uptake in WAT and the kidneys, this effect does not differ between males and females and therefore is unlikely to explain the sex differences in glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Together our data are consistent with human studies showing that, in the fasted state, CR does not affect overall glucose disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gazdag et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>); however, CR enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sequea et al., 2012</xref>) and it is possible that this effect differs between the sexes. Our second relevant finding is that, during an OGTT, CR decreases the tAUC but not the iAUC, highlighting decreases in fasting glucose, rather than insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, as the main driver of the improvements in glucose tolerance. Thirdly, we show that CR’s effects on hepatic gene expression differ between young male and female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These transcriptional differences suggest that, during CR, both sexes increase hepatic FA oxidation, but only males increase TCA cycle activity and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). Strikingly, females have higher plasma ketone concentrations, a marker of hepatic acetyl-CoA content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Perry et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these data, our model is that CR males utilise hepatic acetyl-CoA to support the TCA cycle and ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation; in contrast, in CR females the hepatic acetyl-CoA accumulates, thereby stimulating pyruvate carboxylase and promoting gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Consequently, females are better at resisting hypoglycaemia during CR. As discussed below, future studies using metabolic tracers or related approaches will be important to further test these conclusions.</p><p>How is loss of visceral fat linked with these hepatic effects? Visceral adiposity is strongly associated with increased hepatic fat storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), and decreased liver fat coincides with improved insulin sensitivity during CR, both in rats and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Perry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, young female mice resist the decreases in hepatic triglycerides following short-term fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Della Torre et al., 2018</xref>) and prolonged time-restricted feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Piotrowska et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we were surprised to find that CR does not affect hepatic triglyceride content in young mice of either sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This may be because our young AL controls are lean and healthy, and therefore already have livers that are not excessively fatty. In contrast, many of the previous studies investigated CR in animals or humans that are older and/or with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Piotrowska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Perry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>), thereby increasing the baseline/control hepatic fat content. This would not explain why our findings differ to those of Della Torre et al, who studied fasting in young, healthy mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Della Torre et al., 2018</xref>); however, it is perhaps unsurprising that our 6-week CR elicits different effects to those induced during shorter term fasting.</p><p>Our above observations are important because they show that CR can exert metabolic benefits without decreasing hepatic triglyceride content. In contrast, we find that effects on sphingolipids may play a role, with CR altering hepatic sphingolipid content more so in young males than in young females. Here, the effect of diet and/or sex depends on the sphingolipid species concerned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is reminiscent of the findings of Norheim et al, who report sex differences in hepatic ceramide content in mice fed obesogenic diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Norheim et al., 2018</xref>). They further showed that the relationship between ceramides, body fat and insulin sensitivity also differs between males and females, focussing on 16:0 ceramide (C16:0). Indeed, ceramides’ influence on insulin sensitivity depends on the ceramide species. For example, hepatic increases in C16:0 have been implicated with the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaurasia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Turpin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Raichur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Raichur et al., 2019</xref>). This is seemingly at odds with our finding that CR increases hepatic C16:0 in young males but not young females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, unlike in obesity, increased hepatic C16:0 during CR appears to be associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity.</p><p>The rate of conversion of ceramides to DHCs may be a root cause of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). This underscores the concept that the ratio between each ceramide and DHC species may influence metabolic function more than the absolute values of either (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apostolopoulou et al., 2020</xref>). More research is needed to determine how specific ceramide and DHC species, and the ratios thereof, impact sex differences in the health benefits of CR. Despite these remaining questions, our work extends previous observations by revealing that CR’s hepatic effects are sexually dimorphic and that this contributes to the sex differences in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Oestrogen as a modulator of the CR response</title><p>In many cases, young females’ resistance to the metabolic effects of CR is associated with them already being relatively metabolically healthy on an AL diet. For example, young AL females have lower visceral fat mass and are more glucose tolerant than AL males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B–C</xref>), and are similar to CR males and females in terms of fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). We also show that, for most sphingolipid species, the hepatic ceramide:DHC ratio is similar between AL females and CR mice of either sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), while our RNA-seq data show that CR males are more similar to AL females than AL males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These patterns suggest that the mechanisms through which CR decreases visceral adiposity, improves glucose tolerance and modulates sphingolipid metabolism are already at least partially active in young females, even on an AL diet.</p><p>This observation helps to clarify potential mechanisms for CR’s age-dependent sex differences. Sexual dimorphism in metabolic function typically results from sex hormones, with genetic factors and/or developmental programming also playing a role. For example, X-chromosome-linked genetic factors influence sex differences in adiposity independently of sex hormones or other secondary sexual characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mauvais-Jarvis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Link et al., 2020</xref>), while the developmental and neonatal environment causes sexually dimorphic metabolic programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dearden et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is unlikely that these developmental or genetic factors explain the sex differences we observe. Developmental programming is unlikely because the early life environment of our mice was the same for both sexes and was devoid of any adverse or stressful stimuli. Similarly, if X-linked genetic factors were responsible then the sex differences would be expected to persist in aged females, but they mostly do not. This leaves sex steroids as the likely mediator. Consistent with this, oestrogen is now well known to influence metabolic function and the fasting response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mauvais-Jarvis, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Della Torre et al., 2018</xref>), and many actions of oestrogens overlap with those central to the effects of CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wei and Huang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Klinge, 2020</xref>). Indeed, our RNA-seq data show that CR activates oestrogen response pathways in males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), further suggesting commonalities in the effects of oestrogens and CR. Herein, we further show that the sex differences in CR’s metabolic effects are absent or greatly diminished when CR is initiated at 18 months of age, when C57BL/6 females are typically anoestrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gee et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Diaz Brinton, 2012</xref>). Similarly, CR does decrease fat mass in young ovariectomised females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wheatley et al., 2011</xref>), while oestrogen treatment protects male mice from obesity-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dakin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we propose that young females resist the metabolic effects of CR because, through endogenous oestrogen action, they already have high activation of pathways that mediate CR’s metabolic effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations and further considerations</title><p>Our study represents a significant advance in knowledge by revealing that age and sex have a substantial influence over the metabolic benefits of CR. This highlights the need for preclinical and human CR research to address these variables as key determinants of the CR response, a consideration that we show has been lacking in most CR research. We show that these sex differences occur on a systemic, physiological level and that they extend to cellular and molecular effects within adipose tissue and the liver, observations that identify potential mechanisms for the age-dependent sex differences; however, a general limitation of our study is that these mechanisms remain to be directly addressed. Specific limitations are as follows.</p><p>Firstly, we used a feeding regimen common in rodent CR studies, with mice receiving a single ration of diet in the morning. We found that the sex differences persisted when the daily ration was given in the evening, demonstrating that the sexual dimorphism is not specific to a morning-fed regimen. However, such single-ration protocols invoke extensive daily fasting, with mice typically consuming all of the food within ~2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acosta-Rodríguez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Rodríguez et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, they include elements of both CR and of intermittent fasting. Recent studies have shown that such prolonged daily fasting contributes to the metabolic benefits and lifespan extension associated with CR, at least in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acosta-Rodríguez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mitchell et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to determine if these beneficial effects of prolonged fasting, and not just CR per se, also differ between males and females.</p><p>Secondly, regarding insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, it would be informative to use hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps and labelled metabolic tracers to comprehensively assess systemic and hepatic insulin sensitivity and determine if, as we propose, the differences in glucose homeostasis relate primarily to effects on gluconeogenesis and hepatic acetyl-CoA metabolism.</p><p>Thirdly, the role of oestrogen remains to be directly tested. This could be done in mice through ovariectomy studies and/or manipulation of ERα activity. We have also tried to determine oestradiol concentrations in our mouse plasma samples using mass spectrometry, a method required for reliable assessment of sex steroid concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Handelsman and Wartofsky, 2013</xref>). However, despite extensive mass spectrometry optimisation efforts, we have not yet been able to reliably measure oestradiol using the relatively small plasma volumes available. Related to this, in our human studies we were unable to confirm the menopausal status of the female participants. Other limitations of our human studies are that they were done only in overweight or obese individuals; included relatively few younger participants; and lacked analysis of regional adiposity (e.g. visceral versus subcutaneous adipose tissue). These limitations reflect that our human study was not originally designed to directly test the influence of age and sex, with the data instead analysed retrospectively to address this. Future human research must therefore prioritise assessment of menopausal status and regional adiposity, both in lean and overweight/obese subjects, if the outcomes of CR are to be fully interpreted.</p><p>A fourth limitation regards the underlying molecular mechanisms. Pathways implicated in mediating CR’s effects include activation of AMPK, SIRT, IGF-1 and FGF21, modulation of mitochondrial function and inhibition of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Speakman and Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kane et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, genetic, pharmacological and/or other approaches to manipulate these candidate pathways could be used to further dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying CR’s age-dependent sexually dimorphic metabolic effects. Such approaches are a promising basis for future research.</p><p>Beyond these specific limitations, a broader question is whether other effects of CR also differ between males and females in this age-dependent manner. Some research suggests that CR’s effects on cardiovascular function and healthy ageing differ between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ferland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Austad and Bartke, 2015</xref>); however, given the dearth of CR studies that directly assess sex differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) there remains a critical need to determine how age and sex influence the many other outcomes of CR. This is important not only for understanding fundamental biology, but also if we are to translate the benefits of CR, or CR mimetics, to improve human health. For example, if younger women resist many of CR’s health benefits, should any CR-based intervention focus only on older women, who may be more responsive?</p><p>Finally, while it will be useful to understand the extent and basis for these sex differences, it is also important to consider their broader purpose. Adipose tissue profoundly influences female reproductive function, with adipose-secreted factors acting within the central nervous system to indicate if the body’s energy stores are sufficient to support reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohler et al., 2010</xref>). The hormone leptin is the key adipose-derived factor that impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis: if fat mass is too low, for example in anorexia nervosa or lipodystrophy, then leptin levels are also insufficient, resulting in decreased gonadotropin secretion and impaired reproductive capacity. Normal menses resumes in anorexic individuals who regain weight and fat mass, or in lipodystrophic individuals following leptin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bohler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Misra and Klibanski, 2014</xref>). Notably, we previously demonstrated that female mice resist hypoleptinaemia during CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cawthorn et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we speculate that females resist fat loss during CR to preserve reproductive function. Given the tight interplay between adipose tissue and systemic metabolic homeostasis, such resistance to fat loss then has consequences for CR’s other metabolic effects. This evolutionary pressure to overcome periods of food scarcity would thereby have driven the divergence of the CR response in males and females, with implications for current efforts to exploit CR therapeutically to improve human health.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

granted by the UK Home Office. Mice were originally obtained from Charles River (UK) and then bred and aged in-house. They were housed on a 12 hr light/dark cycle in a specific-pathogen-free facility with free access to water and food, as indicated. Data herein are reported according to the ARRIVE guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Percie du Sert et al., 2020</xref>); no checklist is provided, but key details are as follows. Differences in mouse cohorts are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, along with the groups being compared and the experimental unit. The exact number of mice used is stated in the figure legends. Sample sizes for each cohort were determined by power calculations using G*Power software, with effect sizes based on pilot studies and/or previously published data for fat loss and improved glucose tolerance (the primary outcomes being tested) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cawthorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cawthorn et al., 2014</xref>); to increase power, data for young mice are reported across multiple cohorts from at least four separate studies, each of which revealed the same sex differences in CR’s metabolic effects. Mice were randomly assigned to each diet. To minimise potential confounders, such as the order of treatments or measurements, mice were treated or analysed based on the order of their ID number, a variable randomly distributed across the experimental variables (diet and sex). Blinding was not possible during the in vivo experiments because the experimenter(s) can see, based on presence or absence of diet, which mice are AL and which are CR; however, data analysis was done in a blinded manner. Mice were excluded from the final analysis only if there were confounding technical issues or pathologies discovered at necropsy. Ten mice from the young study were excluded from the analysis of OGTT and necropsy tissue masses because of a technical issue during gavaging for the OGTT, which compromised their subsequent food intake. One mouse was excluded from PET/CT data analysis because it accidentally had two doses of FDG administered. One aged mouse was excluded because of developing confounding liver tumours. For some cohorts, specific tissues were not weighed at necropsy and therefore these mice have no data for these readouts.

During this time, mice were fed a control diet (Research Diets, D12450B) ad libitum and daily food intake was determined by weighing the food remaining in each cage each day. Following 1 week of single housing, all mice were randomly assigned to control diet (Research Diets D12450B, provided AL) or the CR diet (Research Diets D10012703, administered at 70% of the average daily AL diet consumption). This CR diet is formulated for iso-nutrition at 70% CR, ensuring that malnutrition is avoided. The evening-fed CR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) were fed daily between 1800 and 1900, while all other CR mice were fed daily between 0900 and 1000.

For the first 2 weeks of CR mice were monitored and weighed daily to ensure they did not lose more than 30% of their initial body mass. For the following 4 weeks of CR, body mass was recorded weekly. Mice were assessed non-invasively for body fat, lean mass, and free fluid weekly from weeks 0 to 6 using TD-NMR (Minispec LF90II; Bruker Optics, Billerica, MA, USA). Blood ketone concentrations were measured from weeks 0 to 4 using a GKI-Bluetooth Blood Glucose &amp; Ketone Meter (Keto-Mojo Europe, Amsterdam, Netherlands). At necropsy, mice were humanely sacrificed via cervical dislocation and decapitation. Tissues were harvested, weighed, and stored either in 4% formalin or on dry ice.

SUVs were calculated for regions of interest, namely BAT, iWAT, gWAT; heart; bone tissue (without BM) from tibiae, femurs, and humeri; To distinguish bone tissue from BM, a calibration curve was generated using HU obtained from the acquisition of a CT tissue equivalent material (TEM) phantom (CIRS, model 091) and mouse CT scans, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Suchacki et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Histology and adipocyte size quantification</title><p>Dissected mouse tissue was fixed for 48 hr and paraffin embedded by the histology core at The University of Edinburgh’s Shared University Research Facilities (SuRF). Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were then sectioned at 100 µm intervals using a Leica RM2125 RTS microtome and collected onto 76x26 mm StarFrost 624 slides (VWR, UK). The slides were baked at 37 °C overnight before Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Quantification of adipocyte number and size was performed on H&amp;E-stained adipose tissue using the ImageJ plug-in Adiposoft, an automated software for the analysis of adipose tissue cellularity in histological sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Galarraga et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>NEFA analysis in plasma samples</title><p>NEFA standard solution (Wako, 270–77000) was serially diluted to concentrations of 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 mM. The standard dilutions, blank sample and plasma (2 μL) were pipetted into separate duplicate wells of a 96-well plate. Reagent 1 (200 μL) (Wako, 434–91795) was added to each well and the plate incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Absorbance of each well was measured at 550 and 660 nm. Reagent 2 (100 μL; Wako, 436–91995) was then added to each well and the plate was incubated again at 37 °C for 5 min and absorbance measured at 550 and 660 nm. The 660 nm reading was subtracted from the 550 reading from both measurements and the mean blank absorbance subtracted from the mean duplicate absorbance from each sample. NEFA concentrations were then determined by regression analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Protein isolation and western blotting</title><p>Frozen WAT samples were lysed in preheated SDS lysis buffer (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.06 M Tris pH 6.8, 12.7 mM ETDA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). After tissue disruption, the lysate was boiled at 95 °C on a dry heat block for 10 min. Boiled lysate was centrifuged at 16,000×<italic>g</italic> and the cleared liquid fraction below the lipid layer and above the pellet was removed to a new tube for downstream analyses. Protein concentration was quantified using the BCA protein assay (Pierce 23225). For SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, lysates were diluted to equal protein concentration in lysis buffer plus 4 X SDS loading buffer (4% SDS, 240 mM Tris-HCL ph6.8, 40% glycerol, 0.276%(w/v) beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Bromophenol blue). Dithiothreitol was added to the lysates (25 mM final concentration). Samples were boiled for 5 min, cooled on ice for 1 min, vortexed, and equal amounts of protein (13 µg per lane) separated on gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Samples were then transferred to Immobilon-FL transfer membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% milk for 1 hr at RT. Membranes were incubated in primary antibodies (Key resources table; each in 5% BSA) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with secondary antibody (Key resources table) at 1:5000 dilution for 1 hr at RT. Fluorescent color was detected with Odyssey CLx Imager (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Band signal was quantified using Image Studio v5.2 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Quantified data obtained from two different membranes were combined by using the strength of the signal of the ladder bands as a control for intensity differences between the two membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Liver ceramide quantification</title><p>Liver ceramide and dihydroceramide content was determined using LC-MS (Lipidomics Core Facility; University of the Highlands and the Islands, Inverness, UK). As per (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Folch et al., 1957</xref>), 100 mg of frozen liver tissue was homogenised in ice-cold MeOH using a mechanical tissue homogeniser. Fifty microlitres of each sample was combined with 100 μL ceramide 17:0 (1 μM in MeOH) and 25 μL dihydroceramide 12:0 (2 μM in MeOH; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) as internal standards. MeOH (1.875 mL) and CHCl<sub>3</sub> (4 mL) were added. Samples were then stored on ice for 1 hr with intermittent vortex mixing, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected. KCl (0.9%; 1.45 mL per sample) was added to the supernatant and the samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The lower phase was collected and evaporated under nitrogen and reconstituted in 1 mL CHCl<sub>3</sub>. Solid phase extraction was performed via a 100 mg/3 mL Isolute silica column (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). The column was conditioned twice with 3 mL CHCl<sub>3</sub> and then loaded with 1 mL of the sample. The bound sample was washed with 2 washes of 3 mL CHCl<sub>3</sub> then eluted with 2 additions of ethylacetate CHCl<sub>3</sub> (1:1 v/v). The collected eluate was evaporated and dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 200 μL MeOH. LC-MS/MS analyses were performed in positive ion mode on a Thermo TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a HESI probe and coupled to a Thermo Accela 1250 UHPLC system. The ceramides and dihydroceramides were separated on a Kinetex C8 HPLC column (1.7 μm; 100×2.1 mm; catalogue number 00D-4499-AN, Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK). Mobile phase A was 90% H<sub>2</sub>O, 9.9% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Mobile phase B was 99.9% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The gradient was held at 80% mobile phase B for 1 min then gradually increased to 100% mobile phase B over 15 min. Mobile phase B at 100% was maintained for 1 min and then equilibrated to storage conditions. The flow rate used was 500 μL per min at 40 °C. Two µL of each sample was injected into the LC-MS/MS for ceramide analysis and 10 μL for dihydroceramide. Total ceramide and dihydroceramide concentrations were calculated from the summed concentrations of all the monitored molecular species. All values were normalised to wet weight of liver. Principal component analysis for ceramide and dihydroceramide data was done using RStudio (RStudio Team, USA), using the code provided (see ‘Data and code availability’, below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>RNA was isolated from tissues using Ribozol solution (cat.

Defining those differences has been relatively straightforward, but understanding the underlying basis for the phenotypic effects continues to be difficult. This paper demonstrates the sex-and age-dependent effects of calorie restriction on adipose tissue and body composition. It then goes further in describing the metabolic distinctions that arise between males and females. As such, this study will open up new opportunities to explore these sex differences and to test the hypothesis that estrogen in younger animals and humans may be at the center of these effects. Furthermore, it provides a basis for determining why weight loss may be difficult for some individuals with calorie-restricted diets.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88080.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Zaidi</surname><given-names>Mone</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04a9tmd77</institution-id><institution>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88080.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General Statements [optional]</p></disp-quote><p>In this study we reveal that, in both mice and humans, the metabolic benefits of caloric restriction (CR) are sex- and age-dependent. Through a systematic review of the literature, we show that sex differences have been largely overlooked by previous CR research, a finding that Reviewer 1 highlights as “an important point”. Our results have critical implications for understanding the fundamental biology linking diet and health outcomes, as well as translational strategies to leverage the therapeutic benefits of CR in humans.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their helpful appraisal of our manuscript, which Reviewer 2 highlights as “a very well written paper”. Reviewer 1 emphasised the translational relevance of our findings and commented on the “systematic” nature of our study. They noted that it “was well performed”, “is a valuable and important contribution to the field”, and “will elicit great interest in the scientific and public readership.” Indeed, the importance of sex as a biological variable was the focus of a recent news feature in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02919-x), underscoring the timeliness and relevance of our findings.</p><p>We hope the Editorial Board will agree on the value and importance of our study, which we have further improved through the revisions described below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of the revisions</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed almost all the reviewers’ points through the revisions described in Section 3. In addition, we have conducted extensive new calorimetry studies using the Promethion CORE system, which is the highest-resolution system available for indirect calorimetry. These new data, along with our lipolysis analyses, explain why females resist weight loss and fat loss during caloric restriction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of the revisions that have already been incorporated in the transferred manuscript</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed all of the reviewers’ major comments, as follows:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>A) The clinical part is definitely the weak spot in the study. I don't think that the data should be omitted, but the authors should be very careful in interpreting the data. Obvious limitations apply to this part, which need to be more directly addressed in the abstract and discussion. It feels like the data from the small-scale clinical trial is exaggerated.</p></disp-quote><p>The clinical study was conducted by Prof Alex Johnstone’s group at the Rowett Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Aberdeen. Her group are experts in the study of dietary interventions for weight loss. The study was conducted to a high standard and therefore we have the utmost confidence in the conclusions drawn from our analysis of this data.</p><p>As we discuss in response to the reviewer’s other points below, the clinical study was primarily designed to address other outcomes and we analysed the data retrospectively to investigate if sex and age affect CR-induced weight and fat loss. This explains some of the limitations that the reviewer mentions, e.g. the relatively low numbers of younger males, and the focus on overweight and obese subjects. As requested, we have now addressed these limitations as follows:</p><p>i. Updated the abstract to clarify that the data are from overweight and obese subjects.</p><p>ii. Updated the results to emphasise that we did a retrospective analysis of CR in overweight and obese subjects (lines 447-448).</p><p>iii. Performed an additional ANCOVA analysis to test if baseline adiposity or BMI contribute to the sex differences in body mass, fat mass or fat-free mass (new Figure 10—figure supplement 1); see Reviewer 1 Major Point D below.</p><p>iv. Updated the ‘Limitations’ section of the Discussion to highlight the retrospective nature of the human study (lines 768-770).</p><p>v. Updated the Methods to again clarify the retrospective nature of the analysis (lines 865-867).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) It is important to mention in the abstract and the discussion that the human data came from obese participants. This might well influence the findings from human data.</p></disp-quote><p>The human subjects were overweight or obese; this was previously stated in the methods section (line 867) and in the discussion (lines 554-556). To further clarify this, we now also mention it in the Abstract (line 62) and have reiterated it in the Discussion (line 766-767). Importantly, the fact that humans still show age-dependent sex differences in fat loss, even when overweight and obese, supports our conclusion that this age effect in mice is not simply a consequence of aged mice being fatter than younger mice. We refer to this as the ‘baseline adiposity’ hypothesis (lines 546-563 of the Discussion). In response to point D below, we have also analysed if the loss of fat mass or fat-free mass is influenced by adiposity or BMI at baseline (pre-CR). Our analyses show that neither of these parameters explain the sex differences in loss of fat mass or fat-free mass (see new Figure 10—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) It is very important to calculate the % calorie restriction of the human participants achieved throughout the CR study. This is crucial information to compare it to other studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Methods (lines 885-889) to explain the basis for the weight loss diet, as follows: “Participants had their basal energy requirements determined and each participant was then fed an individualised diet with a caloric content equivalent to 100% of their resting metabolic rate (Table 3). This approach was taken to standardise the diet to account for individual energy requirements and energy restriction.” We have also updated Table 3 to show the caloric intake for males and females. Note that RMR accounts for ~60-70% of total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) in adults (Martin et al., 2022), so the diet in our study would give a daily caloric deficit of around 30-40% from baseline TDEE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) Since there is quite a wide range in the BMIs of the participants, can the authors also stratify against BMI?</p></disp-quote><p>We have done this against both baseline BMI and against baseline fat mass (the latter to further test the ‘baseline adiposity’ hypothesis). We now present this data in Figure 10—figure supplement 1. We find that, in males but not in females, baseline BMI or fat mass are significantly associated with the changes in fat mass or fat-free mass: surprisingly, individuals with higher baseline fat mass or BMI show less fat loss and a greater loss of fat-free mass during CR. Importantly, males and females do not significantly differ in the relationships between baseline fat mass (or BMI) and loss of fat mass or fat-free mass. This further supports our conclusion that the sex differences in fat loss are unrelated to differences in baseline adiposity. We report this in lines 445-446 of the Results and lines 558-560 of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E) There is no mention of any pre-study registration online of the clinical part (e.g. clinicaltrials.gov). Was this done?</p></disp-quote><p>This study was done before pre-registration was a requirement for clinical trials. We retrospectively analysed the study data to investigate if sex and/or age influence the outcomes. In the updated manuscript we now state this on lines 865-867 of the Methods, as well as in the Results (line 447) and Discussion (lines 768-770).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F) In the methods section the authors write &quot;Participants were informed that the study was funded by an external commercial sponsor…&quot;. This is important information, and this is not mentioned anywhere else in the paper. Can the authors clarify this point? A commercial sponsor would, in my view, qualify for a conflict of interest that needs to be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Declaration of Interests section to clarify this as follows: “The human weight loss study was funded by a food retailer; however, the company had no role in the data analysis, interpretation or conclusions presented in this paper.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>G) How did the authors determine the group sizes for the clinical part? I have some doubts about the sub-group sizes. It would be valuable information if the authors had a statistical analysis plan prior conducting the study. It appears a bit, like the sub-groups were chosen at random, to match findings of the mouse data. Otherwise, there should have been a better allocation within the sub-groups (especially age).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that larger group sizes would have been preferable. This limitation reflects that the study was not originally designed to test age and sex effects on CR outcomes, but instead was analysed retrospectively to investigate the impact of these variables. As mentioned above, we have updated the text of the manuscript to highlight the retrospective nature of the analyses. In the Discussion, under ‘Limitations’, we also highlight the fact that relatively few younger subjects are included in the human study (line 767).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>H) There's a big problem with the age stratification of the male participants in the clinical data. If I'm correct there are only 5 males &lt;45 years. Although this looks intriguing, this can easily be a sampling problem.</p></disp-quote><p>As above, we agree on the limitation of having relatively few males in this &lt;45 group. We used 45 years as the cut-off point because this is the age when, in women, oestrogen levels begin to decline (as was stated in lines 537-539 of the Discussion, and now reiterated in lines 464-465 of the Results). The key data are those for the ANCOVA analysis (Figure 10H; previously Figure 9H) showing that the influence of age on fat loss differs between males and females across all ages; hence, this is not simply an artefact of the &lt;45 vs &gt;45 groupings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I) The applied protocol for CR in mice is known to provoke long fasting phases and probably elicits some effects through fasting alone, rather than the caloric deficit. There are some papers out addressing this (e.g. by deCabo, Lamming). The authors should not dismiss this fact and at least address it in their discussion. Also, given this fact, it would be thoughtful to include a database-search – not only regarding CR – but also regarding various types of intermittent fasting protocols in humans and animal studies (similar to what the authors did in the supplemental figure).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on the importance of highlighting recent studies demonstrating that prolonged daily fasting contributes to the outcomes of typical ‘single-ration’ CR protocols. We have added a new paragraph to the Discussion to address this (Lines 742-751).</p><p>Regarding the second point, we feel that including a new literature search that addresses not only CR, but also intermittent fasting, is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. However, this is a very good idea and would be worth addressing in a future standalone review article. We have also updated our source data to include all data from our literature reviews, to help if other researchers wish to analyse according to fasting duration or other variables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>J) Did the authors monitor the eating time of the mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We have since done this in new cohorts of mice fed using the same CR protocol. We find that the mice consume their food within 2-3 hours, consistent with other CR studies. We have now mentioned this in the Methods section (lines 848-849).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>K) While CR certainly has a lot of health benefits in rodents and humans, it should be advised to raise the cautious note that it may not be beneficial for everyone in the general population. For some groups of people and in some cases (e.g. infectious diseases, pregnancy) even CR with adequate nutritional intake of micro/macronutrients might be disadvantageous. This should be mentioned clearly, as the topic gets more and more &quot;hyped&quot; in public media and online.</p></disp-quote><p>We now highlight this important point in the opening paragraph of the introduction (lines 73-75).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L) There is no indication of how the authors dealt with missing data. Statistically this can be very important, especially in cases with a low number of data points.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Methods section we previously explained (lines 829-830 that “Mice were excluded from the final analysis only if there were confounding technical issues or pathologies discovered at necropsy).” No data had to be excluded from our human study and we have now stated this in the Methods (line 878). For analyses involving paired or repeated-measures data (e.g. time courses of body mass or blood glucose), if data points were missing or had to be excluded for some mice then we used mixed models for the statistical analysis. We have now updated this information in the ‘Statistical analysis’ section of the Methods (lines 1058-1060). Because of the large numbers of mice used in our studies, analyses remain sufficiently well powered even if some data points were missing or had to be excluded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>M) Key data from qPCR should be followed up by western blots or other means. If this was done and there was no effect, the authors should report this. Also, is there any evidence or the possibility to support these findings regarding pck1 and ppara in human samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now used RNA sequencing to comprehensively determine how CR and sex influence the hepatic transcriptome. These data are reported in new Figures 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript. The data identify extensive sex differences in how CR alters hepatic function. Gene set enrichment analysis shows that CR stimulates oxidative phosphorylation and the TCA cycle in males but not in females, even though, in both sexes, there is increased fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, we find that plasma ketone concentrations, a marker of hepatic acetyl-CoA levels, are increased in females compared to males. Thus, our data suggest that CR males use hepatic acetyl-CoA to support the TCA cycle, whereas, in females, acetyl-CoA accumulates, thereby activating pyruvate carboxylase and stimulating gluconeogenesis. These new data substantially improve our manuscript and highlight unexpected sex differences that may underpin the metabolic and health benefits of CR.</p><p>Regarding effects of CR on <italic>PCK1</italic> and <italic>PPARA</italic> expression in human liver samples, no human CR studies have taken liver biopsies for downstream molecular analysis. Recent studies of the GTEx database confirm that hepatic gene expression in humans is highly sexually dimorphic (Oliva et al., 2020). We checked <italic>PCK1</italic> and <italic>PPARA</italic> in the GTEx database and found that, in the liver, each of these transcripts is expressed more highly in females than in males (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/PCK1 and https://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/PPARA). While this is the opposite to what we observe in our ad libitum mice (previous Figure 6A; data now superseded by the RNAseq data), it demonstrates that sex differences in these genes’ hepatic expression do occur in humans. The effect of CR on their hepatic expression, and whether this differs between males and females, remains to be addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>N): I think it would be very valuable to analyse the sex-differences in lipolysis directly in fat tissues. The authors concentrated on differences in hepatic mRNA profiles, but there's an obvious possibility and gap in their story.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have now analysed lipolysis in two ways: firstly, by measuring plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and secondly by measuring phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipose tissue. These data, shown in new Figures 2K-L and Figure 2—figure supplement 3C, confirm that, during caloric restriction, lipolysis is less active in females than in males, which likely contributes to females’ resistance to fat loss. In the Discussion we cite previous research identifying sex differences in adipose lipolysis and lipogenesis and explain how this data fits with our findings (lines 603-609).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>O) Given the relatively low n and sometimes small effect sizes I fear that some of their findings won't be reproduced by other labs. Were the (mouse) data collected all at once in one cohort or did the authors pool data from different cohorts/repeats?</p></disp-quote><p>We presume the reviewer means ‘relatively high n’, as most of our mouse analyses used large group sizes. The mouse data were pooled from across multiple cohorts, with ANOVA confirming that the same sex-dependent CR effects were observed within each cohort. This reproducibility across multiple cohorts is a clear strength of our study because it demonstrates the robustness of our findings. Importantly, the sex differences in fat loss, weight loss and glucose homeostasis were still observed in our much-smaller cohort of evening-fed mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1; n = 5-6), demonstrating that large sample sizes are not needed for other researchers to detect these effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>a) The discussion is very extensive, and I suggest compressing the information presented there to make it more easily readable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed some text that was more speculative, such as the paragraph discussing a possible role for ERalpha. Because of the improved indirect calorimetry analysis, we have also removed the paragraph, under “Limitations”, that explained the limitations of the previous calorimetry studies. We have also revised wording elsewhere to state things more succinctly. However, given the scope of our study we feel we cannot substantially cut down the Discussion without compromising the interpretation of our findings. We note the Reviewer two’s comment that “This is a very well written paper” and feel that attempting to compress the extensive information in the Discussion would compromise, rather than help, the readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) There is some confusion present in the literature regarding the nomenclature of CR/fasting interventions. Recently some reviews have summarized the different forms (e.g. Longo Nature Aging, Hofer Embo Mol Med, …) and the authors should address this briefly. Especially the applied CR intervention in mice overlaps with intermittent fasting.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Discussion (lines 742-751) to explain how our single-ration CR protocol also incurs a prolonged intermittent fast, and how this fast <italic>per se</italic> may contribute to metabolic effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) What was the decision basis for stratifying the human data into &lt; and &gt;45 years?</p></disp-quote><p>We used 45 years as the cut-off point because this is the age when, in women, oestrogen levels begin to decline (this point was stated in lines 537-538 of the Discussion, and we now reiterate it in lines 464-465 of the Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) The part on aging starting in Figure 7 comes quite surprising and it is not clearly linked to the data before. A suggestion here would be to smooth the transition in the text and the authors could again perform a literature search regarding age-of-onset for CR/fasting interventions in mice and humans.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence to smooth the transition to these studies (lines 415-416), linking the rationale to findings from the RNAseq data that is shown in the previous section. We had previously done a literature search to identify the age of onset of CR interventions in mice and humans. We summarise the findings of this search in lines 502-518 and 531-541 of the Discussion. We have also updated the source data so that it includes our review of the CR literature, allowing other researchers to interrogate this data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) At the first mention of HOMA and Matsuda indices, the effect direction should be put into physiological context.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention this in lines 290-291 of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h) There is no mention of how the PCA analyses were conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Methods to explain that the PCA analyses were done using R. We have updated the source data to include the outputs from these analyses, as well as the underlying code. These data and code are now available here https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/3817.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) Were the mice aged in-house in the authors' facility or bought pre-aged from a vendor? Is it known how they were raised? If bought pre-aged, were female and male animals comparable?</p></disp-quote><p>We bred and aged all mice in house. Males and females were littermates from across several cohorts. Therefore, there are no concerns about lack of comparability resulting from environmental differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>j) Very minor note: I think that &quot;focussed&quot; has become very rarely used, even in British English. I don't know about the journal's language standards, but I would switch to the much more common &quot;focused&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated to ‘focused’ as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>k) Figure 6B/F (PCAs) should indicate the % difference of each dimension.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the figures (now Figure 6D) to show the % variance accounted for by each principal component; this has also been done for the RNAseq data in new Figure 7A. We have also updated the figure legends to specify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l) Limitations section: Maybe tone down on &quot;world-leading mass spec facility&quot;. This sounds like an excuse and this statement is unsupported and doesn't add anything valuable to the section. Other limitations would include the low n, as mentioned above and the mono-centric fashion of the mouse and human experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these points as follows:</p><p>– Toned down the description of our mass spec facility (they are renowned for expertise in steroid hormone analysis, so we our original text was intended to highlight that our facility are not novices for this).</p><p>– Regarding the low n for some of the human groups, we now highlight this on line 767 of the Discussion.</p><p>– We have added a new paragraph to the Discussion (lines 742-751) explaining the limitations of our CR protocol, i.e. that includes elements of both CR and intermittent fasting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>Point 1: This is a very well written paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this kind comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2: Since the authors fed the animals in the morning, this is likely the reason for energy expenditure to be different in the CR vs ad lib groups. Although the authors do study the effects of night v day feeding and saw no change in the outcomes regarding weight, this fact I think should be mentioned somewhere. Also, figure 4A is expressed a W while all the other graphs are in kJ. I think it would be nice to see it all consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the first point, we agree that time of feeding can influence when energy expenditure is altered, but most studies show that CR decreases overall energy expenditure regardless of time of feeding. For example, Dionne et al. studied the effects of CR on energy expenditure, administering the CR diet during the night phase (Dionne et al., 2016). They found that CR mice have lower energy expenditure in the day but not in the night (Figure 3C in their paper), which is the opposite to our findings (previous Figure 4C; new figures 3A-B). However, total energy expenditure in their study remains decreased with CR. This goes against the reviewer’s suggestion that feeding the animals in the morning “is likely the reason for energy expenditure to be different in the CR vs ad lib groups”. We have updated our manuscript (Lines 611-616) to clarify this.</p><p>Regarding the second point, in our new figure 3 we use consistent units (kcal, or kcal/h) for all energy expenditure data. The figure legend also reflects this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3: For all the graphs, can you make the CR groups bold and not filled as it is hard to see the lighter colours.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the graphs so that the CR groups are represented by solid lines, rather than dashed lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 4: I know many investigators use them, but I am not sure how relevant HOMA-IR and the Matsuda index are in mice since they were specifically designed for humans.</p></disp-quote><p>The issue of whether it is correct to use HOMA-IR and/or Matsuda index in mice is often debated in the metabolism field. Importantly, we are not using the absolute values for HOMA-IR or Matsuda in the same way that they are used in humans; instead, we are comparing the relative values between groups because these are still physiologically meaningful. We discussed this with Dr Sam Virtue, an expert in mouse metabolic phenotyping (Virtue and Vidal-Puig, 2021), who agrees on their usefulness in this way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 5: Something also to note is the fact that all the glucose uptake data is under basal conditions. Just because there are no differences in the basal state does not mean that there are no differences after a meal/during an insulin stimulation. I think that this needs to be discussed and the muscle and fat not completely discounted as a player in the differences seen.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that CR can enhance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, but our OGTT data suggest that it is effects on fasting glucose, rather than insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, that contribute to the sex differences we observe. We have now updated the Discussion (lines 642-645) as follows, “CR enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (83) and it is possible that this effect differs between the sexes. Our second relevant finding is that, during an OGTT, CR decreases the tAUC but not the iAUC, highlighting decreases in fasting glucose, rather than insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, as the main driver of the improvements in glucose tolerance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of analyses that authors prefer not to carry out</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>Major point I: … it would be thoughtful to include a database-search – not only regarding CR – but also regarding various types of intermittent fasting protocols in humans and animal studies (similar to what the authors did in the supplemental figure).</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that including a new literature search that addresses not only CR, but also intermittent fasting, is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. However, this is a very good idea and would be worth addressing in a future standalone review article. To assist with this, we have updated the source data to include all details of the literature review presented in Figure 1. The link to the source data is provided in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor point c: The order of the subpanels in Figure 9 (and other figures where B is below A and so on) is confusing. Please rearrange or indicate in a visual way which panels belong to each other.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree that the order of subpanels in Figure 9 (now Figure 10) is confusing: the panels are clearly labelled, and we find it most logical to have the absolute values shown in the top row (panels A, C and E), with the corresponding graphs of fold changes shown beneath each of these (panels B, D and F). This allows the reader to quickly compare the absolute vs fold-change data for each readout. If we had panels A-C on the top row and D-F on the second row, then the connection between graphs 10C and 10D would be less clear and comparable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor point d: Did the authors also measure cardiovascular (e.g. blood pressure) parameters? There is some evidence out there that there is an age/sex dependency during fasting/CR. This would be a nice add-on to the rather small clinical data here.</p></disp-quote><p>We did measure various cardiovascular parameters for our mice but find, unlike for the metabolic outcomes, these generally don’t show sex or age differences. In our human study we measured blood pressure and heart rate before starting CR and at weeks 3 and 4 post-CR. For this response to reviewers we have summarized these human data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. The data show that CR decreases blood pressure and heart rate in males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A-E</xref>). In the younger age group (&lt;45 years) the decrease in systolic blood pressure is greater in females than in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1J</xref>) and the changes in heart rate over time also differ between the sexes, irrespective of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1F</xref>). However, unlike for the effects on fat mass or fat-free mass (now shown in Figure 10H-I; previously Figure 9), across all subjects ANCOVA reveals no age-sex interactions in these cardiovascular effects.</p><p>We have decided to not include these data in the current study because we feel it is already extensive and is focused on metabolic outcomes. We instead plan to report the cardiovascular outcomes (from both humans and mice) in a separate paper.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of CR on cardiovascular parameters in humans (related to Figure 10).</title><p>Twenty male and twenty-two female volunteers participated in a weight loss study involving a 4-week dietary intervention, as described for Figure 9. (A-F) Systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP and heart rate were recorded at weeks 0, 3 and 4. Data are shown as absolute values (A,C,E) or fold-change relative to baseline (B,D,F). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Significant effects of time, sex, and time*sex interaction were assessed using 2-way ANOVA. (G-I) Simple linear regression of age vs fold-change (<italic>week 4 vs week 0)</italic> in systolic BP (G), diastolic BP (H) and heart rate (I). For each sex, significant associations between age and outcome (fold-change) are indicated beneath each graph as ‘<italic>P,</italic> Slope’. ANCOVA was further used to test if the age-outcome relationship differs significantly between males and females. ANCOVA results are reported beneath each graph as ‘<italic>P,</italic> Slope’ and ‘<italic>P,</italic> Intercept’ for males vs females (M vs F). In (G), similar slopes but different intercepts show that sex significantly influences changes in systolic BP, but the influence of age does not differ between the sexes. In (H,I) neither slopes nor intercepts differ significantly between males and females, indicating that the age-outcome relationship is similar between the sexes. (J-L) Fold-change (week 4 vs week 0) in systolic BP (J), diastolic BP (K) and heart rate (L) for males vs females separated into younger (&lt;45 years) and older (&gt;45 years) groups. Data are presented as violin plots overlaid with individual data points. Significant effects of age, sex, and age*sex interaction were assessed using 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. Overall <italic>P</italic> values for each variable, and their interactions, are shown beneath each graph. Significant differences between comparable groups are indicated by ** (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88080-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>References:</p><p>Dionne, D.A., Skovso, S., Templeman, N.M., Clee, S.M., and Johnson, J.D.
