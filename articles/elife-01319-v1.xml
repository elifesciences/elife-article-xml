these responses throughout the cell. Mechanistic understanding of this process is hampered by limited structural information on these macromolecular complexes. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) spatially constrain phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA). Electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions of type-II PKA-AKAP18γ complexes reveal hetero-pentameric assemblies that adopt a range of flexible tripartite configurations. Intrinsically disordered regions within each PKA regulatory subunit impart the molecular plasticity that affords an ∼16 nanometer radius of motion to the associated catalytic subunits. Manipulating flexibility within the PKA holoenzyme augmented basal and cAMP responsive phosphorylation of AKAP-associated substrates. Cell-based analyses suggest that the catalytic subunit remains within type-II PKA-AKAP18γ complexes upon cAMP elevation. We propose that the dynamic movement of kinase sub-structures, in concert with the static AKAP-regulatory subunit interface, generates a solid-state signaling microenvironment for substrate phosphorylation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01319.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01319.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01319.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>It was once thought that proteins needed to have structures that were both ordered and stable, but this view was changed by the discovery that certain proteins contain regions that are disordered and flexible. In some cases these regions of intrinsic disorder help the protein to function by linking more stable regions that are active. However, in other proteins the disordered regions are themselves biologically active and can, for example, function as enzymes.</p><p>Protein kinase A is a family of enzymes that contains both ordered and disordered regions, with the ordered sections being involved in phosphorylation, a chemical process that is widely used for communication within cells. However, in order to initiate phosphorylation, these kinases must be anchored to a rigid substrate nearby, so a second group of proteins called AKAPs–which is short for A-kinase anchoring proteins–hold the kinases in place by binding to their disordered regions. These AKAPs also help the kinases to dock with other molecules involved in phosphorylation.</p><p>A full structural picture of how the kinases induce phosphorylation has yet to be obtained, partly because it is extremely difficult to determine the structure of the disordered regions within the kinases. Moreover, the AKAPs are also disordered, which makes it difficult to work out how the kinases are held in position.</p><p>Smith, Reichow <italic>et al.</italic> have used electron microscopy to reveal that the disordered region has two important roles: it determines how far away from the anchoring protein that the active region of the kinase can operate, and it influences how efficiently the kinase can bind to its target molecule in order to induce phosphorylation. Future challenges include investigating how the inherent flexibility of AKAP complexes contribute to the efficient phosphorylation of physiological targets.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01319.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01319.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>A-kinase anchoring protein </kwd><kwd>cAMP signaling</kwd><kwd>single particle reconstruction</kwd><kwd>cAMP-dependent kinase</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>intrinsic disorder</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>F Donelson</given-names></name><name><surname>Reichow</surname><given-names>Steve L</given-names></name><name><surname>Esseltine</surname><given-names>Jessica L</given-names></name><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name><name><surname>Langeberg</surname><given-names>Lorene K</given-names></name><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name><name><surname>Gonen</surname><given-names>Tamir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL088366, GM48231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>F Donelson</given-names></name><name><surname>Esseltine</surname><given-names>Jessica L</given-names></name><name><surname>Langeberg</surname><given-names>Lorene K</given-names></name><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural analysis of an AKAP18-protein kinase A complex reveals that regions of intrinsic disorder impact the phosphorylation of preferred substrates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins are widespread in nature, yet the mechanistic roles they play in biology are underappreciated. Such disordered segments can act simply to link functionally coupled structural domains or they can orchestrate enzymatic reactions through a variety of allosteric mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dyson and Wright, 2005</xref>). The regulatory subunits of protein kinase A provide an example of this important phenomenon where functionally defined and structurally conserved domains are connected by intrinsically disordered regions of defined length with limited sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scott et al., 1987</xref>). In this study, we show that this seemingly paradoxical amalgam of order and disorder permits fine-tuning of local protein phosphorylation events.</p><p>Phosphorylation of proteins is a universal means of intracellular communication that is tightly controlled within the spatial context of the cell. A variety of stimuli trigger these events, which are catalyzed by numerous protein kinases and reversed by phosphoprotein phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hunter, 1995</xref>). A classic example is production of the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP), which stimulates a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to phosphorylate a range of cellular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>). The PKA holoenzyme is a tetramer composed of two regulatory subunits (R) and two autoinhibited catalytic subunits (PKAc). Binding of cAMP to each R subunit is believed to liberate active kinase and phosphorylation ensues. The local action of PKA is dictated by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that impose spatial constraint by tethering this kinase in proximity to substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wong and Scott, 2004</xref>). AKAPs also organize higher-order macromolecular signaling complexes through their association with G-protein coupled receptors, GTPases and additional protein kinases. Likewise, AKAP-associated phosphatases and phosphodiesterases act to locally terminate these signals. While physiological roles for AKAPs that sequester enzymatic activity with ion channels, cytoskeletal components and regulatory enzymes have been well established, the structural mechanisms involved in these protein–protein interactions have been difficult to characterize.</p><p>Currently, structural details on PKA anchoring are limited because most AKAPs are large, intrinsically disordered macromolecules that lack recognizable structural domains. An exception is the crystal structure of the central domain of AKAP18γ that bears homology to bacterial 2H phosphoesterase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gold et al., 2008</xref>). Likewise, high-resolution crystallographic structures of the catalytic subunit (PKAc) when free and in complex with the C-terminal autoinhibitory and cAMP binding domains of the type I or type II regulatory subunits of PKA (RI and RII) have provided details on the mechanisms of catalysis and autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knighton et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gold et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Yet, despite decades of effort, a complete structural picture of the PKA holoenzyme is lacking. This is presumably due to the presence of long flexible intrinsically disordered linker regions within the R subunit that tether this complex. NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallographic studies show that the N-terminal domains of RI and RII homodimerize through a four-helix bundle docking and dimerization interface (D/D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Newlon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gold et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kinderman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sarma et al., 2010</xref>). The D/D creates a high-affinity binding groove for a canonical amphipathic helix on each AKAP that forms the reciprocal binding surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gold et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although the physiological consequences of anchored PKA phosphorylation events have been established in a variety of cellular contexts, we have yet to discern how the individual protein components are assembled and operate within AKAP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scott and Pawson, 2009</xref>). Even more elusive is a mechanistic role for intrinsically disordered domains within these macromolecular assemblies. For example, does internal flexibility within these signaling assemblies modulate other aspects of enzyme action in addition to sequestering PKA at specific regions of the cell? Here we have used electron microscopy (EM) to evaluate the topological arrangement of the fully assembled type IIα PKA holoenzyme when anchored to AKAP18γ. This analysis unveils a remarkable level of conformational plasticity that resides within the AKAP–PKA complex. In vitro and cell-based structure-function approaches reveal an unexpected functional requirement for intrinsically disordered regions within RIIα. These regions not only define a radius of action of the anchored catalytic subunit but also modulate the enzymatic efficiency of the kinase. Insights from these studies may be broadly applicable to the understanding of other intrinsically disordered proteins and anchoring complexes that organize enzymatic action in the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Macromolecular assemblies were formed when purified human γ isoform of AKAP18 (AKAP18γ) was incubated with the PKA holoenzyme (PKA<sub>holo</sub>), formed by the RIIα and PKAc subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’).

Single particle analysis revealed clusters of three densities, each approximately 60–100 Å in size resembling beads on a string (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Closer inspection of individual particles established that these tripartite structures adopted a range of conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In solution, these complexes may adopt many more configurations and flattening on the carbon support of the EM grid likely captured only a subset of the possible topologies. Approximately 7,000 particles were selected from electron micrographs for structural analysis. Projection averages were derived by classifying particles of similar orientation and structural conformation using reference-free multivariate statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Heel et al., 1996</xref>), and iterative stable alignment and clustering procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). Class averages revealed a remarkable variety of configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). These ranged from a tightly packed pseudo-symmetric triangular configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, left panel) to a fully extended linear configuration of the three densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, right panel). In either case, the central density was consistently smaller (∼60 Å) than the two peripheral densities (85 × 100 Å). Similar size differences between the central and peripheral lobes were observed at the single particle level in raw micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Affinity-labeling of strep-tagged AKAP18γ with a 5 nm gold particle targeted the smaller central density, indicating that this element includes the anchoring protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, inset).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-01319-media1.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01319.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Conformational dynamics of the wild-type AKAP18γ–PKA holoenzyme complex.</title><p>A montage of projection averages obtained for the wild-type AKAP18γ–PKA holoenzyme complex displays the variety of topological configurations sampled by the dynamic signaling particle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01319.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01319.004</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions for the triangular and linear configurations of the AKAP18γ–PKA<sub>holo</sub> complex were determined at 35 Å resolution from a tilted-series dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). Negative staining in EM can cause flattening of particles, which might lead to apparent structural distortions. However, inspection of particles at various tilt angles showed that particles of linear and triangular conformations remained clearly distinguishable, even at high tilt angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In both 3D reconstructions, a central mass with dimensions of 60 × 60 × 80 Å (corresponding to the site of AKAP18γ as demonstrated by affinity gold labeling, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, black triangle and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, inset) was flanked on either side by larger densities of 100 × 100 × 85 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These flanking densities can each accommodate a sub-complex of RIIα and PKAc. In the triangular conformation, the two peripheral densities are oriented at a 100° angle with respect to the central density and exhibit an end-to-end length of ∼300 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top). The end-to-end length increases to ∼385 Å in the extended linear configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom). Back-projections calculated from the final 3D maps compare well with the experimental class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, this back-projection analysis demonstrated that when the triangular model is tilted completely on its edge (where it may appear more linear in projection) its dimensions (max length = 300 Å) are significantly smaller than the maximum end-to-end length obtained for the linear reconstruction (max length = 385 Å). Hence, we conclude that the linear and triangular conformations are structurally distinct.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01319.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>3D reconstructions and pseudo-atomic structure of the AKAP18γ–PKA<sub>holo</sub> complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three-dimensional (3D) EM reconstructions and 90° rotated views of the fitted molecular models for the AKAP18γ–PKA<sub>holo</sub> complex.

We propose that conformational plasticity observed in these analyses is facilitated by this intrinsically disordered region between residues 44 and 90 of RIIα, a linker that connects the AKAP docking site (D/D domain) to the cAMP-responsive transduction domains. This notion is further substantiated by a primary sequence analysis of RIIα orthologs, showing that the linker regions are of similar length but exhibit low amino acid identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01319.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Flexibility within RIIα constrains the configuration of the anchored kinase assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Amino acid sequence alignment of the linker region in RIIα that connects the conserved N-terminal D/D domain to the C-terminal autoinhibitor and cAMP binding domains.

This structural postulate was tested by producing modified AKAP18γ–PKA<sub>holo</sub> complexes in which the linker region of RIIα was deleted (RIIα Δ44–86) or replaced with an extended sequence of 60 residues found in zebrafish (RIIα ZeChimera; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Formation of modified AKAP–PKA complexes (assembled as described above) was monitored by Coomassie blue staining and immunoblot detection of the component proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The conformations of these modified AKAP18γ–PKA<sub>holo</sub> complexes were analyzed by electron microscopy as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>). Single-particle EM and class averages of the assemblies formed with RIIα Δ44–86 yielded uniform complexes exclusively in a compact triangular configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>). In contrast, complexes formed with RIIα ZeChimera resembled the array of conformations observed for the wild-type AKAP18γ–PKA<sub>holo</sub> assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,G</xref>). Quantitative analysis of the differing linker lengths was assessed by measuring the radius of each particle, defined by the center of the AKAP18γ subunit to the distal end of each PKA subunit. Particle radii for the RIIα Δ44–86 complexes ranged in length from 55 to 125 Å, (mean value of 87 ± 13 Å, n = 142; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) whereas the assemblies formed with the RIIα ZeChimera were extended with lengths ranging from 100 to 265 Å (mean value of 168 ± 33 Å, n = 296; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). These latter measurements are similar to the parameters of the native complex, (160 ± 29 Å, n = 216; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2D and 3D</xref>). Thus we conclude that a flexible linker in RIIα is responsible for the conformational plasticity of the AKAP18γ–PKA<sub>holo</sub> assemblies.</p><p>One mechanistic ramification of our structural analyses is that flexibility within PKA<sub>holo</sub> complex could permit precise orientation of the anchored catalytic subunit toward substrates. This would be particularly true for substrates that are physically associated with AKAPs. For example, the type 4 phosphodiesterase isoforms PDE4D3 and PDE4D5 associate with the central domain of AKAP18γ and are phosphorylated on two sites by PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sette and Conti, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carlisle Michel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stefan et al., 2007</xref>). We confirmed this protein–protein interaction upon co-expression of the components in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). PDE4Ds co-precipitate with AKAP18γ and the RII subunits of PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 1) but not with GFP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 2). Accordingly, cAMP phosphodiesterase activity was enriched 3.27 ± 0.48-fold (n = 5) in AKAP18γ–GFP immune complexes as compared to GFP controls or samples treated with the PDE4 selective inhibitor rolipram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Our structural data predict that the C subunit of anchored PKA resides within ∼100 Å of its substrate PDE4D (shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We reasoned that this tight configuration could permit cAMP-independent phosphorylation of the phosphodiesterase. Therefore, in the first phase, ‘basal’ phosphorylation of PDE4D was measured in the context of the AKAP18γ signaling complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Phosphate incorporation into PDE4D was increased 1.87 ± 0.14-fold (p&lt;0.05) upon its tethering to AKAP18γ as assessed by autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E</xref>). This suggests that the proximity to a substrate afforded by AKAP18γ augments the cAMP-independent action of PKA. This could explain why physiologically relevant PKA targets such as aquaporins or phospholamban, which require continual or instantaneous phosphorylation to fulfill their biological roles, have their own AKAP-associated pool of kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Henn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lygren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gold et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, a primary function of AKAPs may be to ensure basal phosphorylation of such tethered substrates.</p><p>In the second phase, experiments were conducted using higher-order complexes formed with wild-type RIIα, RIIα Δ44–86, or the RIIα ZeChimera (assembled as described above) to investigate whether manipulating the intrinsic flexibility of PKA altered phosphorylation of anchored PDE4D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). We measured cAMP-independent phosphorylation of PDE4D at 5 min, a time point that showed sub-maximal substrate phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Basal PDE4D phosphorylation was enhanced 1.97 ± 0.18-fold (n = 6, p&lt;0.05) in complexes formed with RIIα Δ44–86 when compared to a wild-type complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, bars 1 and 4). In contrast, extension of the linker region in the context of AKAP18γ–RIIα ZeChimera PKA<sub>holo</sub> assembly had no effect as compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, bars 1 and 7). Control experiments confirmed that addition of cAMP further augmented phosphorylation of PDE4D in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, lanes 2, 5 and 8) and pretreatment with PKI inhibitor peptide abolished anchored kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, lanes 3, 6 and 9). These data show that the AKAP can be thought of as a catalyst that physically brings the reactants together, and the flexibility within the anchored PKA holoenzyme allows for the precise orientation of the enzyme and substrate. This mechanism may be particularly relevant for cAMP-independent phosphorylation events that are believed to represent approximately 30% of PKA action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, this hitherto unexplained but critical component of cellular PKA activity may be accomplished by the persistent phosphorylation of substrates embedded in higher-order AKAP signaling assemblies.</p><p>To follow these in vitro studies, we tested our hypothesis that flexibility within the anchored PKA holoenzyme influences cAMP signaling in living cells. We generated a modified fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based PKA activity sensor using the A-kinase activity reporter (AKAR2) backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Our modified sensor (AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub>) was constructed by fusing the PKA binding helix of AKAP18 (18<sub>RBS</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fraser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gray et al., 1998</xref>) to the amino terminus of AKAR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This genetically encoded reporter detects PKA phosphorylation in real-time by monitoring changes in the YFP/CFP emission ratio inside cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As a prelude to these studies AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> association with wild-type RIIα or either of the modified RIIα constructs was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of each complex from HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In parallel, immunoblot and confocal fluorescent imaging analyses confirmed that mCherry tagged versions of each RIIα form were expressed to equivalent levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and uniformly distributed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01319.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Flexibility within the anchored PKA holoenzyme impacts cAMP responsive signaling inside cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the modified AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> FRET reporter used in these studies.

Notable increases in AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> FRET were evident in cells expressing RIIα wild type or the RIIα ZeChimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,G</xref>). In both the cases the normalized FRET ratio was maximal at 200 s and gradually declined over the remainder of the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, black and orange traces). This latter phenomenon may be attributed to either desensitization of the β-AR system or dephosphorylation of the reporter by phosphoprotein phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bouvier et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pitcher et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Violin et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, cells expressing the more compact RIIα Δ44–86 form responded more rapidly and robustly to isoproterenol with a maximal FRET response at 200 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,H</xref>, green trace). The RIIα Δ44–86 effect was abolished when control experiments were performed with a proline modified AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> derivative that is unable to anchor PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fraser et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gray et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Other control experiments established that application of isoproterenol did not stimulate an AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> derivative (T/A) where the threonine phospho-acceptor was replaced with alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, inset, red trace).</p><p>Scatter plot representation of the Iso stimulated FRET responses at 200 s reveal that AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub>-PKA complexes formed with RIIα or the RIIα ZeChimera responded with similar magnitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, black and orange). In contrast, the normalized FRET responses of the more compact and less flexible AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub>-PKA complexes formed with RIIα Δ44–86 were significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, green, p&lt;0.001). Taken together, these cell-based studies indicate that removal of the flexible linker region in RIIα augments cAMP-responsive PKA phosphorylation of AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> inside the cells. These findings complement the interpretation of our EM reconstructions and in vitro phosphorylation studies. These observations argue that compact and rigid AKAP–PKA assemblies enhance kinase action within the immediate vicinity of the substrate.</p><p>Local activation of PKA is believed to involve dissociation of the C subunits from the R subunit dimer. Yet, cAMP binds to the R subunits avidly (K<sub>D</sub> 6–8 nM), and its rate of release is so slow that it is not readily apparent how the cAMP-binding sites turnover within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Poppe et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, there is a report that cAMP can activate PKA without C subunit release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated whether cAMP stimulation altered the composition of PKA holoenzymes associated with the AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> reporter. Interestingly, both the RII and C subunits of PKA were present in AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> immune complexes, even after stimulation of cAMP production by isoproterenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). The isoproterenol-stimulated activation of PKA was validated by immunoblot detection of phosphorylated substrates with a phospho-PKA site antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, bottom panel). Control experiments confirmed that PKA subunits did not associate with the proline-modified AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> derivative, whereas the AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub>-T/A reporter retained the ability to anchor PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, lanes 3–6).</p><p>This AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub> reporter data raised the question of whether anchoring can stabilize the PKA holoenzyme even in the presence of cAMP. To further test this hypothesis, co-precipitation experiments were repeated with full-length AKAP18γ. Again the C subunit was retained within the AKAP complex upon isoproterenol stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). This occurred regardless of whether the PKA holoenzymes were formed with wild-type RIIα, RIIα Δ44–86, or RIIα ZeChimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, top panel). These results confirm that the increased agonist-stimulated activity of the AKAR-18<sub>RBS</sub>–RIIα Δ44–86 complex shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref> is not due to enhanced dissociation of the PKA catalytic subunit. A broader implication is that release of the C subunit from anchored PKA holoenyzmes may not be required for the phosphorylation of nearby substrates. Under this scenario, association with AKAPs limits and thereby defines the range of kinase action within the cell. This underscores the central role of AKAPs in the governance of cAMP responsive phosphorylation events.</p><p>A combination of steric effects and environmental factors may explain the enhanced catalytic efficiency of this condensed AKAP–PKA assembly inside cells. For example, the less flexible RIIα Δ44–86 dimer may constrain the PKAc subunits in a manner that minimizes the distance to their target substrate. Moreover, the more compact AKAP-PKAΔ44-86-substrate assembly may augment kinase activity by inhibiting the actions of signal termination enzymes. This could involve the steric exclusion of cellular protein phosphatases that catalyze the removal of phosphate or protection from phosphodiesterase activity that metabolizes cAMP. Deletion of the flexible linker between residues 44–86 of RIIα not only enhances basal phosphorylation of these anchored substrates, but also supplements the catalytic efficiency of the anchored PKA holoenzyme in this cellular context. However, this enhanced anchored kinase action may be an undesirable feature in vivo. Hence, we propose that the evolution of flexible linkers in RII may be a means to ensure bi-directional regulation of phosphorylation events by signal termination enzymes.</p><p>It is noteworthy that extending the number of residues in the RIIα ZeChimera linker had little effect on the overall structure of the AKAP-PKA complex, or on the activity of PKA monitored by our in vitro and cell-based assays. According to our structural analysis, this construct samples a range of radial conformations that are very similar to wild-type particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Moreover, this observation is consistent with theoretical analyses of random coiled chain models that demonstrate the average end-to-end length of random coil scales by the square root of the number of amino acids in the chain (average length ∼ <italic>N</italic><sup>0.5</sup>, where <italic>N</italic> is the number of residues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Flory, 1975</xref>). This statement implies that the average length separating the ends of a random coil reaches a plateau, or maximum, that is only marginally altered upon the inclusion of more residues. Consequently extending the linker in the context of the RIIα ZeChimera may explain why this affords minimal benefit to the overall structure and dynamics of this seemingly more extended and malleable anchored enzyme complex. Hence, evolutionary constraint of the RIIα linker domain to 45–47 residues may ensure appropriate separation between the anchoring and transduction domains of anchored mammalian PKA holoenzymes.</p><p>Another key element of our model is that the array of conformations adopted by the anchored RII subunit dimer defines a ‘radius of action’ for the tethered catalytic subunit. Not only does this structural plasticity explain why an intact PKA holoenzyme structure has eluded X-ray crystallographers for over 20 years but also suggests that the ‘built in’ flexibility within this protein complex sets a dynamic range for basal and cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of nearby substrates. This latter concept could have profound implications for PKA and other kinases, where enzyme activity is constrained within anchored complexes or enzyme scaffolds. The conformational variability of the tethered complex could enhance kinase access to multiple phosphorylation sites on the same substrate, or, alternatively, orient each catalytic subunit toward distinct substrate proteins within the vicinity of the scaffolding site. Our structural and cellular characterization of higher-order AKAP assemblies emphasizes how static protein–protein interactions act in concert with the dynamic movement of sub-structures to orchestrate local phosphorylation events. We believe that these combined molecular approaches are broadly applicable for the investigation of related enzyme complexes that are spatially organized within the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>RIIα and PKAc were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was transformed with pET28b-RIIα-6xHis (encoding full-length RIIα, accession NM_008924) or pET15a-6xHis-mPKAc (Addgene plasmid 14921; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.addgene.org/">www.addgene.org</ext-link>), encoding full-length mouse PKA catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Narayana et al., 1997</xref>) and grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers have discussed their comments and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments. Please respond to these comments by email to let us know how you intend to prepare a revised manuscript, rather than actually preparing a revised manuscript at this stage.</p><p>AKAP proteins play an important role in anchoring PKA and other kinases allowing targeted regulatory phosphorylation. There has been rather little structural information on AKAP complexes. New structural data has the potential to provide significant new insights into the mechanisms of this and related systems. Here, the authors have purified a complex corresponding to a single AKAP18γ molecule together with two copies of the PKA RIIα subunit and two PKAc subunits. The complex was subjected to negative stain electron microscopy and single particle analysis. The authors identify a tripartite architecture for the complex with the AKAP protein located centrally in close association with two dimerization interface domains of the RII subunits. Conversely, the two PKAc subunits closely associated with the cAMP binding domains of the RII subunits are mapped to the peripheral densities. The authors provide biochemical data to support the conclusion that the architecture of the AKAP complex contributes to PKA-mediated phosphorylation dynamics.</p><p>The present analysis of the electron microscope data should be expanded and improved to justify the authors' conclusions (points 1–2). There are also concerns about the biochemical analysis presented (points 3–5).</p><p>1) A major conclusion of the paper is that the complex is highly flexible, adopting conformations which range from triangular to linear configurations and that this flexibility serves to allow catalytic interaction with a range of potential substrates. The concept of a highly flexible complex is initially introduced in interpreting the appearance of raw images and class averages of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). However, variations in appearance of such projection images can in principle arise from either conformational variability or from projections of the three-dimensional structure in different directions. The 2D analysis of the projection images does to not appear to be optimal. The class averages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> appear to be over-averaged with quite low levels of detail – in comparison there appear to be significant details in the original images that are not recovered in the class averages. A more powerful classification procedure such as the ISAC program developed in the Penzcek lab may result in higher-quality class averages and aid the analysis.</p><p>2) The authors use the angular reconstitution approach to calculate 3D structures for the complex in extended and linear conformations using tilted images. This provides stronger evidence for the existence of multiple conformations. However, there is a significant concern here with respect to the analysis of tilted negatively stained images. Although the negative stain approach yields relatively faithful images at zero tilt, it is typically associated with substantial shrinkage normal to the surface of the grid. Hence tilted images are commonly distorted from their proper projection structures. This could lead, for example, to the apparent linearization of a triangular conformation. Careful analysis of untilted images exploiting the most effective classification approaches should make it possible to recover a sufficient range of projections from untilted images for 3D analysis.</p><p>3) The in vitro phosphorylation studies imply that the major role of RIIα linker is on basal (not PKA-stimulated) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, the in vivo reporter analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) does not appear to show changes in basal activity, but does show changes in stimulated activity. How do the authors reconcile these findings? These observations require some explanation because they lie at the heart of the authors' conclusions.</p><p>4) Controls should be included in the in vivo analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). What is the effect of blocking AKAP/RIIα interactions (e.g., using peptide competition or by using a mutant construct that does not bind RIIα) on the FRET signal for each of the three RIIα proteins?</p><p>5) There are potential alternative explanations for the biochemical observations presented that are unrelated to substrate tethering and orientation that need to be excluded by experimental analysis. For example, the changed activity reported upon alteration of the linker could involve more rapid or complete dissociation of PKAc from the complex. The authors should therefore examine levels of associated PKAc in immunoprecipitates of the various RII constructs prior to, and subsequent to, a cAMP agonist.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01319.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Variations in appearance of such projection images can in principle arise from either conformational variability or from projections of the three-dimensional structure in different directions</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the appearance of structural variation can result from either conformational variability or from projections of the structure in different orientations. We have expanded our EM analysis to include a new supporting figure showing single particles at 0-degree tilt that appear as either linear or triangular conformations, together with a montage of the same particles collected under various tilt-angles. This analysis clearly shows that the linear and triangular particles are distinct and do not appear as one another at the various angles that we sample. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, we have included back-projection analysis of our 3D-reconstructions (both linear and triangular). This analysis shows that even when the triangular model is tilted-completely on its edge (where it may appear more linear in projection) its dimensions are always smaller than the extended end-to-end particle lengths obtained for the truly linear particles. These data has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>These additional analyses suggested by the reviewer both improve and support our assessment that the structural variability observed by EM is a result of the inherent conformational variability within the AKAP-PKA complex.</p><p><italic>A more powerful classification procedure such as the ISAC program developed in the Penzcek lab may result in higher quality class averages and aid the analysis</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers we have used ISAC in an attempt to tease out more details in our projection averages.

Hence tilted images are commonly distorted from their proper projection structures. This could lead, for example, to the apparent linearization of a triangular conformation</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers raise an important concern regarding the effects of particle flattening. The EM analysis described above has addressed this concern. We have modified the text to more clearly reflect the concern regarding flattening artifacts in negative stain EM. Of course one could consider cryo-EM as an alternative; however, these particles are too small and the contrast will be too weak. Consequently this is not a viable option. But we also would like to note that our analysis represents the best interpretation of the available data and structural findings are corroborated with biochemical experiments.</p><p><italic>3) The in vitro phosphorylation studies imply that the major role of RIIα linker is on basal (not PKA-stimulated) phosphorylation (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>). However, the in vivo reporter analysis (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>) does not appear to show changes in basal activity, but does show changes in stimulated activity. How do the authors reconcile these findings? These observations require some explanation because they lie at the heart of the authors' conclusions</italic>.</p><p>We are happy to include additional data showing the basal activity of each modified PKA holoenzyme using our FRET sensor. Analysis of raw baseline FRET activity shows elevated signal of the truncated RII form as compared to the wild type or the extended RII chimera. This additional data further supports the concept that the linker region within the anchored PKA holoenzyme is important for establishing spatial constraints for substrate phosphorylation under conditions where sustained basal phosphorylation is necessary to maintain homeostasis. These data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and discussed in the text.</p><p>In response to the second aspect of this question we are happy to clarify that nature of the dynamic changes in the cAMP responsive FRET ratios shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5H and 5I</xref>. These data represent the normalized rate of change in the CFP/YFP ratio that occurs upon cAMP stimulation. Accordingly, these data measure hormone stimulated reporter activity over and above the raw baseline FRET. We have clarified this point in the figure legends.</p><p>We maintain that the changes in basal and stimulated activity are both important indications that linker length and “disorder” are crucial to maintain an appropriate amount of built-in flexibility and allow the kinase to phosphorylate target substrates in a spatially constrained microenvironment.</p><p><italic>4) Controls should be included in the in vivo analysis (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>). What is the effect of blocking AKAP/RIIα interactions (e.g., using peptide competition or by using a mutant construct that does not bind RIIα) on the FRET signal for each of the three RIIα proteins</italic>?</p><p>We now include supplemental data that monitors the responsiveness of an AKAP18<sub>RBS</sub>-pro-AKAR containing two proline substitutions in the AKAP18 anchoring helix that abolish binding to PKA. Experiments using this control kinase activity reporter were performed to analyze all three PKA holoenzyme forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). These data are discussed in the text.</p><p><italic>5) The authors should therefore examine levels of associated PKAc in immunoprecipitates of the various RII constructs prior to, and subsequent to, a cAMP agonist</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting point. To test this concept, cells were treated with isoproterenol and AKAP18 complexes were immunoprecipitated. The amount of associated PKA catalytic subunit was determined by western blotting. Interestingly, very little PKA C subunit dissociates from any of the complexes, and there is not a noticeable difference between PKA holoenzymes assembled or reconstituted with each of the different RII forms.</p><p>This new and exciting data, included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5J and 5K</xref>, suggest that anchoring may function to stabilize PKA holoenzymes in a manner that prevents full dissociation of the subunits upon occupancy of the cAMP binding sites. These results are discussed in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
