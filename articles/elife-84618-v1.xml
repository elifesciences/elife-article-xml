fibers. Although stress-induced gene expression underlies environmental adaptation, it is unclear how transcriptional and epigenetic factors regulate fiber type-specific responses in the muscle. Here, we show that flavin-dependent lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) differentially controls responses to glucocorticoid and exercise in postnatal skeletal muscle. Using skeletal muscle-specific LSD1-knockout mice and in vitro approaches, we found that LSD1 loss exacerbated glucocorticoid-induced atrophy in the fast fiber-dominant muscles, with reduced nuclear retention of Foxk1, an anti-autophagic transcription factor. Furthermore, LSD1 depletion enhanced endurance exercise-induced hypertrophy in the slow fiber-dominant muscles, by induced expression of ERRÎ³, a transcription factor that promotes oxidative metabolism genes. Thus, LSD1 serves as an âepigenetic barrierâ that optimizes fiber type-specific responses and muscle mass under the stress conditions. Our results uncover that LSD1 modulators provide emerging therapeutic and preventive strategies against stress-induced myopathies such as sarcopenia, cachexia, and disuse atrophy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LSD1</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>muscle atrophy</kwd><kwd>muscle hypertrophy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

is the largest organ in humans, and the loss of muscle mass and physical activities are linked to the risks of metabolic disorders and aging-associated diseases. Skeletal muscle is composed of distinct types of myofibers. The slow-twitch fibers (type I) have high respiratory potential, and thus, a high endurance capacity, while the fast-twitch fibers (type II) have high glycolytic capacity and are specialized for dynamic movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>). In mice, type II fibers can be subdivided into three groups, type IIA, type IIX, and type IIB, with the type IIA relatively more oxidative than the types IIX and IIB. These myofibers are subject to gain or loss, with different sensitivities in response to numerous environmental cues, such as nutritional conditions, hormones, drugs, and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braun and Marks, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hawley et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the fast fibers are preferentially affected in glucocorticoid (GC)-induced muscle atrophy, which is associated with certain environmental and pathological conditions, such as starvation, GC drug therapy, sepsis, cachexia, acute diabetes, and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braun and Marks, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schakman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Przygodda et al., 2017</xref>). Although GCs induce atrophy by enhancing protein catabolism via the autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sartori et al., 2021</xref>), the molecular basis for the fiber type preference is still unclear. Another environmental condition that can remarkably alter muscle phenotypes is exercise. By increasing muscle mass, resistance, and endurance, exercise confers health benefits in the young, old, and sick individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cartee et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, endurance exercise promotes the formation of oxidative fibers, thus increasing the oxidative capacity in the muscle, which can effectively improve systemic metabolism in diabetic patients and prevent disuse-induced atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qaisar et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Several chromatin factors promote phenotypic plasticity in the skeletal muscle. SMYD3, a histone methyltransferase, promotes GC-induced atrophy in mice by enhancing the expression of atrophy-associated genes, such as <italic>myostatin</italic> and <italic>Met</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Proserpio et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, SETD7, another histone methyltransferase, and histone deacetylases-4 and -5 have essential roles in cachexia and denervation-induced atrophy, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nayak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moresi et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, DNA methyltransferase 3A is essential for muscle adaptation to endurance exercise by suppressing the oxidative stress response in the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Damal Villivalam et al., 2021</xref>). These previous findings in literature have established that epigenetic factors are the integral components of muscle adaptation. However, factors that define the fiber type-specific responses to environmental factors have not been identified.</p><p>Lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1 or KDM1A) is a flavin-dependent amine oxidase that in general removes mono- and di-methyl groups of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) and other protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakao et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting its contribution to specific biological processes. Despite ubiquitous expression in various tissue types, LSD1 plays essential roles in myogenic differentiation and muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Scionti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tosic et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, we recently demonstrated that LSD1 promotes fast-like myogenic differentiation by epigenetically repressing slow fiber genes in C2C12 mouse myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anan et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the available evidence raises the possibility that LSD1 influences the adaptive phenotypes in the muscle under environmental cues. To verify this, we generated muscle-specific/inducible LSD1-knockout mice and examined how LSD1 loss affects muscle plasticity under environmental stresses. We found that LSD1 depletion exacerbated GC-induced fast fiber atrophy while augmenting endurance exercise-induced slow fiber hypertrophy. In these adaptive processes, LSD1 regulated distinct sets of target genes, together with unique transcription factors (TFs). Collectively, our current study reveals the mechanism through which LSD1 builds the epigenetic barriers that restrict adaptive responses in the muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Muscle-specific LSD1 depletion exacerbates dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy</title><p>LSD1 is also known as KDM1A. For clarity, we use the word LSD1 for the protein and <italic>Lsd1</italic> for gene and mRNA. To investigate the role of LSD1 in muscle plasticity in vivo during postnatal life, we generated tamoxifen-inducible-, skeletal muscle-specific LSD1-knockout (LSD1-mKO) mice by crossing LSD1-floxed mice (LSD1<italic><sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>) and transgenic mice harboring ACTA1-creERT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCarthy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This strategy facilitated LSD1 depletion in differentiating and differentiated muscle cells. We confirmed that LSD1 was depleted after tamoxifen administration in both fast-twitch fiber-dominant (tibialis anterior [TA], gastrocnemius [Gas], and extensor digitorum longus) and slow-twitch fiber-dominant (soleus [Sol]) tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B, C</xref>). The magnitude of LSD1 depletion was comparable among these tissues. Marginal amounts of LSD1 were present after Cre induction, probably due to the expression in hematopoietic and vascular cells that are resident in muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kerenyi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, LSD1 expression in the heart, liver, and adipose tissues remained unaffected. Next, we depleted LSD1 in growing mice by administrating tamoxifen to pre-weaning mice (11 days of age) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The expression of muscle fiber genes was largely unaffected, suggesting that LSD1 depletion in our system did not affect postnatal muscle growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic GC, affects both the muscle mass and quality by inducing protein catabolism in fast fiber-dominant muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quattrocelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3AâC</xref>). To determine the involvement of LSD1 in muscle plasticity under environmental stress, we administered Dex in wild type (WT) and LSD1-mKO mice after knockout (KO) induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that the atrophy of TA and Gas muscles was enhanced in LSD1-mKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which was also evident from their reduced body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). Consistently, major hallmarks of muscle atrophy, including enhanced processing of autophagy protein LC3, increased expression of p62, attenuated phosphorylation of Akt, were pronounced in the LSD1-mKO muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5AâC</xref>). Another atrophy marker, 4E-BP phosphorylation, remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5D</xref>). Of note, LSD1 depletion alone did not affect the muscle size and body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3D, E</xref>), indicating that the effects of Dex were enhanced by the absence of LSD1. In contrast, the Sol muscle, which was only modestly sensitive to Dex, and non-muscle tissues were unaffected by LSD1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). Next, we evaluated the muscle performance of LSD1-mKO mice after Dex administration. LSD1 depletion led to weakened muscle strength as revealed by a whole limb grip test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while LSD1 depletion alone was not sufficient to induce this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3F</xref>). In contrast, the running endurance was unaffected as assessed by a treadmill run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4C</xref>). These results suggest that LSD1 protects fast-dominant muscles from Dex-induced atrophy, thereby maintaining muscle strength.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Muscle-specific lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1)-knockout exacerbates dexamethasone (Dex)-induced fast muscle atrophy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design: LSD1 deletion was induced by tamoxifen injection for 5 days (days 0â4), and Dex was administered for 7 days (days 3â9) at 1 mg/kg.

In C2C12 cells, Foxk1 represses atrophy genes under nutrient-rich conditions and becomes sequestered from the nucleus upon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowman et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the repressive function of Foxk1 is achieved through its interaction with Sin3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowman et al., 2014</xref>), which also forms a complex with LSD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Of note, the expression of Foxk1 in the Gas and TA muscles was higher than that in the Sol muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), raising the possibility that Foxk1 mediates the muscle site-dependent function of LSD1. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses in C2C12 myotubes showed that Dex exposure reduced the nuclear retention of Foxk1, which was further promoted by the addition of T-3775440, an LSD1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We also performed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiment and found a physical interaction between Foxk1 and LSD1 in C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In addition, both LSD1 and Foxk1 interacted with the common partner Sin3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, we created Foxk1-KO C2C12 cells using a CRISPR Cas9 system and demonstrated that the key LSD1-targeted atrophy genes in these cells were upregulated after differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Foxk1-KO C2C12 myotubes also showed upregulated expression of type I and IIA fiber genes, which was consistent with the results observed in the LSD1-mKO Gas muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In these cells, the LSD1 inhibition did not further affect the expression of atrophy and myofiber genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). ChIP experiment revealed that the occupancy of LSD1 at atrophy gene loci was diminished in the absence of Foxk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). These data indicate that LSD1 largely depends on Foxk1 to regulate the atrophy genes. Moreover, the upregulation of atrophy genes was also observed in the C2C12 myotubes expressing Foxk1 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D and E</xref>).

We demonstrated that LSD1 inhibition combined with Dex treatment led to impaired nuclear retention of Foxk1, resulting in the de-repression of atrophy genes. Previous reports showed that, under nutrient-rich conditions, the Akt-mTORC1 pathway promotes the nuclear localization of Foxk1 to repress autophagy and other catabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sakaguchi et al., 2019</xref>). Because GCs exert their pro-atrophic effects partly through the inhibition of the Akt-mTORC1 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schakman et al., 2013</xref>), this pathway may be involved in the nuclear retention of Foxk1. Thus, LSD1 counteracts GC signaling to facilitate the role of Foxk1, enabling optimal muscle adaptation to pro-atrophic stress. In addition, upon the sequestration of Foxk1 from the nucleus under starvation, Foxk1 target genes are replaced by Foxo3, which is known as a downstream effector of GR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sandri et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, LSD1 depletion promotes the accessibility of Foxo3 or other Dex-induced TFs to atrophy genes in muscle cells.</p><p>Enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased oxidative capacity are the key hallmarks of muscle adaptation to endurance exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qaisar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egan and Zierath, 2013</xref>). ERRÎ³ is dominantly expressed in the slow-dominant muscles and induced in the fast muscles after exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Narkar et al., 2011</xref>). Forced expression of ERRÎ³ in the muscle induces the formation of type I fibers and promotes endurance capacity, while the loss of ERRÎ³ is associated with impaired oxidative metabolism and muscle endurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Misra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Narkar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rangwala et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, comprehensive epigenomic analysis in the mouse muscles identified ERRÎ³ as the causal TF for exercise-induced epigenomic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramachandran et al., 2019</xref>). This evidence indicates that ERRÎ³ is a key mediator of the metabolic and physical adaptation to exercise. Previous studies have primarily focused on the function of ERRÎ³ in the fast-dominant muscles, and hence, its physiological relevance in the slow muscles has not been characterized. In this study, we found that LSD1 depletion promotes the adaptive response to VWR, with increased expression of ERRÎ³ and its downstream mitochondrial metabolism genes in the Sol. We also found that VWR upregulated the protein expression of ERRÎ³ in the Sol, and hence, our data collectively indicates that LSD1 limits the adaptive response in the slow muscle, particularly the type I fiber, by fine-tuning the exercise-induced expression of ERRÎ³.</p><p>Fiber-type composition in the skeletal muscle is subject to remodeling under diverse environmental stresses. Previous reports have demonstrated that Dex treatment increases the relative occupancy of type I fibers in fast-dominant muscles due to the shrinking of type IIB/X fibers but does not directly affect the growth or formation of type I fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciciliot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shimizu et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, we observed an increase in the number of enlarged type I fibers in the LSD1-mKO Gas muscle. Because there were no obvious de novo fiber formation under our experimental setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7C</xref>), it was likely that the preexisting fibers were affected by LSD1 depletion. One possible explanation is that the slow fibers in the LSD1-mKO mice became resistant to Dex. However, previous reports have shown that the type I fibers are unresponsive to GC-induced shrinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciciliot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shimizu et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that this fiber type in the Gas was already resistant to Dex, regardless of the LSD1 genotype. A more plausible scenario is that type II fibers were converted to type I fibers. This possibility is backed by our previous finding that LSD1 binds to and represses a number of slow fiber-associated genes (e.g., Myh7) in C2C12 myotubes that express fast muscle-like phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anan et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the loss of LSD1 compromised the fast fiber identity, which in turn made the muscle cells permissive to the fiber-type conversion induced by the Dex treatment.</p><p>In our VWR study, we found that the loss of LSD1 led to an increase in the type I fiber area but not the fiber number, suggesting that these fibers were selectively enlarged. It has also been reported that VWR induces the hypertrophy of Sol with prominent effects on type IIA fibers but not on type I fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Momken et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pellegrino et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that LSD1 loss sensitized type I fibers to exercise-induced stress. Because LSD1-KO did not upregulate the slow fiber-associated genes, such as <italic>Myh7</italic> and <italic>Myl2</italic> (data not shown), LSD1 possibly suppressed the synthesis of type I fiber indirectly by negatively regulating the translation or stability of fast fiber proteins. In a previous report, the forced expression of oxidative metabolism genes in the muscle in mice enhanced type I fiber formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">HÃ©nique et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the enhanced oxidative capacity in the trained LSD1-KO Sol triggered the type I fiber program. Collectively, our current study highlights the important contribution of LSD1 to the maintenance of fiber-type identity in the skeletal muscle under environmental fluctuations.</p><p>Our findings have several important implications from the biomedical standpoint. Sarcopenia is aging-associated muscle loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cruz-Jentoft and Sayer, 2019</xref>) and is characterized by a fast fiber-selective loss with the possible involvement of elevated GCs in aged individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciciliot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clegg and Hassan-Smith, 2018</xref>). We found that LSD1 expression in mouse and human muscles declined with age and showed negative correlation with the expression of the atrophy genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Revitalizing LSD1 activity using chemicals or dietary factors (e.g<italic>.</italic>, riboflavin) may facilitate muscle maintenance under aging-associated stresses. Moreover, the inhibition of LSD1 in combination with aerobic exercise may be beneficial for the prevention and management of disuse-induced atrophy, in which the oxidative capacity in the slow muscles is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciciliot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ji and Yeo, 2019</xref>). The modulation of LSD1 activity in different contexts will provide new strategies for improving muscle health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Dex and insulin (from bovine pancreas) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and STZ was from Wako.

Many of the experiments and analyses suggested have already been carried out. For the remaining experiments, we have already gathered necessary materials. Thus, we can add highly relevant revisions to the next version within a short period.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of the planned revisions</p><p>Insert here a point-by-point reply that explains what revisions, additional experimentations and analyses are planned to address the points raised by the referees.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Major #1</p><p>This study primarily uses the genetic mouse model in which LSD1 gene is inactivated after tamoxifen injection in 8 weeks old mice, as shown in supplemental figure 1 B and C. 8 weeks after birth postnatal growth of muscle is not complete and the contribution of satellite cells to muscle growth is still significant. Therefore the timing of tamoxifen injection used cannot discriminate if the observed phenotype involves the function of LSD1 during the post-natal growth of the muscle or in the muscle fibers or both. One way to demonstrate the real contribution of LSD1 in the maintenance of muscle fibers plasticity under environmental stress would be to inject Tamoxifen later (around 10-12 weeks of age), in order to remove a possible bias caused by the contribution of satellite cells during the post-natal growth. At least key findings should be confirmed at this later stage.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we used ACTA1-CreERT mice to conditionally knockout LSD1 in the skeletal muscle. The ACTA1 promoter is derived from human muscle actin gene, which is not expressed in the satellite cells, and has been widely used for the transgene expression in myofibers (Stantzou <italic>et al.</italic> Development 2017). Thus, the inactivation of LSD1 occurs in the existing myofibers, and alterations in satellite cell function, if any, would be indirect effects of the loss of LSD1 in mature myocytes or differentiating myoblasts.</p><p>To test whether postnatal muscle growth was affected in our LSD1-mKO mice, we administrated tamoxifen (4OHT) to pre-weaning mice (11 days old). LSD1 depletion did not affect the expression of muscle fiber genes, when muscle tissues were isolated from mice 11 days after the start of 4OHT (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2).</p><p>These evidences exclude the contribution of satellite cells in the phenotypes observed in the LSD1-mKO mice. Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 has been added in the revised manuscript, and described in the Results section (P.5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major #2</p><p>LSD1 m-KO muscles seem to have more type I and IIA fibers than WT, even without DEX treatment. Is it possible to quantify the results in supplemental figure 4C?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we quantitatively analyzed the fiber type compositions in Figure 1âfigure supplement 6C (former Figure S4C) using the data from WT (n=4) and LSD1-mKO (n=5) mice (Figure 1âfigure supplement 6D ). We did not find a significant difference between these mice, confirming our finding that the loss of LSD1 accelerates the Dex-driven phenotypic changes. We also analyzed the Soleus muscle from untreated mice, and found no obvious difference between the WT and KO (Figure 1âfigure supplement 7A-B ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major #3</p><p>The effect on fiber type is convincing, while variations in gene expression are of quite low amplitude. However, the atrophy should be induced by other means to ensure that the effects are specific to GC/nuclear receptors pathways; Denervation? Starvation? Not all the experiments need to be repeated, just key results such as, for example, exacerbation of atrophy in LSD1 m-KO, Foxk1 increase.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that testing alternative atrophy models is important for generalizing our findings. For this, we employed a model for diabetes-related muscle atrophy. A pro-diabetic agent streptozotocin (STZ) disturbs the function of pancreatic islet leading to fast-fiber atrophy (OâNeill <italic>et al.</italic> Diabetes 2019). LSD1-mKO did not affect the muscle weight in STZ-treated mice (Figure 2âfigure supplement 3). Consistently, there were no major difference in the expression of atrophy genes in STZ-treated WT and LSD1-mKO mice (Figure 2âfigure supplement 3 ). These results suggest that the LSD1 function depends on the source of atrophy-inducing stress, and that the loss of LSD1 sensitized the muscle to GC-mediate signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major #4</p><p>Autophagy data: the effect on the LC3I/LC3II ratio are modest. The autophagy part should be removed or completed with additional data to convincingly show that autophagy is affected. Links between LSD1 and mTOR have been published, so the mTOR pathway could be investigated in the model (S6k, S6 and 4EBP1 phosphorylation). Given AKT levels and phosphorylation are affected by the absence of LSD1 + DEX, it can be predicted that mTOR activity will change.</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed the expression of additional autophagy markers p62 and phosphorylated 4EBP1. Consistent with the upregulated expression of atrophy genes and increased LC3I/II ratio, LSD1-mKO mice had elevated levels of p62 and phosphorylated 4EBP1 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 5B and D,). Altogether, the data suggest that Dex-induced muscle atrophy was exacerbated by the loss of LSD1. These data are added as Figure 1âfigure supplement 5B and D, and described in the Results section (P.6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major #5</p><p>The ability of LSD1 to retain FOXK1 in the nucleus is an important information that should be better supported experimentally. In the absence of such information, no mechanism can be proposed for the effect of LSD1 of FOXK1. The immunofluorescence images provided are not convincing and moreover they could be interpreted by a reduction in the level of FOXK1 protein (degradation?) rather than by a nuclear exclusion in the presence of DEX. This point should be addressed, authors could include western blot of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions to better quantify the nuclear level of FOXK1 in absence of LSD1.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed WB analyses of Foxk1 using nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Our results show that LSD1 inhibition combined with Dex treatment led to a reduced nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B ). This data is consistent with our immunofluorescence data, and altogether suggest that LSD1 promotes the nuclear retention of Foxk1. The data has been added as Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B and described in the Results section (P.9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major #6</p><p>The absence of centralized nuclei indicates that there is no fiber regeneration but it does not exclude the possibility that satellite cells were recruited to existing fibers and thus participated to hypertrophy. To eliminate this possibility, the average nuclei/cytoplasm volume should decrease if hypertrophy results from increased protein synthesis and not myonuclei accretion. This should be checked.</p></disp-quote><p>We histologically analyzed the sections of Gas muscles after Dex treatment and found that there is no evidence of central nuclei in either WT or KO mice (Figure 1âfigure supplement 7C).</p><p>As mentioned above (Major #1), it is unlikely that the satellite cell function was responsible for the enhanced atrophic phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major #7</p><p>The upregulation of ERRÎ³ in the absence of LSD1 is convincing in the VWR conditions. ERRÎ³ level should be evaluated in the sedentary LSD1 KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed the expression of ERRg in sedentary mice, and found no significant difference between WT and KO mice (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A ). This suggests that the loss of LSD1 in combination with VWR training led to the increased expression of ERRg. This data is included in the revised manuscript as Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A and described in the Results section (P.12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor #1</p><p>There is a clear difference in the number of mouse replicates between treated (Dex or VWR) and non-treated mice, regardless the genotype. Experiments with non-treated mice lack adequate numbers to make a definitive conclusion. For example, there is a huge spread in the data in Figure 1 B and 4 D. If the number of animals would have been increased, would the absence of difference hold up?</p></disp-quote><p>We increased the number of non-treated animals in Figures 1B and 4B as suggested. Nonetheless, we did not find any significant differences in the muscle weight (Figures 1B and 4B). These changes are reflected on original Figures 1B and 4B. For Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A-B, we used violin plots to clearly visualize the differences among groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor #2</p><p>The authors claim that: &quot;Consistent with the results of the augmented endurance capacity, the Sol muscle in the KO mice showed enhanced succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining, indicating that the number of oxidative fibers increased (Figure 4F and Supplemental Figure 8F)&quot;. However, supplemental figure 8 D indicates that the number of type I fibers does not change compared to WT. Authors should clarify this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we found that the area of type I fiber but not the number was increased in the LSD1-KO Sol (Figure 4D and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D). Because SDH staining reflects the OXPHOS capacity in all fiber types, it is possible that the OXPHOS capacity in the fibers other than type I had been augmented by LSD1-KO. Thus, for clarification, we will change the statement as follows: OXPHOS capacity of Sol was enhanced by the loss of LSD1 (Results section, P.11)<bold>.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>Methods</p><p>1. The authors used the Cre-lox system with tamoxifen to generate skeletal muscle-specific LSD1 KO mice. It is clear that both the mRNA and protein levels of LSD1 in various muscles were dramatically reduced, but there is still some LSD1 expressed in skeletal muscle, especially in Sol muscle (Supplemental Figure 1C). The author needs to think about whether it is appropriate to use the term &quot;LSD1 knockout&quot; or &quot;LSD1 deficiency&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In this study, we crossed LSD1-floxed mice with ACTA1-creERT mice. This enables the deletion of critical exons of <italic>LSD1</italic> in mature myocytes and myogenic precursors that have initiated the differentiation program. LSD1 is a ubiquitously expressed gene, and it is known that immature myogenic cells (<italic>e.g.,</italic> satellite cells, Tosic et al. Nat Commun. 2018) and other non-myogenic cells such as hematopoietic and vascular cells abundantly express LSD1 (Kerenyi et al. <italic>ELife</italic> 2013, Yuan et al. Biochem Pharmacol. 2022). Thus, it is likely that LSD1 expression by these cell types were detected in our whole muscle western blots. We added these statements in the text for clarification (Results, P.5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>2. To identify the transcriptional regulators that mediate the regulation of atrophy-associated genes by LSD1, the authors performed motif analyses on the promotor regions of upregulated genes in LSD1-mKO Gas. Based on the results and other reports, they focused on Foxk1 and proved LSD1 and Foxk1 cooperatively regulate the atrophy transcriptome in the presence of Dex. However, Figure 3C showed that a transcription factor Nfatc1 is also reduced in Sol muscle similar to Foxk1. Also, other studies demonstrated that the transcription factor NFATc1 controls fiber type composition and is required for fast-to-slow fiber type switching in response to exercise in vivo. More specifically, NFATc1 inhibits MyoD-dependent fast fiber gene promoters by physically interacting with the N-terminal activation domain of MyoD and blocking recruitment of the essential transcriptional coactivator p300 (Cell Rep. 2014 Sep 25; 8(6): 1639-1648). Furthermore, it has been reported that LSD1 Controls Timely MyoD Expression via MyoD Core Enhancer Transcription (Cell Rep. 2017 Feb 21;18(8):1996-2006. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2017.01.078). It is unclear how the authors exclude Nfatc1 for the LSD1-mediated effects in different muscle fibers. Further experiments may be necessary to exclude Nfatc1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for an insightful comment. In addition to Foxk1, we tested the involvement of NFATc1 in the gene regulation under LSD1-depleted state. We treated C2C12 with an LSD1 inhibitor S2101 in combination with a calcium ionophore that promotes the transcriptional function of NFATc1 by inducing its nuclear localization (Meissner et al. J Cell Physiol. 2007). While LSD1 inhibition promoted the expression of Pgc1a and Myh7, ionophore treatment had no additive effects. Because we found a physical association of Foxk1 with LSD1, we focused on the functional involvement of Foxk1 in LSD1-mediated repression of atrophy genes. We recently performed an ATAC-seq analysis in Dex-treated muscle, and found that the Foxk1 motif but not the NFATc1 motif was enriched in the LSD1-KO-specific open chromatin regions. This data further suggests the significant contribution of Foxk1 in the transcriptional regulation under LSD1 depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In figure 3D, only merged images were colored. It would be better to show colored images for Foxk1 and DAPI.</p></disp-quote><p>We replaced the images with the colored ones in Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Immunofluorescence analysis in C2C12 myotubes showed that Dex exposure reduced the nuclear retention of Foxk1, which was further promoted by the addition of T-3775440, an LSD1 inhibitor (Figure 3D). The author also used Foxk1-KO C2C12 myotubes to prove LSD1 and Foxk1 cooperation to regulate the expression of type I /IIA fiber and atrophy genes in Foxk1-KO cells. Are the effects of LSD1 dependent on Foxk1 or synergistically acting with Foxk1? The treatment of LSD1 inhibitor in Foxk1-KO C2C12 may be helpful to answer this question.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we tested the combination effect of LSD1 inhibition and Foxk1-KO. The treatment of Foxk1-KO cells with T-3775440 did not show additional effects on the expression of atrophy and slow fiber genes (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B). Next, we analyzed the chromatin association of LSD1 in Foxk1-KO cells by a ChIP assay, and found that the occupancy of LSD1 at atrophy gene loci was diminished in Foxk1-KO cells (Figure 3G and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C). These results collectively suggest that the LSD1 largely depend on Foxk1 to control atrophy genes. These data are included in the revised version as Figure 3G and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B-C, and described in the text (Results, P. 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In supplementary figure 2, body weight in the mKO+Dex group was reduced in comparison to that of WT+Dex. How about the body weight of mKO mice without Dex injection compared to that of WT? This data will be helpful to understand the effect of muscle-specific LSD1 deficiency on whole-body energy balance.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the body weight of untreated mice, and found that there is no genotype effect (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3D-E ). Thus, we think that LSD1-mKO alone does not influence the whole-body energy balance. We included this data as Figure 1âfigure supplement 3D-E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors analyzed the size distribution of myofibers and mentioned that large type I and type IIA fibers preferentially increased in the LSD1-mKO muscle, whereas large type IIB + IIX fibers decreased (Supplemental Figure 4, B, E, and F). It is better to show the results of statistics. If no significance were found, it should be mentioned in the result section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed statistical analyses on Figure 1âfigure supplement 7D-E (Supplemental Figure 4E and F in the previous version), and found that a fraction of large type I fibers was significantly larger in KO mice. This result is indicated in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Page 11, To reveal the genes regulated by LSD1 under the VWR condition, the authors performed additional RNA-seq analysis using Sol muscle. The non-hierarchical clustering analysis was informative and showed signaling pathways related to âmitochondrionâ, âmitochondrion organizationâ, and âoxidative phosphorylationâ were altered in the Sol muscle deficient in LSD1 under the VWR condition (Figure 5B). However, it is unclear why they focus on Err-Î³ to explain LSD1-KO phenotypes in Sol muscle. Is this gene also derived from RNA seq? It is better to show whether Err-Î³ expression is also significantly altered based on RNA seq data.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, ERRg was upregulated by LSD1-KO+VWR and was included in the Cluster 6 genes together with the OXPHOS and mitochondria-related genes (Figure 5A). These data prompted us to focus on ERRg as a potential factor that explains the LSD1-KO phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors claim that LSD1 serves as an &quot;epigenetic barrier&quot; that optimizes fiber type-specific responses and muscle mass under stress conditions. This claim is derived from the loss of function studies. To generalize the functions of LSD1, the gain of function studies will be also necessary. Adding the characteristics of LSD1 overexpression in C2C12 cells will further improve the quality of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the gain of function further strengthens the quality of our study. As suggested, we introduced LSD1 into C2C12 cells using a lentivirus vector. However, the net expression of endo- and exogenous LSD1 (mouse and human, respectively) were similar between mock- and LSD1-introduced cells (data not shown). This suggests that LSD1 protein level was maintained at a certain level in these cells.</p><p>Because <italic>Esrrg</italic> is completely silenced in C2C12 cells, it is difficult to monitor ERRg-mediated gene regulation in these cells. To overcome this, we made use of a rat cardiomyocyte cell line H9c2, in which ERRg is functionally involved in differentiation (Sakamoto <italic>et al.</italic> Nat Commun 2022). We first inhibited LSD1 using the inhibitor T-3775440 in these cells, and found that the expression of <italic>Esrrg</italic> and its downstream target <italic>Perm1</italic> was significantly upregulated (Figure 5C, left). We next overexpressed LSD1 in these cells and found a downregulation of <italic>Esrrg</italic> and <italic>Perm1</italic> (Figure 5C, right). These data are highly consistent with our in vivo data that LSD1 represses <italic>Esrrg</italic> in slow fiber enriched muscle. These data are added as Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C-E, and described in the Results section (P. 12-13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>9. The authors mentioned supplementary figure 10 only at the end of the manuscript of the Discussion section (page 15) without a specific explanation of the figures in the result section. The data are important in that LSD1 expression in human muscles declined with age and showed a negative correlation with the expression of the atrophy gene. It should be presented in the result section with a more detailed description.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these data are important and need further explanations. We added the description in details in the Results section (P.13) and moved the entire figure to the main figure (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

More discussion to compare the current study and other studies will be necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.
