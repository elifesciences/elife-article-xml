cell identity. Aged <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut differentiated enterocytes (ECs) lose their identity, impairing tissue homeostasis. To discover identity regulators, we performed an RNAi screen targeting ubiquitin-related genes in ECs. Seventeen genes were identified, including the deubiquitinase Non-stop (CG4166). Lineage tracing established that acute loss of Non-stop in young ECs phenocopies aged ECs at cellular and tissue levels. Proteomic analysis unveiled that Non-stop maintains identity as part of a Non-stop identity complex (NIC) containing E(y)2, Sgf11, Cp190, (Mod) mdg4, and Nup98. Non-stop ensured chromatin accessibility, maintaining the EC-gene signature, and protected NIC subunit stability. Upon aging, the levels of Non-stop and NIC subunits declined, distorting the unique organization of the EC nucleus. Maintaining youthful levels of Non-stop in wildtype aged ECs safeguards NIC subunits, nuclear organization, and suppressed aging phenotypes. Thus, Non-stop and NIC, supervise EC identity and protects from premature aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>cell

Identity supervisors safeguard the expression of genes that enable differentiated cells to respond to environmental cues and perform required physiological tasks. Concomitantly, they ensure silencing/repression of previous fate and non-relevant gene programs and reduce transcriptional noise. Inability to safeguard cell identity is a hallmark of aging and results in diseases such as neurodegeneration, diabetes, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bensellam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hudish et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Conway et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deneris and Hobert, 2014</xref>). In many cases, transcription factors (TFs) together with chromatin regulators and architectural/scaffold proteins establish and maintain large-scale chromatin and nuclear organization that is unique to the differentiated state of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blau and Baltimore, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Booth and Brunet, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Naetar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bitman-Lotan and Orian, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut epithelia, the transcription factor Hey (Hairy/E(spl)-related with YRPW motif), together with <italic>Drosophila</italic> nuclear type A lamin, Lamin C (LamC), co-supervise identity of fully differentiated enterocytes (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Monastirioti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gruenbaum and Foisner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flint Brodsly et al., 2019</xref>). Highly similar to the vertebrate gut, <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut epithelia intestinal stem cells (ISC) either self-renew or differentiate into progenitor cells that mature into enteroendocrine cells (EEs) or give rise to enteroblast (EB) progenitors. EBs mature into fully polyploid differentiated enterocytes (ECs) that carry out many critical physiological tasks of the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lemaitre and Miguel-Aliaga, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hung et al., 2020</xref>). Aging affects the entire midgut, and is associated with loss of EC identity, mis-differentiation of progenitors, pathological activation of the immune system, and loss of the physiological properties of the gut and its integrity. It also results in loss of intestinal compartmentalization, and microbiota-dysbiosis, all leading to reduced lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biteau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonnay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrandon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rodriguez-Fernandez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jasper, 2020</xref>). During aging, the protein levels of identity supervisors such as Hey and LamC decline, resulting in inability to maintain EC-gene programs and ectopic expression of previous- and non-relevant gene programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neves et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flint Brodsly et al., 2019</xref>).

Recent works suggest an intimate link between ubiquitin, proteostasis, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kevei and Hoppe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vilchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">HÃ¶hfeld and Hoppe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Enam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chua and Signer, 2020</xref>). We performed an RNAi screen to search for Ub/UbL-related genes within ECs that supervise identity. Screening of 362 genes, 17 were identified whose conditional elimination in fully differentiated ECs resulted in loss of EC identity. Further analysis revealed one of them, the deubiquitinating isopeptidase (DUB) Non-stop (Non-stop/dUSP22) is a key EC identity supervisor. Purification and proteomic analysis identified Non-stop as part of a CP190/Nup98/Sgf11/e(y)2/mdg4 protein complex, termed Non-stop identity complex (NIC), that is essential for maintenance of EC identity. In part, Non-stop protects NIC proteins from age-dependent decline, safeguarding the EC-gene expression signature, as well as large-scale nuclear organization in these cells, preventing premature aging. Over lifespan, Non-stop protein levels in ECs declined, leading to loss of NIC subunits. This decline is associated with loss of gut identity and physiology at the cellular and tissue levels. Maintaining youthful levels of Non-stop prevented loss of the NIC and prevented aging of the gut.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A transgenic RNAi screen identified Ub/UbL-related EC identity regulators</title><p>To identify EC identity supervisors, a collection of RNAi transgenic flies targeting 362 evolutionarily conserved Ub/UbL-related genes were screened (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>; List of Ubiquitin-Related Genes according to DRSC - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flyrnai.org/DRSC-SUB.html">http://www.flyrnai.org/DRSC-SUB.html</ext-link>).

Immunofluorescence was used to score loss of proteins which are hallmarks of EC identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Among the changes upon loss of EC identity is the ectopic expression of the ISC marker Delta on the surface of ECs-like polyploid cells. This change may be also accompanied with a decline in the expression of a GFP signal that is expressed only in fully differentiated ECs (derived from the MyoIA<sup>ts</sup> Gal4, UAS-GFP transgene). Knockdown of seventeen genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>), resulted in loss of EC identity and appearance of EC-like polyploid cells (PPCs).

The DUB Non-stop (Not, dUSP22, CG4166) was identified as a bona-fide EC identity supervisor. RNAi mediated knockdown of Non-stop in ECs using three independent UAS-RNAi lines resulted in the inability of ECs to maintain MyoIA&gt;UAS-GFP signal followed by ectopic expression of the ISC marker Delta on the surface of EC-like polyploid cells in both females and males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, quantitated in 1G and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1HâJ</xref>).</p><p>Non-stop was discovered as a ubiquitin protease essential for axonal guidance in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martin et al., 1995</xref>). Non-stop is highly conserved from yeast to humans (Ubp8 and USP22 respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mohan et al., 2014</xref>), and it is required for deubiquitinating monoubiquitinated histone H2B (H2Bub) and activation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weake et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mohan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Immunofluorescence revealed that Non-stop is expressed in all midgut cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâD</xref>). Non-stop is the major H2Bub deubiquitinase in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, therefore functional loss of Non-stop should lead to an increase in H2Bub levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weake et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mohan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, ECs lacking Non-stop exhibited more H2Bub, and accordingly protein extracts derived from these midguts were characterized by an over 6-fold increase in H2Bub compared to control knockdown midguts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2FâH</xref>). We noticed that Non-stop knockdown in ECs resulted in an increase in Prospero positive cells (likely EEs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>, and quantified in 1H, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). However, reduction of Non-stop in EEs did not impact EE or EC identity or number, and there was no change in Delta expression. Thus, indicating that Non-stop function in maintaining differentiated identity was confined to ECs and not EEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2IâL</xref>).</p><p>While we focused on differentiated midgut cells, we observed that Non-stop has also a role in the biology of progenitor cells. UAS-RNAi-mediated loss of Non-stop in progenitors (derived by the Esg&gt;Gal4 driver that is expressed in both ISCs and EBs), resulted in increased progenitor number (Delta positive small cells). It also resulted in mis-differentiation of progenitors as evident by polyploid cells that ectopically express Delta, as well as GFP under the control of the Esg&gt;Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2MâN</xref>). Targeting of Non-stop only in ISCs in the gut (using Delta&gt;Gal4), resulted in lethality at the pupal stage with no viable adults. In contrast, elimination of Non-stop in EBs using Hey&gt;Gal4 had no impact on the gut tissue, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2OâP</xref>, and not shown). However, a detailed analysis of the function of Non-stop in ISCs is outside the scope of this study that focuses on the differentiated ECs.</p><p>At the tissue level, Non-stop elimination affected the entire midgut tissue; resulting in ectopic activation of the Notch pathway, as well as the stem-cell enhancer M5-4 <italic>esg::LacZ</italic> in polyploid cells, indicating that these cells were losing their differentiated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IâL</xref>, quantified in 1Q, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). Loss of Non-stop also resulted in increased phospho-Histone H3 which is indicative of mitotic activity in small cells, likely progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M,N</xref>). Knockdown of Non-stop in ECs reduced epithelial integrity as evidenced by leaking of blue colored food outside the gut, and reduced overall survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O,P and R</xref> respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>).</p><p>We evaluated the identity and fate of young ECs conditionally lacking Non-stop, and aged wildtype ECs, as well as the cellular composition of the gut. Towards this end we used the lineage tracing system G-TRACE. G-TRACE is a dual-color GAL4-dependent system, that enables tracing fully differentiated non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Evans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flint Brodsly et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, the MyoIA-Gal4/Gal80<sup>ts</sup> directs the expression of the color system only to fully differentiated ECs. Expression of the Gal4 is dependent on the EC-specific MyoIA promoter that induces expression of a UAS-RFP (red). Concomitantly, this Gal4 activity induces the expression of a Flp-recombinase resulting in a recombination event that drives permanent expression of a GFP regardless of the differentiation state of the cell. Therefore, wildtype young ECs express both RFP and GFP, and are the only population of polyploid cells (PPCs), observed in control midgut tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, in guts where Non-stop was knocked-down in ECs, other populations of fluorescently colored PPCâs were observed. These include PPCs that express only GFP, termed PPC** (PPC<sup>GFP+ RFP-</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, and quantified in 2J; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>). Unlike control cells, PPC** did not express EC-related transcription factors such Odd-skipped and exhibited reduced expression of the differentiated lamin, LamC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâG</xref>). We observed a small number of PPC** that express the ISC marker Delta (&lt;%1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). While this is a low percentage, we never observed the expression of Delta on the surface of control PPCs. By the nature of the G-TRACE system, we concluded that these PPC** are likely ECs that were no longer fully differentiated, failing to maintain EC identity. In accordance, PPCs that did not express EC key transcription factors such as Pdm1 and caudal were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>). In addition, guts where Non-stop was targeted in ECs were populated with PPCs lacking expression of either RFP or GFP (termed PPC*), and are likely mis-differentiated progenitors that failed to activate the <italic>myo</italic>-promoter and the entire RFP/GFP marking system, and 30% of these cells ectopically expressed Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2HâJ</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>G-TRACE-Lineage characterization of Non-stop targeted young ECs and, aged ECs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of EC-G-TRACE-lineage tracing system adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flint Brodsly et al., 2019</xref>.

In vitro binding, using S2 cell-derived extract expressing HA-Non-stop and His-tagged bacterially expressed and purified proteins, confirmed that Non-stop interacted with its known interaction partner E(y)2. Non-stop also interacted with Cp190 via the C-terminal portion of Cp190 [amino acids (a. a.) 468â1096], and only minimally with the N-terminal portion of Cp190 (a.a. 1â524) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Using Y2H we mapped the interaction between Cp190 and Non-stop to the second and third zinc fingers of Cp190 but not the first or fourth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Non-stop did not interact with Mdg4 in in vitro binding assay or in a simple Y2H. Suggesting that the interaction between Non-stop with Mdg4 likely involves the entire DUB module (e.g. Sgf11 and E(y)2). Indeed, once all three proteins are co-expressed in a yeast cell (yeast three hybrid system, (Y3H), an interaction with Mdg4 is detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F</xref>)). We modified the resulting Y3H and observed that in yeast cells it is possible to show the assembly a complex consisting all four proteins (Y4H; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). Using this system, we determined that the interaction between Mdg4 with the DUB ternary complex (Eny2/Sgf11/Non-stop) requires a region adjacent to the BTB domain of Mdg4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

We identified 214 loci that exhibited reduced chromatin accessibility (âclosedâ). Of these, 75% (162/214) were located in the range of 0â10 Kb vicinity of genes that exhibited reduced expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5âsource data 2</xref>). STRING gene ontology analysis of these âclosedâ regions suggested that they belong to genes that maintain the physiological properties of enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Alignment of the âclosedâ chromatin regions showed that they cluster to discrete gene regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; for EC-related down-regulated genes, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref> for all closed sites; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5s2sdata1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2âsource data 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, one cluster was located to the 5â UTR, a second cluster was at the transcriptional start site (TSS), a third was spanning the coding region, and a fourth was located at the 3â-UTR.

In a sharp contrast to the numerous closed regions only a small number (~16) regions exhibited increased accessibility upon loss of Non-stop in ECs interestingly many of these genes code for long non-coding RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, supporting the notion that Non-stop acts primarily to maintain chromatin accessibility in the vicinity of its targets.</p><p>We hypothesized that the ectopic expression of these genes may be, at least partially, due to changes in nuclear organization in ECs. In this regard, among the genes that require Non-stop/NIC at the protein level is LamC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AâF</xref>). LamC is the dominant lamin in ECs that silences the expression of stem cell and non-relevant gene programs in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flint Brodsly et al., 2019</xref>). For example, PCNA is not expressed in control ECs, but is ectopically expressed in PPC** (ECs that are no longer differentiated; PPC<sup>GFP+ RFP-</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F,G</xref>) when non-stop is silenced. This ectopic expression was prevented by co-expression of LamC in ECs where Non-stop was eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1H</xref>). Moreover, loss of Non-stop in ECs also resulted in a significant decrease in the linker histone H1 that is associated with compacting chromatin and gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fyodorov et al., 2018</xref>). H1 protein levels were reduced in the nuclear periphery of ECs lacking Non-stop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>) in gut extracts derived from flies where Non-stop was targeted in ECs, as well as upon knockdown of Non-stop in S2R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref> respectively). Thus, the ectopic expression of non-EC programs may be due to loss of LamC and H1 proteins and subsequently heterochromatin impairment and dependent silencing. However, since we isolated mRNA from the entire midgut, the source of these upregulated mRNAs may also be from mis-differentiated stem cells (PPC*), as well as from the increase in rapidly dividing progenitor cells.</p><p>Comparison of Non-stop RNA-seq data with a genome-wide high-resolution DamID binding map of histone H1 performed in Kc167 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Braunschweig et al., 2009</xref>) identified the GAGAGA sequence that is the binding sites for the transcription factors Trithorax-related (Trl/GAF), a shared motif for Non-stop-regulated genes also bound by H1. Moreover, GAGAGA sequence was also enriched in Non-stop closed regions at the TSS of genes requiring Non-stop for expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>While Trl/GAF was not identified as part of the NIC in our proteomic purification, it associates in a protein complex containing Nup98, e(y)two and Mod (mdg4) that regulate gene-expressionÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). However, targeting Trl/GAF or the adaptor protein CLAMP protein which also binds to the GAGAGA sequence and associates with Cp190 and Mod (mdg4) did not result in loss of EC identity (Not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bag et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that NIC is likely functionally and compositionally distinct from the Trl-containing complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Non-stop maintains the protein level of NIC subunits</title><p>Non-stop/USP22 iso-peptidase activity is required for transcriptional activation, as well as for preventing ubiquitin-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atanassov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atanassov and Dent, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cloud et al., 2019</xref>).

Moreover, the protein levels of NIC subunits CP190, e(y)2, and Mod (mdg4) were also reduced in aged ECs (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-E-G-J</xref>; quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7QâT</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7âsource data 1</xref>). Thus, suggested that a decline in Non-stop protein resulting in a failure to safeguard NIC stability accompanies aging. Therefore, we tested whether preventing decline in Non-stop protein can protect from loss of NIC. Towards this aim we continuously expressed Non-stop in ECs using UAS-non-stop and the MyoIA&gt;Gal4/Gal80<sup>ts</sup> system, expressing Non-stop to a level similar to its expression in young ECs as determined by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Based on cell-specific secondary tests, we identified three categories of supervisors; 1. EC-specific identity regulators 2. Genes that are required for differentiated cell identity (both EEs and ECs) 3. Genes that are required for identity of all cell types (general identity regulators). Of specific interest were a group of genes (CG1490; CG2926; CG4080) whose elimination in EEs resulted in a loss of EC, but not EE, identity, acting as inductive identity regulators. Likely their effect on ECs involves cell~cell communication via diffusible factors. While loss of each individual gene identified in the screen resulted in loss of EC identity, the molecular and genetic connections between different identity regulators requires further studies.</p><p>The observation that Ub/UbL-related genes protect the differentiated identity is conserved across species. Screens in mammalian systems identified enzymes within the SUMO and ubiquitin pathways acting as a barrier against forced reprogramming of differentiated cell. Among these genes were Ubc9, the sole SUMO conjugating enzyme, that was also identified in our screen and the isopeptidase Psmd14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cheloufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to Non-stop, our screen identified the iso-isopeptidase UTO6-like (CG7857), Usp7, and Rpn11 as regulators of EC identity. Rpn11 is part of the lid particle of the 26S proteasome, involved in deubiquitinating proteins undergoing proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Greene et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Genes regulating identity are likely to serve as a barrier to tumorigenesis having a tumor suppressive function.

Relevant to our study is the observation that USP22 has tumor suppressive functions in colon cancer by reducing mTor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kosinsky et al., 2020</xref>). Along this line it is interesting to note that 10/17 of human orthologs to genes discovered in our screen are either mutated or silenced in cancer. Thus, future studies of these human orthologs may identify potent tumor suppressors in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Potential function of Non-stop and the NIC</title><p>Our proteomic, biochemical, and genetic analyses established that to maintain identity Non-stop acts as part of the NIC protein complex.</p><p>Like SAGA, NIC contained the entire DUB module including Non-stop, E(y)two and Sgf11. Within SAGA, Sgf11 is critical for Non-stop activity. However, loss of Sgf11 did not result in loss of EC identity. While this may reflect intrinsic differences between the complexes it may also be possible that knock-down of Sgf11 transcripts in ECs did not reduce Sgf11 protein levels sufficiently enough to result in a phenotype.</p><p>The BTB domain of Mod(mdg4) interacts with the M domain of Cp190 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melnikova et al., 2017</xref>), and together they enable the recruitment of NIC to the promoter/enhancer regions. There are more than 30 Mod(mdg4) isoforms with different C-ends, each of which interacts with different DNA-binding TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">BÃ¼chner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melnikova et al., 2017</xref>). Cp190 can also be able to recruit different TFs and interacts with Chromo and Zinc-finger 4 (Maksimenko, and Georgiev unpublished data), that are co-localized with Nup98-96. The Mod(mdg4)/CP190 sub-complex is bound to promoters through interactions with many promoter specific C2H2 proteins including dCTCF, Su(Hw)(ref), and possibly via other TFs enriched in our ATAC-seq analysis.</p><p>Prominent phenotypes of loss of Non-stop were the reduced protein level of Nup98 and its miss-localization from the nuclear periphery to an intranuclear punctate distribution. Nup98 was shown to recruit Set1~COMPASS to enhance histone H3K4me2-3 methylations in hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Franks et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, a possible function of the NIC may be the recruitment of the H3K4me2/3 COMPASS methylases to catalyze H3K9 di- and tri-methylation at enhancers and promotors, which are fundamental for gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakanishi et al., 2009</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shilatifard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sze and Shilatifard, 2016</xref>).

Interestingly, the DNA binding site of Trl/GAF/ was enriched in EC genes that their expression required Non-stop for maintaining chromatin accessibility. However, Trl, CTCF, SuHw, or Mtor that interact with Cp190 were not detected as Non-stop bound proteins in our proteomic analysis, and RNAi-mediated elimination of Trl/GAF, or SuHw from ECs did not result in loss of EC identity.

RNA-seq analysis established that Non-stop did not regulate the mRNA level of NIC subunits. Suggesting that Nonstop acts by deubiquitinating NIC subunits in ECs. In this regard, it is possible that the stabilization of NIC subunits may also require the EC-related lamin, LamC. We noticed that Lamin C protein levels (but not mRNA) decline upon loss of Non-stop. Moreover, LamC expression partially restored the protein levels of NIC subunits and their intranuclear localization, potentially by serving as a scaffold for NIC at the nuclear periphery (not shown). Therefore, additional experiments are required to establish whether NIC subunits are directly deubiquitinated and stabilized by Non<bold><italic>-</italic></bold>stop iso-peptidase activity and the potential contribution of LamC to stabilization of NIC subunits.</p><p>Thus, Non-stop may function at two levels; One is a direct role in transcription safeguarding chromatin accessibility at EC genes, while a second function is the stabilization of identity supervisors including NIC subunits and LamC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Crosstalk between identity supervisors;</title><p>Both Non-stop and the transcription factor Hey are bona-fide regulators of EC identity required for the expression of EC-related genes. A significant number of EC-related genes required both Non-stop and Hey for their expression, suggesting that Hey and Non-stop may co-regulate these genes. However, functional and epistatic tests suggest that Hey also acts upstream or in additional pathways to Non-stop. Hey binds to enhancers in <italic>lamin</italic> genes repressing the expression of the ISC-related lamin, LamDm0 and enhances the expression of LamC. In contrast, Non-stop does not regulate the accessibility, or expression of either LamDm0 or LamC at mRNA level. However, Non-stop is required for maintaining the levels of LamC protein. Therefore, loss of Non-stop results in a decline in LamC but not in the ectopic expression of LamDm0, which is observed upon acute loss of Hey or aging. This discrepancy may be due to the presence of Hey on its repressed targets in young ECs where Non-stop is targeted, and directly repressing their expression as maybe in the case of LamDm0. Moreover, EC-specific expression of Non-stop did not suppress the phenotypes associated with acute loss of Hey in young ECs further supporting for Hey-dependent, but Non-stop independent functions. However, the ECs-specific expression of either Non-stop or Hey in aging midguts restores expression of LamC and repressed ectopic LamDm0 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Non-stop and pre-mature aging</title><p>Changes in large-scale nuclear organization are hallmarks of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Expression of identity supervisors can prevent age-related distortion of the nucleus EC identity and protect overall the epithelial tissue (This work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flint Brodsly et al., 2019</xref>). However, to accomplish this, Non-stop or Hey were continuously expressed in ECs and temporal expression of Hey or Non-stop in already aged ECs was not sufficient to suppress aging phenotypes. Thus, if the levels of identity supervisors are kept at youthful levels, they can continue to maintain cell identity and prevent signs of aging, effectively keeping the gut organization and structure similar to young tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kenyon, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, it is not clear how expression of a single regulator like Non-stop has an extensive impact on the entire nucleus. Recent studies suggest that Non-stop functions in additional multiprotein complexes that may regulate large-scale cellular organization. For example, Non-stop is part of an Arp2/3 and WAVE regulatory (WRC) actin-cytoskeleton organization complex where it deubiquitinates the subunit SCAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cloud et al., 2019</xref>). In this regard, a nuclear actin organizing complex, WASH, interacted with nuclear Lamin and was required for large scale nuclear organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Verboon et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to suggest that such complexes are required to maintain cell identity, and that subunits within these complexes are deubiquitinated by Non-stop.</p><p>In this regard many nuclear proteins are extremely long-lived proteins (LLPs) among them are nuclear pore complex proteins (NPCs) and core histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Toyama et al., 2019</xref>). The extended stability of LLPs may originate from intrinsic properties of LLPs, or due to sequestration and evading degradation. However, increased stability may be also actively maintained by constitutive de-ubiquitination. Indeed, post-translational modification by ubiquitin and SUMO were shown to regulate lamin stability and their intranuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blank, 2020</xref>). Specifically, type-A lamin and its splice variant Progerin, the cause of Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a premature aging syndrome, are degraded by the HECT-type E3 ligase Smurf2 via ubiquitin-dependent autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borroni et al., 2018</xref>). The elimination of Progerin by expression of Smurf2 in HGSP-fibroblasts reduced the deformation observed in these cells. Thus, it is possible that enhancing Progerin degradation by inhibiting the human ortholog of Non-stop, USP22, will restore nuclear architecture, and suppress the premature aging phenotypes observed in HGPS cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Key resource table with fly stocks and antibodies used

Using different approaches, the authors identify Non-stop (Not) functions in a complex to maintain the identity of Enterocyte cells and protects them from premature aging. The data support the main claims of the paper.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Non-stop identity complex (NIC) supervises enterocyte identity and protects from pre-mature aging&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Neta-Erez et al., &quot;A Non-stop identity complex (NIC) supervises enterocyte identity and protects from premature aging&quot;. The authors performed the RNAi screening on the maintenance of EC identity and identified the de-ubiquitinase Non-stop and its complex NIC as an EC identity supervisor. Using the similar techniques with their previous publication on <italic>eLife</italic> (Flint-Brodsly et al., 2019) and in combination with proteomic and genomic studies, the authors nicely demonstrated that the role of NIC on EC identity as well as its impact on aging. The data are convincing to support their claims but the following points need to be clarified to improve the manuscripts.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The relationship between non-stop (NIC) and other potential EC identifiers that are shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B-G is unclear. Since, these were not identified as part of the NIC complex, their contribution towards supervision of EC identity and whether they function downstream of Non-stop needs to be explained further. Based on the images in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, knockdown of CG1451, CG 18174 and CG1490 seems to have more delta positive cells than what is shown in Figure 1D, so the rationale behind characterizing Non-stop in more detail rather than other candidates and whether the role of other candidates overlaps with Non-stop is unclear. One question that comes to mind is whether increasing levels of CG1451, CG18174 or CG1490 can rescue the Non-stop phenotype.</p><p>2) The authors showed that Non-stop expresses basically all gut cell types, and EE-specific Not RNAi was no effect on EC identity. Hence, they mentioned &quot;Non-stop function in maintaining gut identity was specifically localized in ECs&quot;. How about the effect of ISC or EB-specific Not RNAi on EC differentiation or identity? Loss of Non-stop in ECs results in reduced expression of 863 mRNAs with 38% of them being EC-related. How about the other 62%? Are they also important for cellular identity of other tissues? How many transcription factors are affected? Is Hey included? Are the NIC subunit genes transcriptionally downregulated upon Not(RNAi)?</p><p>3) The authors could show that Non-stop teams up with E(y)2, Sgf11, Cp190, mdg4, and Nup98 forming the Non-stop identity complex (NIC). However, direct binding was only confirmed for Cp190 in yeast 2H assays. Complex formation should also be shown for the other components. Depletion of Non-stop results in reduced Cp190, e(y)2, and Mod (mdg4) levels whereas Nup98 exhibits changed localization. The authors suggest that Non-stop stabilizes the associated NIC subunits but this model is not convincingly supported by the data. It should be ruled out whether the NIC subunit encoding genes are transcriptionally downregulated upon Non-stop depletion. Moreover, western blot analysis detecting the NIC subunits would be more quantitative to compare ECs (or S2R cells) with and without Non-stop expression. Otherwise it remains unclear whether the changes in NIC subunit level are directly resulting from Non-stop binding or not. CP190 binds directly to Non-stop via its 2nd/3rd zinc finger domain. Is a CP190 version lacking these binding domains more or less stable compared to wild-type CP190? It also remains unclear if NIC subunits are regulated ubiquitin-dependent. Could the NIC subunit level and/or Nup98 localization be increased by proteasomal inhibition? Rescue experiments with Non-stop mutants affected in ubiquitin-specific peptidase activity would be important to address the ubiquitin-dependent regulation mediated by Non-stop.</p><p>4) The authors showed mis-expression of Delta in the EC-specific Not RNAi flies in Figure 1 as one of the typical phenotypes for the loss of EC identity. However, they didn't show whether PPC** express Delta. The authors need to show this data or an appropriate explanation about this point is required.</p><p>5) Figure 1. The survival curve in Figure 1R is depicted for 33 flies only. For a reasonable inference to be drawn a minimum of 50-100 individuals should be included in a cohort if Log-rank test was used for statistical comparison. Also 3 repeats should be provided.</p><p>6) The Discussion is highly speculative and mainly focussed on supplementary data. It should be more focussed on the main findings of the work and provide a clear take home message with mechanistic concepts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62312.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The relationship between non-stop (NIC) and other potential EC identifiers that are shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B-G is unclear.

In G-TRACE analysis loss of Non-stop resulted in significant numbers of âEC cells that are no longer differentiatedâ. Moreover, at the same time we performed our Ub-screen we discovered via proteomic analysis the novel NIC complex. Therefore, we thought it will be interesting to test its potential role in cell identity specifically after that we realized that Nonstop activity is not mediated via SAGA complex, and that SAGA is not involved in regulation of EC identity. We do agree that other genes identified in the screen are highly interesting.</p><p>Taking into account the reviewerâs comment, we performed epistatic analysis between Non-stop and Hey is a master identity supervisor of EC identity. Specifically, we tested whether Non-stop expression suppresses Hey-related loss of identity phenotypes, and whether expression of Hey can suppress Nonstop LOF phenotypes. In both experiments no rescue was observed, suggesting for possible interdependent between Hey and non-stop. This notion is also supported with the observation that large number of EC genes that require both Hey or Non-stop for their expression. This new data is now shown in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E-H. and added the relevant section in the text:</p><p>âWe previously identified genes that required Hey for their expression in ECs, and 76% (174/228) of Hey-dependent genes also required Non-stop for expression (Figure 5C).

UAS-RNAi-mediated loss of Non-stop in progenitors (derived by the Esg&gt;Gal4 deriver that is expressed in both ISCs and EBs), resulted in increased progenitor number (Delta positive small cells). [â¦] However, a detailed analysis of the function of Non-stop in ISCs is outside the scope of this study that focuses on the differentiated ECsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Loss of Non-stop in ECs results in reduced expression of 863 mRNAs with 38% of them being EC-related.

We re-analyzed the data and corrected gene numbers in each group. As suggested we now present bioinformatic analyses of the genes that are not known EC genes and exhibit downregulated expression by Non-stop thus data is shown in figure. GO analysis unveiled that they are enriched in physiological pathways of ECs (new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A). We updated the text and figures:</p><p>âIn addition, 51% (444/863) of Nonstop down regulated genes were not previously identified as EC genes in other studies.

Using simple Y2H and in vitro binding assay we showed that Non-stop interacted directly with Ey2 and Cp190. Using Y2H we mapped the interaction within Cp190 (Figure 3E-G). Mdg4did not interact in vitro or in Y2H with Nonstop. However, via yeast 3 hybrid assay (Y3H) we learned that the interaction of Mdg4 requires the entire DUB module (Nonstop, Ey2,Sgf11), and mapped the region within Mdg4 that mediates the interaction.</p><p>All this new data is shown in new Figure 3G, and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F.

These experiments were not informative, as in whole midgut extracts, we did not detect reduction in the levels of Nonstop or other NIC subunits proteins. This is likely due to the robust increase in progenitor and other cells types that populate the midgut upon loss of Nonstop. These cells express Nonstop and NIC masking the reduction of Nonstop and NIC in ECs and ECs and EC-like cells that are observed visually by IF.</p><p>We have also performed similar experiments in S2 cells, where we eliminated Nonstop via shRNA. These preliminary experiments supported our midgut analysis in vivo and elimination of Nonstop resulted in reduced level of NIC subunits.
