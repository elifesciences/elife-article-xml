mating and social affiliation but may also inadvertently alert predators and rivals. Consequently, the decision to vocalize depends on brain circuits that can weigh and compare these potential benefits and risks. Male mice produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during courtship to facilitate mating, and previously isolated female mice produce USVs during social encounters with novel females. Earlier we showed that a specialized set of neurons in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG-USV neurons) are an obligatory gate for USV production in both male and female mice, and that both PAG-USV neurons and USVs can be switched on by their inputs from the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus and switched off by their inputs from neurons on the border between the central and medial amygdala (Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons) (Michael et al., 2020). Here, we show that the USV-suppressing Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are strongly activated by predator cues or during social contexts that suppress USV production in male and female mice. Further, we explored how vocal promoting and vocal suppressing drives are weighed in the brain to influence vocal production in male mice, where the drive and courtship function for USVs are better understood. We found that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons receive monosynaptic inhibitory input from POA neurons that also project to the PAG, that these inhibitory inputs are active in USV-promoting social contexts, and that optogenetic activation of POA cell bodies that make divergent axonal projections to the amygdala and PAG is sufficient to elicit USV production in socially isolated male mice. Accordingly, Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons, along with POA<sub>PAG</sub> and PAG-USV neurons, form a nested hierarchical circuit in which environmental and social information converges to influence the decision to vocalize.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>vocalization</kwd><kwd>ultrasonic</kwd><kwd>preoptic</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>periaqueductal gray</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019274</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01MH117778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mooney</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01DC0133826</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mooney</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F31DC017879</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Michael</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The decision to vocalize depends on neural circuits that balance the rewards of potential social affiliation with the risks of advertising.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vocalizations help foster mating and social bonding in most mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seyfarth and Cheney, 2010</xref>). However, vocalizing in the wrong context can increase the risk of attracting the attention of eavesdropping predators or social rivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, to make an adaptive vocal decision, the neural circuits that regulate vocalization must respond not only to affiliative social and sexual cues generated by conspecifics but also to threats and aversive social stimuli, weighing them against the potential benefits of mating and social interactions. How these various and often opposing types of sexual, social, and environmental factors are integrated in the brain to influence the decision to vocalize remains unclear. Here, we explored the idea that vocal-suppressing neurons in the amygdala encode information about predators and threatening rivals, and that they influence the decision to vocalize by weighing this information against that about potential social partners and mates.</p><p>Mice produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) to communicate with conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chabout et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hammerschmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maggio and Whitney, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neunuebel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Portfors, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tschida et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Warren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Warren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). As with the production of affiliative vocalizations in other mammals, USV production in mice is enhanced by certain social factors, including the presence of suitable sexual partners and previous experience with social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chabout et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, it is uncommon for either male or female mice to vocalize when they are alone in the absence of any social stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tschida et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>). When resident adult males are presented with male intruders in their home cage, they rarely vocalize and often initiate attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, when presented with females, male mice produce USVs robustly to females to facilitate mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chabout et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Neunuebel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Portfors, 2007</xref>). In female mice, the context and function of robust vocalizations are less elucidated. Nevertheless, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2021</xref> showed that after being subjected to social isolation, resident female mice start to produce significantly more USVs in response to a novel female, although the cues that drive these female-female vocalizations and their social function are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hammerschmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The recent identification of neurons in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) that serve as an obligatory gate for USV production (PAG-USV neurons) provides the potential for understanding the circuit logic underlying a mouse’s decision to vocalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tschida et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, a GABAergic projection from the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA) to the PAG drives USV production in male and female mice in part through disynaptic disinhibition of PAG-USV neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons on the border of the central and medial amygdala (Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons) directly inhibits PAG-USV neurons, and optogenetically activating these neurons in male mice suppresses their courtship USVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>). Such convergent and opponent circuit architecture points to the PAG as one site where vocal-promoting signals could be weighed against vocal-suppressing signals to influence the decision to vocalize. However, while POA neurons that express Estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1), which is a molecular marker of POA neurons that innervate the PAG-USV region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>), are strongly activated in male mice during female courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), the extent to which Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are excited by predators or social rivals remains unknown. Thus, one question we sought to answer is whether Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are activated by predator cues or during social contexts that typically suppress USV production in male and female mice.</p><p>Moreover, carefully weighing the potential costs and benefits of vocalization is likely to involve integration at other sites beyond the PAG. Indeed, some POA neurons that project to the PAG-USV region also project to the region of the amygdala that contains Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>), raising the possibility that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons integrate USV-promoting as well as USV-suppressing information. However, whether POA neurons that provide input to the Amg<sub>C/M</sub> are active during USV-promoting social encounters and whether activity in this subset of POA neurons is sufficient to drive USV production in the absence of social cues remain untested. Lastly, the physiological properties of synaptic inputs from the POA onto Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are unknown, but these properties are important to understand whether the Amg<sub>C/M</sub> balances competing types of information to determine whether a mouse will vocalize.</p><p>To this end, here we investigated the role of Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons and their inputs from the POA in regulating USV production using in vivo fiber photometry of identified cell groups, anatomical and functional circuit mapping, and functional manipulations of neuronal activity in socially interacting and isolated mice. These experiments reveal that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons in both male and female mice are strongly activated by cues or contexts that suppress USV production, and that optogenetically activating Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons selectively suppresses USV production in both male and female mice across a variety of social contexts in which they typically vocalize. To further explore how vocal promoting and vocal suppressing drives are weighed in the brain to influence vocal production, we conducted an additional series of experiments in male mice, where the drive and courtship function for USVs are better understood. We found that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons receive monosynaptic inhibitory input from POA neurons that also project to the PAG, that these inhibitory inputs are active in USV-promoting social contexts, and that optogenetic activation of POA cell bodies that make divergent axonal projections to the amygdala and PAG is sufficient to elicit USV production in socially isolated male mice. Together these experiments reveal a nested hierarchical circuit in which environmental and social information is integrated and weighed at multiple processing steps to influence the decision to vocalize.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are active in response to threatening stimuli</title><p>Given that optogenetically activating Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons suppresses USV production in male mice during courtship encounters with females, we reasoned that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons would be highly active during threatening contexts in which vocalization is potentially risky for the sender and thus likely to be suppressed. First, we tested how USV production during social encounters was affected by the synthetic fox urine odor 2-methyl-2-thiazoline (2MT), a derivate of 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Day et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Root et al., 2014</xref>), a component of fox urine that is highly aversive to mice. In comparison to TMT, 2MT has been reported to induce freezing behavior more reliably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruzsik et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Isosaka et al., 2015</xref>). We measured the number of USVs produced by male or previously isolated female (see following section) mice during a 5-min encounter with a novel female conspecific in the presence or absence of 2MT. We found that both male and female mice produced significantly fewer USVs when encounters with a novel female occurred in the presence of 2MT compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are active in response to threatening stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) Schematic shows the behavioral paradigm: in the neutral condition, a stimulus female mouse along with a dish containing clean bedding was placed into the home cage of either a male or a female resident; in the 2MT condition, a stimulus female mouse along with a dish containing 2MT was placed into the home cage of either a male or a female resident.

The rationale for conducting fiber photometry experiments with only social partners, <italic>or</italic> novel objects, <italic>or</italic> 2MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) as opposed to repeating the behavioral paradigm used in the vocalization behavioral test described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is that we sought to isolate Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> activity patterns that were evoked by one stimulus type or another, rather than a combinatorial signal that would be difficult to interpret in the absence of these single condition data. In both sexes, calcium signals in Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons were significantly elevated above baseline when the animal approached and investigated dishes containing any of these items (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), but they were the highest when investigating the dish containing 2MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). The overall pattern of responsiveness to these various stimuli was similar between male and female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the calcium increase evoked by 2MT was not linked to subsequent bouts of freezing, suggesting that activity in these neurons was driven by detection of the odorant rather than the subsequent behavioral response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, an innately aversive predator odorant suppresses USV production and strongly activates USV-suppressing Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons in both male and female mice.</p><p>We then tested how Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neuron activity was affected during social interactions with other conspecifics that can either promote or suppress USV production. We used fiber photometry to measure calcium signals of Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons in freely behaving male and female mice during 5-min encounters with novel male and female conspecifics. These encounters resulted in non-aggressive interactions when USV production was more likely to occur or aggressive interactions (i.e. fights between two males) when USV production is absent (we confirmed that males did not produce USVs during fights). In both sexes, we observed similar small increases in Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neuronal activity when calcium signals were aligned to the onsets of non-aggressive social encounters with male or female conspecifics, or with a mouse’s investigation of a novel object (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, calcium signals of Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons did not change significantly at the onset or offset of USV bouts, suggesting that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are not simply turning off USV bouts during non-aggressive social encounters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In contrast, Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neuronal calcium signals increased markedly during aggressive interactions between two males that included attacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>). Although many of these epochs included aggressive behavior from both males, Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neuronal calcium signals were larger in the male being attacked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In summary, Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons exhibit large increases in activity during aggressive social encounters when USVs are not typically produced and much smaller increases in activity during affiliative social encounters in which USVs frequently occur. These observations support the idea that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons actively suppress USV production in the presence of threatening stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activating PAG-projecting Amg<sub>C/M</sub> neurons suppresses female USV production</title><p>While we previously showed that optogenetic activation of Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons transiently suppressed courtship USVs in male mice without disrupting non-vocal social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>), it remained an open question as to whether these neurons also suppress USV production in female mice.

Indeed, several recent studies showed that optogenetically activating Esr1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the POA was sufficient to elicit long-lasting bouts of USVs in both male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karigo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>). Given these observations, we wondered whether Esr1 might also be expressed in Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons. Consistent with this idea, in situ hybridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas shows expression of Esr1 mRNA in the same region of the amygdala as Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are found in male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We therefore tested the hypothesis that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons express Esr1 using immunofluorescent Esr1 protein antibody staining. We found that nearly half of GFP-labeled Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons express Esr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>,~49%, N=913 cells from 7 mice, 3 males and 4 females; Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons labeled by injecting PAG with AAV-retro-Cre and amygdala with AAV-flex-GFP, similar to the strategy shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

All mice were single-housed post-surgery. Optogenetic activation of Esr1<sup>+</sup> Amg<sub>C/M</sub> cells immediately and reversibly suppressed USV production (N=9 mice; 5 males and 4 females; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). As with stimulation of Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> cells, this suppression was specific to the time period of optogenetic stimulation and did not occur in light-only control conditions or in control conditions in which USV bouts were allowed to decay naturally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>; p&lt;0.001 for differences between optogenetic condition and both control conditions during the laser stimulation period, two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc pairwise Tukey’s HSD tests).

Lastly, stimulating Esr1<sup>+</sup> Amg<sub>C/M</sub> neurons was similarly efficient for suppressing USVs in both males and females. Taken together, this evidence suggests that Esr1<sup>+</sup> Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons mediate vocal suppression in both male and female mice. Though GABAergic Esr1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the hypothalamus and glutamatergic Esr1 +neurons in the posterior amygdala have been implicated in mediating sexual behaviors and aggression, to our knowledge this is a novel role for GABAergic Esr1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Analyzing circuit mechanisms that balance vocal-promoting and suppressing signals in male mice</title><p>The experiments described in the prior sections establish that activating Amg<sub>PAG</sub> neurons in male and female mice suppresses spontaneous USV production during social encounters with novel females, that these neurons respond similarly to an aversive predator odorant that also suppresses USV production, and that they display similar molecular phenotypes. We next sought to understand how these vocal-suppressing Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons interact with vocal promoting signals to influence USV production in the service of social affiliation. Although the drive and affiliative function are well understood for male courtship USVs, the drivers and functions for USVs produced by previously isolated female mice during encounters with novel females are not known.

However, POA<sub>Esr1-Amg</sub> terminal activity remained low when aligned to the onsets of the mouse’s investigation of a dish containing 2MT or the onsets of attacks by male conspecifics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Taken together, these findings support the idea that POA<sub>Esr1-Amg</sub> axons in the Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> of male mice are highly active during social encounters in which USVs are produced, but not in situations in which Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> activity is high and USV production is suppressed. Therefore, in addition to being strongly activated by stimuli or aggressive social interactions that suppress USV production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, F and J</xref>), Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons receive inputs from the POA that convey information about pro-vocal social contexts and USV production.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>POA inputs to the Amg<sub>C/M</sub> are active during affiliative social encounters and USV production in male mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Viral strategy for photometry recording of Esr1<sup>+</sup> POA terminal activity in Amg<sub>C/M</sub> region (POA<sub>Esr1-Amg</sub> terminal activity).

Therefore, our current observations raise the interesting possibility that the Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> cells that suppress USVs are <italic>directly</italic> inhibited by the POA<sub>PAG</sub> neurons that promote USV production. To test this hypothesis, we first injected the PAG with AAV-retro-Cre, the POA with AAV-flex-ChR2, and the amygdala with AAV-flex-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Several weeks later, we performed in vitro whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from visually identified Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons while optogenetically activating POA<sub>PAG</sub> axon terminals in brain slices containing the amygdala. We visually targeted our recordings to tdTomato<sup>+</sup> Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons in the presence of TTX and 4AP to isolate monosynaptic currents. Optogenetically activating POA<sub>PAG</sub> axon terminals in the amygdala evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in a majority (9/13) of Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> (td-Tomato+) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>; mean current = 141.9 pA at 0 mV in TTX/4AP; currents with reversal potentials at –70 mV were identified as IPSCs, and no EPSCs were observed at –70 mV in the presence of TTX and 4AP). Bath application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist gabazine SR-95531 abolished these optogenetically evoked IPSCs in all four cases in which it was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, 4/9 recordings). Therefore, POA<sub>PAG</sub> cells provide monosynaptic inhibitory input onto Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons. These various findings support the idea that USV-suppressing Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons, which are strongly activated by predator cues and social threats, are also directly inhibited by USV-promoting POA neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Aversive stimuli and affiliative social stimuli both exert strong influence on an animal’s decision to vocalize, but in opposite directions. How vocal-suppressing information is encoded, and how this information interacts with vocal-promoting information in the brain has been unclear. Here, we provide evidence in mice that vocal-suppressing neurons in the amygdala (Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons) encode information about predators and threatening rivals, and that they influence the decision to vocalize by integrating this information with that about potential social partners and mates.</p><p>Using behavioral methods, we established that 2MT, a potent analog of the fox urine odorant TMT, suppresses USVs produced by male and female mice. Moreover, using fiber photometric calcium imaging, we found that PAG-projecting Amg<sub>C/M</sub> neurons (Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons) in both females and males were strongly activated during exposure to 2MT but not when the animal subsequently exhibited 2MT-evoked freezing or was exposed to other neutral odorants. We also observed that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons were excited during aggressive social encounters between male mice, particularly when a male was under attack, a context when we never detected USV production. These results indicate that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons provide a neural substrate for encoding threating social and environmental stimuli in either sex of mice. Further, using a novel social isolation paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tschida et al., 2019</xref>), we elicited robust USVs in female mice. We showed that stimulation of Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons not only suppresses USV production in male mice in the context of courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>), but also operates similarly to suppress a form of social USV production in pairs of interacting female mice. Thus, although male and female mice produce USVs in different amounts and in different social and reproductive contexts, the amygdala &gt;PAG pathway encodes information about interaction with threatening stimuli, and it functions similarly to effectively suppress vocalizations across contexts and in both sexes.</p><p>We also established that these USV-suppressing Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are predominantly GABAergic, with a subset expressing Esr1 in both female and male mice. While previous studies have shown that activating Esr1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the POA promotes USVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>), we found that activating Esr1<sup>+</sup> neurons in the Amg<sub>C/M</sub> region robustly suppresses USVs in both male and female mice. This result suggests that Esr1 may serve as a more widespread marker of the neural circuits that regulate USV production across sexes. It also adds to the existing literature in underscoring the diverse, and sometimes opposing, social functions of Esr1 <sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hashikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kudwa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moran et al., 2020</xref>). Together, our results indicate a similar functional and anatomical organization of vocal suppressing pathways in both sexes and provide insight into how certain aversive stimuli act centrally in the mouse’s brain to suppress vocal communication.</p><p>Beyond establishing a common function of Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons in both male and female mice, the current study also provides a deeper characterization of how Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons integrate vocal promoting and vocal suppressing signals in male mice. The rationale for this male-centric focus is that the motivational drive and affiliative social functions of USV production in male mice are well understood, whereas the motivational drive and social functions of female vocalizations remain elusive. In particular, it is unclear whether the USVs that previously isolated females produce in response to a novel female, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>, function to promote affiliation or to signal aggression.</p><p>In adult male mice, robust vocal production to females facilitates mating success, as females prefer more vocal males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tschida et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, in the wild, sexual and social stimuli may coincide with aversive stimuli. For instance, a male may encounter a potential mate in an area where he can also detect potential threats, such as the smell of a predator. In this situation, how does the male balance the drive to reproduce with the drive to survive? In our behavioral experiments, we observed that while mice vocalized significantly less in the presence of both predator odor and a female social partner, they still vocalized. This observation provides naturalistic evidence that there exists a logic where pro-social drive can eclipse the drive to suppress vocalizations.</p><p>To elucidate the interaction of vocal-suppressing and vocal promoting signals in males, we used monosynaptic rabies virus tracing to map an extensive array of cortical and subcortical neurons that provide input onto these Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons. These include GABAergic neurons in the medial preoptic area that we and others previously demonstrated promote USV production by disinhibiting PAG-USV neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, we showed that a subset of GABAergic POA neurons that project to the PAG (POA<sub>PAG</sub> neurons) also make inhibitory synapses on Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons. These POA<sub>PAG</sub> inputs to Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are activated in USV-promoting and USV-producing contexts, and optogenetically activating POA neurons that provide inputs to the Amg<sub>C/M</sub> region was sufficient to promote USV production in socially isolated male mice. Consequently, in addition to PAG-USV neurons, our study advances Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons as sites where competing types of sexual, social, and environmental information are weighed to regulate the mouse’s decision to vocalize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of nested circuits that mediate the decision to vocalize.</title><p>Inhibitory neurons within the Amg<sub>C/M</sub> encode threatening stimuli and suppress vocalizations via their direct inhibitory input to PAG-USV neurons, which gate USV production via their excitatory input to downstream vocal premotor neurons. At the same time, Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons receive direct input from inhibitory neurons in the POA, which encode social stimuli and promote vocalizations via their axon collaterals that disinhibit PAG-USV neurons. Together, Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons, along with POA<sub>PAG</sub> and PAG-USV neurons, form a nested hierarchical circuit in which environmental and social information converges to influence the decision to vocalize.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85547-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Indeed, the PAG has long been recognized as an obligatory for vocalizations in a wide range of mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jürgens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jürgens, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nieder and Mooney, 2020</xref>), and the molecular genetic identification of USV-gating neurons in the mouse has opened the door to a more systematic analysis of the circuitry that underlies the mouse’s decision to vocalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tschida et al., 2019</xref>). Our recent prior study exploited this advance to establish that PAG-USV neurons receive USV-promoting inputs from the POA and USV-suppressing inputs from Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>). In the current study, we extend these prior observations by showing that the Amg-PAG pathway responds to predator odorants and, in the male, threatening social encounters. Collectively, these studies advance the PAG as one site where vocal promoting and vocal suppressing information can be weighed to influence the decision to vocalize.</p><p>Beyond underscoring that the PAG is a site where such competing information is integrated to influence the decision to vocalize, the present study reveals that vocal-suppressing neurons in the amygdala also weigh and compare vocal promoting and vocal suppressing information. In particular, here we showed that USV-suppressing Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons are directly inhibited by USV-promoting neurons in the POA. In contrast, a prior study showed that Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons do not project back into the USV-promoting region of the POA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, although Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons may alter POA activity through indirect pathways, the asymmetry of this circuit supports a logic where the reproductive and social benefits of vocalizing may outweigh the potential costs of advertising a male mouse’s location to predators and aggressive social rivals. One limitation of the current study is that we did not test whether optogenetic activation of POA terminals in the Amg<sub>C/M</sub> region in the presence of 2MT and in the absence of a live social partner is sufficient to elicit vocalizations. While the present efforts provide insights into the vocalization decision-making process, future experiments are needed to test the full dynamic range of interactions between vocal-promoting and vocal-suppressing afferents to the amygdala and the PAG. It is also important that future studies examine whether this hierarchical asymmetry among POA-Amg-PAG mediating vocal decisions is present in females as well. In summary, the present study provides insight into how environmental and social factors are encoded and weighed at several levels of a hierarchically organized circuit to regulate social vocalizations in adult male and female mice. Given the conserved nature of many of the neural components examined here, a similar nested circuit design may play an important role in regulating vocalizations in other mammals, including humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Contact for reagent and resource sharing</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to the corresponding authors, Richard Mooney (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neuro.duke.edu/research/faculty-labs/mooney-lab">mooney@neuro.duke.edu</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental models and subject details</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Animal statement</title><p>All experiments were conducted according to protocols approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Animals</title><p>For optogenetic activation, fiber photometry, and transsynaptic tracing experiments, the following mouse lines from Jackson labs were used: C57BL/6 (000664) and Esr1-Cre (017911).

Data were acquired using Bonsai software by drawing a region of interest (ROI) around the green image of the patch cord and calculating the mean pixel value. The blue and green channels were median filtered and the blue channel was fit to and subtracted from the green signal. During recordings, stimuli including a dish containing either 10 μL of 2MT (Sigma Aldrich M83406; 1:50 dilution, amount and dilution same as used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruzsik et al., 2021</xref>), 10 μL of a control odor (ethyl tiglate), a novel plastic ‘toy’, or the soiled bedding of male or female conspecifics, or a live novel female or male intruder were introduced one at a time to the experiment mouse’s home cage. Video, audio and calcium signals were recorded as the experiment mouse freely interacted with the presented stimulus. The resulting calcium signal was analyzed using custom matlab codes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Behavior scoring</title><p>Behaviors examined in the fiber photometry experiments (approach, non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions, freezing behaviors) were scored manually by experimenters who were blind to the mouse genotype, recording site/experiment and the photometry recordings. An approach to the dish was timestamped when the mouse extended their snout to the dish to sniff the dish content. A non-aggressive interaction refers to chemoinvestigation (or anogenital sniffing) of the intruder. An aggressive interaction refers to violent fighting, where the resident and the intruder were locked together rolling, biting, kicking, and wrestling with each other. Freezing behavior was operationally defined as when the animal remained motionless for at least 3 continuous seconds.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>In situ hybridization using hybridization chain reaction (HCR)</title><p>In situ hybridization was performed using hybridization chain reaction (HCR v3.0, Molecular Instruments) as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michael et al., 2020</xref>, with VGAT (<italic>Slc32a1</italic>) and VGLUT2 (<italic>Slc17a6</italic>) probes being applied to 80-μm-thick coronal floating sections including the Amg<sub>C/M</sub> region.

Neurons were optogenetically activated with illumination from a 473 nm laser (3–15 mW) at 10–20 Hz (50ms pulses, 2–10 s total) or with phasic laser pulses (1–2 s duration). Laser stimuli were driven by computer-controlled voltage pulses (Spike 7, CED). For stimulation of Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons, Amg<sub>C/M</sub> Esr1<sup>+</sup> neurons, the laser was manually triggered each time the mouse began a bout of vocalization towards a social partner that lasted several seconds. For stimulation of POA<sub>Amg</sub> neurons stimulation was triggered manually at regular intervals while the animal was alone.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-8"><title>Post-hoc visualization of viral labeling</title><p>Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and then transcardially perfused with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (4% PFA).

Briefly, mice that received viral injections 2–4 weeks prior were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and standard procedures were used to prepare 300-µm-thick coronal slices. The brain was dissected in ice-cold ACSF containing the following (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.30 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26.2 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.0 NaHPO<sub>4</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O, and 11.0 dextrose and bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The brain was mounted on an agar block and sliced in ice-cold ACSF with a vibrating-blade microtome (Leica). Slices were incubated for 15 min at 32 °C in a bath of NMDG recovery solution containing the following (in mM): 93.0 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30.0 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20.0 HEPES, 25.0 glucose, 2.0 thiourea, 5.0 Na L-ascorbate, 2.0 Na-pyruvate, 10.0 MgSO<sub>4</sub> 7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 95.0 HCl. Slices were then moved to a bath of HEPES storage solution containing the following (in mM): 93.0 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30.0 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20.0 HEPES, 25.0 glucose, 2.0 thiourea, 5.0 Na L-ascorbate, 2.0 Na-pyruvate, 10.0 MgSO<sub>4</sub> 7H<sub>2</sub>O, and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and allowed to gradually reach room temperature over the course of 1 hr, where they remained for the duration. Recordings were performed in ACSF at a temperature of 32 °C. For voltage clamp experiments patch electrodes (4–8 MΩ) were filled with cesium internal solution containing the following (in mM): 130 cesium methanesulfonate, 5 QX-314 Br, 10 HEPES, 8 TEA-Cl, 0.2 EGTA, 4 ATP-Mg salt, 0.3 GTP-Na salt, and 10 phosphocreatine. Recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier whose output was digitized at 10 kHz (Digidata 1440 A). Series resistance was &lt;25 MΩ and was compensated up to 90%. Signals were analyzed using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Neurons were targeted using interference contrast and epifluorescence to visualize fluorescent indicators previously expressed via viral injection. ChR2-expressing axon terminals were stimulated by 5–20ms laser pulses (3–10 mW) from a 473 nm laser delivered via fiber optic inside the recording pipette (Optopatcher, A-M Systems). To confirm the direct nature of optogenetically evoked currents 2 µM TTX (Tocris) and 100 µM 4AP (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the ACSF and perfused onto slices. To confirm that evoked currents were GABAergic, 10 µM gabazine (Tocris) was applied. Pharmacological agents including were bath applied for 10 min before making recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-12"><title>Code availability</title><p>Custom-written Matlab codes used in this study have been deposited to the Duke Research Data Repository, under the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7924/r4cz38d99">https://doi.org/10.7924/r4cz38d99</ext-link> and are also available from the co-corresponding authors.

This study presents valuable measures of the neurons that suppress vocalization in appropriate contexts using a rich variety of behavioral, imaging, optogenetic, and tracing methodologies. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is solid, and their results provide synaptic mechanisms by which vocal-promoting and vocal-suppressing signals could interact in the mouse's brain to underlie the hierarchical control of vocalization.

However, we previously showed that the POA &gt; PAG pathway promotes vocalizations in male and female mice (Michael et al., 2020). Here we showed that stimulation of POA&gt;PAG axon collaterals in the Amg can also promote vocalizations in male mice. Lastly, we show here that male and female mice will vocalize to female partners in the presence of 2MT, even though they do so less frequently. We maintain that this provides a more naturalistic test of the idea that POA/PAG/Amg cells can override 2MT, which we show here activates the vocal suppressing cells in the Amg and suppresses USV production. We acknowledge that the explicit test of whether optogenetic stimulation of POA<sub>PAG</sub>&gt;Amg collaterals can promote USV production in the presence of vocal-suppressing stimuli is lacking and agree that future experiments are needed to test the full dynamic range of interactions between vocal-promoting and vocal-suppressing afferents to the amygdala and the PAG (we added this point to our discussion of limitations in lines 724-729). However, we also maintain that our present efforts provide novel insights into this process and are well suited to the Research Advance format, as opposed to a new Article.</p></body></sub-article></article>
