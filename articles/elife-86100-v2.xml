In mice and humans, two Cylicins, the gonosomal X-linked Cylicin 1 (<italic>Cylc1/CYLC1</italic>) and the autosomal Cylicin 2 (<italic>Cylc2/CYLC2</italic>) genes, have been identified. Cylicins are cytoskeletal proteins with an overall positive charge due to lysine-rich repeats. While Cylicins have been localized in the acrosomal region of round spermatids, they resemble a major component of the calyx within the perinuclear theca at the posterior part of mature sperm nuclei. However, the role of Cylicins during spermiogenesis has not yet been investigated. Here, we applied CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in zygotes to establish <italic>Cylc1-</italic> and <italic>Cylc2</italic>-deficient mouse lines as a model to study the function of these proteins. <italic>Cylc1</italic> deficiency resulted in male subfertility, whereas <italic>Cylc2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>Cylc1</italic><sup>-/y</sup><italic>Cylc2</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, and <italic>Cylc1</italic><sup>-/y</sup><italic>Cylc2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> males were infertile. Phenotypical characterization revealed that loss of Cylicins prevents proper calyx assembly during spermiogenesis. This results in decreased epididymal sperm counts, impaired shedding of excess cytoplasm, and severe structural malformations, ultimately resulting in impaired sperm motility. Furthermore, exome sequencing identified an infertile man with a hemizygous variant in <italic>CYLC1</italic> and a heterozygous variant in <italic>CYLC2</italic>, displaying morphological abnormalities of the sperm including the absence of the acrosome. Thus, our study highlights the relevance and importance of Cylicins for spermiogenic remodeling and male fertility in human and mouse, and provides the basis for further studies on unraveling the complex molecular interactions between perinuclear theca proteins required during spermiogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Male humans, mice and other animals produce sex cells known as sperm that seek out and fertilize egg cells from females.

Two proteins, known as Cylicin 1 and Cylicin 2, are unique to the cytoskeleton of sperm, but their roles remain unclear.</p><p>To investigate the role of the Cylicins during spermiogenesis, Schneider, Kovacevic et al. used an approach called CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene-editing to generate mutant mice that were unable to produce either Cylicin 1 or Cylicin 2, or both proteins. The experiments found that healthy female mice were less likely to become pregnant when they mated with mutant males that lacked Cylicin 1 compared with males that had the protein. When they did become pregnant, the females had smaller litters of babies.</p><p>Mutant male mice lacking Cylicin 2 or both Cylicin proteins (so-called “double” mutants), were infertile and mating with healthy female mice did not lead to any pregnancies. Further experiments found that the sperm of such mice had smaller heads than normal sperm, defective acrosomes, and curled tails that wrapped around the head.</p><p>Schneider, Kovacevic et al. also examined the sperm of a human patient who had inherited genetic variants in the genes encoding both Cylicin proteins. Similar to the double mutant mice, the patient was infertile, and his sperm also had defective acrosomes and curled tails.</p><p>These findings indicate that Cylicins are required to make the acrosome as sperm cells mature and help maintain the structure of the cytoskeleton of sperm. Further studies of Cylicins and other sperm proteins in mice may help us to understand some of the factors that contribute to male infertility in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cylicin</kwd><kwd>male infertility</kwd><kwd>sperm</kwd><kwd>calyx</kwd><kwd>perinuclear theca</kwd><kwd>manchette</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHO 503/23-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schorle</surname><given-names>Hubert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHN 1668/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneider</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRU326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tüttelmann</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cylicin 1 and Cylicin 2 are essential components of the sperm perinuclear theca and their loss results in impaired spermiogenesis and thus in infertility in mice and men.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The differentiation of round spermatids into sperm during spermiogenesis is a highly organized and spatiotemporally controlled process taking place in the seminiferous epithelium of the testis. Cellular and morphological remodeling involves DNA hypercondensation, establishment of a species-specific head morphology, removal of excess cytoplasm, as well as formation of accessory structures like acrosome and flagellum. These structural changes depend on a highly efficient protein trafficking machinery and a unique sperm cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Teves et al., 2020</xref>). One essential cytoskeletal element is the perinuclear theca (PT), which surrounds the sperm nucleus, except for the caudal edge, at the implantation site of the flagellum. The PT is supposed to serve as a structural scaffold for the sperm nucleus and resembles a rigid cytosolic protein layer, which is resistant to non-ionic detergents and high salt buffer extractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Longo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longo and Cook, 1991</xref>). The PT has been subdivided into a subacrosomal and postacrosomal part based on its localization, function, composition, and developmental origin. The subacrosomal part of the PT develops early during spermiogenesis, simultaneously with the formation of the acrosome. It is supposed to emerge from acrosomal vesicles, and presents as a thin cytosolic protein layer between the inner acrosomal membrane and the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oko and Sutovsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oko and Maravei, 1995</xref>). The postacrosomal part of the PT, also known as the sperm calyx, originates from cytosolic proteins that are transported via the manchette and assembled during sperm head elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oko and Sutovsky, 2009</xref>). It is located in-between the nuclear envelope and the sperm plasma membrane.</p><p>Proteomic analyses using murine and bovine PT extracts revealed 500–800 different proteins, highlighting its high molecular complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). Apart from cytoskeletal proteins, signaling molecules and several de novo synthesized core histones were identified. They are proposed to be essential for sperm-egg interaction and chromatin remodeling of the male pronucleus at early post-fertilization stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hamilton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sutovsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oko and Sutovsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herrada and Wolgemuth, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tovich and Oko, 2003</xref>). Many structural proteins of the PT are testis-specific and uniquely expressed in the PT, including Calicin (<italic>Ccin</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paranko et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Longo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">von Bülow et al., 1995</xref>), Cylicin 1 (<italic>Cylc1</italic>) and Cylicin 2 (<italic>Cylc2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Longo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hess et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hess et al., 1995</xref>), actin-capping proteins CPβ3 and CPα3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bülow et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hurst et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tanaka et al., 1994</xref>), as well as actin-related proteins Arp-T1 and Arp-T2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heid et al., 2002</xref>). Despite being characterized on molecular level, their function remains largely elusive.</p><p>Both, <italic>Ccin</italic> and Cylicins, are highly basic proteins with a predominant localization in the calyx of mature sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hess et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hess et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paranko et al., 1988</xref>). In most species, two Cylicin genes, <italic>Cylc1</italic> and <italic>Cylc2</italic>, have been identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). They are characterized by repetitive lysine-lysine-aspartic acid (KKD) and lysine-lysine-glutamic acid (KKE) peptide motifs, resulting in an isoelectric point (IEP) &gt;pH 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hess et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hess et al., 1995</xref>). Repeating units of up to 41 amino acids in the central part of the molecules stand out by a predicted tendency to form individual short α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hess et al., 1993</xref>). Mammalian Cylicins exhibit similar protein and domain characteristics, but CYLC2 has a much shorter amino-terminal portion than CYLC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the <italic>CYLC2/Cylc2</italic> gene is encoded on autosomes, the human and murine <italic>CYLC1/Cylc1</italic> gene is encoded on the X-chromosome, resulting in hemizygosity in males. Further, in bovine, Cylc2 serves as actin-binding protein of the sperm perinuclear cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rousseaux-Prévost et al., 2003</xref>). Cylicins seem to be cytoskeletal regulators and required for proper sperm head architecture.</p><p>In this study, we report the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated generation and characterization of <italic>Cylc1-</italic>, <italic>Cylc2-,</italic> and <italic>Cylc1/2</italic>-deficient mice, demonstrating that Cylicins are indispensable for male fertility and play a key function in the formation of the sperm calyx. We show that Cylicins are required for the maintenance of the PT integrity during spermiogenesis and in mature sperm. Their deficiency results in morphological defects of the sperm head, acrosome, and midpiece. Our analyses revealed that <italic>Cylicin</italic> genes are evolutionary conserved in rodents and primates. Furthermore, we identified Cylicin variants in an infertile man, demonstrating the conserved role of Cylicins in regulating male infertility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cylicins are indispensable for male fertility in mice</title><p>Cylicins were first discovered and characterized in the early 1990s; due to their subcellular localization a role in sperm head architecture was postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Longo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hess et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hess et al., 1995</xref>). To address the question of the role of Cylicins during spermiogenesis, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to generate <italic>Cylc1</italic>- and <italic>Cylc2</italic>-deficient mouse models. First, for <italic>Cylc1</italic>, a pair of sgRNAs targeting exon 5 was designed, and a mouse line with a frameshift inducing deletion of 1.585 kb, accounting for 85% of the <italic>Cylc1</italic> coding sequence, was established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Specificity of antibodies was proven by immunohistochemical (IHC) stainings, showing a specific signal in testis sections only, but not in any other organ tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of WT testicular tissue showed presence of both, CYLC1 and CYLC2, from the round spermatid stage onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The signal was first detectable in the subacrosomal region as a cap-like structure, lining the developing acrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). As the spermatids elongate, CYLC1 and CYLC2 move across the PT toward the caudal part of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). At later steps of spermiogenesis, the localization in the subacrosomal part of the PT faded, while it intensified in the postacrosomal calyx region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Of note, the localization of CYLC1 and CYLC2 in the calyx of mature sperm has been reported in bovine and human. The generated antibodies did not stain testicular tissue and mature sperm of <italic>Cylc1-</italic> and <italic>Cylc2</italic>-deficient males, except for a very weak unspecific background staining in the lumen of seminiferous tubules and the residual bodies of testicular sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, western blot analyses confirmed the absence of CYLC1 and CYLC2 in cytoskeletal protein fractions of the respective knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), thereby demonstrating (i) specificity of the antibodies and (ii) validating the gene knockout. Of note, the CYLC1 antibody detects a double band at 40–45 kDa. This is smaller than the predicted size of 74 kDa, but both bands were absent in Cylc1<sup>-/y</sup>. Similarly, the CYLC2 antibody detected a double band at 38–40 kDa instead of 66 kDa. Again, both bands were absent in <italic>Cylc2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>. Next, mass spectrometry analysis of cytoskeletal protein fraction of mature spermatozoa was performed detecting both proteins in WT but not in the respective knockout samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sperm morphology is severely altered in Cylicin-deficient mice</title><p>Next, spermiogenesis of Cylicin-deficient males was analyzed in detail.

However, in 91% of <italic>Cylc2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> sperm, CCIN localized to the tail or in random parts of the sperm head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>).

CapZα3 forms a heterodimer with CapZβ3, creating a functional complex that localizes in the calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wear and Cooper, 2004</xref>).

PNA lectin staining and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining of testicular tissue sections were performed to investigate acrosome biogenesis. During Golgi phase, the acrosome first starts to appear as an aggregation of proacrosomal vesicles into a single granule. This premature acrosomal structure was unaltered in all genotypes, with PNA signal appearing as a small dot on one pole of round spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>).

Transport of the intracellular vesicles is crucial for the formation of the flagellum, acrosome assembly, and removal of excess cytoplasm. The manchette is first detected at step 8 at the perinuclear ring of round spermatids, just prior to their elongation. During the next steps of spermiogenesis, as the spermatids elongate, manchette moves toward the neck region in a skirt-like structure and starts disassembling at step 13 when the elongation is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Okuda et al., 2017</xref>). We used immunofluorescence staining of α-tubulin on squash testis samples containing spermatids at different stages of spermiogenesis to investigate whether the altered head shape, calyx structure, and tail-head connection anomalies originate from defects of the manchette structure. Spermatids starting from step 8 were observed individually for step-to-step comparison. In all genotypes, a cap-like shape of the manchette was observed in step 8 round spermatids, suggesting that the manchette assembles properly and starts elongating toward the neck region during step 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In all genotypes, the typical skirt-like structure was observed at the caudal region of the spermatids at steps 10 and 11, suggesting that the manchette assembles correctly even in Cylicin-deficient sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The PT has a role of structural scaffold that surrounds sperm nucleus, and its protein composition is crucial for correct sperm development. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to establish <italic>Cylc1-</italic>, <italic>Cylc2-,</italic> and <italic>Cylc1/2</italic>-deficient mouse lines to analyze the role of Cylicins. We demonstrated that the loss of Cylicins impairs male fertility in mice by severely disturbing sperm head architecture. The significance of our findings is supported by the identification of <italic>CYLC1/2</italic> variants in an infertile patient who presents similar structural anomalies in sperm cells.</p><p>Detailed analysis of sperm development and morphology demonstrated that infertility of Cylicin-deficient male mice is caused by anomalies of different sperm structures. The prominent loss of PT integrity and calyx structure in the mature sperm lead to acrosome loosening and detachment from the nuclear envelope. Furthermore, the shifting of the basal plate caused damage in the head-tail connecting piece resulting in coiling of the flagellum and impaired swimming. Murine Cylicins are first detected in the peri-acrosomal region of round spermatids and move to the postacrosomal region of PT during spermatid elongation to finally localize to the calyx of mature sperm. This dynamic localization pattern of Cylicins has been described in human, boar, and bovine sperm as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Longo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hess et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hess et al., 1995</xref>). Interestingly, other PT-enriched proteins CCIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paranko et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lécuyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>) and CPβ3/CPα3 move in the similar manner across PT during spermiogenesis and are present in the calyx of mature sperm of various mammalian species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This co-localization suggests the potential interaction between calyx proteins. Furthermore, CCIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Longo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paranko et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">von Bülow et al., 1995</xref>) and CPβ3-CPα3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bülow et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hurst et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tanaka et al., 1994</xref>) are described as actin-binding proteins and porcine Cylc2 has been shown to have a high affinity for F-actin as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rousseaux-Prévost et al., 2003</xref>). The potential roles of F-actin during spermiogenesis in mammals involve biogenesis of the acrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Welch and O’Rand, 1985</xref>) and its correct attachment to the outer nuclear membrane of the spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Russell et al., 1986</xref>) as well as removal of excess cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Russell, 1979</xref>).</p><p>The loss of Cylicins caused acrosome detachment from NE starting from cap phase of the acrosome biogenesis. Interestingly, loss of CCIN results in similar loosening of the acroplaxome from the outer nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). CCIN is shown to be necessary for the IAM-PT-NE complex by establishing bidirectional connections with other PT proteins. Zhang et al. found CYLC1 to be among proteins enriched in PT fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). Based on their speculation that CCIN is the main organizer of the PT, we hypothesize that both CCIN and Cylicins might interact, either directly or in a complex with other proteins, in order to provide the ‘molecular glue’ necessary for the acrosome anchoring. Furthermore, Cylicin deficiency resulted in cytoplasmatic retention and bending of the midpiece, similarly to the CPα3 mutant phenotype repro32/repro32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Geyer et al., 2009</xref>). The CAPZ complex has been shown to regulate the actin dynamics by preventing addition or loss of G-actin subunits to the ends of F-actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wear et al., 2003</xref>). Since we demonstrated that the loss of Cylicins resulted in mislocalization of both CCIN and CPα3, we speculate that Cylicins have a crucial role in maintenance of the integrity of PT structure and thus are required for proper function of PT proteins.</p><p>Other than morphological defects of the mature sperm PT, during spermiogenesis Cylicin deficiency results in excessive manchette elongation, its delayed disassembly, as well as formation of abnormal gaps in the PT at the level of perinuclear ring. The intra-manchette transport (IMT) of proteins from the apical pole of the head to the base of the developing tail occurs during spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lehti and Sironen, 2016</xref>). The malfunctions of the IMT can cause delay in manchette clearance and morphological defects of mature sperm. Mouse models deficient for IMT proteins such as HOOK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mendoza-Lujambio et al., 2002</xref>), CEP131 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hall et al., 2013</xref>), and IFT88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kierszenbaum et al., 2011</xref>) show abnormal manchette elongation and delay in its clearance resulting in aberrant nuclear shape of the sperm. Furthermore, the loss of HOOK1 results in head-tail connection and midpiece anomalies such as flipping of the head, basal plate defects, and coiling of the tail similar to <italic>Cylc2</italic> deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mochida et al., 1999</xref>). The localization of manchette on the caudal portion of spermatids coincides with the localization of the calyx in the mature sperm, so these results indicate that the manchette might be maintained longer to compensate for the missing formation of the calyx structure. Furthermore, we observed wide gaps in the perinuclear ring during manchette elongation, suggesting that Cylicins might have a role in maintenance of the contact between caudal and apical PT region and its integrity.</p><p>Our evolutionary analysis of <italic>Cylc1</italic> and <italic>Cylc2</italic> genes across rodents and primates revealed that both coding sequences are under purifying selection. Overall, the results reveal that <italic>Cylc1</italic> is under slightly less conserved constraint than <italic>Cylc2</italic> leading to the hypothesis that loss of function in <italic>Cylc1</italic> might be less severe and could be compensated for by <italic>Cylc2</italic> due to partial redundancy. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that <italic>Cylc1</italic> deficiency causes subfertility in male mice, while the loss of both <italic>Cylc2</italic> alleles results in male infertility. Furthermore, <italic>in Cylc2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> male mice fertility was preserved, while <italic>Cylc1</italic><sup>-/y</sup><italic>Cylc2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> males were unable to sire offspring leading to the conclusion that the loss of one <italic>Cylc2</italic> allele could be compensated by <italic>Cylc1</italic>, however at least two functional Cylicin alleles are required for male fertility in mice. Interestingly, <italic>Cylc1</italic><sup>-/y</sup><italic>Cylc2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> males displayed an ‘intermediate’ phenotype, showing slightly less damaged sperm than <italic>Cylc2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Cylc1</italic><sup>-/y</sup><italic>Cylc2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals. This further supports our notion that loss of the less conserved <italic>Cylc1</italic> gene might be at least partially compensated by the remaining <italic>Cylc2</italic> allele.</p><p>In general, the evolutionary rate of C-terminal lysine-rich region of both Cylicins seems to be highly volatile between conserved and positively selected codon sites, while the lysine residues seem to be strongly conserved. Changes in the C-terminal region, potentially affecting the length of the lysine-rich domain, might have an adaptive advantage. Targeted positive selection on codon sites could also be a signature of co-evolution with a rapidly evolving interactor.</p><p>Sperm morphological defects and infertility observed in one patient with variants in both Cylicin genes point toward a requirement for human spermiogenesis and fertility. A defect in acrosome formation and the existence of variants in two out of three alleles in both <italic>CYLC</italic> genes is in line with the observations made in mice. The absence of CYLC1 confirmed through immunofluorescent staining indicates a functional impact of the missense variant on the CYLC1 protein. Furthermore, impaired CCIN localization was observed in patient M2270 as well, suggesting that PT has similar roles in human and rodents despite the differences in sperm head shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Courtot, 1991</xref>). These results suggest that establishing mouse models deficient for Cylicin and other PT proteins might provide insights into mechanisms of human spermiogenesis and cytoskeletal regulation as well. However, with our data we cannot exclude the possibility that there is a discrepancy between mice and men and that the missense variant in <italic>CYLC1</italic> might alone be sufficient to cause the observed phenotype of M2270. The o/e ratios of both genes calculated within the gnomAD database rather indicate a stronger selective pressure on human <italic>CYLC1</italic> (0.08) than on <italic>CYLC2</italic> (0.84). Furthermore, the <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant affects an intolerant region within the protein sequence according to metadome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wiel et al., 2019</xref>), whereas the <italic>CYLC2</italic> variant is located in a region that is more tolerant to variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we cannot definitively validate the hypothesis of an oligogenic disease in men as well.</p><p>The <italic>CYLC2</italic> missense variant is inherited by the father of M2270 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and, thus, not sufficient to cause infertility. However, the father reported difficulties to conceive naturally. Based on this one family, we cannot exclude an effect of pathogenic heterozygous <italic>CYLC2</italic> variants.</p><p>Overall, the identification and detailed characterization of further patients with variants in <italic>CYLC1</italic> and <italic>CYLC2</italic> is warranted to draw firm conclusions on the effect of variants in these genes on spermiogenesis and infertility.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted according to German law of animal protection and in agreement with the approval of the local institutional animal care committees (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, North Rhine-Westphalia, approval IDs: AZ84-02.04.2013.A429, AZ81-02.04.2018.A369). <italic>Cylc1-</italic> and <italic>Cylc2</italic>-deficient mice were generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in zygotes of the hybrid strain B6D2F1.

Cylicins are localized in the acrosomal region of round spermatids, yet they resemble a calyx component within the perinuclear theca of mature sperm nuclei. The function of Cylicins during this developmental stage of spermiogenesis (tail formation and head elongation/shaping) was not known. In this study, using CRISPR/Cas genome editing, the authors generated Cylc1-and Cylc2-knockout mouse lines to study the loss-of-function of each Cylicin or all together.</p><p>The major strengths of the study are the rigorous and comparative phenotypic analyses of all the combinatorial genotypes from the cross between the two mouse lines (Cylc1-/y, Cylc2-/-, Cylc1-/y Cylc2+/- and Cylc1-/y Cylc2-/-) at the levels of male fertility, cellular, and subcellular levels to support the conclusion of the study. While spermatogenesis appeared undisturbed, with germ cells of all types detected in the testis, low sperm counts in epididymis were observed. Mice were subfertile or infertile in a dose-dependent manner where fewer functional alleles had more severe phenotypes; the loss of Cylc2 was less tolerated than the loss of Cylc1. Thus, loss of Cylc1, and to an even greater extent, loss of Cylc2, leads to sperm structure anomalies and decreased sperm motility. Particularly, the sperm head and sperm head-neck region are affected, with calyx not forming in the absence of Cylicins, the acrosomal region being attached more loosely, and the sperm head itself appearing structurally rounder and shorter. Furthermore, manchette, which disassembles during spermiogenesis, persists in mature sperm of mice missing Cylc2. It is interesting that the study identifies a human male that has mutations in both CYLC1 and CYLC2 genes and suffers from infertility, with similar motility and sperm structure defects compared to the mouse models. CYLC1 in the sperm from the infertile patient sperm is absent, providing evidence that in both rodents and primates, Cylicins are essential for male fertility. Evolutionary analysis of two genes adds an interesting point. The authors show that the reason for the loss of Cylc2 being more severe is due to the higher conservation of Cylc2 compared to Cylc1 in rodents and primates.</p><p>Overall, the work highlights the relevance and importance of Cylicins in male infertility and advances our understanding of perinuclear theca formation during spermiogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86100.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The work presented in this manuscript focuses on the role of Cylicins in spermiogenesis and the consequences of their absence on infertility. The manuscript is presented in two parts: the first part studies the absence of Cylicins from KO mouse models and shows in mice that both isoforms of Cylicins are necessary for normal spermiogenesis. The evaluation of double heterozygotes is particularly useful for the second part which looks at the presence of mutations in these genes in a cohort of infertile men. A patient with two hemizygous/heterozygous mutations in the CYLC1 and 2 genes, respectively, was identified for the first time and the results obtained with the KO models support the hypothesis of the pathogenicity of the mutations.</p><p>In general, the experiments are perfectly performed and the results are clear. Numerous techniques in the state of the art in male reproduction are used to obtain high-quality phenotyping of the mouse models.</p><p>The discovery of two concomitant mutations in an infertile patient is very interesting and the work carried out on mice allows supporting that an absence of CYLC1 and a heterozygous mutation of CYLC2 could lead to a phenotype of complete infertility. However, as the mutation on CYLC2 is not identified as pathogenic, the pathogenicity of this mutation remains in question (the authors note this point in the discussion). It would be interesting to see if the mutated amino acid is conserved between different species. In mice, the authors have shown the importance of these proteins on the morphology of the acrosome. What about in humans?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86100.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors tried to study the role of the cylicin gene in sperm formation and male fertility.

We added a point-by-point discussion of all comments/suggestions hereafter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) Antibody specificity: Fig 1E - there are some unspecific binding in Cylc2-/- for CYLC2 and in Cylc1/y Cylc2+/- for CYLC1 in the testis (and elongating spermatids in Figure 1 – Supplement 4). Could authors elaborate/comment on this? Western blot analysis would be also helpful to further support the antibody specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>The very weak unspecific staining in the testis for CYLC2 (in Cylc2-/-) and CYLC1 (in Cylc1-/y Cylc2+/-) is only present in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules and/or the residual bodies of the testicular sperm cells and can be referred to as background signal. Importantly, the signal is entirely lost in the PT region, proving specificity of the generated antibodies. We added the following paragraph to the results section:</p><p>Line 124-127: The generated antibodies did not stain testicular tissue and mature sperm of Cylc1- and Cylc2-deficient males, except for a very weak unspecific background staining in the lumen of seminiferous tubules and the residual bodies of testicular sperm (Fig. 1 F).</p><p>Specificity of antibodies was additionally proven by immunohistochemical staining, showing a specific staining only in testis sections but not in any other organ tested.</p><p>Line 115-117: Specificity of antibodies was proven by immunohistochemical stainings, showing a specific staining in testis sections only, but not in any other organ tested (Figure 1 – supplement 2)</p><p>To further verify the specificity of generated antibodies and the generation of functional knockout alleles, we additionally performed Western Blot analysis on cytoskeletal protein fractions, confirming the results of the IF staining. No unspecific bands were detected in the Western Blot, further supporting the notion that the weak unspecific signals in IF resemble staining artifacts.</p><p>The paragraph reads now as follows:</p><p>Line 127-132: Additionally, Western Blot analyses confirmed the absence of CYLC1 and CYLC2 in cytoskeletal protein fractions of the respective knockout (Fig. 1 G), thereby demonstrating (i) specificity of the antibodies and (ii) validating the gene knockout.

It is not common to see a gene dosage effect in the sperm phenotype as transcripts and proteins can be shared between haploids due to syncytium formation during spermatogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we apologize for the misinterpretation. In Cylc2+/- mice expression of Cylc2 was reduced by half but there was no altered phenotype observed. The sentence now reads as follows:</p><p>Line 112: In Cylc2+/- animals expression of Cylc2 was reduced by 50 %.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 194-196 - the authors say that the sperm are smaller, with shorter hooks and increased circularity of the nuclei, and reduced elongation. Are these statistically significant? There seems to be a high variation in the graph in S2D and the statistical analysis is not given.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, performed statistical analyses, and highlighted significantly altered values for sperm head elongation and circularity in Figure 2 – Supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 153-164 It is interesting that the absence of Cylc2 affected many parts of sperm structure. I think some ratios of sperm always have a morphological defect in diverse ways, so it is hard to confirm the finding only with a single sperm image. I think that it will be important to do some statistical analysis or at the minimum show more TEM images from TEM.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the observed morphological defects require a detailed statistical evaluation.

However, we think that the results are important to understand the role of Cylicins for male reproduction in general. The results obtained from the mouse model might be transferable to other species, including humans. Further, the results present a possible explanation for the subfertility of Cylc1-deficient mice, in contrast to infertility of Cylc2-deficient males. We shortened the section, the paragraph reads as follows:</p><p>Line 287-302: To address why Cylc2 deficiency causes more severe phenotypic alterations than Cylc1deficiency in mice, we performed evolutionary analysis of both genes. Analysis of the selective constrains on Cylc1 and Cylc2 across rodents and primates revealed that both genes’ coding sequences are conserved in general, although conservation is weaker in Cylc1 trending towards a more relaxed constraint (Fig. 6). A model allowing for separate calculation of the evolutionary rate for primates and rodents, did not detect a significant difference between the clades, neither for Cylc1 nor for Cylc2, indicating that the sequences are equally conserved in both clades.</p><p>To analyze the selective pressure across the coding sequence in more detail, we calculated the evolutionary rates for each codon site across the whole tree.

For Cylc2, 47% of codon sites conserved, 44% under neutral/relaxed constraint, and 9% positively selected. Interestingly, codon sites encoding lysine residues, which are proposed to be of functional importance for Cylicins, are mostly conserved. For Cylc1, 17% of lysine residues are significantly conserved and 35% of significantly conserved codons encode for lysine. For Cylc2, this pattern is even more pronounced with 27.9% of lysine codons being significantly conserved and 24.3% of all conserved sites encoding for lysine (Fig. 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Line 114, 115, 118 à Figure 1D is already well-described in the previous paragraph and thus redundant.

The PAS staining in figure 2 was replaced by HE-stained overview testis sections in Figure 3 – supplement 1 showing intact spermatogenesis in all genotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 130. Please indicate a reference for the lower limit of 58%. If this lower limit corresponds to human sperm, it should be omitted.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the given reference limit of 58% is only valid for human sperm samples. Therefore, we omitted the reference limit. The paragraph reads now as follows:Line 144-146: Eosin-Nigrosin staining revealed that the viability of epididymal sperm from all genotypes was not severely affected (Fig. 2 D, Figure 2 – supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. line 152 Sperm morphology. Before showing the ultrastructure of the sperm, it would be important to show sperm morphology observed by optical microscopy. Therefore, I recommend including figure S2 as a principal figure, with a mix of Figures 3B and 3E.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The results section was re-structured accordingly, first showing results of optical microscopy (Fig. 2), followed by an in-depth ultrastructural investigation of morphological defects and their effects on sperm motility. Brightfield images of epididymal sperm were moved from former Figure S2 to main Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 164. figure S2A, showing that the 9+2 pattern is normal in KO sperm, is not convincing. Enlargement is required to conclude that the axoneme structure is normal; from the pictures, it rather seems that some doublets are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the bad quality of the TEM pictures showing the axonemes. We recorded and included new images showing an intact 9+2 microtubular structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Line 196. I would suggest removing the term &quot;mild globozoospermia&quot;. Globozoospermia is rather complete (100% of round sperm heads) or incomplete (&lt;90 % of round sperm heads). The anomalies observed on sperm heads, sperm motility, and the decrease in sperm concentration are rather suggestive of an OAT.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we omitted the term “mild globozoospermia”. Instead, we added a concluding remark to the section, summarizing the described defects as OAT syndrome. The section reads now as follows:</p><p>Line 215-217: Taken together, observed anomalies of sperm heads, impaired sperm motility, and the decrease in epididymal sperm concentration show that Cylc deficiency results in a severe OAT phenotype (Oligo-Astheno-Teratozoospermia-syndrome) described in human.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Line 248. It is not clear from the data of figure 4B that &quot;the developing acrosome lost its compact adherence to the nuclear envelope&quot;. From this figure, only defective morphologies of the acrosome are observed</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we omitted the sentence. Furthermore, it does not add additional information to the manuscript, since defects in the attachment of the acrosome to the nuclear envelope have been described in detail in Figure 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. line 260-264. Manchette defects appear at stages 9-10. At this stage, the HTCA is already attached to the nucleus of the spermatid. see for instance figure 2 from Shang Y, Zhu F, Wang L, Ouyang YC, Dong MZ, Liu C, Zhao H, Cui X, Ma D, Zhang Z, Yang X, Guo Y, Liu F, Yuan L, Gao F, Guo X, Sun QY, Cao Y, Li W. Essential role for SUN5 in anchoring sperm head to the tail. Elife. 2017 Sep 25;6:e28199. doi: 10.7554/eLife.28199 . Therefore, the hypothesis that &quot;abnormal attachment of the developing flagellum to the basal plate and consequently flipping of the head and coiling of the tail in mature spermatozoa&quot; is unlikely and I suggest modifying this paragraph. In the HOOK paper, the manchette defects occurred earlier.</p></disp-quote><p>We read the suggested literature and we agree to this reviewer’s comment. Manchette defects that we observe appear at later stages and are probably not responsible for the morphological anomalies of the mature sperm. We also re-analyzed all the manchette staining pictures and didn’t find any defects at earlier stages, so we decided to delete the sentence from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Line 344. Please indicate a percentage of headless spermatozoa. Many sperm is too vague.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we quantified the percentage of sperm showing abnormal flagella and a headless phenotype. The paragraph reads now as follows:</p><p>Line 335-339: Bright field microscopy demonstrated that M2270’s sperm flagella coiled in a similar manner compared to flagella of sperm from Cylicin deficient mice. Quantification revealed 57% of M2270 sperm displaying abnormal flagella compared to 6% in the healthy donor (Fig. 7 D). Interestingly, DAPI staining revealed that 27% of M2270 flagella carry cytoplasmatic bodies without nuclei and could be defined as headless spermatozoa (Fig. 7 C, white arrowhead; Fig. 7 E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Any data concerning the success of ICSI for this patient?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the outcome of the ICSI were added to the main text.Line 309-311: The couple underwent one ICSI procedure which resulted in 17 fertilized oocytes out of 18 retrieved. Three cryo-single embryo transfers were performed in spontaneous cycles, but no pregnancy was achieved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Finally, it would be interesting to study the localization of PLCzeta in this model, since its localization in the perinuclear theca has been clearly shown (Escoffier et al, 2015 doi:10.1093/molehr/gau098 )</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion and performed PLCzeta staining on human sperm, clearly showing an irregular PT staining pattern in sperm of patient M2270 compared to healthy control sperm. Of note, staining was not possible in the mouse due to the antibody being reactive only for human samples.</p><p>The section reads as follows:</p><p>Line 343-349: Testis specific phospholipase C zeta 1 (PLCζ1) is localized in the postacrosomal region of PT in mammalian sperm (Yoon and Fissore, 2007) and has a role in generating calcium (Ca²⁺) oscillations that are necessary for oocyte activation (Yoon, 2008). Staining of healthy donor’s spermatozoa showed a previously described localization of PLCζ1 in the calyx, while sperm from M2270 patient presents signal irregularly through the PT surrounding sperm heads (Fig. 7 G). These results suggest that Cylicin deficiency can cause severe disruption of PT in human sperm as well, causing male infertility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Why the Cylc1-/y Cylc2+/- males were infertile? It would be helpful to show the homologue of the two proteins;</p></disp-quote><p>To elaborate more on the homology of CYLC1 and CYLC2, we added a more detailed section about the protein and domain structure to the introduction.</p><p>Line 73-78: In most species, two Cylicin genes, Cylc1 and Cylc2, have been identified (Figure 1supplement 1). They are characterized by repetitive lysine-lysine-aspartic acid (KKD) and lysine-lysineglutamic acid (KKE) peptide motifs, resulting in an isoelectric point (IEP) &gt; pH 10 14, 15. Repeating units of up to 41 amino acids in the central part of the molecules stand out by a predicted tendency to form individual short α-helices (Hess et al., 1993). Mammalian Cylicins exhibit similar protein and domain characteristics, but CYLC2 has a much shorter amino-terminal portion than CYLC1 (Figure 1supplement 1).</p><p>Speculations about the infertility of Cylc1-/y Cylc2+/- males was added to the discussion:</p><p>Line 410-413: Interestingly, Cylc1-/Y Cylc2+/- males displayed an “intermediate” phenotype, showing slightly less damaged sperm than Cylc2-/- and Cylc1-/Y Cylc2-/- animals. This further supports our notion, that loss of the less conserved Cylc1 gene might be at least partially compensated by the remaining Cylc2 allele.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Western blot is important to show the absence of the two proteins in the mouse models;</p></disp-quote><p>To further verify the specificity of generated antibodies and the generation of functional knockout alleles, we additionally performed Western Blot analysis on cytoskeletal protein fractions, confirming the results of the IF staining.</p><p>A paragraph was added to the manuscript and reads as follows:</p><p>Line 127-134: Additionally, Western Blot analyses confirmed the absence of CYLC1 and CYLC2 in cytoskeletal protein fractions of the respective knockout (Fig. 1 G), thereby demonstrating (i) specificity of the antibodies and (ii) validating the gene knockout. Of note, the CYLC1 antibody detects a double band at 40-45 KDa. This is smaller than the predicted size of 74 KDa as, but both bands were absent in Cylc1-/y. Similarly, the CYLC2 Antibody detected a double band at 38-40 KDa instead of 66 KDa. Again, both bands were absent in Cylc2-/-. Next, Mass spectrometry analysis of cytoskeletal protein fraction of mature spermatozoa was performed detecting both proteins in WT but not in the respective knockout samples (Figure 1 – supplement 5; Figure 1 – supplement 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. On Page 7, line 227 and line 243, was the acetylated α-tubulin or α-tubulin antibody used?</p></disp-quote><p>For all stainings α-tubulin antibody was used. We corrected this accordingly.Line 257-259: We used immunofluorescence staining of α-tubulin on squash testis samples containing spermatids at different stages of spermiogenesis to investigate whether the altered head shape, calyx structure, and tail-head connection anomalies originate from possible defects of the manchette structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Fig. 2S: A cartoon showing the elongation and circularity of nuclei for evaluation is helpful; The TEM images from the control and Cylc1 KO mice are needed;</p></disp-quote><p>Cylc1-/Y TEM picture was added in Figure 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The discussion should be rewritten. The current version is to repeat the experiments/findings. The authors should discuss more about the potential mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed the observed defects of Cylc-deficient animals and discussed this in relation to other published mouse models deficient in Calyx components. Furthermore, we speculated about potential interaction partners of Cylicins and the importance of these protein complexes for male fertility. However, to this point, we think that it is too farfetched to speculate about potential mechanisms without any evidence for Cylc interaction partner or their exact molecular function. This requires further research.</p></body></sub-article></article>
