These processes require multiple steps that are coordinated by the meiotic cell cycle and monitored by surveillance mechanisms. In diverse species, failures in chromosome synapsis can trigger a cell cycle delay and/or lead to apoptosis. How this key step in ‘homolog engagement’ is sensed and transduced by meiotic cells is unknown. Here we report that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, recruitment of the Polo-like kinase PLK-2 to the synaptonemal complex triggers phosphorylation and inactivation of CHK-2, an early meiotic kinase required for pairing, synapsis, and double-strand break (DSB) induction. Inactivation of CHK-2 terminates DSB formation and enables CO designation and cell cycle progression. These findings illuminate how meiotic cells ensure CO formation and accurate chromosome segregation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most animals, plants, and fungi reproduce sexually, meaning that the genetic information from two parents combines during fertilization to produce offspring. This parental genetic information is carried within the reproductive cells in the form of chromosomes. Reproductive cells in the ovaries or testes first multiply through normal cell division, but then go through a unique type of cell division called meiosis. During meiosis, pairs of chromosomes – the two copies inherited from each parent – must find each other and physically line up from one end to the other. As they align side-by-side with their partners, chromosomes also go through a mixing process called recombination, during which regions of one chromosome cross over to the paired chromosome to exchange information. Scientists are still working to understand how this process of chromosome alignment and crossing-over is controlled.</p><p>If chromosomes fail to line up or cross over during meiosis, eggs or sperm can end up with too many or too few chromosomes. If these faulty reproductive cells combine during fertilization this can lead to birth defects and developmental problems. To minimize this problem, reproductive cells have a quality control mechanism during meiosis called “crossover assurance”, which limits how often mistakes occur. </p><p>Zhang et al. have investigated how cells can tell if their chromosomes have accomplished this as they undergo meiosis. They looked at egg cells of the roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic>, whose meiotic processes are similar to those in humans. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a protein called CHK-2 regulates many of the early events during meiosis. During successful meiosis, CHK-2 is active for only a short amount of time. But if there are problems during recombination, CHK-2 stays active for longer and prevents the cell division from proceeding.</p><p>Zhang et al. uncovered another protein that affects for how long CHK-2 stays switched on. When chromosomes align with their partners, a protein called PLK-2 sticks to other proteins at the interface between the aligned chromosomes. A combination of microscopy and test tube experiments showed that when PLK-2 is bound to this specific location, it can turn off CHK-2. However, if the chromosome alignment fails, PLK-2 is not activated to switch off CHK-2. Therefore, CHK-2 is only switched off when the chromosomes are properly aligned and move on to the next step in crossing-over, which then allows meiosis to proceed. Thus, PLK-2 and CHK-2 work together to detect errors and to slow down meiosis if necessary.</p><p>Further experiments in mammalian reproductive cells will reveal how similar the crossover assurance mechanism is in different organisms. In the future, improved understanding of quality control during meiosis may eventually lead to improvements in assisted reproduction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>Polo-like kinase</kwd><kwd>synaptonemal complex</kwd><kwd>DNA double-strand break</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>auxin-inducible degradation</kwd><kwd>crossover</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dernburg</surname><given-names>Abby F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM065591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dernburg</surname><given-names>Abby F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and cytological analyses reveal a regulatory circuit that controls a key cell cycle transition during meiosis and mediates feedback regulation in response to meiotic defects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiotic progression differs in many ways from a mitotic cell cycle. A single round of DNA replication at meiotic entry is followed by two nuclear divisions. Between replication and the first division is an extended period known as meiotic prophase, during which chromosomes pair, align through the process of synapsis, and recombine to establish physical links (chiasmata) between each pair of homologs. Together with sister chromatid cohesion, chiasmata direct bipolar orientation and segregation of homologous chromosomes during Meiosis I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hillers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ur and Corbett, 2021</xref>). Synapsis and recombination are monitored by meiotic checkpoints that can delay cell cycle progression and/or lead to apoptosis when these processes are impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Subramanian and Hochwagen, 2014</xref>).</p><p>During early meiosis, double-strand breaks (DSBs) are induced and resected. These recombination intermediates undergo strand invasion to establish joint molecules between homologs, which recruit a set of factors collectively known as ‘pro-crossover’ or ‘ZMM’ proteins. Many of these intermediates eventually lose the ZMM proteins and are resolved as non-crossovers, while the subset that retains these factors is ‘designated’ to be resolved as crossovers (COs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pyatnitskaya et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, formation and initial processing of DSBs requires the activity of CHK-2, a meiosis-specific homolog of the DNA damage transducing kinase Chk2/CHEK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacQueen and Villeneuve, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oishi et al., 2001</xref>). CHK-2 is eventually inactivated at mid-pachytene; based on cytological markers, this roughly coincides with cessation of DSB formation and the resolution of many intermediates through a ‘generic’ (as opposed to meiosis-specific) homologous recombination pathway. A similar transition during mid-prophase has been described in budding yeast and mammals. In each case, this progression depends on assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a meiosis-specific protein scaffold that assembles between homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Enguita-Marruedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kauppi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murakami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nadarajan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thacker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wojtasz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>CHK-2 is inactive in proliferating germline stem cells and becomes active upon meiotic entry. The mechanism of activation has not been fully established, but it is promoted by targeted degradation of a CHK-2 inhibitor, PPM-1.D/Wip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baudrimont et al., 2022</xref>). Work in budding yeast has shown that a CHK-2 ortholog, Mek1, undergoes trans-autophosphorylation of its activation loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carballo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niu et al., 2007</xref>); this mechanism is likely conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> since the activation loop of CHK-2 also contains a CHK-2 consensus phosphorylation motif (R-x-x-S/T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Neill et al., 2002</xref>). Like all Chk2 homologs, CHK-2 contains a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and thus recognizes phosphorylated motifs of the consensus (pT-X-X-[I/L/V]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durocher and Jackson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2000</xref>). While mammalian Chk2 undergoes homodimerization through binding of its FHA domain to N-terminal motifs phosphorylated by ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>), the meiosis-specific Mek1 (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>) and CHK-2 (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) kinases lack this regulatory domain. Activation is likely promoted by binding of these kinases to target motifs on other proteins, such as Hop1 in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carballo et al., 2008</xref>), resulting in high local concentrations that enable intermolecular trans-phosphorylation. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Pairing Center proteins HIM-8 and ZIM-1, -2, -3 contain FHA-binding motifs that recruit CHK-2 during early meiotic prophase. By phosphorylating a Polo box interacting motif on these proteins, CHK-2 primes the recruitment of the Polo-like kinase PLK-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Together, CHK-2 and PLK-2 at Pairing Centers modify NE proteins including lamin (LMN-1) and the LINC protein SUN-1, which promotes chromosome pairing and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Link et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Penkner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woglar et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, CHK-2 is required for chromosome pairing as well as for DSB induction.</p><p>During early pachytene, recombination intermediates are established along chromosomes and can be detected as foci by immunofluorescence. By mid-pachytene, most of these recombination intermediates disappear, while six ‘designated crossover’ foci, which show strong localization of the cyclin homolog COSA-1 and other pro-CO factors, are detected in each nucleus, one per chromosome pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woglar and Villeneuve, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yokoo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). This accumulation of pro-CO proteins at the sites that will eventually become crossovers is termed ‘crossover designation’. Collectively, pro-CO factors are thought to prevent non-CO resolution and eventually promote the resolution of these late intermediates as COs. The mechanism and timing of CO resolution in <italic>C. elegans</italic> remain somewhat unclear.</p><p>Defects in synapsis or establishment of CO intermediates result in activation of a ‘crossover assurance checkpoint’ and a delay in cell cycle progression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Activation of the checkpoint is detected cytologically as an extended region of CHK-2 activity. Based on nuclear morphology and cytological reporters of CHK-2 activity, defects in synapsis prolong the ‘transition zone’ (leptotene/zygotene) stage of meiosis, which is characterized by clustering of chromosomes and high CHK-2 activity, while defects in recombination result in a prolonged ‘early pachytene’ stage, with more dispersed chromosomes and intermediate level of CHK-2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). In mutants that are competent to form some COs despite defects in synapsis or recombination, the region of nuclei displaying a limited number of ‘designated’ CO sites is also shifted proximally within the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stamper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woglar and Villeneuve, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). This feedback regulation requires a family of HORMA domain proteins that bind to the chromosome axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), but how cells detect defects in synapsis or CO intermediates and how CHK-2 activity is prolonged remain unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CHK-2 inhibits CO designation</title><p>To monitor the activity of CHK-2 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we used a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes CHK-2-dependent phosphorylation sites on the four paralogous Pairing Center proteins HIM-8 and ZIM-1, -2, and -3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Co-staining of pHIM-8/ZIMs and GFP::COSA-1 confirmed that CO designation occurs concomitantly with loss of CHK-2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Since CHK-2 inactivation and CO designation are both delayed in mutants that activate the CO assurance checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), we wondered whether CHK-2 activity inhibits CO designation. Because CHK-2 activity during early meiotic prophase is essential for DSB formation and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacQueen and Villeneuve, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oishi et al., 2001</xref>), and thus for the establishment of recombination intermediates that are prerequisite for CO designation, we exploited the auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system to deplete the CHK-2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Activity of degron-tagged CHK-2 became undetectable in meiotic nuclei within 3 hr of auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Depletion of CHK-2 shifted the appearance of nuclei containing bright COSA-1 foci to a more distal (earlier) position in the germline, indicative of accelerated CO designation and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Temporal profile of CHK-2 activity and crossover designation during meiotic prophase in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of meiotic prophase in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite germline. The distal tip of the gonad is oriented on the left side in this schematic and in all other figures. Meiotic progression is readily visualized due to the simple organization of the germline. Cells exit proliferation and enter meiosis in the distal ‘arms’ of the gonad and move proximally toward the spermatheca and uterus at a velocity of about one cell row per hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). Homolog pairing and synapsis and double-strand break (DSB) induction normally occur during the first few hours following meiotic entry, in the ‘transition zone’ region corresponding to leptotene and zygotene. DSBs are then processed to form recombination intermediates, which increase in abundance during early pachytene. At mid-pachytene, a transition occurs that leads to disappearance of most intermediates. One recombination intermediate on each pair of chromosomes becomes ‘designated’ as an eventual crossover site.

The intensity of GFP::COSA-1 foci remains fairly constant throughout this last stage. In this work, we use the appearance of bright COSA-1 foci as a proxy for crossover designation and the mid-pachytene cell cycle transition.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84492-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CHK-2 inhibits crossover (CO) designation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative hermaphrodite gonads stained for GFP::COSA-1 (green), SYP-1 (magenta), and DNA (blue).

Consistent with this, tagged CHK-2 was difficult to detect on western blots from wild-type animals, even following immunoprecipitation. Based on other evidence (see below) we suspected that phosphorylation of CHK-2 might lead to its degradation. We thus exploited the AID system to deplete PAS-1, a subunit of the 20S proteasome, as a potential way to increase the abundance of CHK-2. Under conditions in which PAS-1 was efficiently depleted, CHK-2 was clearly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Mass spectrometry analyses of the immunoprecipitates revealed that CHK-2 is indeed phosphorylated on Thr120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To test the role of phosphorylation on the corresponding serine (S116) and/or T120 of CHK-2, we mutated each of these sites to nonphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic residues. Surprisingly, the abundance of all these mutant CHK-2 proteins was much lower than the wild-type protein; only S116A was detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with the reduced abundance of CHK-2 protein, mutation of these residues led to loss of CHK-2 function: phopsho-HIM-8/ZIMs was not detectable and bivalent formation was defective; only S116A was partially functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These observations suggest that these mutations destabilize CHK-2 in addition to potentially inhibiting substrate binding.</p><p>To determine whether PLK-2 is important for meiotic progression independent of its role in homolog pairing and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Labella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sato-Carlton et al., 2017</xref>), we used a degron-tagged allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).

We scored the timing of CO designation as the fraction of the length of the region of the gonad spanning meiotic prophase (prior to diplotene–diakinesis) in which nuclei display bright COSA-1 foci, since this ratio is fairly consistent for a given genotype/condition, more so than the absolute length of this zone or number of nuclei. The ‘bright COSA-1 zone’ was reduced from 55% of prophase in wild-type hermaphrodites to 44% in <italic>plk-2</italic> null mutants, 37% in PLK-2::AID+auxin, and 20% in syp-1(T452A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, D</xref>). The delay in <italic>plk-2</italic> null mutants is likely due in part to earlier prophase defects, including delayed pairing and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Labella et al., 2011</xref>). Depletion of PLK-2 caused less disruption of these early events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). SYP-1<sup>T452A</sup> caused even milder defects in pairing and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brandt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sato-Carlton et al., 2017</xref>), but a more dramatic delay in CHK-2 inactivation and CO designation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C–F</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B, D</xref>). These differences are likely due to the ability of PLK-1 to partially substitute for PLK-2 in inactivating CHK-2 (see below), while SYP-1<sup>T452A</sup> cannot recruit either PLK-1 or PLK-2. This supports the conclusion that recruitment of Polo-like kinase to SCs is important for CHK-2 inactivation and CO designation.</p><p>Although mutation or depletion of PLK-2 or failure to recruit it to the SC delayed inactivation of CHK-2, markers for CHK-2 activity eventually disappeared and CO designation was detected in all these strains. We thus wondered how CHK-2 is inactivated in the absence of PLK-2. In <italic>plk-2</italic> null mutants, PLK-1 can partially substitute at Pairing Centers to promote pairing and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Labella et al., 2011</xref>). We tested whether PLK-1 might compensate for loss of PLK-2 in late prophase, as it does during early meiosis, by co-depleting both paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Compared to PLK-2 depletion alone, CO designation was further delayed when PLK-1 and PLK-2 were both depleted, indicating that PLK-1 can indeed contribute to CHK-2 inactivation during late prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). However, CHK-2 was still eventually inactivated in the absence of both paralogs. We also tested whether the nonessential Plk1 homolog <italic>plk-3</italic> can promote CO designation. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harper et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>plk-3</italic> mutants showed no apparent meiotic defects, and we observed no further delay when we combined a <italic>plk-3</italic> deletion with depletion of PLK-1 and PLK-2 (data not shown). Thus, PLK-3 does not contribute to inactivating CHK-2, even in the absence of PLK-1 and PLK-2.</p><p>The ERK kinase MPK-1 promotes pachytene exit and has been proposed to be important for CO designation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Church et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nadarajan et al., 2016</xref>). We used the AID system to test whether MPK-1 promotes CHK-2 inactivation or CO designation. MPK-1::AID was undetectable in germ cells following 1 hr of auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although depletion of MPK-1 led to a disordered appearance of the proximal germline, it did not cause any apparent delay in CO designation, either alone or in combination with <italic>syp-1<sup>T452A</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>). We thus conclude that MPK-1 activity does not play a role in CO designation. We speculate that a rise in CDK activity and/or other spatially regulated signals in the proximal gonad may lead to CHK-2 inactivation even when Polo-like kinase activity is absent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, we find that CHK-2 activity is required to inhibit CO designation. CHK-2 is normally inactivated at mid-pachytene through the recruitment of PLK-2 to the SC and the formation of CO precursors, but delays in synapsis prevent the activation of PLK-2 and thereby prolong CHK-2 activity. Notably, delays in the establishment of CO intermediates also prolong CHK-2 activity, and thus full activation of PLK-2 may depend on the formation of CO intermediates on all chromosomes. Consistent with this idea, PLK-2-dependent phosphorylation of the central region protein SYP-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nadarajan et al., 2017</xref>) increase markedly starting at mid-pachytene, concomitant with CO designation. How the formation of CO precursors promotes PLK-2 activity remains unclear, but the kinase does appear to associate with designated CO sites even when it cannot be recruited to the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our data support the idea that PLK-2 directly regulates CHK-2 via inhibitory phosphorylation, but do not rule out the possibility that recruitment of PLK-2 to the SC leads indirectly to CHK-2 inactivation. A recent study reported that CHK-2 inactivation is reversible through mid-pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castellano-Pozo et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with the idea that it occurs through phosphorylation, which can be reversed by phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kar and Hochwagen, 2021</xref>). We speculate that phosphorylated CHK-2 may be degraded after mid-pachytene, resulting in irreversible inactivation.</p><p>Intriguingly, both CHK-2 and PLK-2 are active during leptotene/zygotene, when both kinases are bound to Pairing Centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Link et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Penkner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woglar et al., 2013</xref>), implying that in this context PLK-2 does not inactivate CHK-2. We speculate that the configuration of CHK-2 and PLK-2 recruitment motifs on the Pairing Center proteins may make the target site(s) in the FHA domain of CHK-2 inaccessible to the active site of PLK-2. However, the activity of CHK-2 in early prophase also depends on an enigmatic meiotic regulator of PLK-2 activity, a heterodimeric complex of HAL-2 and HAL-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roelens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). This may inhibit or antagonize phosphorylation of CHK-2. Further work will be needed to clarify how CHK-2 and PLK-2 work in concert at pairing centers during early meiosis, while PLK-2 antagonizes CHK-2 later in meiotic prophase.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, synapsis can occur normally in the absence of DSBs or recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>), and meiocytes surveil both synapsis and CO precursors to ensure chiasma formation and faithful segregation (reviewed by ). In organisms where synapsis depends on the stabilization of interhomolog joint molecules through the ‘ZMM’ pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pyatnitskaya et al., 2019</xref>), cells may monitor synapsis as a proxy for the presence of CO-competent intermediates. However, in either case, SC assembly is essential for the surveillance. In mouse spermatocytes, PLK-1 localizes along SCs and promotes pachytene exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jordan et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, similar mechanisms may coordinate synapsis with meiotic progression in other organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains</title><p>All <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained on standard nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with OP50 bacteria at 20°C.

We considered various ways to circumvent this issue, including expressing these mutant alleles in the presence of a degradable wild-type copy (as suggested above). However, as the reviewers/editors have noted, such experiments can be technically challenging. One barrier is the challenges associated with expression of transgenes in the germline of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. While methods for single-copy insertion (e.g., MosSCI or Cas9-based editing) have enabled germline expression of transgenes, this often fails to recapitulate the expression levels of endogenous genes. This is usually attributed to the presence of multiple potent and silencing pathways (including RNAi and piRNAs) in the germline. It is particularly daunting to introduce <italic>chk-2</italic> transgenes, since <italic>chk-2</italic> is an unusually large gene for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (~8 kb), well beyond the typical size of insertions made with CRISPR/Cas9, MosSCI, or other available transgenic methods. Moreover, the endogenous <italic>chk-2</italic> is on a chromosome arm; such distally positioned genes are typically protected from germline silencing by mechanisms that remain poorly understood, further complicating efforts to design and introduce additional copies. Thus, we feel that the effort required to overcome the technical barriers to such experiments outweighs any potential information that they would yield.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some attempts to differentiate between the requirement of the kinases vs the requirement of their kinase activity would be highly beneficial for the manuscript. Once again, given that these kinases play roles earlier in meiosis, the use of kinase-dead alleles might not be possible. Have the authors tried an analog-sensitive strategy to inhibit kinase activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, as well as the reviewers’ recognition (again) that such experiments might be technically prohibitive. We agree that it would potentially be helpful to determine whether the role of PLK-2 and/or CHK-2 in promoting crossover designation can be separated from their kinase activities. We have engineered analog-sensitive alleles to inhibit PLK-1 and PLK-2 (as well as CDK-2) in other contexts, but this approach was not useful here for 2 reasons: (1) the degree of inhibition was somewhat variable, and more crucially, (2) the kinetics of inhibition were not rapid enough to allow for activity of the Polo-like kinases during early meiosis and inhibition shortly thereafter. The activity of most small molecules, including ATP analogs, in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> is severely limited by the low permeability of the worm cuticle and/or the activity of efflux pumps. We also found that CHK-2 is refractory to the analog-sensitive approach; our efforts to engineer such alleles resulted in severe loss of kinase activity in the absence of inhibitors.</p><p>Auxin (indole acetic acid) is unusually small and water-soluble, and thus diffuses relatively quickly into the germline. It often induces robust protein degradation in ~1 hour, and this approach enabled us to induce degradation of CHK-2 and PLK-1/2 far more quickly than we could inhibit the kinase activity of PLK-1/2 using ATP analogs. Even this approach is limited by diffusion; we know that auxin-induced degradation can occur markedly faster in other experimental contexts, including in oocytes and embryos freshly dissected from adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Thus, we do not have suitable tools to address this issue beyond what we have already included in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, please go over the reviewers' comments carefully as some of them point out that some claims might need rewording.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It is worth clarifying in the Results section how long it takes for a nucleus to progress through prophase I (i.e., was the protein depleted for the entirety of meiosis up to the point that the nuclei were imaged, or was the protein only depleted for part of prophase I?)</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed this in the figure legend of Figure 1A. Cells enter meiosis in the distal “arms” of the gonad and move proximally towards the spermatheca and uterus at a velocity of about one cell diameter per hour (Deshong et al., 2014). This should be regarded as a rough approximation and varies over the reproductive lifespan of adult hermaphrodites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1:4 – &quot;CHK-2-dependent phosphorylation sites on HIM-8 and ZIM-1/2/3 at Pairing Centers&quot; – I'm assuming this means this happens exclusively at pairing centers and not that the antibody only works at pairing centers, but the wording could imply the latter.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this.

But we feel it is not easy to precisely describe the denominator using simple words without causing confusion. So, we prefer just to indicate that the axis is a ratio on the graph and rely on the readers to read the figure legend if they need the detailed information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1D, the bright green of GFP::COSA-1 in the graph is a bit challenging to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the color to grey to improve readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2</p><p>The color of SYP-1 (or at least the color of the text-the pseudocoloring of the microscopy appears to be magenta) should be changed to magenta to make the figure accessible to colorblind readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for noting this; we have made the suggested change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2-S1:</p><p>Change the color of RAD-51 to magenta.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the color of RAD-51 to magenta.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3-S1:</p><p>The text size of the axes and labels of the mass spec graph could be increased to improve legibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made these changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4-S1 and associated Methods text:</p><p>Were the gain and/or brightness and contrast modified to account for the intense pHIM-8/ZIMs staining? If so, it would be informative to include this in the Microscopy methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We think the reviewer is referring to the difference of pHIM-8/ZIMs intensity in the pre-meiotic nuclei in control and PLK-depleted worms. The intense signal in pre-meiotic nuclei does not correspond to HIM-8/ZIMs, but instead to an unknown epitope recognized by the antibody in mitotic cells (Kim et al., 2015). The intensity of this pre-meiotic epitope is greatly elevated by PLK-1/2 depletion, presumably due to arrest in mitosis. We adjusted the brightness in this figure to reveal the pHIM-8/ZIMs signal in meiotic nuclei, but the background intensity outside meiotic nuclei were kept the same in control and PLK-depleted worms, allowing comparison of signal intensity between different conditions. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 2 legend: &quot;Dashed green lines indicate the earliest nuclei with bright COSA-1 foci and the end of pachytene, respectively.&quot; – please clarify that the &quot;respectively&quot; refers to the left line and the right line.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the review for this suggestion.

Otherwise, this should be marked as speculation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now elaborated our description of the differences seen in synapsis- versus DSB/recombination-deficient mutants. As reported in Kim et al. (2015) and elsewhere, synapsis defects prolong the clustered chromosome morphology (sometimes described as a “crescent-shaped” DAPI-staining mass) characteristic of the leptotene-zygotene stage, while defects in DSB induction or recombination result in an extended “early pachytene” stage, with chromosomes distributed around the nuclear periphery. More and brighter foci of phosphorylated HIM-8/ZIM proteins are seen in transition-zone like nuclei than in early pachytene nuclei, indicating that the level of CHK-2 activity, at least at the Pairing Centers, is higher in leptotene/zygotene than in early pachytene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p. 9 line 5: The authors speculate that phosphorylation of CHK-2 T120 leads to CHK-2 degradation, which is plausible given their results; the unexpected finding that blocking this phosphorylation with mutation to alanine (Figure 3 sup. 2) also apparently leads to instability should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed this in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p. 9: the non-phosphorylatable alleles of CHK-2 turned out to be loss-of-function alleles, so the specific questions of whether phosphorylation of T120 or S116 leads to inactivation could not be asked in this work.
