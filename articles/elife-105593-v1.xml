aggravates neuron damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the restoration of BBB in the chronic stage after stroke remain unclear. Here, pericyte pool alterations and their consequences for BBB integrity and brain recovery were analyzed in the C57BL/6 mice stroke model. Lineage tracing, RNA-seq, and immunofluorescence staining revealed endothelial cell (EC) transdifferentiation into pericytes (E-pericytes) in C57BL/6 mice after stroke. E-pericytes depletion by diphtheria toxin A (DTA) aggravated BBB leakage and exacerbated neurological deficits in the MCAO model. The myeloid cell-driven transdifferentiation of ECs into pericytes accelerated BBB restoration and brain self-repair after stroke via endothelial-mesenchymal transformation (EndoMT). Decreasing the number of E-pericytes by specific knockout of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene in ECs also aggravated BBB leakage and exacerbated neurological deficits. EC-specific overexpression of the <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> gene promoting E-pericytes transdifferentiation reduced BBB leakage and exerted neuroprotective effects. Deciphering the mechanism by which E-pericytes coordinate post-stroke recovery may reveal a novel therapeutic opportunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>brain injury</kwd><kwd>brain recovery</kwd><kwd>BBB spontaneous recovery</kwd><kwd>NVU</kwd><kwd>EC</kwd><kwd>pericyte</kwd><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd><kwd>cell fate</kwd><kwd>cell biology</kwd><kwd>neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Projects # 32170961</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Jie-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100022963</institution-id><institution>Key R&amp;D Program of Zhejiang</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024SSYS0031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Jie-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Westlake Laboratory of Life Sciences and Biomedicine HRHI program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202309002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Jie-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Westlake Laboratory of Life Sciences and Biomedicine HRHI program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202109013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Jie-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82101475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Zhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Changes in the pericyte pool after stroke affect the restoration of the blood-brain barrier function and brain self-repair, and offer a new approach to therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All vertebrate creatures have evolved strategies for tissue repair after an accident or conflict, and effective tissue repair is critical for survival. The liver is the unique solid organ capable of precisely regulating its mass through regeneration to maintain the liver-to-body mass ratio within the optimal range required for metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michalopoulos and Bhushan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michalopoulos and DeFrances, 1997</xref>). Vascular repair is crucial in liver regeneration and skin wound healing because blood vessels can provide nutrients and oxygen to facilitate tissue restoration and functional recovery in the chronic stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singhal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peña and Martin, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2017</xref>). The liver and skin demonstrate a powerful ability for tissue self-repair, which benefits from vascular repair. As one of the most important organs, current knowledge and research on the contribution of vascular repair to brain self-repair are inadequate.</p><p>Stroke results in large-scale cell death because of ongoing ischemia and hypoxia, which remains a major cause of adult disability and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broughton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gorelick, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feigin et al., 2018</xref>). The definitive spontaneous repairing processes in the brain remain largely unknown after stroke, and the decoding and harnessing of these processes may accelerate brain recovery, which usually takes years. Until recently, such efforts mainly involved protective trophic factors and cell transplants designed to rescue or replace a specific population of neurons, and the results have largely been disappointing in clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartus and Johnson, 2017</xref>). Treatments to reduce neuronal death and limit acute damage are desirable by timely restoring blood vessel reperfusion in the acute phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Juttler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2024</xref>). No proven medical therapies exist for restoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the chronic phase. Unfortunately, the knowledge of brain self-repair by remedying vascular vessels after stroke in the chronic repair phase is still rare.</p><p>The vascular hierarchy comprises arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins. Nutrient and gas exchange occur primarily in the capillary beds, up to 90% of blood vessel length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murrant and Fletcher, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iadecola et al., 2023</xref>). Capillaries are mainly composed of endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes, which safeguard the functions of capillary beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trimm and Red-Horse, 2023</xref>). ECs and pericytes respond to different reactions and fates after stroke. Pericytes rapidly exhibited apoptosis and death after stroke; nevertheless, ECs tolerated ischemia and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2014</xref>). When pericytes are lost, the functions of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and CBF are destroyed. The BBB serves as a selectively permeable interface that precisely regulates substance exchange between the circulation and the central nervous system (CNS), thereby maintaining the specialized microenvironment essential for proper neuronal signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2010</xref>). Effective CBF is essential for cell survival in the brain after stroke. The prevention of BBB leakage and the decrease of CBF due to pericyte loss is important for vascular and neurological functions after stroke.</p><p>The endothelium is capable of remarkable plasticity. Certain ECs in the embryo undergo hematopoietic transition, giving rise to multi-lineage hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which are crucial for developing the blood system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yokomizo and Suda, 2024</xref>). ECs can undergo EndoMT, acquiring mesenchymal properties. The process is important in various pathological conditions, such as fibrosis and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu and Kovacic, 2023</xref>). Endocardial ECs are progenitors of pericytes and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the murine embryonic heart via EndoMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Protein C receptor-expressing (Procr<sup>+</sup>) ECs would give rise to de novo formation of ECs and pericytes in the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). In situ, is there a self-repair mechanism to replenish the pericytes pool from ECs for protection functions of blood vessels after stroke in the chronic repair phase that is unknown?</p><p>In the acute and subacute phases after stroke, myeloid cells were dominant immune cells entering the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang and McCullough, 2024</xref>). Most myeloid cells could not occupy the ischemic brain for a long time and faded away by releasing various factors, including pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and trophic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beuker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shichita et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gliem et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sas et al., 2020</xref>). Blocking myeloid cell recruitment using anti-CCR2 antibody and <italic>CCR2</italic> gene knockout mice impaired long-term spontaneous behavioral recovery after stroke via reducing anti-inflammatory macrophages and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pedragosa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wattananit et al., 2016</xref>). In mice subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doyle et al., 2010</xref>), TGFβ1 was predominantly co-localized with CD68<sup>+</sup> activated microglia and macrophages. Importantly, TGFβ1 contributed to angiogenic pathogenesis in human stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krupinski et al., 1996</xref>). At the same time, TGFβ is the main driver of EndoMT, which is involved in endothelial-to-pericytic transition in the murine embryonic heart and mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooley et al., 2014</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether myeloid cells can drive endothelial-to-pericytic transition via EndoMT to replenish the pericyte pool and remedy the functions of vascular vessels after stroke in the chronic phase.</p><p>Transdifferentiation of ECs into E-pericytes replenishes the pericyte pool, critically contributing to BBB restoration and brain self-repair after stroke. In the MCAO model, ischemic injury triggered endothelial-to-pericytic transition, driven by myeloid cells via the TGFβ1-TGFβR2-EndoMT pathway. The dynamic changes in E-pericyte numbers directly influenced BBB integrity and long-term functional recovery. The previously overlooked mechanism not only restores the pericyte pool but also enhances endogenous brain repair, offering a novel therapeutic avenue for stroke recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Changes in the pericyte pool after stroke</title><p>To understand endothelial-to-pericytic transition and its regulatory mechanisms post-stroke, initial efforts targeted changes in the pericyte pool. The MCAO model in mice was employed to mimic stroke conditions in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beuker et al., 2022</xref>).

However, pericyte-specific transcription factor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>), pericyte-enriched transmembrane receptor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H</xref>), and pericyte-enriched ligand genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2I</xref>) were not expressed or expressed at low levels in ECs but expressed in EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs. Therefore, EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs acquired a pericyte-like transcriptome after stroke. Compared with ECs at RP34D, EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs showed significant upregulation of 379 genes and downregulation of 220 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2J</xref>). GO analysis of upregulated DEGs in EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs (top 10 GO terms) showed enhanced aerobic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2K</xref>), whereas ECs exhibited greater dependence on anaerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Bock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falkenberg et al., 2019</xref>). KEGG pathway analysis of the upregulated DEGs in EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs was most significantly enriched in EC migration, epithelial cell migration, epithelial and tissue migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2J</xref>), which was consistent with the detachment of EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs from blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Transcriptomic data indicated pericyte-like features in EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs, contrasting with immunofluorescence evidence of EC-derived pericyte-like cells post-stroke. Therefore, EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs are named E-pericytes, as they are derived from ECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Depletion of E-pericytes impedes BBB repair</title><p>During both development and adulthood, pericytes maintain BBB function.

Macrophages actively secreted metabolites during regeneration to establish immune-muscle stem cells (MuSCs) cross talk in a GSDMD-dependent manner to promote tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2024</xref>). Cerebral ischemic injury and repair involve both cerebral cells and the immune system, which play a critical role in determining stroke outcomes. Studies had shown that <italic>CCR2</italic> knockout and pharmacological inhibition of CCR2 attenuated MDM-induced acute brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2018</xref>). However, MDMs recruited to the injured brain after ischemic stroke contribute to long-term spontaneous functional recovery during the chronic stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wattananit et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of MDMs to promote functional recovery was because macrophages were polarized toward the anti-inflammatory phenotype and promoted angiogenesis during the recovery stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wattananit et al., 2016</xref>). However, the precise role of myeloid cells in angiogenesis and spontaneous behavioral recovery after stroke remains to be elucidated. Inhibiting the infiltration of myeloid cells into the brain could reduce the number of CD31<sup>+</sup> ECs, implying the decrease of angiogenesis. Furthermore, the suppression of myeloid cell-derived TGFβ1 in the brain restrained endothelial-to-pericytic transition and decreased the pool of pericytes. Pericytes play a vital role in angiogenesis and maintaining the stability of newly formed blood vessels. Myeloid cells promote angiogenesis by driving endothelial-to-pericytic transition. Their inhibition reduces pericyte numbers, ultimately impairing angiogenesis and CBF.</p><p>During the acute phase of stroke, ischemia and hypoxia lead to rapid death of pericytes, which increases BBB leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2010</xref>). Although the decrease of pericytes during the acute phase of stroke has been reported, there is almost no research on the pericyte pool during the chronic phase. During the chronic phase of stroke, the pericyte pool gradually increased, including both the self-proliferation of pericytes and the conversion of ECs to pericytes. E-pericytes were crucial for the function of vascular vessels during brain self-repair. Depletion of E-pericytes led to the loss of vascular self-recovery function, including BBB integrity and CBF recanalization, and impaired neurological recovery. Increasing the number of E-pericytes reduced Evans blue leakage, augmented CBF, and promoted neurological recovery, which suggested the importance of E-pericytes for blood vessel self-recovery.</p><p>Unlike the liver and skin, owing to powerful self-healing ability, stroke can lead to severe disability due to the limited capacity of cerebral cells to regenerate or replace dead cells, especially neurons. Exploring and confirming therapeutic theory for neurons and other cells protection is necessary for stroke. Synapse-level reconstruction of neural circuits and remyelination are involved in the recoverable process via various neurotrophic factors and cell transplants, which also are confronted with rigorous challenges to maintain long-term survival because of lack of effective blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Svara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanes and Zipursky, 2020</xref>). A novel pathway for brain self-repair during the chronic phase of stroke was identified. ECs can give rise to pericytes to replenish the pool, accelerating the restoration of BBB function. E-pericytes stimulated angiogenesis and reversed the no-reflow phenomenon, leading to restored blood flow and elevated CBF in the ischemic brain. All the above improvements are beneficial in promoting neuron survival and functional recovery after stroke.</p><p>There is no doubt that the brain also has a limited ability to repair itself, which is not as strong as the liver and skin, but if the brain’s ability to repair itself can be amplified, it will be huge progress for the therapy of stroke. The role of TGFβ family members in angiogenesis is underscored by the observations that nearly all mice with knockout of specific TGFβ family members died during midgestation due to yolk sac angiogenesis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goumans et al., 2009</xref>). Mutations in the genes encoding TGFβ pathway components are linked to an increasing number of human pathologies involving vascular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">ten Dijke and Arthur, 2007</xref>). Increasing TGFβR2 expression could increase the number of E-pericytes, reduce BBB leakage, increase CBF, and accelerate neurological functional recovery. Thus, the TGFβ1-TGFβR2 pathway is a potential therapeutic agent for promoting brain self-repair after stroke. At the same time, ECs can be transformed into pericytes in other tissues after ischemia, suggesting that activation of the TGFβ1-TGFβR2 pathway may also be involved in the repair of other tissues.</p><p>In summary, transdifferentiation from ECs to pericytes is identified post-stroke, mediating both cellular reprogramming and recovery of BBB integrity and neurological function. E-pericytes are driven by infiltrating myeloid cells, which release TGFβ1 to induce ECs subjected to EndoMT. The discovery of E-pericytes in fueling the destructive pericyte pool to remedy the functions of the lost pericytes after stroke indicates the capacity of brain self-repair from cell transformation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>After stroke, ECs can be converted into E-pericytes. The TGFβ1-TGFβR2 pathway has been shown to induce EndoMT in ECs, leading to the formation of fibroblast-like cells at RP8D. The phenomenon has been confirmed in other disease models. However, the conversion of fibroblast-like cells into pericytes has been rarely reported. The mechanisms by which fibroblast-like cells convert into pericytes remain unexplored, including the key transcription factors involved and whether their manipulation could specifically regulate E-pericytes to promote post-stroke recovery. Some E-pericytes are found to migrate from blood vessels, while others adhere to blood vessels. Based on the normal positioning of pericytes, E-pericytes located on blood vessels are expected to function more effectively. Therefore, how to promote the return of migrating E-pericytes to blood vessels remains an unsolved problem.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Transgenic Cdh5CreERT2 transgenic mice cross with reporter mice <italic>Ai47 (EGFP <sup>fl/fl</sup>) reporter</italic> or <italic>Ai14 (tdTomato<sup>fl/fl</sup>) reporter mice</italic>.

Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg), and brain dissection was performed immediately for FACS experiments, or cardiac paraformaldehyde (PFA) perfusion was performed for the immunohistochemistry experiment. After fixation, brains were dissected and kept in 4% PFA for an additional 4 hr and then transferred to PBS until further processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>MCAO</title><p>Adult mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg), and body temperature was maintained during surgery with a heating pad. A midline neck incision was made, the right common carotid artery was carefully separated from the vagus nerve, and the artery was ligated using a 5.0 string. A second knot was made on the left external carotid artery. The right internal carotid artery (ICA) was isolated, and a knot was left loose with a 5.0 string. The knot was not tightened until the intraluminal insertion was done. A small hole was cut in the common carotid artery before it was bifurcated to the external carotid artery and ICA. A silicon-coated monofilament (tip diameter = 230 μm, Doccol Corporation, 602256PK5Re) was gently advanced into the ICA until it stopped at the origin of the MCA in the circle of Willis. The third knot on the ICA was closed to fix the filament in position. During MCA occlusion (2 hr), mice were kept in a warm cage at 25°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Laser speckle contrast imaging</title><p>Laser speckle contrast imaging provides a measure of CBF by quantifying the extent of blurring of dynamic speckles caused by the motion of red blood cells through the vessels. Briefly, mice were placed under an RFLSI III device (RWD Life Sciences) before and after the suture was successfully inserted through the CCA. The skull over both hemispheres was exposed by making an incision along the midline of the scalp. When a 785 nm laser is used to illuminate the brain, it produces a random interference effect that represents blood flow in the form of a speckle pattern. Scattering light was detected by a charge-coupled device camera, and the images were acquired by custom software from RWD Life Sciences Company. For each acquisition, a total of 160 images, each of which measured 2048×2048 pixels, were collected at 16 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Laser Doppler flowmetry</title><p>After the laser emitted by the LDF device is irradiated onto the tissue, the laser is scattered by the moving red blood cells in the blood, causing a change in the frequency of the scattered light. The frequency change is related to the speed of the red blood cells, so the blood flow velocity can be inferred by measuring the Doppler shift. Briefly, mice were placed under an LDF device (moorVMS-LDF1) before and after the suture was successfully inserted through CCA at RP34D. Connect the probe to the Laser Doppler Flowmeter, turn on the device to start measuring, determine the brain area you wish to measure, position the Laser Doppler probe on the desired brain area, record the data, export the raw data and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Tamoxifen</title><p>Tamoxifen, 10 mg/ml dissolved in corn oil, was administered intragastrically with 200 µl for 4 consecutive days.

Using genetic lineage tracing approaches, they find that endothelial cells give rise to non-endothelial cells, which they term &quot;E-pericytes.&quot; They further show that depleting these cells exacerbates blood-brain barrier leakage and worsens functional recovery. The authors also provide evidence that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, myeloid cell-derived TGFβ1, and endothelial TGFβRII are involved in this process. These are potentially interesting findings, however, the experimental evidence that endothelial cells undergo transdifferentiation to non-endothelial cells is weak, as is the evidence that these cells are pericytes. Addressing this foundational weakness will facilitate interpretation of the other findings.</p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors corrected labeling errors and included negative controls for flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry data. They did not, however, substantively address the major weaknesses below related to rigorously demonstrating the cellular origin and identity of &quot;E-pericytes.&quot;</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The authors address an important question about blood vessel function and plasticity in the context of stroke.</p><p>(2) The authors use a variety of genetic approaches to understand cell fate in the context of stroke. Particularly commendable is the use of several complementary lineage tracing strategies, including an intersectional strategy requiring both endothelial Cre activity and subsequent mural cell NG2 promoter activity.</p><p>(3) The authors address upstream cellular and molecular mechanisms, including roles for myeloid-derived TGFβ.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors use Cdh5-CreERT2; Ai47 mice to permanently label endothelial cells and their progeny with eGFP. They then isolate eGFP+ cells from control and MCAO RP7D and RP34D brains, and use single cell RNA-seq to identify the resulting cell types. Theoretically, all eGFP+ cells should be endothelial cells or their progeny. This is a very powerful and well-conceived experiment. The authors use the presence of a pericyte cluster as evidence that endothelial to pericyte transdifferentiation occurs. However, pericytes are also present in the scRNA-seq data from sham mice, as are several other cell types such as fibroblasts and microglia. This suggests that pericytes and these other cell types might have been co-purified (e.g., as doublets) with eGFP+ endothelial cells during FACS and may not themselves be eGFP+. Pericyte-endothelial doublets are common in scRNA-seq given that these cell types are closely and tightly associated. Additionally, tight association (e.g., via peg-socket junctions) can cause fragments of endothelial cells to be retained on pericytes (and vice-versa) during dissociation. Finally, it is possible that after stroke or during the dissociation process, endothelial cells lyse and release eGFP that could be taken up by other cell types. All of these scenarios could lead to purification of cells that were not derived (transdifferentiated) from endothelial cells. Authors note that the proportion of pericytes increased in the stroke groups, but it does not appear this experiment was replicated and thus this conclusion is not supported by statistical analysis. The results of pseudotime and trajectory analyses rely on the foundation that the pericytes in this dataset are endothelial-derived, which, as discussed above, has not been rigorously demonstrated.</p><p>(2) I have the same concern regarding inadvertent purification of cells that were not derived from endothelial cells in the context of the bulk RNA-seq experiment (Fig. S4), especially given the sample-to-sample variability in gene expression in the RP34D, eGFP+ non-ECs group (e.g., only 2/5 samples are enriched for mesenchymal transcription factor Tbx18, only 1/5 samples are enriched for mural cell TF Heyl). If the sorted eGFP+ non-ECs were pericytes, I would expect a strong and consistent pericyte-like gene expression profile.</p><p>(3) Authors use immunohistochemistry to understand localization, morphology, and marker expression of eGFP+ cells in situ. The representative &quot;E-pericytes&quot; shown in Fig. 3A-D are not associated with blood vessels, and the authors' quantification also shows that the majority of such cells are not vessel-associated (&quot;avascular&quot;). By definition, pericytes are a component of blood vessels and are embedded within the vascular basement membrane. Thus, concluding that these cells are pericytes (&quot;E-pericytes&quot;) may be erroneous.</p><p>(4) CD13 flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry are used extensively to identify pericytes. In the context of several complementary lineage tracing strategies noted in Strength #2, CD13 immunohistochemistry is the only marker used to identify putative pericytes (Fig. S3J-M). In stroke, CD13 is not specific to pericytes; dendritic cells and other monocyte-derived cells express CD13 (Anpep) in mouse brain after stroke (PMID: 38177281, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://anratherlab.shinyapps.io/strokevis/">https://anratherlab.shinyapps.io/strokevis/</ext-link>).</p><p>(5) Authors conclude that &quot;EC-specific overexpression of the Tgfbr2 protein by a virus (Tgfbr2) decreases Evans blue leakage, promotes CBF recovery, alleviates neurological deficits and facilitates spontaneous behavioral recovery after stroke by increasing the number of E-pericytes.&quot; All data in Fig. 10, however, compare endothelial Tgfbr2 overexpression to a DsRed overexpression control. There is no group in which Tgfbr2 is overexpressed but &quot;E-pericytes&quot; are eliminated with DTA (this is done in Fig. 9B, but this experiment lacks the Tgfbr2 overexpression-only control). Thus, the observed functional outcomes cannot be ascribed to &quot;E-pericytes&quot;; it remains possible that endothelial Tgfbr2 overexpression affects EB leakage, CBF, and behavior through alternative mechanisms.</p><p>In response to this comment, authors wrote: &quot;in Figures 9A-B, we observed no significant difference in Evans blue leakage between the Tgfbr2 overexpression group and the Tgfbr2 overexpression + DTA group (P=0.8153), this suggests that the impact of Tgfbr2 overexpression on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is primarily attributed from the E-pericytes generated by Tgfbr2 expression.&quot;</p><p>I do not see data from a Tgfbr2 overexpression-only group in Fig. 9B. Further, I do not understand authors' logic: If the mechanism by which EC Tgfbr2 overexpression acts to reduce BBB leakage is by increasing the number of &quot;E-pericytes,&quot; depleting &quot;E-pericytes&quot; with DTA in this context should increase BBB leakage.</p><p>(6) Single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data are not available in a public repository (such as GEO). Depositing these data would facilitate their independent reevaluation and reuse.</p><p>In response to this comment, authors indicated they submitted data to GEO, but did not provide an accession number.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105593.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The data and experiments presented in that study convincingly show that a subpopulation of endothelial cells undergo transformation into pericyte-like cells after stroke in mice.

We initially employed traditional lineage tracing methods to demonstrate that endothelial cells can transform into pericytes after stroke. We utilized Cdh5CreERT2;Ai47 mice, Tie2-Dre;Mfsd2aCreER;Ai47 mice, and AAV-BI30 virus-infected Ai47 mice. However, in our validation of the transformed cells as pericytes, there are limitations to our results. While three pericyte markers (CD13, NG2, and PDGFRβ) were used in Cdh5CreERT2;Ai47 mice, only one marker (CD13) was applied in Tie2Dre; Mfsd2aCreER;Ai47 and AAV-BI30 virus-infected Ai47 mice. This is insufficient, and the other two pericyte markers (NG2 and PDGFRβ) need to be verified in these models.</p><p>At scRNA-seq, although we observed an increased proportion of pericyte/EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells after stroke, we did not rule out potential contamination by pericyte cells, nor did we include sufficient replicates. To address these issues, we can explore additional methods for analyzing scRNA-seq data, increasing sample replicates, and eliminating pericyte contamination using advanced algorithms. Furthermore, we can use chimeric-related mutations to compare normal endothelial cells, normal pericytes, endothelial-derived pericytes (E-pericytes), and intermediate fibroblast-like cells at the DNA level. This approach will help identify and trace chimeric-related mutations across different cell types and developmental stages. Finally, we can track the entire process of endothelial cell transformation into pericytes using two-photon imaging in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Li and colleagues study the fate of endothelial cells in a mouse model of ischemic stroke.

As the reviewer has pointed out, several factors may contribute to cell contamination. For instance, the meninges of adult mice are difficult to remove completely, which may lead to fibroblast contamination. Although Cdh5CreERT2 can specifically label endothelial cells in the normal brain parenchyma, there may still be very few unspecific cells in certain brain regions, such as the choroid plexus and periventricular areas, resulting in the presence of ependymal cells. To address these issues, we can improve our methodology by carefully removing the meninges, choroid plexus, and periventricular cells during sample preparation. Additionally, we need to increase the N of the transcriptome samples to enhance the reliability of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I have the same concern regarding the inadvertent purification of cells that were not derived from endothelial cells in the context of the bulk RNA-seq experiment (Figure S4), especially given the sample-to-sample variability in gene expression in the RP34D, eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs-group (e.g., only 2/5 samples are enriched for mesenchymal transcription factor Tbx18, only 1/5 samples are enriched for mural cell TF Heyl). If the sorted eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs were pericytes, I would expect a strong and consistent pericyte-like gene expression profile.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question.</p><p>Indeed, significant differences were observed in the expression of pericyte-related transcriptional profiles within the eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs group. For instance, transcription factors such as Hic1 and Fosl1 were nearly absent in the eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs group. We propose several potential explanations for these observations:</p><p>(1) The sorted eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs group may contain other cell types, leading to contamination.</p><p>(2) The eGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs group may not uniformly express all pericyte-related transcriptional profiles.</p><p>(3) The temporal dynamics of transcription factor expression (i.e., different factors being expressed at different stages) could contribute to the observed variability.</p><p>(4) The heterogeneity in the timing of endothelial-to-pericyte transformation (i.e., some cells have already transformed into pericytes while others are in the process of transformation at the early stage) may result in significant differences in transcriptional profiles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors use immunohistochemistry to understand localization, morphology, and marker expression of eGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in situ. The representative &quot;E-pericytes&quot; shown in Figure 3A-D are not associated with blood vessels, and the authors' quantification also shows that the majority of such cells are not vessel-associated (&quot;avascular&quot;). By definition, pericytes are a component of blood vessels and are embedded within the vascular basement membrane. Thus, concluding that these cells are pericytes (&quot;E-pericytes&quot;) may be erroneous.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we found that 72.2% of E-pericytes were free and not associated with blood vessels. Normally, pericytes surround blood vessels and connect to endothelial cells. However, in certain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and diabetic encephalopathy, pericytes can detach from blood vessels. In our stroke model, we observed that pericytes detach from blood vessels. This phenomenon can be explained by two possible scenarios:</p><p>(1) After endothelial cells transform into E-pericytes, the E-pericytes detach from blood vessels due to the pathological environment following stroke.</p><p>(2) After stroke, blood vessel function is impaired, leading to vascular degeneration. Endothelial cells shed from the blood vessels and subsequently transform into E-pericytes.</p><p>Therefore, preventing pericyte detachment from blood vessels after stroke represents an important scientific challenge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) CD13 flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry are used extensively to identify pericytes. In the context of several complementary lineage tracing strategies noted in Strength #2, CD13 immunohistochemistry is the only marker used to identify putative pericytes (Figure S3J-M). In stroke, CD13 is not specific to pericytes; dendritic cells and other monocyte-derived cells express CD13 (Anpep) in mouse brain after stroke (PMID: 38177281, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://anratherlab.shinyapps.io/strokevis/">https://anratherlab.shinyapps.io/strokevis/</ext-link>).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable input. In the context of stroke, CD13 is not specific to pericytes. Additionally, pericytes lack a single specific marker; instead, their identity is determined by a combination of multiple markers. To more convincingly validate the identity of pericytes, it is necessary to incorporate additional pericyte markers alongside several complementary lineage tracing strategies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors conclude that &quot;EC-specific overexpression of the Tgfbr2 protein by a virus (Tgfbr2) decreases Evans blue leakage, promotes CBF recovery, alleviates neurological deficits and facilitates spontaneous behavioral recovery after stroke by increasing the number of E-pericytes.&quot; All data in Figure 10, however, compare endothelial Tgfbr2 overexpression to a DsRed overexpression control. There is no group in which Tgfbr2 is overexpressed but &quot;E-pericytes&quot; are eliminated with DTA (this is done in Figure 9B, but this experiment lacks the Tgfbr2 overexpression-only control). Thus, the observed functional outcomes cannot be ascribed to &quot;E-pericytes&quot;; it remains possible that endothelial Tgfbr2 overexpression affects EB leakage, CBF, and behavior through alternative mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable comment. Although in Figures 9A-B, we observed no significant difference in Evans blue leakage between the Tgfbr2 overexpression group and the Tgfbr2 overexpression + DTA group (P=0.8153), this suggests that the impact of Tgfbr2 overexpression on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is primarily attributed from the E-pericytes generated by Tgfbr2 expression. Furthermore, in Figure 10A, the inclusion of the Tgfbr2 overexpression + DTA group would provide stronger evidence that the effects of Tgfbr2 overexpression on the BBB and neurobehavioral outcomes are mainly due to the E-pericytes derived from Tgfbr2 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data are not available in a public repository (such as GEO).

These so-called &quot;E-pericytes&quot; are protective and might present a new target for stroke recovery.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying BBB restoration post-stroke is crucial to the field. Using lineage tracing, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and immunostaining, Li et al. detected the transdifferentiation of endothelial cells (ECs) into E-pericytes in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. The specific knockout of Tgfbr2 in ECs reduced the number of E-pericytes, exacerbated BBB leakage, and worsened neurological deficits. This observation of EC to pericyte differentiation is novel; however, the conclusions at this stage are not fully supported by the evidence provided.</p><p>(1) The authors claimed, based on the EdU assay, that 12.9% of pericytes present at RP34D originated from self-proliferation, while the origin of the remaining 27.6% of new pericytes remains unclear. This raises concerns, as the EdU assay is not 100% efficient in detecting all proliferating cells. If EdU<sup>+</sup> ECs account for fewer than 10% of all ECs, it follows that other EdU-ECs must have alternative origins.</p></disp-quote><p>That is an interesting question. To address this issue, we need to consider the following aspects:</p><p>(1) The EdU assay is not 100% efficient in detecting all proliferating cells, which means that the actual proportion of proliferating pericytes may be higher than 12.9%, while the proportion of pericytes from other sources may be lower than 27.6% (as determined by FACS). This is consistent with the observation in Figure 3H (immunofluorescence analysis), where EGFP<sup>+</sup> pericytes accounted for only 24.5% of all pericytes.</p><p>(2) The dose of EdU administered in our study was relatively high (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection, daily), which may increase the efficiency of EdU labeling.</p><p>(3) When EdU<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells (ECs) constitute less than 10% of all ECs, it does suggest that EdU-ECs could be a source of pericytes. However, at least EdU<sup>+</sup> ECs cannot transform into pericytes, as we did not detect any EdU<sup>+</sup>EGFP<sup>+</sup> pericytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The reference for Cdh5CreERT2 is cited as 25, which is a review article published in ATVB. This review lists many different drivers, and the specific Cdh5CreERT2 line used in this study is not identified. This specificity is critical for accurate lineage tracing of ECs.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the review I mentioned did not address this, the specificity of Cdh5CreERT2 in the brain has been demonstrated in other studies (Boyé K, et al. Nat Commun. 2022 Mar 4;13(1):1169; Patel A, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2024 Dec 3;121(49):e2322124121). We have further confirmed that Cdh5CreERT2 specifically labels endothelial cells in the brain parenchyma (Figure S1). Additionally, we found nonspecific labeling in the blood (less than 1% CD45+ blood cells, primarily myeloid cells) and meninges outside the brain parenchyma. We ruled out nonspecific transdifferentiation labeling in the blood through bone marrow reconstitution experiments and in the meninges using in vivo two-photon imaging (results not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The scRNA-seq data should include GFP signals to track the increasing number of pericytes from early to late stages post-injury. This is the only independent method from staining to verify that the pericytes are indeed derived from GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs after brain injury. Sham samples should be utilized as strict side-by-side controls.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valuable suggestion. We observed that, despite being positive for EGFP protein, only 50% of the sorted cells expressed the EGFP gene at the transcriptome level. This phenomenon has also been reported in other studies (Rodor J,et al a. Cardiovasc Res. 2022 Aug 24;118(11):2519-2534.). For these reasons, we did not rely on GFP signals to track the increase in pericyte numbers from early to late stages post-injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Since Ai47 is employed, there are three different variants of green fluorescent proteins, including ZsGreen, which may result in signals being spotted in the staining. The GFP signal detected could also represent dead cells that have lost CD31 expression.</p></disp-quote><p>The detected GFP signal could also originate from dead cells that have lost CD31 expression, which is a plausible explanation. As shown in Figure 3I, EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs peak at RP14D and then decline, suggesting that some EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs either die or revert to endothelial cells (ECs). Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that we captured some dead EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs; however, as indicated in Figure 3I, this proportion is likely less than 25%. Additionally, pericytes are prone to death in ischemic and hypoxic environments (Figure 1A), which explains why some of the transformed EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs may die. Nevertheless, at RP514D, we can still detect EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs, indicating that a subset of these cells can survive for an extended period (Figure S3F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The quality of the staining images is not convincing, as some non-ECs and ECs are in close proximity, leading to potential artifacts in signal interpretation. The reviewer cannot rely solely on single staining techniques to be convinced of EC differentiation into pericytes. Although it has been reported that ECs can differentiate into pericytes during development, this phenomenon in the adult brain is surprising; thus, more rigorous evidence with strong lineage tracing data should be provided through multiple measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>Why some non-ECs and ECs are located nearby:</p><p>(1) Non-ECs exhibit characteristics of pericytes, which are typically adjacent to ECs.</p><p>(2) Could this proximity lead to potential artifacts in signal interpretation? We believe this is unlikely, as we also observed a significant number of non-ECs located far from ECs on blood vessels (Figure 3A-B, Figure S3M).</p><p>(3) Three pericyte markers (CD13, NG2, and PDGFRβ) were also used to verify the transformed cells, while the three pericyte markers were not expressed in normal endothelial cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting) should be employed to quantitatively assess the contribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs to pericytes at each stage after injury, compared to sham controls.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, if the contribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs to pericytes could be assessed at each time point, the role of E-pericytes in the pericyte pool could be better explained, and the proportion of E-pericytes would become more prominent. In Figure 3, we did not use FACS to evaluate the contribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs to pericytes at each stage post-injury. Instead, we only assessed the ratio of EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs to all EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells. However, we did verify the contribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs (E-pericytes) to pericytes at RP34D using FACS (CD13+ DsRed/CD13 = 25.6%, Figure 4C). This ratio is consistent with the immunofluorescence data (Figure 3H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In Tie2Dre;Mfsd2aCrexER;Ai47 mice, ECs in the brain are specifically labeled, indicating that ECs could give rise to CD13+ EGFP<sup>+</sup> non-ECs at RP34D (Figure S3L). However, the GFP signal for Ai47 is not homogeneous, displaying many spotted patterns. Using tdTomato as an alternative for detection could enhance clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the experiment using tdTomato as the reporter gene in mice and observed results consistent with those obtained using Ai47 as the reporter gene. For consistency, all results presented are based on Ai47. Regarding the spotted patterns observed with Ai47, this phenomenon can be attributed to the relatively low laser intensity (2%). Higher laser intensity would cause overexposure of EGFP<sup>+</sup> ECs. To address the issue of spotted patterns in Ai47 imaging, we can improve the visualization of complete cell morphology (as shown in Figure S3M) by increasing the gain value, which enhances the background signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The data concerning the genetic ablation of pericytes lacks specificity. There is insufficient evidence to support that DTA is specifically expressed in E-pericytes. The authors should utilize DTR (Diphtheria Toxin Receptor) and confirm that DTR expression is restricted to pericytes derived from GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs. Treatment with diphtheria toxin, but not PBS as a control, should specifically ablate these E-pericytes without affecting any other GFP-pericytes in the brain following injury.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not verify that DTA expression was restricted to E-pericytes. To ensure that DTA is only expressed in converted E-pericytes, we employed two strategies:</p><p>(1) Specific Targeting of Endothelial Cells: We used the AAV-BI30 virus to specifically infect endothelial cells. Although not 100% exclusive, 98.5% of the expression occurred in endothelial cells, with minimal infection in neurons and microglia. Additionally, we combined this with Cdh5CreERT2 to control the DIO action in the virus. This means that only endothelial cells expressing both Cdh5CreERT2 and infected with AAV-BI30 could undergo cell fate changes and transform into pericytes, subsequently expressing markers such as NG2 and driving DTA expression in E-pericytes (Figure 4A).</p><p>(2) Validation of DTA Expression: To prevent off-target expression of DTA in other cell types, we plan to verify DTA protein expression using specific antibodies to confirm whether DTA is expressed in unintended cells. Alternatively, as suggested, we could utilize the Diphtheria Toxin Receptor (DTR) system. By ensuring that DTR expression is restricted to pericytes derived from GFP<sup>+</sup> ECs, treatment with diphtheria toxin would specifically ablate these E-pericytes without affecting other GFP- pericytes in the brain post-injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) There is currently no convincing genetic data demonstrating that Tgfb signaling overexpression or deletion modulates the transdifferentiation of ECs to pericytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is an important consideration. Although we knocked out the TGFβ receptor in endothelial cells (ECs) and observed a reduction in the formation of E-pericytes (Figure 6D and 6G), it would be more informative to specifically knockout the Tgfb gene in myeloid cells or monocyte-macrophage lineages to determine whether these cells are the primary source of TGFβ driving endothelial cell transformation. Additionally, injecting TGFβ protein directly into the brains of mice could help explore whether exogenous TGFβ promotes the formation of E-pericytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 1D, there does not appear to be a clear PDGFRβ-positive population.

Also, the y-axis labeling is missing for the traces.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure S9A, we assessed changes in blood flow using laser speckle imaging. Laser speckle imaging relies on random interference patterns formed by scattered light when a laser strikes tissue. Moving red blood cells alter the contrast of the speckle pattern: faster blood flow results in quicker speckle changes and lower contrast, while slower blood flow leads to slower speckle changes and higher contrast. By analyzing these changes in speckle contrast, blood flow dynamics can be evaluated in real-time and non-invasively.</p><p>In Figure S9B, we measured blood flow changes using Laser Doppler flowmetry. When a laser interacts with flowing blood, the moving red blood cells scatter the light, causing a frequency shift (Doppler shift). Faster blood flow results in a greater frequency shift, while slower blood flow leads to a smaller frequency shift. By detecting the frequency shift of the scattered light, blood flow velocity and changes can be measured in real time and non-invasively. In Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF), the unit of the vertical axis is typically Perfusion Units (PU). PU is a relative unit used to represent changes in blood flow rather than absolute blood flow velocity.

However, since ProcrCreERT2 labels not only ECs but also pericytes in the brain, the results did not achieve our goal and were therefore not included in the study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
