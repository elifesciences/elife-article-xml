Most studies analyzing the influence of land-use change on pathogen emergence focus on a single host–pathogen system and often observe contradictory effects. Here, we studied virus diversity and prevalence patterns in natural and disturbed ecosystems using a multi-host and multi-taxa approach. Mosquitoes sampled along a disturbance gradient in Côte d’Ivoire were tested by generic RT-PCR assays established for all major arbovirus and insect-specific virus taxa including novel viruses previously discovered in these samples based on cell culture isolates enabling an unbiased and comprehensive approach. The taxonomic composition of detected viruses was characterized and viral infection rates according to habitat and host were analyzed. We detected 331 viral sequences pertaining to 34 novel and 15 previously identified viruses of the families <italic>Flavi</italic>-, <italic>Rhabdo</italic>-, <italic>Reo</italic>-, <italic>Toga</italic>-, <italic>Mesoni</italic>- and <italic>Iflaviridae</italic> and the order <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>. Highest host and virus diversity was observed in pristine and intermediately disturbed habitats. The majority of the 49 viruses was detected with low prevalence. However, nine viruses were found frequently across different habitats of which five viruses increased in prevalence towards disturbed habitats, in congruence with the dilution effect hypothesis. These viruses were mainly associated with one specific mosquito species (<italic>Culex nebulosus</italic>), which increased in relative abundance from pristine (3%) to disturbed habitats (38%). Interestingly, the observed increased prevalence of these five viruses in disturbed habitats was not caused by higher host infection rates but by increased host abundance, an effect tentatively named abundance effect. Our data show that host species composition is critical for virus abundance. Environmental changes that lead to an uneven host community composition and to more individuals of a single species are a key driver of virus emergence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>arbovirus</kwd><kwd>mosquito</kwd><kwd>disease ecology</kwd><kwd>insect-specific virus</kwd><kwd>community composition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Federal Ministry of Education and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01KI1716</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Junglen</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JU2857/3-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Junglen</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DR772/10-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Junglen</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of naturally infected mosquitoes shows that ecosystem disturbance can lead to a turnover in host community composition and that more individuals of a single species are a key driver of virus emergence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major challenge in understanding the emergence of infectious disease is to identify the driving factors responsible for changes in infectious disease dynamics. New infectious diseases mostly emerge in tropical regions that have undergone strong ecological and economic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Swei et al., 2020</xref>). Tropical rainforests are terrestrial ecosystems with a high biodiversity, constituting a habitat with a diverse range of hosts and pathogens. This high host richness likely corresponds to a high pathogen richness as each host is likely to carry its own specific pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunn et al., 2010</xref>). Pristine rainforests are subject to large scale anthropogenic land use transformation leading to increased contact among humans, wildlife, and pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keesing et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Olival et al., 2017</xref>). Disturbed habitats often show a drastic decline in biodiversity or turnover of host species community composition, which is accompanied by an increase of species that are resilient to disturbance, so-called generalist species. How changes in community composition influence pathogen prevalence in target hosts is still unclear and a matter of scientific debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Randolph and Dobson, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this context, the dilution effect hypothesis postulates that a high diversity of different host species dilutes the prevalence of a specific pathogen in intact ecosystems as the density of competent hosts (hosts that contribute to pathogen transmission and maintenance) is diluted by the presence of non-competent hosts. Biodiversity loss increases the infection prevalence of this specific pathogen in the disturbance-resilient, competent host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ostfeld, 2017</xref>). Prerequisites for the occurrence of a dilution effect are the presence of species that differ in their susceptibility for a particular pathogen and a lower risk of extinction of competent hosts under habitat disturbance. This may then lead to a higher relative frequency of competent host species in modified habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halliday et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Joseph et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ostfeld and Keesing, 2012</xref>). Hence, in the case of zoonotic pathogens, the disease risk for humans is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ostfeld, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gibb et al., 2020</xref>). Studies confirming the dilution effect hypothesis focused on pathogens known to cause outbreaks in humans and livestock (e.g. West Nile virus [WNV], Sin Nombre virus, and <italic>Borrelia</italic> spp.) and use generalist species as hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Allan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ostfeld and Keesing, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Khalil et al., 2016</xref>). However, it seems that this effect cannot be generalized and that diverse mechanisms regulate infectious disease transmission dynamics in a host-, pathogen-, and situation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2015b</xref>). Some studies observed a contrary effect for WNV, Usutu virus, and <italic>Borellia</italic> spp., where the infection rate or density of infected hosts increased with biodiversity, referred to as amplification effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Levine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ruyts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Roiz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>These conflicting results indicate that biodiversity loss has complex impacts on disease risk and effects can be heterogeneous and scale-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keesing et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McLeish et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Salkeld et al., 2013</xref>). Partial views on single host species or single pathogens cannot reveal general mechanisms. Existing studies either focused only on pathogen discovery aside from an ecological context or on one specific pathogen in a specific host across different habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ostfeld and Keesing, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Levine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). Studies with a wider scope analyzing community composition of entire host groups and assessing the genetic diversity of their pathogens in undisturbed and disturbed habitats are lacking and would be paramount for a comprehensive understanding of biodiversity-infection relationships. To this end, analyzing species interactions is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of the factors governing emerging infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnson et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis combining fields of community ecology and virology to understand how viral richness depends on host richness, and which role host–habitat associations play for viral abundance patterns using viruses that naturally infect mosquitoes in a natural system. Habitat alterations such as agricultural development and urbanization promote thriving of disease-transmitting mosquito species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burkett-Cadena and Vittor, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Perrin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Perrin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schrama et al., 2020</xref>), but it is less clear how such changes in mosquito species disassembly affect the abundance and prevalence of viruses. From the limited amount of available studies, these mostly focused on the effects of land use change on one specific virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferraguti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Martínez-de la Puente et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the vertebrate-pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), for example, dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gould et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Weaver et al., 2018a</xref>), mosquitoes can also be infected with so-called insect-specific viruses (ISVs), which cannot infect vertebrates due to several host restriction barriers, for example, sensitivity to higher (body) temperatures and inability to replicate in vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blitvich and Firth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Marklewitz et al., 2015</xref>). All arbovirus taxa are embedded in a much greater phylogenetic diversity of ISVs, which suggests that arboviruses evolved from ancestral arthropod-restricted viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blitvich and Firth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Marklewitz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Halbach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Junglen, 2016</xref>). The mode of transmission of most ISVs in nature remains largely unknown but is suggested to rely on direct transmission. For some insect-specific flaviviruses, vertical transmission to the progeny was described and is considered to play an important role for virus maintenance in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blitvich and Firth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bolling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lutomiah et al., 2007</xref>). Additional transmission mechanisms of ISVs may include shared food sources, ectoparasites, or venereal transmission (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Halbach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agboli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Meki et al., 2021</xref>). It has been shown that at least some flavi-, mesoni, and bunyaviruses are expectorated during feeding, which may provide a route for horizontal virus transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birnberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Newton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ramírez et al., 2018</xref>). However, transmission dynamics may differ among virus species and viral families and data are lacking describing the maintenance and transmission of ISVs related to arboviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Meki et al., 2021</xref>). Knowledge of the natural transmission of ISVs has been mainly studied for entomopoxviruses and baculoviruses, which infect other insects than mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). Due to their high abundance in natural mosquito populations, ISVs can serve as model systems to study how changes in mosquito species assembly affect associated virus abundance.</p><p>In a preliminary analysis, we had demonstrated that the prevalence of three ISVs, isolated from mosquitoes sampled along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in Côte d’Ivoire, West Africa, increased from pristine to disturbed habitat types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Junglen et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zirkel et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequently, a plenitude of previously unknown RNA viruses was identified in these samples establishing novel species, genera, and even families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Marklewitz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zirkel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hermanns et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hermanns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Junglen et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Junglen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kallies et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Marklewitz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Marklewitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Quan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zirkel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>). To this end, we established broad-range generic PCR assays for all viruses identified previously in these samples, as well as for all major virus taxa containing arthropod-associated viruses. With this, we aimed to assess the viral genetic diversity along with the prevalence patterns of each detected virus in an entire family of hosts (<italic>Culicidae</italic>) sampled across habitat types. We expect a higher species diversity in mosquitoes of the family <italic>Culicidae</italic> in habitats of low or no disturbance and predict a turnover in mosquito species composition along the disturbance gradient concomitant with an increase in disturbance-resilient mosquito species and their viruses. We thus hypothesize that habitat perturbation and subsequent changes in community composition influence virus abundance patterns and most likely transmission dynamics. This multi-host and multi-taxa study provides insight into common and distinct micro-evolutionary patterns of virus emergence and geographic spread at the interface of pristine and modified landscapes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Biodiversity analyses</title><p>The data set included 42 unique mosquito species units.

The hierarchical cluster analysis confirmed the finding that agriculture and secondary forest clustered together via <italic>C. decens</italic> and <italic>C. nebulosus</italic>, while villages and camp mainly clustered via <italic>C. nebulosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Agriculture had high amounts of <italic>Culex annulioris</italic> and <italic>Coquillettidia metallica</italic>, while primary forest mosquito communities were characterized by <italic>Uranotaenia</italic> species. Villages were mainly characterized by <italic>Anopheles</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore grouped our mosquitoes to the eight major groups <italic>C. decens</italic> (i = 1101), <italic>C. nebulosus</italic> (i = 719)<italic>, C. annulioris</italic> (i = 263)<italic>, Culex</italic> sp.

(i = 294), while all others, mainly the non-defined ones, were termed ‘others’ (i = 1366) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on these findings, our anthropogenic disturbance gradient was as follows (from low to high disturbance): PF-SF-A-C-V. Significant associations were found between main mosquito groups and habitat (LRT p&lt;0.001, df = 28, deviance = 3782; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Assessment of the genetic virus diversity</title><p>In total, we found 331 viral RdRp sequences pertaining to 34 putative novel viruses and 15 previously identified viruses of the families <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic>, <italic>Peribunyaviridae,</italic> and <italic>Phasmaviridae</italic> of the order <italic>Bunyavirales,</italic> as well as of the families <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, <italic>Togaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Reoviridae, Iflaviridae,</italic> and <italic>Mesoniviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Viral infection rates did not change considerably in their mosquito hosts between disturbed and undisturbed habitat types.

We characterized the genetic diversity of RNA viruses (multi-taxa) in an entire family of hosts (<italic>Culicidae</italic>; multi-host), which were sampled along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient. We subsequently studied prevalence patterns of all detected viruses per habitat type, as well as mosquito community composition per habitat type. We discovered an exceptionally high diversity of 49 distinct viruses, of which 34 were previously unknown members of seven different RNA virus families. We demonstrated that the majority of these viruses occurred at low minimum infection rates (MIRs) of 0.22–1.97 infected mosquitoes per 1000 tested mosquitoes. Nine viruses occurred more frequently across the disturbance gradient, of which five increased in prevalence from pristine to disturbed habitat types. We could show that the detection rates of these viruses corresponded to the abundance patterns of their specific mosquito host species. Importantly, the differences in virus prevalence were driven by the number of hosts present in a specific habitat type and not by changes in host infection rates. This interplay was named abundance effect. These data show that host community composition critically influences virus prevalence that has direct impact on our understanding of infectious disease emergence mechanisms.</p><p>The majority of the detected viruses grouped with ISVs in phylogenetic analyses, suggesting that vertebrates do not participate in their amplification and maintenance cycles. However, the novel viruses Cimo peribunyavirus I and II formed a monophyletic clade that shared a most recent common ancestor with viruses of the genera <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic> and <italic>Pacuvirus</italic>. Orthobunyaviruses are arboviruses that infect a great variety of vertebrates including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>). Pacuviruses were isolated from rodents and phlebotomine sandflies in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aitken et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rodrigues et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the amplification cycle of Cimo peribunyavirus I and II may involve vertebrates and may be more complex than that of the other detected viruses. Further research is necessary to assess the host range of Cimo peribunyavirus I and II. The ISVs detected here were previously unknown, and it is thus not known whether they are viral symbionts of mosquitoes or pathogenic viruses. Since these represent previously unknown viruses, no study investigating whether they induce symptoms of disease and/or influence life history traits of mosquitoes has been conducted. Either way, the study provides data for a better understanding of factors influencing the viral community composition of mosquitoes. Although the microbiome of invertebrates is widely unexplored, it has been shown that the microbiome of mosquitoes can have a negative effect on its vector competence (the ability of mosquitoes to transmit human- and livestock pathogenic viruses). In consequence, even if the viruses detected in this study would be symbionts of mosquitoes, they may affect the transmission efficiency of pathogenic viruses and affect spillover events of pathogenic arboviruses from sylvatic to urban cycles. Nevertheless, studying abundance patterns and geographic spread of ISVs in the light of habitat disturbance and shifts in host community composition can provide valuable insight into infectious disease dynamics, at least for directly transmitted viruses. Mosquito-borne viruses are among the major global health concerns, and the recent spread and epidemics caused by Zika and chikungunya viruses have exemplified that there is an urgent need to understand viral emergence processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Weaver et al., 2018a</xref>). Using mosquito-specific viruses as model viruses has many advantages as these viruses are more frequently found than arboviruses and no vertebrate host is required for virus maintenance and amplification, which makes links between host community composition and virus abundance patterns easier to identify. Mosquitoes and their viruses are an ideal system to study such effects as this allows studying infectious disease dynamics in an entire family of hosts, which can be tested in high numbers.</p><p>Our observed virus prevalence patterns are in agreement with several studies stating a heterogeneous effect of biodiversity on pathogen prevalence or disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Randolph and Dobson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Salkeld et al., 2013</xref>). Biodiversity can influence disease risk by different mechanisms like host regulation, changes in encounter rates or transmission rates, leading to an amplifying or diluting net effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keesing et al., 2006</xref>). Areas with a high host richness likely harbor a high pathogen richness that might act as a source pool of novel diseases upon habitat change and increased contact to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keesing et al., 2010</xref>). We observed the highest virus richness in intermediately disturbed and primary rainforest habitats supporting that biodiverse habitats are also rich in pathogens. However, highest viral prevalence rates were observed in villages and at camp sites, further supporting that intact or intermediately disturbed ecosystems also contain well-balanced spectra of viruses.</p><p>For those arboviruses that are transmitted by a generalist mosquito species and use a competent host profiting from disturbance, a dilution effect can occur at local scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halliday et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ostfeld and Keesing, 2012</xref>). Several studies observed a dilution effect for WNV with either increasing non-passerine or total bird diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Allan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ezenwa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Swaddle and Calos, 2008</xref>) while others reported no protective effect of avian species richness on WNV prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Levine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Loss et al., 2009</xref>). For tick-borne encephalitis virus, a dilution effect with increasing density of incompetent deer hosts was observed at local scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cagnacci et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, the prevalence of the directly transmitted hantavirus sin nombre virus is reduced at sites with higher rodent diversity as the persistence of the main host species (deer mouse) is reduced at diverse sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clay et al., 2009</xref>). A similar pattern was observed in our sampling for the five viruses GOLV, HEBV, FERV, Spilikins virus, and CAVV belonging to four different families (<italic>Phenuiviridae</italic>, <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, <italic>Phasmaviridae,</italic> and <italic>Mesoniviridae</italic>). All these viruses used mosquitoes of the species <italic>C. nebulosus</italic> as primary host, which seemed to profit from disturbance and increased in abundance in disturbed versus pristine habitats (38% vs. 3%).</p><p>The ecological mechanisms leading to changes in mosquito community composition due to anthropogenic disturbance are presently poorly understood. Environmental changes, including land use changes, but also changes in the host species composition have been suggested to act as drivers of vector-borne diseases, including important arboviral diseases like dengue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Patz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Takken and Verhulst, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Young et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, very few studies have focused on <italic>C. nebulosus</italic>. It has been reported as a sylvatic species in Nigeria, Benin, and Mozambique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abílio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Agwu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lingenfelser et al., 2010</xref>), but to the best of our knowledge this is the first study showing an increasing abundance of <italic>C. nebulosus</italic> in modified ecosystems. The possible reasons for the varying mosquito community compositions in the different habitat types might be the availability of suitable larval habitat sites and food sources, the abundance of predators, as well as differences in temperature and humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferraguti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Roiz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Thongsripong et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The prevalence of the five viruses associated with <italic>C. nebulosus</italic> was reduced in the diverse habitat types where the abundance of incompetent mosquito hosts increased and <italic>C. nebulosus</italic> was rarely found. It is striking that this effect was observed for five taxonomically different viruses infecting the same host species. This effect was not observed for closely related viruses using other mosquito species as host that did not increase in abundance in disturbed habitats. These data suggest that the adaptability of mosquito hosts to changed environments plays a more important role for the increase in prevalence of associated viruses than the phenotypic or genetic characteristics of these viruses. A similar observation was made by another study, which showed that the virome composition of three mosquito species captured along a rural to urban disturbance gradient in Thailand was defined primarily by the mosquito host species rather than the geographic location and that ISVs display a relatively narrow host range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Thongsripong et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Contrary effects can be caused by scale-dependent effects or depending on additive or substitutive community assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2015b</xref>). Additionally, the most competent host can either increase or decline with disturbance, leading either to a dilution or amplification effect, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halliday et al., 2017</xref>). In our investigated sample set, two viruses (Cimo phenuivirus II, family <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic>, and Cimo flavivirus I, family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) with higher prevalence in pristine than in disturbed habitats were detected. As observed for the five viruses mentioned above (GOLV, HEBV, FERV, Spilikins virus, and CAVV), virus prevalence rates were closely linked to abundance rates of host mosquito species. Cimo phenuivirus II and Cimo flavivirus I were associated with <italic>Uranotaenia</italic> and <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> mosquitoes that declined in abundance in disturbed habitat types. An explanation of why such an effect is rarely found could be that model pathogens selected in the field of disease ecology are usually zoonotic pathogens that infect humans in disturbed habitats and are known to cause outbreaks. Thus, there may exist a bias towards those pathogens that thrive in disturbed habitat types. Pathogens that are rarely found in disturbed habitats may never be selected for disease ecology studies. Notably, the vast majority of detected virus species showed low infection rates without any evidence for effects of mosquito community changes on their abundance. These findings for 40 (out of 49) distinct viruses infecting different mosquito species suggest that host community disassembly does only influence a small fraction of the pathogen population. These examples underline why an unbiased multi-host and multi-taxa approach is crucial to uncover host community effects on pathogen prevalence patterns.</p><p>In other studies focusing on plant, vector-borne, indirectly and directly transmitted pathogens, the composition of the host community rather than total biodiversity was a predictor for pathogen distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Randolph and Dobson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McLeish et al., 2017</xref>). For example, (i) a low diversity of grassland plant species diversity was associated with a higher abundance of fungal plant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mitchell et al., 2002</xref>), (ii) the disease and infection risk of populations of wild pepper (chiltepin) with different viruses increased with the level of human management, which was associated with decreased species diversity and host genetic diversity, and increased host plant density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pagán et al., 2012</xref>), and (iii) the prevalence of four generalist aphid-vectored pathogens (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses) increased in grass host plants as local host richness declined, indicating that virus incidence in the focal host species is affected by the composition of the entire host community rather than by dependence on species diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mitchell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pagán et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lacroix et al., 2014</xref>). This is in agreement with the strong observed association between the prevalence of a certain virus and the abundance of its main mosquito host species in our study.</p><p>We detected novel strains of two previously characterized viruses, PCLV and Anopheles flavivirus, in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquitoes, respectively, corresponding to previous findings of these viruses in these mosquito species in Asia and Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fauver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). This further supports the specific associations between certain viruses and mosquitoes on a broader geographical scale.</p><p>Mosquitoes harbor a diverse natural virome that can influence subsequent virus infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Junglen and Drosten, 2013</xref>). We observed four frequently co-occurring viruses in <italic>C. nebulosus</italic> mosquitoes (GOLV, HEBV, FERV, and CAVV) that also grew together in cell culture, while in contrast the two <italic>C. decens</italic>-associated viruses, Cimo rhabdovirus I and JONV, were rarely detected together. This could hint, on the one hand, at synergistic interactions and, on the other hand, at superinfection exclusion between different ISVs in mosquitoes. For several ISVs in the genera <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and <italic>Alphavirus,</italic> an interference with related arboviruses was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bolling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nasar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hobson-Peters et al., 2013</xref>). A better knowledge of the virome of different mosquito species as well as studies on mutual interference might help to assess vector competence and possibilities of geographic spread.</p><p>Virus detection in mosquito homogenates independent of virus isolation extents potential virus findings but has the limitation that exogenous and integrated viruses can be discovered. The detection of likely integrated sequences derived from flavi- and rhabdoviruses in our mosquito sample is in agreement with frequent previous findings of NIRVS from these families in mosquito genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fort et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Katzourakis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lequime and Lambrechts, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Whitfield et al., 2017</xref>). NIRVS are more closely related to ISVs than to arboviruses, probably limiting their influence on vector competence. The transovarial transmission of ISVs might increase the chance of germline integrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Palatini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Olson and Bonizzoni, 2017</xref>). NIRVS can be transcriptionally active and might play a role in immunity against related viruses by producing piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fort et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lequime and Lambrechts, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Whitfield et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Ter Horst et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our data show that only some viruses of a huge viral community benefited from ecosystem disturbance. This effect was found for five viruses (GOLV, HEBV, FERV, Spilikins virus, and CAVV) and was determined by abundance patterns of their mosquito hosts, which profited from habitat disturbance and strongly increased in numbers from pristine to disturbed habitats. In contrast, we also detected two viruses (Cimo phenuivirus II and Cimo flavivirus I) that were associated with mosquito hosts specific to primary habitat types. Detection rates of the associated viruses were also closely linked to host abundance, and these viruses were found with higher frequencies in the primary and secondary rainforest. However, our analyses have also shown that virus prevalence is not always a consequence of the abundance of host species in a certain area. The prevalence pattern of JONV did not follow the abundance pattern of <italic>C. decens</italic> mosquitoes and its abundance seems to be determined by unknown mechanisms, possibly by superinfection exclusion mediated by Cimo rhabdovirus I. The study of prevalence patterns of a broad genetic diversity of RNA viruses and their associated hosts allowed us to seek for general mechanisms influencing emergence and geographic spread of mosquito-associated viruses. No general dilution or amplification effect was observed. Instead, we identified changes in mosquito community composition causing an increase or decrease in the main host species as the most important factor determining virus prevalence patterns, an effect named abundance effect. Remarkably, host infection rates were not affected by higher host abundance in our study.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mosquito collection</title><p>In total, 4562 female mosquitoes were collected in five habitat types along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in the area of the Taï National Park in Côte d’Ivoire in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Junglen et al., 2009b</xref>).

Virus data analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 7.04 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Biodiversity analyses</title><p>All biodiversity analyses were done with R version 3.6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">R Development core Team, 2019</xref>). We used rarefaction curves and Hill numbers of diversity order q = 0 (species richness) to compare mosquito communities between the five habitats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chao et al., 2014</xref>; R-package ‘iNEXT’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chao and Hsieh TCM, 2020</xref>). To this end, we summed the number of mosquito species per habitat and excluded non-defined species from the analysis. For detection of underlying gradients, we used the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Legendre and De Cáceres, 2013</xref>; R-package ‘vegan’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oksanen et al., 2019</xref>) and hierarchical cluster analysis to group main mosquito species according to their habitat association (R-package ‘pheatmap’). To assess whether there are significant associations between these mosquito groups and habitat, we fitted a loglinear model (generalized linear model with ‘log’ link and Poisson error distribution) to the number of mosquitoes counted per group as response variable, with mosquito group and habitat as covariates in interaction. Since there were no counts of <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> species in camp and village, we added a small constant of 1 to all responses to avoid singularities in the model outcome and to be able to model it with a log transformation. We assessed significance of the single terms using a log likelihood ratio test (LRT) of this saturated model.</p><p>We used Spearman’s rho on the full data set to assess which viruses were associated with each other in the different pools. We focused our analyses on abundant viruses we had found at least 10 times in all pools. For assessing virus–habitat relationships expressed as the probability of detecting one of the abundant viruses in a specific habitat, we fitted a generalized linear mixed model with binomial error structure and logit link and the respective virus type detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Swei et al., 2020</xref>) or not (0) as response. As covariates, we included the number of mosquitoes per pool and the habitat. We included the number of mosquitoes per pool as controlling variable because the probability to detect any virus in a pool logically increases when more potential hosts are combined into a pool. Pairwise differences in virus infection probabilities in the habitats were assessed post hoc with Tukey contrasts (R-package multcomp).</p><p>In order to determine the relative contributions and amount of variance explained by host and habitat in partitioning the viral community, we used permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) tests based on Jaccard distance (presence or absence of virus in the pool) (package 'vegan,' function adonis2). We entered mosquito host taxonomy in interaction with habitat and the number of mosquitoes per pool; we only used the main mosquito groups as well as pools with at least one presence of a viral OTU into the analysis, thereby reducing the data set to 122 entries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Nucleotide sequence accession numbers</title><p>The viral sequence fragments and genomes as well as the potential NIRVS were assigned the GenBank accession numbers MZ202249-MZ202305 and MZ399697-MZ399709, respectively.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and George Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Camila Gonzalez (Reviewer #2); Gabriel Hamer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. There is a large amount of data that has undergone very comprehensive analysis but the manuscript needs to be re-written substantially in the context of what is currently known about the transmission and ecology of insect-specific viruses. It appears premature to test hypotheses on ecological patterns of human/vertebrate diseases with these data on mosquito specific viruses.</p><p>2. The paper analyzes data on mosquito specific viruses under the lens of pathogens with public health importance, which is confusing. Clarification is needed as to why analyzing insect-specific virus prevalence and diversity may or may not serve as a model for the study of typical arboviruses, considering the differences in their maintenance in nature.</p><p>3. A caveat of the study is that the (likely) mechanisms of transmission of the viruses identified in the paper were not discussed. Mosquito specific viruses can be transmitted vertically or horizontally, and are in general strongly associated with the environment, but not related with other hosts such as vertebrates. From this perspective, the ecology of transmission of these viruses should not be compared to pathogens that use vertebrate hosts.</p><p>4. The authors found 49 viruses, but emphasize the ecological relevance of their findings to five viruses with increased prevalence from pristine to disturbed habitats, to show a dilution effect. This should be discussed.</p><p>5. It appears that nearly half of the mosquitoes in three of the study sites could not be identified to species. This appears problematic for the estimation of host (mosquito) richness and diversity along the anthropogenic gradient.</p><p>6. Viral taxonomy is also complicated and this study is presenting many new viruses which, based on partial or whole sequencing, are putative novel viruses. For many of the putative new viruses, only small sequences of less than 1200 nt were analysed. Granted that the RdRp is the most conserved gene, how was the 5% demarcation for a new species determined when established criteria differ to this. It is not clear how many of these novel viruses would be accepted by current practices endorsed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The viral taxa uncertainty add complexity for the current analysis. How many of these viral lineages that cluster together are variants of the same virus? How many are unique taxonomic units? This has important consequences on the application of these data to the analyses conducted in this study.</p><p>7. Many of these viruses the authors documented are mostly Insect-specific viruses (ISVs). But it also appears that several could be amplified by vertebrate hosts with poorly understood natural history and for the purposes of this study, all of the viral taxa appear to be grouped together. The inclusion of all viruses is therefore somewhat confounding given the very different natural history associated with these viruses. You frequently refer to 'hosts' throughout the manuscript and for ISVs, the host would likely only be mosquitoes but for arboviruses involving vertebrate amplification hosts, the hosts would be both the mosquitoes and the vertebrates. This study did not quantify any aspect of vertebrate host abundance, diversity, or richness across the gradient. Since most of this study focuses just on the ISVs as a unique system to test the hypotheses, it would be interesting if the authors restricted the analysis to just those viruses with higher probability of being restricted to mosquitoes (e.g. based on phylogenetic placement) to see if the results remain the same.</p><p>8. You report an anthropogenic disturbance gradient from primary forest to village habitat but how was this quantified? How is a village more disturbed than an agricultural field (rice plantation?)? The method to rank these study sites, which becomes important for the analysis, was not described in the methods.</p><p>9. Also, along this topic of study sites, it appears you really only had one replicate of each of the study site type. To test these hypotheses on how host communities influence viral communities it would seem prudent to have had multiple replicates of each study area.</p><p>10. A suggested important contribution of the paper is the finding of an &quot;abundance effect&quot;, suggesting that higher prevalence in degraded ecosystems is the result of host abundance, but additional ecological information is missing on the potential mechanisms leading to this effect. Breeding sites may be a main source of variation in species composition and abundances among habitats, but no comments on this are found on the manuscript.</p><p>11. Some additional useful information could be provided to better understand mosquito sampling, for instance: the number of traps used, duration of sampling in each locality, and sampling dates to understand if there could be seasonal variation.</p><p>12. Mesoniviruses: Some mesonivirus species have been shown to be expectorated by mosquitoes, which explains their presence in multiple mosquito genera and suggests multiple modes of transmission. Perhaps insect-specific bunyaviruses could be the same given their detection in multiple mosquito genera?</p><p>13. Please clarify whether the numbers of pools of each mosquito species collected at each site are the same as in Table 1 of ref 29. I wanted to be able to see the actual numbers of mosquitoes collected at each location.</p><p>14. In line 97, it is stated that the aim was to capture all major taxa of arthropod-associated viruses, but I note that no assays were included to detect negeviruses, which are a growing taxon of insect-specific viruses.</p><p>15. The Results section is too long, particularly with detailed virologic information, and includes parts that should go on the discussion.</p><p>I strongly suggest to include SI Figure 1 (Biodiversity analyses) as a figure in the text since the main conclusions are based on variation of mosquito communities´ composition, and this is the result showing it.</p><p>16. Ln. 128: The authors state &quot;primer and sequences and cycling conditions are available upon request&quot;. If this is the first study to present the results from these newly designed primers, they should be included in this publication. Perhaps as supplemental material. In fact right not it is hard for me to know if you had 8 primer pairs for these RT-PCRs or if any targets overlapped and shared a forward sequence for example. In the following sentences you say you used previously published assays as well, which appear to be a combination of conventional and real-time assays, so now it is getting hard to untangle which results came from which PCR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done an excellent job of displaying very complex data, but I do believe that the methods for the transmission of these viruses in nature needs to be taken into consideration. Granted though, that there are likely to be differing scenarios for different viral families. E.g. Flaviviruses: Numerous groups have shown vertical transmission as the mechanism for persistence of insect-specific flaviviruses in nature. Furthermore most insect-specific flavivirus species have been detected in only one species of mosquito suggesting strong evolution of the virus with their mosquito host.</p><p>Mesoniviruses: Some mesonivirus species have been shown to be expectorated by mosquitoes, which explains their presence in multiple mosquito genera and suggests multiple modes of transmission.

In terms of the flaviviruses, it is generally considered that a new virus species must have &gt;16% sequence identity (nt) to be considered a distinct species.</p><p>Please clarify that in Figure 8, that the left hand graph is all detections of the virus, despite the mosquito species – this didn't come across clearly in the figure legend.</p><p>Were there any attempts to obtain isolates of Cimo peribunyaviruses I and II?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Results section is too long, particularly with detailed virologic information, and includes parts that should go on the discussion.</p><p>I strongly suggest to include SI Figure 1 (Biodiversity analyses) as a figure in the text since the main conclusions are based on variation of mosquito communities´ composition, and this is the result showing it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Ln. 21: Consider change to &quot;…on the mechanism of emergence.&quot;</p><p>Ln. 22: Consider change to &quot;...often observe contradictory results.&quot;</p><p>Ln. 27: &quot;was&quot; should be &quot;were&quot;.</p><p>Ln. 28: You reference congruence to the dilution effect hypothesis here.

Would be good if the table legend or footnotes could explain the abbreviations in the column headers. I think these refer to study sites. Is there a way to sum these study sites and present a total number of unique viruses from each of the study sites? Would this be the number displayed in Figure 7A?</p><p>Ln. 260. You are using the term 'insect-restricted' here and in a couple other locations. Is this the same as 'insect-specific'? If so, I suggest staying consistent with insect-specific which you already use elsewhere in the manuscript. Or you could say these viruses are restricted to mosquitoes if that is appropriate in context.</p><p>Figure 2.

I'm not familiar with this process to attempt to identify if a virus is insect-specific by increasing temperature using insect cells (C6/36). But this sounds strange because holding C6/36 at 34C doesn't sound good for the cells so did the virus not replicate because the cells were all dead?

There is a large amount of data that has undergone very comprehensive analysis but the manuscript needs to be re-written substantially in the context of what is currently known about the transmission and ecology of insect-specific viruses. It appears premature to test hypotheses on ecological patterns of human/vertebrate diseases with these data on mosquito specific viruses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for carefully reading the manuscript and your comment. With this study we aimed to get insight into fundamental questions in the field of disease ecology. Our main aim was to explore how a host community structure, such as number of species, relative abundance of species, and relative number of individuals per species in a community, influences the abundance, prevalence and spread of pathogens using mosquitoes and their associated viruses as a multi-host and multi-pathogen model system. We studied the dynamics of mosquito-associated viruses in relation to ecosystem and mosquito community changes. We revised the manuscript to clarify that we are not testing hypotheses on ecological patterns of human and vertebrate diseases. However, our study provides important insight how the composition of mosquito communities can affect the abundance and prevalence of mosquito-associated viruses. In consequence, these data may help to gain further insight into the dynamics of mosquito-borne viruses with respect to human and vertebrate diseases tackled from the vector part of the transmission cycle.</p><p>Mosquitoes and their viruses are an excellent system to study the effect of host community composition on pathogen abundance and prevalence patterns as mosquito communities can easily be sampled in high numbers and show high infection rates with mosquito-specific viruses. In contrast, mosquito-associated viruses causing disease in humans and vertebrates are rarely found in pristine habitats in nature and it is much more difficult to assess how ecosystem and host community changes affect their abundance. In the light of large-scale land use changes and unprecedented biodiversity loss, it is of utmost importance to understand how these ecological changes affect mosquito species composition and abundance of their associated pathogens. The data generated in this study will thus help to elucidate emergence processes of mosquito-associated viruses at the interface of undisturbed tropical ecosystems and anthropogenic landscapes.</p><p>We added the following paragraph to the introduction summarizing what is currently known about the ecology and transmission of insect-specific viruses (lines 88 – 106):</p><p>“In addition to the vertebrate-pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), e.g. dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (33, 34), mosquitoes can also be infected with so called insect-specific viruses (ISVs), which cannot infect vertebrates due to several host restriction barriers, e.g. sensitivity to higher (body) temperatures and inability to replicate in vertebrate cells (35, 36). All arbovirus taxa are embedded in a much greater phylogenetic diversity of ISVs, which suggests that arboviruses evolved from ancestral arthropod-restricted viruses (35-38). The mode of transmission of most ISVs in nature remains largely unknown but is suggested to rely on direct transmission. For some insect-specific flaviviruses, vertical transmission to the progeny was described and is considered to play an important role for virus maintenance in nature (35, 39-41). Additional transmission mechanisms of ISVs may include shared food sources, ectoparasites or venereal transmission (reviewed in (37, 42, 43)). It has been shown that at least some flavi-, mesoni and bunyaviruses are expectorated during feeding which may provide a route for horizontal virus transmission (44-47). However, transmission dynamics may differ among virus species and viral families and data are lacking describing maintenance and transmission of ISVs related to arboviruses (43). Knowledge on the natural transmission of ISVs has been mainly studied for entomopoxviruses and baculoviruses which infect other insects than mosquitoes (48). Due to their high abundance in natural mosquito populations, ISVs can thus serve as model systems to study how changes in mosquito species assembly affect associated virus abundance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The paper analyzes data on mosquito specific viruses under the lens of pathogens with public health importance, which is confusing. Clarification is needed as to why analyzing insect-specific virus prevalence and diversity may or may not serve as a model for the study of typical arboviruses, considering the differences in their maintenance in nature.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for this comment. We are sorry if it was not clear that we are not focussing on pathogens with public health importance. However, we are studying how the structure of a host community affects infection rates. Such data may provide general insight into linkages between a host community structure and infectious diseases including diseases affecting humans. Infectious diseases are transmitted among individuals of a community, and it is so far not clear how a host community structure influences transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. As outlined above (see response 1), in this study we are testing how the structure of a natural host community influences pathogen abundance and infection rates using viruses that naturally infect mosquitoes in a natural system. Importantly, this study system is a multi-host and multi-pathogen system that allows to assess host-pathogen-specific differences depending on host and pathogen traits, as well as to identify common patterns among different host and pathogen species. So far, studies on multi-host and multi-pathogens have rarely been conducted and if so, were mostly based on a theoretical framework. Empirical data from natural communities, particularly empirical data analysing effects of a mosquito community structure on viral infections, are hardly available. Notably, in light of the current unprecedented biodiversity loss it is unclear how ecological changes such as deforestation and agricultural intensification affect the mosquito community composition, how the mosquito community is structured in changed landscapes and in turn how this affects viruses that are carried by mosquitoes that are resilient to disturbance.</p><p>We carefully revised the manuscript to make this clear. The respective paragraph in the introduction was revised and now reads (lines 82-106):</p><p>“Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis combining fields of community ecology and virology to understand how viral richness depends on host richness, and which role host-habitat associations play for viral abundance patterns using viruses that naturally infect mosquitoes in a natural system. Habitat alterations such as agricultural development and urbanization promote thriving of disease-transmitting mosquito species (25-29), but it is less clear how such changes in mosquito species disassembly affect the abundance and prevalence of viruses. From the limited amount of available studies, these mostly focused on effects of land use change on one specific virus (30-32). In addition to the vertebrate-pathogenic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), e.g. dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) (33, 34), mosquitoes can also be infected with so called insect-specific viruses (ISVs), which cannot infect vertebrates due to several host restriction barriers, e.g. sensitivity to higher (body) temperatures and inability to replicate in vertebrate cells (35, 36). All arbovirus taxa are embedded in a much greater phylogenetic diversity of ISVs, which suggests that arboviruses evolved from ancestral arthropod-restricted viruses (35-38). The mode of transmission of most ISVs in nature remains largely unknown but is suggested to rely on direct transmission. For some insect-specific flaviviruses, vertical transmission to the progeny was described and is considered to play an important role for virus maintenance in nature (35, 39-41). Additional transmission mechanisms of ISVs may include shared food sources, ectoparasites or venereal transmission (reviewed in (37, 42, 43)). It has been shown that at least some flavi-, mesoni and bunyaviruses are expectorated during feeding which may provide a route for horizontal virus transmission (44-47). However, transmission dynamics may differ among virus species and viral families and data are lacking describing maintenance and transmission of ISVs related to arboviruses (43). Knowledge on the natural transmission of ISVs has been mainly studied for entomopoxviruses and baculoviruses which infect other insects than mosquitoes (48). Due to their high abundance in natural mosquito populations, ISVs can thus serve as model systems to study how changes in mosquito species assembly affect associated virus abundance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A caveat of the study is that the (likely) mechanisms of transmission of the viruses identified in the paper were not discussed. Mosquito specific viruses can be transmitted vertically or horizontally, and are in general strongly associated with the environment, but not related with other hosts such as vertebrates. From this perspective, the ecology of transmission of these viruses should not be compared to pathogens that use vertebrate hosts.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that the transmission dynamics differ between ISVs and arboviruses. The mechanism of transmission for the viruses identified in this study is not known. Nearly all of the here identified viruses are most likely insect-specific and vertebrates are most likely not involved in their transmission. The text has been revised accordingly focussing on ISVs (also see responses 1 and 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors found 49 viruses, but emphasize the ecological relevance of their findings to five viruses with increased prevalence from pristine to disturbed habitats, to show a dilution effect. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Please note that abundance patterns were analysed and discussed for all 49 viruses (results lines 156 – 234 and discussion lines 359 – 472). However, since only nine of these viruses were detected frequently, and were found to differ in their abundance among the sampling sides, further analyses regarding ecological hypotheses explaining these abundance patterns were thus limited to these nine viruses. For five of these, the detection rates increased in disturbed habitat types, and we found that this effect could be explained by a turnover in the mosquito species composition and a higher abundance of a single mosquito species, <italic>Culex nebulosus</italic>, which is the host for all of the five frequently detected viruses that increased in abundance in disturbed habitat types.</p><p>Regarding the other 40 viruses, we added the following text to the Discussion section (discussion lines 442 – 447):</p><p>“Notably, the vast majority of detected virus species showed low infection rates without any evidence for effects of mosquito community changes on their abundance. These findings for 40 distinct viruses infecting different mosquito species suggest that host community disassembly does only influence a small fraction of the pathogen population. These examples underline why an unbiased multi-host and multi-pathogen approach is crucial to uncover host community effects on pathogen prevalence patterns.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It appears that nearly half of the mosquitoes in three of the study sites could not be identified to species. This appears problematic for the estimation of host (mosquito) richness and diversity along the anthropogenic gradient.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that this is a drawback of the analyses, however, basically affecting the species richness curves. Here, although we observed the tendency that richness of PF (primary forest) &gt; C (camp sites) &gt; SF (secondary forest) and A (agriculture) &gt; V (villages), the rarefaction curves show that we only get a significant difference (non-overlapping CI) between PF (C) and V, i.e. the two extremes, with a gradient in between. The proportion of missing mosquito identification actually follows this trend, with the proportion of non-identification being highest in primary forest and lowest in villages (PF 40% , SF 40% , A 24% , C 26% , V 14% ). That means, the chances of higher species richness in primary forest is most likely even larger compared to the small proportion of non-identifications in villages, with a similar gradient in between. These results undermine the general tendency we report in the manuscript.</p><p>This caveat of our study is now addressed in the manuscript (lines 130 – 134):</p><p>“A large fraction of 40%, 40% and 26% of the sampled mosquitoes in the primary and secondary forest as well as at the camp sites, respectively, could not be identified to species level either due to morphological damage or to limitations of taxonomic keys. The actual number of different species in these habitats is therefore likely to be higher and the relative abundance of some mosquito species may have been underestimated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Viral taxonomy is also complicated and this study is presenting many new viruses which, based on partial or whole sequencing, are putative novel viruses. For many of the putative new viruses, only small sequences of less than 1200 nt were analysed. Granted that the RdRp is the most conserved gene, how was the 5% demarcation for a new species determined when established criteria differ to this. It is not clear how many of these novel viruses would be accepted by current practices endorsed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The viral taxa uncertainty add complexity for the current analysis. How many of these viral lineages that cluster together are variants of the same virus? How many are unique taxonomic units? This has important consequences on the application of these data to the analyses conducted in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out and we are sorry if this was not well explained before. Different virus species are generally defined by at least 5% genetic distance within their protein sequences of a specific gene (in most cases the RdRp protein or a combination of different genes) according to the species demarcation criteria of the International Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The viral sequence fragments generated in this study originate from the highly conserved core region of the RdRp gene. As this region is the most conserved part of the RdRp, a 5% threshold based on this highly conserved region can thus be considered as a highly conservative threshold as the genetic distance between two sequences will increase when taking into account less conserved genome regions of the RdRp gene. We thus believe that all 49 viral sequences detected in this study are unique taxonomic units belonging to different species. All analyses presented in this study are based on this assumption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Many of these viruses the authors documented are mostly Insect-specific viruses (ISVs). But it also appears that several could be amplified by vertebrate hosts with poorly understood natural history and for the purposes of this study, all of the viral taxa appear to be grouped together. The inclusion of all viruses is therefore somewhat confounding given the very different natural history associated with these viruses. You frequently refer to 'hosts' throughout the manuscript and for ISVs, the host would likely only be mosquitoes but for arboviruses involving vertebrate amplification hosts, the hosts would be both the mosquitoes and the vertebrates. This study did not quantify any aspect of vertebrate host abundance, diversity, or richness across the gradient. Since most of this study focuses just on the ISVs as a unique system to test the hypotheses, it would be interesting if the authors restricted the analysis to just those viruses with higher probability of being restricted to mosquitoes (e.g. based on phylogenetic placement) to see if the results remain the same.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The analyses were indeed performed with viruses that are most likely restricted to mosquitoes. In total, 45 of the 49 viruses detected in this study grouped with ISVs in phylogenetic analyses. Some of these viruses were isolated in cell culture and we found no indication for the ability to infect vertebrate hosts. All of the isolated viruses were temperature-sensitive and did not replicate in the tested vertebrate cell lines including the immunodeficient Vero cell line. Only four of the detected 49 viruses may also be able to infect vertebrates according to placement in phylogenetic analyses (the two peribunyaviruses Cimo peribunyavirus I and II, the phenuivirus Cimo phenuivirus V and the orbivirus Wanken orbivirus). However, these four viruses were rarely detected (in total between one and five strains were found) and not included in the abundance analyses. The abundance analyses were based on viruses that were found at least ten times in the sample set. This was fulfilled for nine viruses. Five of these nine viruses could be isolated in cell culture and infection experiments as well as phylogenetic analyses indicated an insect-specific transmission cycle. The four viruses, which could not be isolated in cell culture, are closely related to previously described insect-specific viruses. We are therefore convinced that the data presented are robust and not influenced by vertebrate hosts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. You report an anthropogenic disturbance gradient from primary forest to village habitat but how was this quantified? How is a village more disturbed than an agricultural field (rice plantation?)? The method to rank these study sites, which becomes important for the analysis, was not described in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Our anthropogenic disturbance gradient was defined by apparent presence and density of humans as given by housing, e.g. camps and villages. In addition, we accounted for the degree of plant species turnover from primary forest to agriculture. The camp is an exception, as it is surrounded by primary forest and thus has a similar vegetation as the primary rainforest; however, we rated human presence higher and therefore grouped the camp closer to the village (Figure 1 a).</p><p>We added this explanation to the methods section (lines 508 – 512):</p><p>“The anthropogenic disturbance gradient was defined by apparent presence and density of humans as given by housing, e.g. camps and villages.

Also, along this topic of study sites, it appears you really only had one replicate of each of the study site type. To test these hypotheses on how host communities influence viral communities it would seem prudent to have had multiple replicates of each study area.</p></disp-quote><p>The sampling design was balanced with different numbers of replicates per study site defined by the number of trap nights, so that the total sampling effort per site was approximately the same. The different replicates were then pooled per site for the analysis. However, we did not treat the replicates in our habitats separately in the model, but the 430 pools for several reasons. We did so, because the replicates themselves were not blocks of repetitions, but contained variance due to different trap heights in the canopy in some replicates, and e.g. for agriculture different replicates in plantations and arable fields. However, we wanted to elucidate the overall effect of human influence, and therefore we pooled the replicates per habitat, with the single pools with distinct mosquito species treated as replicates in the analyses. The field study with the different sampling locations is described in detail in Junglen et al. 2009 EcoHealth (49).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. A suggested important contribution of the paper is the finding of an &quot;abundance effect&quot;, suggesting that higher prevalence in degraded ecosystems is the result of host abundance, but additional ecological information is missing on the potential mechanisms leading to this effect. Breeding sites may be a main source of variation in species composition and abundances among habitats, but no comments on this are found on the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We added the following text to the discussion (lines 409 – 418):</p><p>“The ecological mechanisms leading to changes in mosquito community composition due to anthropogenic disturbance are presently poorly understood. Environmental changes, including land-use changes, but also changes in the host species composition have been suggested to act as drivers of vector-borne diseases, including important arboviral diseases like dengue (84-86). Yet, very few studies have focused on Culex nebulosus. It has been reported as a sylvatic species in Nigeria, Benin and Mozambique (87-89) but to the best of our knowledge this is the first study showing an increasing abundance of Culex nebulosus in modified ecosystems. Possible reasons for the varying mosquito community compositions in the different habitat types might be the availability of suitable breeding sites and food sources, the abundance of predators as well as differences in temperature and humidity (90-92).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Some additional useful information could be provided to better understand mosquito sampling, for instance: the number of traps used, duration of sampling in each locality, and sampling dates to understand if there could be seasonal variation.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added the following section (lines 500 – 508):</p><p>“In total, 4562 female mosquitoes were collected in five habitat types along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient in the area of the Taï National Park in Côte d’Ivoire in 2004 (49). Habitat types represented pristine forest (PF), secondary forests (SF), agricultural areas (A), camps within primary forest (C) and villages (V) in the order of low to high human disturbance. Mosquitoes were collected using five CDC miniature light traps and one CDC gravid trap (developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, John W. Hock Company, USA) per sampling site which were five sites in the PF, three sites in the SF, four sites in A (coffee, cacao, rice and rice plantations), four camp sites (C) and two villages (V). Sampling was conducted for three consecutive days per sampling site from February until June 2004.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Mesoniviruses: Some mesonivirus species have been shown to be expectorated by mosquitoes, which explains their presence in multiple mosquito genera and suggests multiple modes of transmission. Perhaps insect-specific bunyaviruses could be the same given their detection in multiple mosquito genera?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a plausible hypothesis and should be studied in the future.

We tried to establish a generic RT-PCR assay to screen the mosquito homogenates for infection with negeviruses but unfortunately without success.

While negeviruses grow to high titres in cell culture and could easily be detected by our assay in cell culture supernatant, it was not possible to amplify viral genome fragments from the mosquito homogenates. The amount of genome copies in primary mosquito material seems to be too low to allow for virus detection in primary material using generic RT-PCR. Therefore, it was not possible to include negevirus for the analyses of this study.

Would this be the number displayed in Figure 7A?</p></disp-quote><p>We included the following sentence in the legend of table 1 to explain the abbreviations:</p><p>“Abbreviations are PF, primary forest; SF, secondary forest; A, agriculture; C, camp and V, village.”</p><p>The total number of unique viruses from each study site is displayed in Figure 7A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln. 260. You are using the term 'insect-restricted' here and in a couple other locations. Is this the same as 'insect-specific'? If so, I suggest staying consistent with insect-specific which you already use elsewhere in the manuscript. Or you could say these viruses are restricted to mosquitoes if that is appropriate in context.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment. We changed the term “insect-restricted” to “insect-specific” in the whole manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2. For all these phylogenetic trees, it is hard to see how large of a gene region (or entire gene?) was used to build these. Would be helpful to include the number of base pairs, either in legend or in methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>The respective alignment size was included in all figure legends of phylogenetic trees.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln. 356. I'm not familiar with this process to attempt to identify if a virus is insect-specific by increasing temperature using insect cells (C6/36). But this sounds strange because holding C6/36 at 34C doesn't sound good for the cells so did the virus not replicate because the cells were all dead? Do you have a control of some kind showing C6/36 are still healthy at 34C? Did you attempt to grow these viruses in vertebrate cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This method was described by Marklewitz et al. (PNAS; 2015; doi: 10.1073/pnas.1502036112). The C6/36 cells remain viable up to 34°C and arboviruses such as Rift Valley fever virus and La Crosse virus can still replicate in C6/36 cells at 34°C. We included this reference:</p><p>“The cells were infected at a MOI of 0.1 and incubated for 3 days at 28, 30, 32 and 34°C to determine temperature sensitivity as previously described for dual-host and insect-specific bunyaviruses (36).”</p><p>We also tried to infect vertebrate cells with these viruses but they did not replicate in any of the cell lines tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln. 365. You are presenting the detection of viral integration into the mosquito genome but it is not clear how these observations were treated in the context of the analysis of viral taxonomy across the study sites. I assume there were ignored.</p></disp-quote><p>The potentially integrated virus-like sequences were not included in the diversity and prevalence analyses. They are only shown in Table 1 and characterized in the section “Detection of non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences.” To clarify this, we included the following sentence:</p><p>“These findings were not included in the virus diversity and prevalence analyses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln. 394.

True, so you should pull in the relevant literature from plant viruses (and in particular grasses) which have been used as a system to study the relationship between viral prevalence and host community composition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. These references have been added including the following text:</p><p>“For example, (i) a low diversity of grassland plant species diversity was associated with a higher abundance of fungal plant pathogens (110), (ii) the disease and infection risk of populations of wild pepper (chiltepin) with different viruses increased with the level of human management, which was associated with decreased species diversity and host genetic diversity, and increased host plant density (111), and (iii) the prevalence of four generalist aphid-vectored pathogens (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses) increased in grass host plants as local host richness declined indicating that virus incidence in the focal host species is affected by the composition of the entire host community rather than by dependence on species diversity (110-112).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
