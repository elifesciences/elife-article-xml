circuitry is comprised of rhythm generating centers, one for each limb, that are interconnected by local and long-distance propriospinal neurons thought to carry temporal information necessary for interlimb coordination and gait control. We showed previously that conditional silencing of the long ascending propriospinal neurons (LAPNs) that project from the lumbar to the cervical rhythmogenic centers (L1/L2 to C6), disrupts right-left alternation of both the forelimbs and hindlimbs without significantly disrupting other fundamental aspects of interlimb and speed-dependent coordination (Pocratsky et al., 2020). Subsequently, we showed that silencing the LAPNs after a moderate thoracic contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) resulted in better recovered locomotor function (Shepard et al., 2021). In this research advance, we focus on the descending equivalent to the LAPNs, the long descending propriospinal neurons (LDPNs) that have cell bodies at C6 and terminals at L2. We found that conditional silencing of the LDPNs in the intact adult rat resulted in a disrupted alternation of each limb pair (forelimbs and hindlimbs) and after a thoracic contusion SCI significantly improved locomotor function. These observations lead us to speculate that the LAPNs and LDPNs have similar roles in the exchange of temporal information between the cervical and lumbar rhythm generating centers, but that the partial disruption of the pathway after SCI limits the independent function of the lumbar circuitry. Silencing the LAPNs or LDPNs effectively permits or frees-up the lumbar circuitry to function independently.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>propriospinal neuron</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>synaptic silencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS112304-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magnuson</surname><given-names>David SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Whittemore</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS089324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magnuson</surname><given-names>David SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Whittemore</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NS116935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>Brandon L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Silencing long-descending propriospinal neurons that connect C6 to L2 disrupts right-left alternation of both the forelimbs and hindlimbs in the intact animal, but leads to improved stepping after a mild-moderate thoracic contusion spinal cord injury.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Locomotion is a universal and robust behavior shared by almost all animals. In mammals, locomotion involves spinal circuitry that receives descending commands from supraspinal centers and peripheral input from sensory systems. The spinal locomotor circuitry is thought to consist of rhythm generating centers and pattern formation components which together comprise the central pattern generators (CPGs) for locomotion, first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown, 1911</xref>. It is now believed that each limb has its own CPG, and that the lumbar and cervical pattern generators are interconnected by a propriospinal network comprised of spinal interneurons with axonal projections that interconnect the cervical and lumbar enlargements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brockett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Danner et al., 2017</xref>). More specifically, LAPNs and LDPNs provide functional coupling of the two enlargements allowing precise temporal information to pass between and among the hindlimb and forelimb CPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giovanelli Barilari and Kuypers, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">English, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rossignol et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Juvin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Juvin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref>). This intraspinal network is also thought to be important for the propagation/integration of supraspinal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Courtine et al., 2008</xref>) and sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alstermark and Isa, 2012</xref>) in the uninjured system.</p><p>The LDPNs, a large subset of the spinal inter-enlargement circuitry with cell bodies in the cervical enlargement and projections to the lumbar enlargement, are the current subject of anatomical and molecular investigation due to their potential involvement in coordinated patterned behaviors such as locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flynn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brockett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2014</xref>), as well as their potential for promoting functional recovery from SCI via formation of a de novo bridge to bypass the lesion epicenter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bareyre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vavrek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Flynn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benthall et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>SCI disrupts the communication between the brain and spinal cord, resulting in an immediate inability to initiate and maintain patterned weight-supported locomotion at or below the level of lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dietz and Harkema, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">CÃ´tÃ© et al., 2017</xref>). Even if classified as neurologically complete, most clinical SCIs are anatomically incomplete as there is some sparing of white matter at the lesion epicenter, most often the outermost rim of the lateral and ventrolateral funiculi where the LAPN and LDPN axons reside. Therefore, these neurons and their axons may comprise a percentage of the anatomically spared circuitry, thus providing a functional bridge across the injury site. Due to these anatomical characteristics, their resistance to cell death following incomplete SCI, and their presumed function in intact animals, these neurons are well-suited to participate in locomotor recovery after incomplete SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conta and Stelzner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conta Steencken and Stelzner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conta Steencken et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siebert et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our recently published work which targeted LAPNs before and after a low thoracic contusive SCI revealed that the LAPNs secure left-right coordination of the hindlimbs and forelimbs in a context-dependent manner during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref>). More explicitly, when LAPNs were silenced, animals displayed right-left coordination (phase values) outside of alternation (values ~0.5), but at speeds normally associated with strict alternation and without disruption of the primary speed-dependent gait characteristics (e.g. stance/swing times). This phenotype was context-specific and only occurred when the animals were moving from point A to B, nose up on a surface with a high coefficient of friction. The phenotype disappeared (strict alternation was observed) when animals explored (nose-down), when on a low coefficient of friction surface, or when on a treadmill. We thus hypothesized that silencing LAPNs post-SCI would lead to worse interlimb coordination but found just the opposite. Silencing LAPNs restored overground stepping ability, suggesting LAPNs have a maladaptive role in recovered locomotion after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref>). As described earlier, the anatomical location of LDPNs suggests some are spared post-SCI and could serve as a neural substrate for functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brockett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that LDPNs help secure forelimb-hindlimb coordination in the intact animal, and will contribute to the recovery of function post-SCI. To test this hypothesis, and to advance our work on the long propriospinal network, we conditionally silenced LDPNs in the intact animal and after recovery from an incomplete SCI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Silencing LDPNs alters hindlimb interlimb coordination while maintaining intralimb coordination and key locomotor features in uninjured animals</title><p>For this study, we employed a two-virus synaptic silencing strategy developed by Tadashi Isa and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kinoshita et al., 2012</xref>). This system involves a highly efficient lentiviral vector (HiRet) with a tetracycline response element upstream of enhanced tetanus neurotoxin (eTeNt) and EGFP (eTeNT.EGFP) that infects neuron terminals. Next, an AAV2/2 virus that contains a tetracycline transactivator (rtTAV16) is delivered which infects neuron cell bodies. Doxycycline (Dox) then induces the production of eTeNT/EGFP which cleaves the vesicular docking protein VAMP2 thus preventing neurotransmitter release and silencing the neurons based only on their anatomy, any/only neurons with terminals exposed to the lentiviral vector and cell bodies exposed to the AAV2/2 will be silenced, as employed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref>). To silence the LDPNs, we performed bilateral injections at L2 and C6 spinal cord segments to doubly infect LDPNs at their terminals and cell bodies, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Only doubly-infected neurons that constitutively express rtTAV16 will then express enhanced tetanus neurotoxin (eTeNT) in the presence of Dox. At the level of the cell terminal, active eTeNT prevents synaptic vesicle release, leading to âsilencedâ neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Removing Dox restores functional neurotransmission, allowing for reversible silencing of inter-enlargement LDPNs both before and after SCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We examined the coupling patterns of the limb pairs by comparing the temporal relationship, which can be expressed as a phase value. As described in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pocratsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>), phase is determined by dividing the initial contact time of the trailing limb by the stride time of the leading limb. Phase values of 1 indicate synchrony and values of 0.5 indicate alternation of the limb pair. We determined the mean phase value of the limb pairs and any value &gt;2 âSD from this mean was considered âirregular,â as defined by the blue boxes. All the locomotor assessments were done on two different walking surfaces as previously described: bare acrylic with a coefficient of friction (CoF) of 0.44 and Sylgard-coated acrylic with a CoF of 1.73, representing surfaces with relatively poor grip and extremely good grip, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and timeline.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bilateral injections of enhanced tetanus neurotoxin (eTeNT) (green) and tetracycline transactivator (rtTAV16) (yellow) were performed at L2 and C6 spinal cord levels, respectively, followed by a spinal cord injury (black star). Administration of doxycycline (Dox, <bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) induces eTeNT expression in doubly-infected neurons. (<bold>B</bold>) When each viral vector is injected into the location of anatomically defined cell terminals (1. EGFP.eTeNT, green), and neuronal cell bodies (3. AAV2, yellow) the EGFP.eTeNT is retrogradely transported (2.) and the neuron becomes doubly-infected. rtTAV16 is activated in the presence of doxycycline (Dox, red) and can bind to the TRE promotor, which induces eTeNT.EGFP expression (4.). It is anterogradely transported down to the cell bodies (5.), where it cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and prevents the release of vesicular contents into the synapse (6. silenced neurotransmission). (<bold>C</bold>) Before and after viral injections (i) and (ii), pre-injury behavioral assessments were taken at three control time points (gray boxes) and a single round of Dox administration (red box). In viral injection (uninjured) controls, and following spinal cord injury (SCI) (iii), behavioral assessments were repeated at control time points (gray boxes) and during Dox administration (red boxes).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82944-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>When the LDPNs were silenced in otherwise intact animals, we observed a disruption of right-left hindlimb and forelimb alternation that was, in many respects, similar to those observed for LAPN silencing. The two limb pairs demonstrated a substantial proportion of irregular steps and the disruption involved a similar bias towards the hindlimbs, with the forelimb pair showing less significant disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, in contrast to the highly context-dependent LAPN phenotype, LDPN silencing disrupted left-right hindlimb alternation for both the hindlimbs and forelimbs and occurred on both the low CoF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâc</xref>; small yellow circles; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>) and the high CoF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D and E</xref>; small red circles; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>) surfaces. Also distinct from what we saw with the LAPNs, a second round of Dox administration led to greater disruptions in the alternation of both limb pairs, as well as the contralateral hindlimb-forelimb pair, such that there were a greater number of irregular steps during Dox2 than during Dox1, and again these disruptions occurred on both surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâE</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). During silencing, the disruption to interlimb coordination included modest but significant changes in heterolateral/contralateral and homolateral/ipsilateral forelimb-hindlimb coupling, as observed previously when silencing the LAPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>). Based on the magnitude of the effect and the apparent hierarchy of impact, we consider the disruption of forelimb-hindlimb coupling to be secondary to the partial de-coupling of the forelimb and hindlimb pairs (see discussion). The silencing effects on limb pair relationships were restored when Dox was removed from the drinking water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâE</xref>, âPostD1â).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Silencing-induced perturbations for long descending propriospinal neurons (LDPNs) are not context-dependent.</title><p>For Control (e.g. PD1=pre Dox 1), doxycycline (Dox) (e.g. D1D5=Dox 1 day 5), and post-Dox (PostD1) time points, all individual hindlimb and forelimb steps are graphed using circular phase plots (<bold>A</bold>) assessed using Watsonâs Non-Parametric U<sup>2</sup> circular statistics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Swing time, stance time, stride time, stride frequency, and stride distance comprise well-described gait indices that have been shown to have specific relationships with speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gillis and Biewener, 2001</xref>). As observed previously for the LAPNs, silencing LDPNs did not affect the fundamental gait relationships of swing, stance, or stride times regardless of walking surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâC and FâH</xref>). Stride distance and frequency were also unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E, I and J</xref>). It is interesting to note that overall, even at control time points, the LDPN animals exhibited greater variability in many of the outcome measures, as compared to the LAPNs, but both groups showed a small, but statistically significant increase in mean speed during silencing regardless of stepping surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus, these findings suggest that both the LAPNs and LDPNs have roles in securing interlimb coordination but that removing them from the circuitry does not affect velocity-dependent step cycle characteristics or the locomotor rhythm in an otherwise intact rat.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Silencing long descending propriospinal neurons (LDPNs) does not affect key features of locomotion.</title><p>Spatiotemporal measures (swing time, stance time, stride time, stride distance) were plotted against speed for Control (<bold>AâE</bold>) and doxycycline (Dox) (<bold>FâJ</bold>) time points.

These components of interlimb coordination were investigated by plotting the phases of each limb pair against each other at the control and Dox time points, and for each stepping surface. This comparison was not made previously for the LAPNs, so we include those results here (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref> for LAPN methods). During control time points, steps were clustered in the center of the plot for the FL/FL and HL/HL comparisons, indicating that alternating forelimb steps were concomitant with alternating hindlimb steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C and I</xref>). Similarly, alternating hindlimb steps were clustered with synchronous/alternate forelimb steps, contralateral or ipsilateral, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A, B, G and H</xref>). This held true for control testing on both the low and high CoF surfaces. These phase plots demonstrate that during silencing the HL and FL pairs could adopt any possible phase value, but with some over-riding control system that maintained stable stepping even as the two limb pairs were partially decoupled. This can most easily be discerned by noticing that certain combinations of HL/HL â FL/FL phase values simply didnât occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C, F, I and L</xref>) even though each pair expressed the entire possible range of phase values. The spaces in these graphs, most notably centrally in D &amp; J, and middle top and bottom in E &amp; K, also support the concept that forelimb-hindlimb coordination was only disrupted when the forelimb and hindlimb pairs were partially de-coupled and thus was a secondary rather than primary effect of silencing. In addition, there are several specific regions in these phase-phase plots that highlight the differences between the silenced phenotypes for the LAPNs and LDPNs. First, for the LAPNs, there were no perturbations in left-right alternation on the low CoF surface as illustrated by the closely clustered clouds of yellow markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A, E and F</xref>. In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1J, K and I</xref> demonstrate that phase was disrupted for both walking surfaces when the LDPNs were silenced. Second, the appearance of steps with HL/HL and FL/FL phases ~0.25 &amp; 0.75 is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref> as compared to 1 l, given the smaller number of steps analyzed for the LAPN animals. This is also reflected by comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E and K</xref>. In k, it is apparent that the ipsilateral HL-FL pair maintained a phase value around 0.5 even while the HL-HL phase varied throughout the entire range of values on both walking surfaces. Finally, no differences in the base-of-support were detected between the low and high CoF surfaces during silencing for either pathway, suggesting that balance/postural changes likely do not account for these fascinating results (LAPN Dox: 18.36Â±2.97Â° vs 21.44Â±4.48Â°, p&gt;0.05, n.s., paired t-test; LDPN Dox: 18.95Â±7.41 vs 20.11Â±11.91, p&gt;0.05, n.s., paired t-test).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Interlimb coordination persists during swimming in intact animals</title><p>Finally, we examined the effects of LDPN silencing on left-right hindlimb coordination in water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Given this location, it was essential to determine whether the VLF, the area of white matter in which LDPN axons project, was preserved after SCI. To examine this, animals were euthanized during post-injury Dox administration. Their spinal cords were harvested and were blocked in three sections: caudal cervical spinal cord (cell bodies), caudal thoracic spinal cord (injury epicenter and penumbra), and rostral lumbar spinal cord (cell terminals). Thoracic tissue sections were stained at the injury epicenter using eriochrome cyanine (EC) to quantify to amount of spared white matter and imaged to determine where the spared white matter was located. Amongst all animals, the average spared white matter percentage (SWM%) was 26%, slightly higher than that previously described in the LAPN SCI study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In our previous study of the LAPNs, we found that moderate contusive injuries at T10 resulted in disruptions of hindlimb alternation that were not dissimilar to the effects of LAPN silencing. However, silencing LAPNs post-SCI unexpectedly resulted in improved stepping, and in particular restored hindlimb alternation so that it was not significantly different from the uninjured state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref>).

As previously described, RI scores plantar steps according to paw placement order and represents the gait as the ratio of plantar steps that are in order (one of four different orders that normal rats exhibit) over the total number of steps, while CPI represents the number of correctly patterned step cycles (dorsal and plantar) to the total number of cycles (dorsal and plantar) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamers et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caudle et al., 2015</xref>). CPI accounts for whether the animal can achieve coordination regardless of their ability to attain plantar placement, while RI only accounts for correctly patterned plantar steps. RI and CPI were both modestly improved during Dox administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). We also examined the plantar stepping index (PSI), an index that simply compares the number of hindlimb plantar steps as compared to forelimb plantar steps, and it was also modestly improved during silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>When using RI and CPI, an important differentiator is the presence of dorsal steps, which occur when the walking surface is contacted by the dorsum of the foot and/or toes because they remain flexed or curled at stance. Dorsal steps are common after SCI, especially acutely, and are one important measure of recovery from low-thoracic contusive SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basso et al., 1996</xref>). Dorsal stepping index (DSI) is simply the ratio of dorsal steps to the number of total hindlimb steps, thus the DSI in normal uninjured animals should be zero. We compared DSI during post-injury control and silenced time points. The DSI was significantly reduced from 24.31Â±21.02â9.64Â±8.70 during silencing indicating a significant reduction in the overall proportion of dorsal steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This decrease closely resembles the decrease seen in dorsal stepping indices during LAPN post-SCI silencing.</p><p>We also compared the sidedness of dorsal steps. Dorsal step-sidedness refers to the percentage of dorsal steps that occur on the right and the percentage that occurs on the left. The sidedness did not change between control and silencing, with ~55% of dorsal steps occurring in the right hindlimb and ~45% of dorsal steps occurring in the left hindlimb during both control and silenced time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). This is an important observation, as it shows that one limb did not improve to a greater extent than the other. For the purposes of simplicity and ease of comparison with pre-injury data, we utilize the left limb as lead to demonstrate the principle behavioral changes post-SCI, as we did with LAPN SCI data. To further elucidate these improvements in coordination indices, we examined more specific intralimb kinematics and interlimb gait analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>LDPN silencing leads to negligible improvements in intralimb coordination after SCI</title><p>We next examined intralimb coordination using the peak-trough excursions and the temporal relationship between the proximal (iliac crest â hip â ankle) and distal (hip â ankle â toe) angles of the three-segment, two-angle kinematic hindlimb model we employ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8AâD</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>).

Following injury, the average coordination value of these two angles was unchanged between Control and Dox, even while the variability was somewhat reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>), indicating that silencing the LDPNs had a negligible effect on intralimb coordination post-SCI.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Long descending propriospinal neuron (LDPN) silencing has no effect on intralimb coordination after spinal cord injury.</title><p>Angle-angle plots and excursion traces are shown using our three-segment, two-angle model of the hindlimb which incorporates the hip-knee into the proximal angle and the knee-ankle into the distal angle.

We included both plantar and dorsal steps for the purposes of quantifying interlimb coordination, with left dorsal steps identified as teal throughout the remaining figures. As was seen during LAPN silencing, the hindlimb-hindlimb pair and the hindlimb-forelimb pairs are partially decoupled at all post-SCI Control time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, gray circles).

Heterolateral coupling (HL-FL) was also improved, but reached significance only on D8. Interestingly, the improvement in HL-HL coupling was not significant at any Dox3 time point, suggesting that there may be some plastic changes occurring within the circuitry over this 3 week period from D2D5 to D3D14. Importantly, hindlimb coupling is seen as significantly improved when Control and Dox time points are collapsed, suggesting that the total number of steps that fall outside normal variability are reduced overall by LDPN silencing from ~23 â ~12% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

Finally, the reduced prevalence of dorsal steps during post-injury silencing of both LAPNs and LDPNs accounted for some, but not all, of the improvement in hindlimb interlimb coordination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Silencing LDPNs modestly improves balance and posture post-SCI</title><p>Populations of descending cervico-lumbar projections have been implicated as essential for postural stability during overground locomotion in the uninjured mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruder et al., 2016</xref>). To determine if this holds true for the LDPNs post-SCI, we examined measures that are associated with balance and postural control. Uninjured animals typically have a relatively narrow base of support. In conditions with increased postural instability, such as SCI, the paws become externally rotated and the base of support widens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basso et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, we looked at gait angle, the angle made by three subsequent hindlimb placement points (R-L-R), diagonal length (distance from L hindpaw to R forepaw placement), and rear track width (distance between R and L hindpaw placements) and found that all three were modestly improved during silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10AâC</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Indicators of postural stability were mildly improved during post-spinal cord injury (SCI) long descending propriospinal neuron (LDPN) silencing.</title><p>Throughout this figure, the right hindlimb (RH) will be shown in blue, the left hindlimb (LH) will be shown in yellow, the right forelimb (RF) will be shown in red, and the left forelimb (LF) will be shown in green.

However, these relationships are disrupted by the SCI model chosen, such that a substantial proportion of dorsal and some plantar steps fall outside the typically described relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A-E</xref>). Silencing LDPNs restored these relationships and resulted in a dramatic reduction in the variability of abnormal steps, regardless of dorsal or plantar stepping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11FâJ</xref>). Importantly, average swing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11K</xref>) and stance times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11L</xref>) were unchanged during post-SCI silencing as was the duty cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11M</xref>). Finally, the average locomotor speed was modestly increased during post-injury silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11N</xref>) suggesting that speed may be a factor in the improved spatiotemporal relationships. Together with the previous findings, these data suggest that silencing LDPNs after SCI positively influences the temporal coordination of multiple aspects of locomotion, primarily interlimb (HL-HL) coordination. It is imperative to note that while the pattern of improvements observed with LDPN silencing post-SCI is very similar to those seen when the LAPNs were silenced, the overall magnitude of improvement is modest by comparison, where the LAPN silencing induced a more robustly improved phenotype.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Long descending propriospinal neuron (LDPN) silencing restores key features of locomotion are restored following post-SCI.</title><p>Relationships between swing time, stance time, stride time, and stride distance are plotted against speed for Control (<bold>A-E</bold>) and doxycycline (Dox) (<bold>F-J</bold>) time points.

Supporting those data, current results indicate that inter-enlargement LDPNs are an essential pathway in securing interlimb coordination of both the forelimb and hindlimb pairs. When LDPNs were removed from the circuitry via synaptic silencing, there was a greater impact on hindlimb alternation than on the forelimbs, as shown by the higher proportion of affected steps. Furthermore, disrupted forelimb-hindlimb coordination was observed only when the right-left alternation of the forelimb and hindlimb pairs occurred, suggesting that the latter is the primary impact of silencing while the former is a secondary effect. The role of LDPNs in locomotor function after SCI has not previously been reported. We found that silencing the LDPNs after SCI brought about modest but meaningful improvements in postural stability concomitant with mild but significant improvements in hindlimb-hindlimb coordination, including paw placement order and timing, and speed-dependent gait indices. These improvements occurred in the absence of any disruption to forelimb alternation, a hallmark of LDPN silencing in uninjured animals, or changes in hindlimb-forelimb coordination. Collectively, these findings suggest that rather than securing alternation of the hindlimbs and forelimbs, spared LDPNs hinder the capability of lumbar circuitry below the level of the lesion to function optimally, contributing to diminished stepping capacity at chronic post-injury time points. No doubt, these results are counter-intuitive because any decrease in spared axons that cross the site of injury should have a negative impact on locomotor function/recovery.</p><p>However, these results follow two recent studies from our laboratory focused on LAPNs, the ascending equivalent to the LDPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref>). LAPN silencing in uninjured animals disrupted interlimb coordination that mimicked the findings with LDPN silencing, but with several important differences. Perturbations with LAPN silencing were more robust, context-specific, and had a more even disruption to both forelimb and hindlimb pairs. Neither manipulation significantly influenced interlimb coordination during swimming, intralimb coordination, or speed-dependent gait characteristics during stepping within the limitations of the assessment strategy. Taken together with our anatomical analysis of these two populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pocratsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref>), our results lead us to suggest that LAPNs and LDPNs form an inter-enlargement loop, providing temporal information used to secure R-L coordination within each enlargement. Clearly, the context specificity of the LAPN-silenced phenotype argues that sensory input is critical, perhaps to trigger enhanced supraspinal oversight when stepping conditions are not optimal. The speculation that these two populations are part of an anatomical and functional inter-enlargement network is further supported by the similar impact of post-SCI synaptic silencing. When presumably spared LAPNs or LDPNs were silenced post-SCI, we observed significant improvements in stepping. In the case of the LAPNs, the precision of R-L hindlimb alternation was essentially restored to pre-injury levels, and the incidence of dorsal stepping was greatly reduced. The impact of LDPN silencing post-SCI was less pronounced, but still resulted in measurable improvements in both interlimb coordination and trunk stability. Taken together, these results suggest that disruption of an already incomplete (due to the loss of white matter at the injury epicenter) ascending-descending circuit frees-up or permits the lumbar spinal circuitry to function more autonomously, unimpeded by incomplete or noisy information.</p><p>Interestingly, the thoracic contusion injury utilized here and previously (NYU 12.5 g-cm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref>) resulted in a disruption to hindlimb alternation similar to that seen during LDPN silencing but did not disrupt forelimb alternation. Silencing selectively removes the targeted LAPNs or LDPNs, whereas a contusive injury is anatomically selective for the dorsal columns (including the CST), lateral, ventrolateral, and ventral white matter with a medial to lateral bias. This then suggests that the loss of the dorsal columns plus some of the LAPN or LDPN axons (following injury) results in an increased supraspinal oversight of forelimb coordination that ignores or is resilient to the additional impact of LAPN or LDPN silencing. Forelimb alternation is intact at all time points post-thoracic contusion, whereas hindlimb alternation is disrupted by the thoracic contusion or by LAPN or LDPN silencing.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruder et al., 2016</xref> reported that in the adult mouse, ablation of LDPNs using intersectional approaches reduced the speed and duration of spontaneous locomotor bouts, and disrupted interlimb coordination during high-speed locomotion on a treadmill. In contrast, our data indicate that, despite the disrupted alternation of the two limb pairs, rats are still able to achieve fairly high rates of speed and that locomotor bouts are sustained and unperturbed when LDPNs are silenced in otherwise intact adults. These discrepancies may arise from several differences between the two studies. First, the specific neurons targeted by Ruder et al. may have included LDPNs from multiple cervical segments whereas we chose to focus specifically on LDPNs with cell bodies at C6. Second, the ablation of neurons using the genetic approach (with diphtheria toxin) is permanent and may lead to unrecognized circuit reorganization in the adult.</p><p>The LDPN population targeted in the current study may be comprised of different sub-populations of long spinal projection neurons that have been previously defined genetically in mice. Notably, V0v and V2a, but not V0d, neurons residing in the lumbar enlargement have been implicated in securing left-right limb alternation at high speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Talpalar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruder et al., 2016</xref>). V0v are composed of commissurally-projecting inhibitory interneurons and are recruited to maintain left-right alternation as the speed of movement increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lanuza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crone et al., 2009</xref>). The V2a population of neurons are also classified as ipsilateral excitatory glutamatergic interneurons that are involved in left-right alternation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crone et al., 2009</xref>) with minimal involvement in rhythm generation. It is likely that the silenced LDPN population includes some proportion of each of these defined interneurons, given the perturbations to left-right alternation during silencing. However, it is important to note that LDPNs have characteristics that fall in line with both progenitor domains, as they are both ipsilaterally and commissurally-projecting and co-localize with both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Therefore, it is difficult to place these anatomically-defined neurons within the previously described context of genetically-defined V-neuron classes.</p><p>By virtue of their role in communicating higher motor commands to spinal circuits, a major focus of spinal cord repair has been the regeneration of descending tracts across the lesion site to restore lost motor input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tuszynski and Steward, 2012</xref>). As a consequence of the LDPN cell body position within the cervical spinal cord and their central role in the generation of patterned locomotor output prior to the injury, LDPNs are well-suited to receive synaptic contacts from descending supraspinal projections to form âdetour circuitsâ that might propagate (i.e. relay) supraspinal motor system commands to below the level of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bareyre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Courtine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with that suggestion, evidence continues to point to these descending propriospinal neurons as potential targets for functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taccola et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loy and Bareyre, 2019</xref>). Our targeted population of LDPNs represents a partially-spared inter-enlargement pathway that should continue to reliably carry information across the level of injury.</p><p>Another important consideration is the different types of circuitry that provide input to this propriospinal neuronal population. Early electrophysiological data showed that supraspinal motor centers in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and brainstem, along with primary afferents, provide monosynaptic input onto LDPN populations in the cervical spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brink et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alstermark et al., 1987</xref>). More recent work has confirmed the presence of corticospinal and descending serotonergic pathways in LDPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flynn et al., 2017</xref> showed that commissurally-projecting LDPNs received putative synaptic inputs from both excitatory and inhibitory pathways, such as inhibitory pre-motor interneurons, excitatory corticospinal or myelinated afferents, and proprioceptive input from group Ia muscle afferents. Our data showing IHC colocalization with GABA and glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) are consistent with those data, but the specific pathways with which inter-enlargement LDPNs interact is not apparent and requires further investigation.</p><p>At first glance, our results contradict several studies in the field of locomotor recovery in which various populations of descending propriospinal relays of both thoracic and cervical origin are seen as an essential component of recovered stepping ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bareyre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vavrek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Flynn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Courtine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Courtine et al., 2008</xref>). However, the descending populations in these studies are inconsistent in terms of their defined anatomy (location of cell bodies and terminals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This is a critical consideration, as even minor differences in the anatomical location of spared pathways may drastically alter their influence on below-level circuitry and their propensity to enhance recovery after SCI. The extensive differences in how LDPNs are defined may also offer some clues to the described differences in recovered function described here. Descending pathways with more rostral cell bodies within the cervical cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bareyre et al., 2004</xref>) may have an entirely different function than those located more caudally. Others refer to LDPNs without specifying defining anatomical characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vavrek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Courtine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filli et al., 2014</xref>). The ambiguity surrounding long propriospinal neurons complicates the direct comparison of results regardless of how the neuronal activity is being modulated.</p><p>Some of the referenced studies have also focused specifically on the potential of supraspinal axon regeneration/sprouting and synapse formation onto LDPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vavrek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Courtine et al., 2008</xref>). Whether this regeneration/sprouting leads directly to LDPN-dependent improvements in functional outcomes remains uncertain. Our results suggest that spared LDPNs are detrimental to recovered locomotion and thus may not be good targets for regenerative/bridging efforts. Definitive identification of descending propriospinal pathways that do facilitate functional recovery after SCI is essential to understand therapeutically functional plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Experiments were performed in accordance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use (IACUC) and the Institutional Biosafety (IBC) Committees at the University of Louisville.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Animals were housed two per cage under a 12 hr light/dark cycle with ad libitum food and water throughout the course of the study.

Overground stepping was assessed using the BBB Open Field Locomotor Scale as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caudle et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Coordination indices</title><p>RI, CPI, PSI, and DSI were calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Postural stability</title><p>Several measures were used to determine the postural stability of animals during locomotor bouts. Gait angle is the angle between two consecutive initial contacts of a rear hindlimb in reference to the other hindlimb. Typically, a smaller gait angle would indicate higher stability during locomotion, as the hindlimbs are in the line with the body. Larger gait angles would suggest diminished stability as the hindlimbs would be set wider. Gait angle is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem and the X, Y coordinates of the foot while it is in contact with the ground. Statistics were performed on the group means for the left and right hindlimbs (bars: average Â± SD; circles: individual means).</p><p>The diagonal length is the distance between the initial contacts of diagonal paws. For this calculation, the diagonal pair used was left hindlimbâright forelimb. This pair was chosen to remain consistent with hindlimb phase data in which the left hindlimb is the lead limb. The diagonal length is calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem and the X, Y coordinates of each foot.</p><p>Rear track width is the distance between the hindlimbs during consecutive initial contacts. Track width is calculated by taking the absolute value of the Y-coordinate of the left hindlimb initial contact subtracted from the Y-coordinate of the subsequent right hindlimb initial contact. Larger track width indicates a wider stance during stepping, while a smaller track width indicates stance phases more in line with the body.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Ladder</title><p>We quantified the animalsâ ability to effectively traverse a ladder with fixed-spacing rungs (Columbus Instruments, Columbus OH, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metz and Whishaw, 2002</xref>). Behavioral testing was performed on the same time points as BBB testing (PD2, D2D5, D2D8, PostD2, PD3, D3D5, D3D8, and D3D13). Each animal received five stepping trials in each direction. The total number of footfalls was calculated for the left and right hindlimbs, respectively, for each animal across the time points. We then calculated each animalâs average number of foot slips during the Control and Dox time points listed above. Left and right limbs were not combined to demonstrate that the number of foot slips decrease by a similar amount for each hindlimb (i.e. one foot is not different from the other in terms of recovery). Statistics were performed on the group means (bars: average Â± SD; circles: individual means).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Spatiotemporal gait indices</title><p>Spatiotemporal gait analyses were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shepard et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Histological analyses</title><p>Animals were killed on D3D14 (n=10) following terminal BBB and kinematic behavioral assessments. Animals were overdosed with sodium pentobarbital, followed by pneumothorax and transcardial perfusion with 0.1 âM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS solution. Spinal cords were dissected, post-fixed for 1.5 hr, and transferred to 30% sucrose for a minimum of 4 days at 4 Â°C.

Two-tail p-values are reported.</p><p>The Binomial Proportion Test was used to detect significant differences in the proportion of coordination values beyond the control threshold for the raw and transformed interlimb coordination data of various limb pairs prior to and post-SCI. It was also used to determine statistical significance for per-step changes in left-right coordination and change in interlimb phase, raw BBB score differences, intralimb phase and per-step changes in intralimb phase, dorsal steps as a percentage of total steps, and percentage of categorically organized steps (anti-phase, out of phase, in phase).</p><p>Regression analyses were used to compare speed versus spatiotemporal gait indices datasets, including speed vs. swing time, stance time, stride time, and stride distance. Analyses were performed for hindlimb-hindlimb relationships prior to and after SCI.

Trend lines are shown on graphs with 95% prediction intervals indicated by dashed lines.</p><p>Mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni <italic>post hoc</italic> t-tests (where appropriate) were used to detect a significant difference in the BBB scores based on sidedness and condition (i.e. Control vs Dox; graph not shown).

that extend axons to lumbar regions that control the legs and facilitate recovery of walking ability after spinal cord injury. The paper is important because it provides evidence that neurons arising in the neck do not help the recovery of hindlimb function and in fact, mildly impair it. Most of the evidence is convincing although some limitations were noted. The data adds new information on the role of long projecting interneurons in the spinal cord affecting limb coordination during locomotion and how their silencing helps restore partial function after spinal cord injury.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82944.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Cardozo</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04a9tmd77</institution-id><institution>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Cardozo</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04a9tmd77</institution-id><institution>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.08.30.505848">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.30.505848v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Christopher Cardozo as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>When considering how to revise the manuscript please pay particular attention to the following points.</p><p>1. Add one to two sentences that expand on how the viral system used for tet-inducible synaptic silencing works and is used.</p><p>2. Consider further whether it is possible to quantify the efficiency of viral transduction and how variability in efficiency might influence the interpretation of results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Clarification of a few points would help the reader:</p><p>Line 215: why was this location chosen for histology if the injections were done at C2?</p><p>Line 229: avoid the double negative.</p><p>Line 400 or so: could an alternative be that changes in the excitability of local circuits change how information from LDPN is processed? Just a consideration you may wish to discuss.</p><p>Line 497: Please indicate the Î± used for these calculations.</p><p>Line 498: Please consider including the number added to replace lost animals.</p><p>Line 566: Consider rephrasing this. Does this focus the presentation without detracting from completeness since no difference was seen between L and R? In these days of omics huge datasets have become the norm.</p><p>Please review all figure legends to be sure that the meaning of the asterisks shown in the figures is clearly defined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It was not evident why there was not more of a focus on homolateral and heterolateral forelimb/hindlimb coupling. When one thinks about LDPNs, the obvious changes would be expected to be in the forelimb-hindlimb coupling, rather than left-right at lumbar and cervical levels. A disruption in either homolateral or heterolateral coupling is also likely to disrupt left-right coupling. It is understandable that left/right coupling is featured prominently due to the results from the LAPNs but forelimb-hindlimb coupling should also be displayed. Based on Figure 2 supp 1, it looks like heterolateral coupling is disrupted by silencing but not homolateral.</p><p>The single-figure examples of terminals in Figure 6 are not entirely convincing. Some sort of quantification of terminals should be possible in both SCI and uninjured cords. It is also difficult to interpret that data without knowing the approximate percentage of LDPNs that were silenced (or that expressed TeTN).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study explores the role of descending propriospinal neurons on inter-limb coordination during locomotion and how their silencing helps improve some parameters after spinal cord injury. Below are specific concerns and comments on this study.</p><p>Results</p><p>1) Line 96: please clarify how the double infection was performed, which viruses were injected and how did you ensure that neurons were silenced. Figure 1 only outlines the experimental procedure and does not provide any data in this sense. How do the authors control that TeNT is reversible and how long does it take to reverse the silencing?</p><p>2) Were the injected viruses tagged with fluorescent reporters? It would be helpful to provide some quantification on the number of DLPNs neurons and their distribution in the spinal cord. Are they restricted to C6?</p><p>3) Figure 2: please define the abbreviations used in the graphs. Why were values from each trial in the same animal presented rather than the mean value per animal? Is this statistically correct?</p><p>4) It is not clear to this reviewer why and how silencing of DLPNs in lumbar segments affects the coordination of forelimbs.</p><p>4) Figure 3, graphs A-J: it is more relevant to plot data points from control Acryl and Dox Acryl together and control Sylgard and Dox Sylgard together in the same graphs. This will allow the reader the appreciate potential differences. Here again, it is not clear why data points from each trial were presented rather than mean values per animal.</p><p>5) Figure 5: the figure and text need more clarification. The authors should indicate in the different panels the parts of the white matter that have been spared and the location of the descending projections. It is not clear how the authors come to the conclusion that the LDPN axons have been spared while only 26% of white matter was spared.</p><p>6) Figure 6: The authors state that GFP is expressed in cell bodies of neurons in the cervical spinal cord. However, the staining looks more like terminals contacting the stained cell bodies rather than the expression of GFP. Quantifications are necessary here to support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>4) In the discussion, the authors state that the study by Ruder et al. (2016) used developmental ablation of subsets of LDPNs. Ruder et al. used viral infections to express DTR in descending propriospinal neurons in adult mice. The difference in the outcome of this study compared to that of Ruder et al. cannot be explained by circuit reorganization during development. In the present study, there is no information on the extent of silencing and which neuronal populations are affected. This part of the discussion does not reflect the existing data and does not explain the difference in the outcome between this study and Ruder et al. (2016).</p><p>5) Overall, it is not clear how silencing of DLPNs restores some parameters after spinal cord injury and how relevant this approach would be clinically.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Silencing long-descending inter-enlargement propriospinal neurons improves hindlimb stepping after contusive spinal cord injuries&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. Please carefully check and revise the text discussing how your findings relate and compare to those reported by Ruder (2016). In particular, please note that in the Ruder paper, some experiments looking at neural circuits were conducted based upon tamoxifen-induced Cre-mediated recombination at E10.5 (Figure 1) but it appears to us that experiments examining functional outcomes were after manipulating gene expression by injecting viral constructs after birth. Thus, when discussing how ablating subsets of LDPNs please be sure you are referencing and discussing the correct experimental system.</p><p>2. Thank you for informing us of the errors in some of the figures. Please include updated figures with this resubmission and, update figure legends if needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82944.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>When considering how to revise the manuscript please pay particular attention to the following points.</p><p>1.

It is highlighted in the manuscript.</p><p>âFor this study we employed a two-virus synaptic silencing strategy developed by Tadashi Isa and colleagues (Kinoshita et al., 2012). This system involves a highly efficient lentiviral vector (HiRet) with a tetracycline response element upstream of enhanced tetanus neurotoxin (eTeNt) and EGFP (eTeNT.EGFP) that infects neuron terminals. Next, an AAV2/2 virus that contains a tetracycline transactivator (rtTAV16) is delivered which infects neuron cell bodies. Doxycycline (DOX) then induces the production of eTeNT/EGFP which cleaves the vesicular docking protein VAMP2 thus preventing neurotransmitter release and silencing the neurons based only on their anatomy, any/only neurons with terminals exposed to the lentiviral vector and cell bodies exposed to the AAV2/2 will be silenced, as employed previously (Pocratsky et al., 2017, 2020; Shepard et al., 2021). To silence the LDPNsâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Consider further whether it is possible to quantify the efficiency of viral transduction and how variability in efficiency might influence the interpretation of results.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that this is a research advance with 2 other previous <italic>eLife</italic> publications using the identical synaptic silencing system, I will include a slightly modified version of the response to reviews we provided previously:</p><p>âA recent publication from our laboratories (PMID: 33828464) found similar numbers of ipsilateral LAPNs were labeled when using Fluororuby, a 10kD rhodamine dextran amine, (mean number of LAPNs labeled = 135 +/-52) and a dual-viral system (mean number of LAPNs labeled = 126 +/- 46) similar to the dual-viral silencing a silencing system used here. Provided Fluororuby gives an accurate representation of the number of LAPNs at/near the injection sites, the dual-viral silencing system used here likely silences &gt;90% of LAPNs (defined as neurons with cell bodies at L2 and axon terminals at C6). Additionally, eTeNT (produced by the dual-viral silencing system) has extremely high catalytic activity (PMID: 7527117) that is active at very low levels. Which also supports that &gt;90% of LDPNs were silenced in the current study.â</p><p>We agree that the variability in efficiency of silencing could influence the results quantitatively (the robustness of the expressed phenotype) but believe it would be less likely to influence the results qualitatively (some other primary disruption to stepping). In other words, the partial decoupling of the fore and hindlimb pairs in the intact animal and the modest improvement in interlimb coordination when silenced post-injury would very likely remain the same, just more or less robust that what we have observed. Thus, our overall interpretation of the results would be unlikely to change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Clarification of a few points would help the reader:</p><p>Line 215: why was this location chosen for histology if the injections were done at C2?</p></disp-quote><p>Injections were at L2 and C6/7, and here we refer to caudal cervical segments generally, meaning C6/7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 229: avoid the double negative.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion, it has been fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 400 or so: could an alternative be that changes in the excitability of local circuits change how information from LDPN is processed?

When one thinks about LDPNs, the obvious changes would be expected to be in the forelimb-hindlimb coupling, rather than left-right at lumbar and cervical levels. A disruption in either homolateral or heterolateral coupling is also likely to disrupt left-right coupling. It is understandable that left/right coupling is featured prominently due to the results from the LAPNs but forelimb-hindlimb coupling should also be displayed. Based on Figure 2 supp 1, it looks like heterolateral coupling is disrupted by silencing but not homolateral.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the expectations of FL-HL coordination being disrupted is logical. However, our data overall supports the concept that R-L phase at each girdle is controlled at least partially independent of FL-HL coordination. Thus, if R-L phase is disrupted then any/most of the FL-HL coordination changes would be secondary consequences, rather than primary. If FL-HL coordination were the primary disruption, we would anticipate that R-L phase at each girdle would be intact. In response to this concern we have added a figure 2 figure supplement 2 that shows heterolateral and homolateral coupling. In the text we will revisit the idea that FL-HL disruption appears to be secondary to the disruption at each girdle.</p><p>âDuring silencing, the disruption to interlimb coordination included modest but significant changes in heterolateral and homolateral forelimb-hindlimb coupling, as observed previously when silencing the LAPNs (Figure 2 figure supplement 1; Pocratsky et al., 2020). Based on the magnitude of the effect and the apparent hierarchy of impact, we consider the disruption of forelimb-hindlimb coupling to be secondary to the partial de-coupling of the forelimb and hindlimb pairs (see discussion).â</p><p>And later</p><p>âThe spaces in these graphs, most notably centrally in D and J, and middle top and bottom in E and K, also support the concept that forelimb-hindlimb coordination was only disrupted when the forelimb and hindlimb pairs were partially de-coupled and thus was a secondary rather than primary effect of silencing.â</p><p>Added to the Results section.

Some sort of quantification of terminals should be possible in both SCI and uninjured cords. It is also difficult to interpret that data without knowing the approximate percentage of LDPNs that were silenced (or that expressed TeTN).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these images are not very satisfying. We would truly love to be able to provide the requested quanitfication, but it is not feasible. The eTeTN.GFP expression/staining does not seem to be as reliable as the silencing itself and this is the one major drawback of this system (in our opinions). We would make the argument that the phenotype is comparatively robust given the relatively small number of LAPNs and LDPNs (see Brown et al., 2022 PMID:Â 33828464 for LAPN anatomy) and that demonstrating eTeTN.GFP+ fibers in the target region (C6 intermediate gray matter) is sufficient to be confident that the phenotype results from the synaptic silencing of LDPNs rather than some other mechanism. We acknowledge that the LAPNs may also have synapses outside of C6 and in other work we are tackling a comprehensive anatomical analysis in both intact and injured spinal cord (Brown et al. is the first step in that process). We hope this is sufficient even if not ideal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study explores the role of descending propriospinal neurons on inter-limb coordination during locomotion and how their silencing helps improve some parameters after spinal cord injury.

We believe that the LA and LDPNs form an ascending-descending loop that can influence the interlimb coordination at each girdle and as we have shown, this occurs when either the LA or LDPNs are silenced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3, graphs A-J: it is more relevant to plot data points from control Acryl and Dox Acryl together and control Sylgard and Dox Sylgard together in the same graphs. This will allow the reader the appreciate potential differences. Here again, it is not clear why data points from each trial were presented rather than mean values per animal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have chosen to present the acryl vs sylgard for Control and Dox conditions in order to emphasize any context specificity that exists (does walking surface influence the phenotype?), as this is most relevant to interpretation of the data, from our perspective. By placing the control and dox graphs above/below each other we believe a visual comparison can be made. Part of the reason we present individual data points also has to do with convention and how locomotor control data/results are traditionally displayed. Finally, the averages for these kinds of data/results tend to hide aspects of the pattern of change (with speed, for example) which are easy to appreciate when presented as we have in Figure 3. We hope this explanation is sufficient. We would, if asked, be happy to present these data as averages in a table, if that would help.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5: the figure and text need more clarification. The authors should indicate in the different panels the parts of the white matter that have been spared and the location of the descending projections. It is not clear how the authors come to the conclusion that the LDPN axons have been spared while only 26% of white matter was spared.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the too-definitive statements. We did not intend to support the idea that the LDPNs are spared en mass. We have edited a number of statements throughout the paper to indicate that some proportion are spared because they reside in the most lateral parts of the lateral and ventrolateral white matter. We have also added asterix to two of the images in figure 5 to illustrate the locations of spared lateral and ventrolateral white matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 6: The authors state that GFP is expressed in cell bodies of neurons in the cervical spinal cord. However, the staining looks more like terminals contacting the stained cell bodies rather than the expression of GFP. Quantifications are necessary here to support the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusing wording. The legend for figure 6 has been edited as requested. In G and H, the staining is thought to be intracellular compartments positive for eGFP. As explained earlier, quantification of the eTeNT.GFP is not feasible due to inconsistency. This has been described previously by Isa and colleagues who developed the two-virus silencing system and is why we are pursuing separate virus-based tracing strategies (e.g. Brown et al., 2022). We hope this is acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>4) In the discussion, the authors state that the study by Ruder et al. (2016) used developmental ablation of subsets of LDPNs. Ruder et al. used viral infections to express DTR in descending propriospinal neurons in adult mice. The difference in the outcome of this study compared to that of Ruder et al. cannot be explained by circuit reorganization during development. In the present study, there is no information on the extent of silencing and which neuronal populations are affected. This part of the discussion does not reflect the existing data and does not explain the difference in the outcome between this study and Ruder et al. (2016).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this serious error. The study by Ruder et al. does have the limitation of using ablation, which is not reversible and which may trigger a plastic response to the cell death. Nonetheless, we misrepresented the paper and this has been corrected. We agree that we do not know the extent of silencing, but I contend we do know which neuronal populations are silenced, they are those defined anatomically by cell bodies at C6 and terminals at L2. The paragraph in question has been carefully edited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Overall, it is not clear how silencing of DLPNs restores some parameters after spinal cord injury and how relevant this approach would be clinically.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and did not intend that silencing could in any way be used clinically. However, we do believe that our surprising results are relevant for therapeutic development, in particular with respect to neuromodulation (epidural stimulation) that may actively target circuitry that bridges the area of an incomplete injury.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. Please carefully check and revise the text discussing how your findings relate and compare to those reported by Ruder (2016). In particular, please note that in the Ruder paper, some experiments looking at neural circuits were conducted based upon tamoxifen-induced Cre-mediated recombination at E10.5 (Figure 1) but it appears to us that experiments examining functional outcomes were after manipulating gene expression by injecting viral constructs after birth. Thus, when discussing how ablating subsets of LDPNs please be sure you are referencing and discussing the correct experimental system.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Clearly, we confused the Ruder et al., 2016 paper with other work that focused on developmental ablations. We have edited the paragraph in question to much more clearly discuss the similarities and differences between our work and the work from the Arber lab. We also made a minor edit to the following paragraph to include a reference to the Ruder et al., 2016 paper which adds strength to the discussion. The two paragraphs now read as follows:</p><p>âRuder et al. (2016) reported that in the adult mouse, ablation of LDPNs using intersectional approaches reduced the speed and duration of spontaneous locomotor bouts, and disrupted interlimb coordination during high-speed locomotion on a treadmill. In contrast, our data indicate that, despite the disrupted alternation of the two limb pairs, rats are still able to achieve fairly high rates of speed and that locomotor bouts are sustained and unperturbed when LDPNs are silenced in otherwise intact adults. These discrepancies may arise from several differences between the two studies. First, the specific neurons targeted by Ruder et al. may have included LDPNs from multiple cervical segments whereas we chose to focus specifically on LDPNs with cell bodies at C6. Second, ablation of neurons using the genetic approach (with diptheria toxin) is permanent and may lead to unrecognized circuit reorganization in the adult.</p><p>The LDPN population targeted in the current study may be comprised of different sub-populations of long spinal projection neurons that have been previously defined genetically in mice. Notably, V0v and V2a, but not V0d, neurons residing in the lumbar enlargement have been implicated in securing left-right limb alternation at high speeds (Bellardita and Kiehn 2015; Crone et al. 2009; Talpalar et al. 2013; Ruder et al., 2016). V0v are composed of commissurally-projecting inhibitory interneurons and are recruited to maintain left-right alternation as the speed of movement increases (Lanuza et al. 2004; Crone et al. 2009). The V2a population of neurons are also classified as ipsilateral excitatory glutamatergic interneurons that are involved in left-right alternation (Crone et al. 2008; 2009) with minimal involvement in rhythm generation. It is likely that the silenced LDPN population includes some proportion of each of these defined interneurons, given the perturbations to left-right alternation during silencing. However, it is important to note that LDPNs have characteristics that fall in line with both progenitor domains, as they are both ipsilaterally and commissurally-projecting and co-localize with both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Therefore, it is difficult to place these anatomically-defined neurons within the previously described context of genetically-defined V-neuron classes.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
