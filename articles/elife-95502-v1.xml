However, how phyllosphere and rhizosphere soil microbes distinctively affect seedling mortality and growth of invaders across ontogeny under varying soil nutrient levels remains unclear. In this study, we used the invader <italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic> to evaluate these effects. We found that higher proportions of potential pathogens were detected in core microbial taxa in leaf litter than rhizosphere soil and thus leaf inoculation had more adverse effects on seed germination and seedling survival than soil inoculation. Microbial inoculation at different growth stages altered the microbial community and functions of seedlings, and earlier inoculation had a more adverse effect on seedling survival and growth. The soil nutrient level did not affect microbe-mediated seedling growth and the relative abundance of the microbial community and functions involved in seedling growth. The effects of some microbial genera on seedling survival are distinct from those on growth. Moreover, the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling-killing effects of fungal strains isolated from dead seedlings by non-sterile leaf inoculation exhibited significant phylogenetic signals, by which strains of <italic>Allophoma</italic> and <italic>Alternaria</italic> generally caused high seedling mortality. Our study stresses the essential role of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> litter microbes in population establishment by regulating seedling density and growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plant-microbiome interaction</kwd><kwd>plant-soil feedbacks</kwd><kwd>plant-phyllosphere feedbacks</kwd><kwd>population establishment</kwd><kwd>plant invasion</kwd><kwd>seedling mortality</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100018531</institution-id><institution>Major Science and Technology Projects in Yunnan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202301AS070023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Han-Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFF1302402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Han-Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFC2601100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Han-Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An inoculation experiment shows phyllosphere microbiome plays an important role in invader <italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic> population establishment by killing seedlings at very early growth stage.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant-modified soil properties affect the performance of plants, which are termed âplant-soil feedbacks (PSFs)â.

However, related research has focused mainly on physical (e.g. maintaining soil moisture and temperature, increasing nutrition and reducing light) or chemical effects (e.g. releasing allelochemicals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Demey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jessen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MÃ¶hler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) but has rarely focused on leaf microbial effects. Until 2017, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Whitaker et al., 2017</xref>, extended the PSF to aboveground tissues (including leaf, stem, and ï¬oral tissues), termed âplant-phyllosphere feedbacks (PPFs)â, and found that all four Asteraceae species experienced stronger negative PPFs than PSFs. Subsequently, this team further verified that all 10 tested Asteraceae plants experienced negative PPFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zaret et al., 2021</xref>). The lack of strong mutualists and relatively high abundance of pathogens in the phyllosphere may account for the negative PPFs.</p><p>In addition to microbial sources (i.e. soil vs leaf litter), ontogeny (seedling growth stage) and soil nutrient levels can affect plant-microbe interactions. For example, seedlings showed distinct sensitivity during the growth stage, and younger seedlings were more susceptible to infection by soil microbes because of fewer defense resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, leaf litter has an adverse effect on seedling emergence but a positive effect on later plant growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MÃ¶hler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>); litter also has a stronger negative effect on earlier vegetation growth than on the elder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Loydi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiong and Nilsson, 1999</xref>). Moreover, plants enrich distinct microbes under different nutrient conditions and affect plant performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DostÃ¡l, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gustafson and Casper, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Widdig et al., 2020</xref>). For example, the bacterial diversity in duckweed plants was reduced under nutrient-deficient conditions, but the abundance of Firmicutes increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunyoo et al., 2022</xref>), and members of Firmicutes have been reported to promote plant stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai et al., 2018</xref>, reported that nutrient additions cause crops to enrich some bacteria and fungi from soil and increase yield.</p><p><italic>Ageratina adenophora</italic> (Sprengel) RM King and H Robinson (Asteraceae), known as Crofton weed or Mexican devil weed, has invaded more than 30 countries and areas, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, India, and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Changjun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Julien and Griffiths, 1998</xref>). It is a perennial weed and can produce high yields of seeds with a high germination rate (GR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parsons, 1992</xref>). This weed commonly grows in monocultures, but a high density of seedlings is not common in the wild. Previous studies have shown that <italic>A. adenophora</italic> can enrich the beneficial soil microbial community to facilitate invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Niu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>); in contrast, <italic>A. adenophora</italic> leaves harbor diverse fungal pathogens that can cause adverse effects on itself seed germination and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fang et al., 2021a</xref>). Thus, it is interesting to determine whether leaf microbes play a distinct role from soil microbes in regulating <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling density and whether these effects change with the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth stage and soil nutrition level.</p><p>In this study, we inoculated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> with soil or leaf litter at three stages, 0 day, 21 days, and 28 days after sowing, and transplanted seedlings to grow in soils with high or low nutritional levels. We first determined the germination, seedling survival, and growth of the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> plants. Then, we characterized the bacterial and fungal communities of the soils and leaf litter as inoculation sources, as well as the microbial communities enriched in the leaves and roots of the <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings after growing; we also isolated the fungi associated with the dead seedlings and tested their seedling-killing effects on <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. Finally, we correlated the microbial community with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling mortality and growth.</p><p>We hypothesized that the microbial communities associated with leaf litter and rhizosphere soils can account for the differential effects on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling mortality and growth during different growth stages when growing under different nutrient conditions. We expected that (1) leaf litter would have more adverse effects on seed germination, seedling survival, and growth than soil, as leaf litter often harbors more plant pathogens, and (2) inoculation at different growth stages would change the microbial community enriched by seedlings and thus affect seedling growth. Earlier inoculation had a greater adverse impact on seedling growth than later inoculation, as younger seedlings were more sensitive to pathogen infection than older seedlings. (3) The nutrient level influences seedlings to recruit microbes and thus affects seedling growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of leaf litter and rhizosphere soil on the mortality and growth of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings</title><p>At the G0 timepoint, sterile leaf inoculation significantly delayed germination time more than did soil and non-sterile leaf inoculation, as well as the control (nothing inoculated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, p&lt;0.05).

Our study did not directly test the allelopathic effects of leaf litter. However, leaf litter possibly produces allelochemicals that adversely impact <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seed GT and seedling survival. We observed that sterile leaf litter inoculation caused longer GTs than sterile soil and the control (nothing inoculated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Interestingly, sterile leaf litter inoculation also caused longer GTs than non-sterile leaf litter inoculation, suggesting that some pathways through which leaf microbes alleviate the adverse effects of leaf allelopathy on GTs are unknown. Moreover, sterile leaf inoculation at G0 caused a 19.7% MR for seedlings growing in Petri dishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), but no dead seedlings were observed when the plants were not inoculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, our study highlighted the adverse microbial role of leaf litter in seedling mortality because non-sterile leaves have significantly greater seedling mortality (96.7%) than sterile leaves (19.7%) when inoculated at G0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Indeed, we found that leaf litter harbored more abundant bacterial and fungal genera positively related to seedling mortality, as well as a greater proportion of plant pathogens, than soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The results implied that the litter harbored many plant pathogens and thus played an essential role in mediating <italic>A. adenophora</italic> population density by killing conspecific seedlings. These findings provide novel insights for understanding plant invasion. Invasive plants are commonly characterized by rapid growth and a high yield of seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parsons, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>). These traits are beneficial for rapid population establishment and range expansion at newly invaded sites. However, these invasive plant species commonly form high-density monocultures once the population is established, e.g., <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. For those perennial invasive species, e.g., <italic>A. adenophora</italic>, self-limiting of the population elicited by leaf microbes may alleviate intraspecific competition thus in turn help to maintain monocultures at old established sites. Thus, it is highly interesting to determine whether leaf microbe-mediated self-limitation at an early life stage is common and important in other invasive systems.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Peripheral microbial sources had more adverse effects on seedling survival and growth when inoculating at the early growth stage than at the later stage</title><p>Consistent with our second expectation, inoculation time significantly affected seedling survival and growth; in particular, seedling mortality was greater and seedling growth was poorer when inoculated at G0 than at later growth stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c, d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2b</xref>). The plant growth stage could change the impact of plant host-associated microbes, and such an impact is always strongest in early plant growth stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>). One potential reason is that small seedlings usually allocate most of their resources to survive and grow, while older seedlings have relatively more resources to defend against pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schloter and Matyssek, 2009</xref>). For example, smaller seedlings were more sensitive to inoculated individual fungi, soil microbiota, or litter addition than older seedlings due to fewer defense resources and little chance of recovering from biomass loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Another possible reason is related to the interaction between seed-borne microbes and peripheral microbial sources in young seedlings. There is evidence that seed-borne endophytes are likely to be beneficial for seedling growth and stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DÃ­az Herrera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang and Zhang, 2023</xref>). These seed endophytes might be inhibited or even excluded from young seedlings by external sources of microbes inoculated at G0, when seedlings are highly sensitive to inoculated microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geisen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jevon et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, determining how peripheral microbial sources interact with seed-borne endophytes in seedlings across ontogeny is highly valuable.</p><p>We did not observe an adverse effect of leaf litter microbes on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth, as observed previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fang et al., 2019b</xref>, who inoculated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> at G0 (sowing seeds), because all seedlings inoculated with leaf litter at G0 died after transplantation into soils in this study. In contrast, both the microbial community and function were significantly positively correlated with seedling growth and had a greater relative abundance in seedlings inoculated with leaf litter than in those inoculated with soil, while those with a negative correlation showed the opposite trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This finding suggested that leaf litter microbes might have a more positive effect on <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth than soil microbes if inoculated during the latter growth stage, such as at G21 and G21+28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Interestingly, we found that N circle-related bacterial functions in seedling roots were positively correlated with seedling growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>, showed that <italic>A. adenophora</italic> invasion increased N circle-related bacterial functional genes in soil and subsequently directly promoted plant growth and invasion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fang et al., 2019b</xref>, also reported that several root endophytic nitrogen-ï¬xing bacteria of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> could significantly promote its growth. Interestingly, the abundance of these N circle-related bacterial functions was greater in seedling roots inoculated with leaf litter than in those inoculated with soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), which suggests a possible way in which some N circle-related bacteria associated with leaf litter may migrate from leaves into roots after leaf litter inoculation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Nutrient levels did not affect seedling mortality and microbe-mediated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth</title><p>Nutrient addition can promote severe invasion, as invasive plants often have greater nutrient availability than do native plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Slate et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is unclear whether such an advantage is involved in a change in the microbial community-driven host growth effect. We also found that <italic>A. adenophora</italic> grew larger and more rapidly in the high nutrient treatment than in the low nutrient treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>); moreover, the nutrient level significantly changed the microbial community and bacterial function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Nonetheless, in contrast to our third expectation, seedling mortality was not affected by different nutrient levels, and nutrient levels negligently affected overall microbe-mediated <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth and the relative abundance of microbes and functions correlated with seedling growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai et al., 2018</xref>, reported that nutrient additions cause crops to enrich some bacteria and fungi from soil and increase yield; however, there is no evidence that the increased yield effect is due to enriched microbial communities in this study. Our data indicated that the invasion advantage driven by high nutrient availability may be driven primarily by plant physiological traits, such as rapid nutrient absorption and growth strategies, rather than by enriched microbes. Alternatively, it is possible that our delayed harvest of seedlings under low nutrient levels may cover the distinct microbial role in seedling growth between the two nutrient levels (see Materials and methods).</p><p>However, there was an interaction effect between nutrient level and inoculation time on seedling growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

The remaining figures were visualized in GraphPad Prism v7.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Fertilizer content in the Pindstrup substrate.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-95502-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-95502-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The raw bacterial and fungal sequence data are archived in GenBank under accession numbers PRJNA1008375 and PRJNA1008403, respectively.

However, we actually also recorded seed germination time (GT) and rate (GR), as well as the seedling mortality rate (MR) for those treatments inoculated soil and leaf after sowing 28 days (G28 inoculation). It is allowed us to observe possible allelopathic effect by comparing sterile sample with control (nothing inoculated during the first 28 days). In this version, we added the result of GT, GR and MR for nothing inoculated (treated as control) in Figure 1, and described results as: âWhen inoculated at G0 period, the sterile leaf inoculation significantly delayed germination time more than soil and sterile leaves inoculation and control (nothing inoculated) (Fig. 1a, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05)â (see Line102-104). We have also discussed this point in the resubmitted version as: âOur study did not directly test the allelopathic effects of leaf litter. However, leaf litter possibly produces allelochemicals that adversely impact <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seed germination time and seedling survival. We observed that sterile leaf litter inoculation caused longer GTs than sterile soil and the control (nothing inoculated) (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, sterile leaf litter inoculation also caused longer GTs than nonsterile leaf litter inoculation, suggesting that some pathways through which leaf microbes alleviate the adverse effects of leaf allelopathy on GTs are unknown. Moreover, sterile leaf inoculation at G0 caused a 19.7% mortality rate for seedlings growing in petri dishes (Fig. 1c), but no dead seedlings were observed when the plants were not inoculated (Fig. 1a, S1).</p><p>Nonetheless, our study highlighted the adverse microbial role of leaf litter in seedling mortality because nonsterile leaves have significantly greater seedling mortality (96.7%) than sterile leaves (19.7%) (Fig. 1c)â in Line 289-301.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors did not compare the fungal strains accumulated in dead seedlings to those accumulated in live seedlings to prove that the live seedlings indeed accumulated lower abundances of the strains that were identified to increase seedling mortality.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your concerns. We have not isolated fungi from healthy seedlings to make a comparative study. However, our team work previously found that the seedling-killing <italic>Allophoma</italic> strains obtained in this study had the same ITS genes as the leaf endophyte and leaf spot pathogen <italic>Allophoma</italic> associated with mature <italic>A. adenophora</italic> individual; some seedling-killing <italic>Alternaria</italic> also occur in healthy seedlings inoculated by leaf litter. We thus assumed that these seedling-killing fungi, e.g., <italic>Allophoma</italic> and <italic>Alternaria</italic>, likely exist in <italic>A. adenophora</italic> mature individual by a lifestyle switch from endophytic to pathogenic, and these fungi can kill seedling only at very early life stage of <italic>A. adenophora</italic>.</p><p>Thus, we discussed this point as: âIn particular, the numerically dominant <italic>Allophoma</italic> strains obtained in this study had the same ITS genes as the leaf endophyte and leaf spot pathogen <italic>Allophoma</italic> associated with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> (Chen et al., 2022; Kai Fang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023). Interestingly, a previous report revealed that the dominant genera in healthy seedlings inoculated with leaf litter were <italic>Didymella</italic> and <italic>Alternaria</italic> (Kai Fang et al., 2019). We did not isolate fungi from healthy seedlings to determine whether the live seedlings indeed lacked or accumulated a lower abundance of the seedling-killing strains than did the dead seedlings in this study. We could assume that these fungal genera likely exist in <italic>A. adenophora</italic> mature individual experiencing a lifestyle switch from endophytic to pathogenic and play an essential role in limiting the population density of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> monocultures by killing seedlings only at very early stages. Thus, it is worth exploring the dynamic abundance of these strains and host resistance variation during <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling development.â in Line 432-</p><p>1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The data of seed germination and seedling mortality could have been analyzed in the same manner as that of seedling growth, which makes the whole result section more coherent. I don't understand why the authors had not calculated the response index (RI) for germination/mortality rate and conducted analyses on the correlation between these RIs with microbial compositions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks so much. Response index (RI) was calculated as:</p><p>(variablenonsterileâvariablesterile)/variablesterile. Because mortality rates of some sterile groups were zero values, it is impossible to calculate their RIs. Relatively, only leaf microbes affect seed germination time (GT), leaf and soil microbes did not affect germination rate (GR) (see Fig. 1a,b). Therefore, we preferred to make a direct comparison of the difference between nonsterile and sterile treatments (also see Figure 1d) to assess microbial effect, and we also conducted a correlation by these values with microbial compositions rather than by RIs (see Fig. 3). We emphasized this point in the Materials and Methods in our resubmitted revision as: âBecause the mortality rates of some sterile groups were zero and their RIs were impossible to calculate, we had to directly compare the seedling mortality caused by nonsterile with by sterile samples and perform the analysis of correlation between the mortality rate and microbial composition.â in Line 565-568.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The language of the manuscript could be improved to increase clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved language in the resubmitted version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study provides strong evidence that leaf microbes mediate self-limitation at an early life stage.

Overall, the paper is wellstructured, providing clear and comprehensive information.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In addition to the assessments from the reviewers, we have the following comments on your paper:</p><p>(1) The experimental design is complicated with regard to the multiple interacting treatments. The statistical analyses show that the interaction terms are important and significant. In this case, it could be more informative to show the detailed results at the sub-level than at the main level in the main text. For example, the main effects of inoculation sources and nutrients shown in Figure 2 are difficult to interpret, because the effects of inoculation sources and nutrients have important dependencies with each other and other factors such as inoculation time as shown in Figure S3. Therefore, Figure S3 is more informative than Figure 2. Please also be cautious that it would be necessary to clarify this context dependence when showing and citing results of the main effect to avoid any possible misunderstanding, such as the case of Figure 2 and S3.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We have deleted Figure 2 and placed Figure S3 in the text as Figure 2. And corresponding results have rewritten as âleaf inoculation caused significantly greater seedling mortality than did soil inoculation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); the nonsterile sample caused greater seedling mortality than did the sterile sample, especially leaf inoculation during the G0 and G21 periods. Moreover, nonsterile leaf inoculation at earlier stages significantly increased seedling mortality compared with that at later stages (Fig. 1d, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, seedling mortality did not differ between the high- and low-nutrient conditions, regardless of leaf or soil inoculation (Fig. 1d, both <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).â in Line 109-115.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Response index (RI) is already a measure of microbial feedback effect, so that feedback may not be necessary as an explanatory variable in the model with RI as the response variable.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry that our writing misunderstood you. Here the word âfeedbackâ (e.g., foliage- or soil feedback) does not represent microbial feedback effect, it means leaf or soil inoculation. We have replaced âfeedbackâ by âinoculation sourceâ in the figures and text for better understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Mortality rate is a ratio. It is unclear whether assuming a Gaussian error distribution is fine in your case. It would be important to check the residual distribution and to see whether data transformation (e.g., log) or using other error assumptions (e.g., binomial) is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. As you say, it is not appropriate to use generalized linear models (GLMs) with Gaussian error distributions (identity link) to evaluate seedling mortality, because mortality rate is a ratio, which do not meet normality. Thus, we deleted the result of GLM of seedling mortality and directly compared seedling mortality between different microbial treatments, inoculation time, nutrition level and inoculation source by MannâWhitney U test and KruskalâWallis test (see Fig.1 d). All corresponding results have also been rewritten as âleaf inoculation caused significantly greater seedling mortality than did soil inoculation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); the nonsterile sample caused greater seedling mortality than did the sterile sample, especially leaf inoculation during the G0 and G21 periods. Moreover, nonsterile leaf inoculation at earlier stages significantly increased seedling mortality compared with that at later stages (Fig. 1d, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, seedling mortality did not differ between the high- and low-nutrient conditions, regardless of leaf or soil inoculation (Fig. 1d, both <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).â in Line 109-115.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Please be consistent about the wording of different treatment names throughout the texts, tables, and figures. For example, &quot;feedback&quot; should only be used for microbial treatment, but not for inoculation source treatment (e.g., Figure 2). We can say there is an effect of microbial feedback only if we compare sterile vs. non-sterile groups, otherwise, there could be other effects, for example, the allelopathic effect pointed out by Reviewer #1. When writing inoculation, please be specific about whether it is for inoculation time or inoculation source (e.g., within multiple statistical tables in the appendix).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your good suggestion.

All subtitles in the Result section have similar issues (i.e. Lines 148-150, 207-209).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we subdivided our Results into four sections and we changed these subtitles as:â Effects of leaf litter and rhizosphere soil on the mortality and growth of <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlingsâ, âCorrelations of microbial community composition and potential function with seedling mortality at the early stageâ, âEnrichment of microbial community and function by <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedlings under different treatmentsâ, and âCorrelations of the enriched microbial community and function with <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seedling growthâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 148-206: since there are a lot of results concerning the microbial composition, I suggest focusing on those that could directly explain the positive or negative feedback. The one concerning diversity (e.g. Figure 3 and corresponding texts) does not seem necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We have moved figure 3 into the supplementary figures as Figure S2. To focus on core microbes that could directly explain the positive or negative feedback, we reordered Figure 3, where firstly showed the core soil and leaf bacteria, bacterial functions, as well as core soil and leaf fungi, fungal function (Fig3 a-h); and then showed the correlations of top 30 bacterial and fungal genera from soil and leaf with seedling mortality rate (Fig3 i-j).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 180: is it not common sense that ectomycorrhiza can only be found in soil?</p></disp-quote><p>Yeah, it is. We have deleted this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 199: &quot;the seedling mortality of these strains&quot;? not clear what this means,</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed âThe seedling mortality of these strainsâ into âThe seedling-killing of these strains on <italic>A. adenophora</italic>â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 291-292: I don't see how the authors can distinguish between allelopathic and pathogenic effects based on their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not directly test the allelopathic effects. However, we actually also recorded seed germination time (GT) and rate (GR), as well as the seedling mortality rate (MR) for those treatments inoculated soil and leaf after sowing 28 days (G28 inoculation). It is allowed us to observe possible allelopathic effect by comparing sterile sample with control (nothing inoculated during the first 28 days). In this version, we added the result of GT, GR and MR for nothing inoculated (treated as control) in Figure 1, and described results as: âWhen inoculated at G0 period, the sterile leaf inoculation significantly delayed germination time more than soil and sterile leaves inoculation and control (nothing inoculated) (Fig. 1a, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05)â (see Line102-104). We have also discussed this point in the resubmitted version as: âOur study did not directly test the allelopathic effects of leaf litter. However, leaf litter possibly produces allelochemicals that adversely impact <italic>A. adenophora</italic> seed germination time and seedling survival. We observed that sterile leaf litter inoculation caused longer GTs than sterile soil and the control (nothing inoculated) (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, sterile leaf litter inoculation also caused longer GTs than nonsterile leaf litter inoculation, suggesting that some pathways through which leaf microbes alleviate the adverse effects of leaf allelopathy on GTs are unknown. Moreover, sterile leaf inoculation at G0 caused a 19.7% mortality rate for seedlings growing in petri dishes (Fig. 1c), but no dead seedlings were observed when the plants were not inoculated (Fig. 1a, S1).</p><p>Nonetheless, our study highlighted the adverse microbial role of leaf litter in seedling mortality because nonsterile leaves have significantly greater seedling mortality (96.7%) than sterile leaves (19.7%) (Fig. 1c)â in Line 289-301.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 383-414: Correlations are not necessarily causations. Sometimes a strong correlation may result from higher-order interaction. The authors should be more cautious about the discussion of microbial function in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We deleted all descriptions of adverse effect or beneficial effect on host plant <italic>A. adenophora</italic> growth and cautiously used ânegative correlation or positive correlationâ to discuss the functions of these enriched microbes by <italic>A. adenophora</italic>. In the last, we also added a sentence to say: âIt is necessary to isolate these enriched microbes to test the interactions with the early life stage of <italic>A. adeonophora</italic>.â</p><p>(see Line 411-413).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 489-490: I don't really understand why the authors performed a combination treatment. What did they expect from such a combination?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We described our consideration as: âLeaf inoculation at G28 was performed to simulate natural microbial spread from the leaf litter to the above part of the seedlings by suspending the leaf bag over the transplanted seedlings without direct contact all the time (see Zaret et al. (2021)). This method may result in only microbial species with easy air transmission to infect seedlings. Thus, an additional combination inoculation (named G21+28) was performed on both the 21st (with seedling contact) and 28th days (without seedling contact) to ensure that most leaf microbes had the opportunity to reach the seedlings.â see Line 498-505.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: why not use &quot;mortality rate&quot; instead of &quot;death rate&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We have changed âdeath rateâ into âmortality rateâ in all corresponding figures and text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8: This is a very complicated experimental setup. Why did the authors harvest the plants treated with nutrient addition after the 12th day of the experiment and harvest those without nutrient addition after the 16th day? Why the time lag?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We explained this as: âSeedlings were harvested after 8 weeks of growth under high-nutrient conditions because they grew too fast and touched the PTFE cover; however, we harvested those plants grown under low-nutritional conditions after another 4 weeks of growth due to their very small size (see Fig. S6).â</p><p>(see Method in Line 514-517).</p></body></sub-article></article>
