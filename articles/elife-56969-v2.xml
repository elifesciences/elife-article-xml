In order to link systemic metabolic status to appropriate physiological responses, information on local metabolic events within each of these organs must be integrated. Inter-organ communication factors play an important role in mediating this process of systemic metabolic integration. For instance, classical metabolic hormones such as insulin and glucagon released from the pancreas, as well as leptin released from the adipose tissue, can act on multiple peripheral and central nervous system targets. While insulin and glucagon define anabolic and catabolic states of an animal, leptin limits food intake in response to adequate energy stores in the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahima et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moore and Cooper, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schade et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tartaglia et al., 1995</xref>). In addition to these classical hormones, a number of peptides have been identified that can mediate inter-organ communication axes. For example, adiponectin, adipisin, and asprosin are molecules that are released from the adipose tissue that signal to distant tissues such as muscle/liver and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Romere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yamauchi et al., 2014</xref>). IGF1, angiotensin, and IGFBPs are released from the liver and signal to multiple distant organs including adipose tissue, muscle, and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clemmons, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Droujinine and Perrimon, 2016</xref>). The role of the skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ has gained special interest lately, primarily due to the beneficial effects of having healthy active muscles toward ameliorating or preventing the pathophysiology of a number of disorders and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benatti and Pedersen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boström et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">So et al., 2014</xref>). A number of skeletal muscle-derived signaling factors (‘myokines’), including Irisin, Myostatin, IL6, Myonectin, and FGF21, have recently been characterized and they signal both locally, and to distant tissues, to control processes as diverse as muscle growth and browning of fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boström et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher and Maratos-Flier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McPherron, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seldin et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, conservative estimates, based on bioinformatic analysis of the skeletal muscle transcriptome and proteomics studies, indicate that skeletal muscles are capable of secreting more than 200 myokines and the vast majority of these proteins are yet to be characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012</xref>). The vertebrate PDGF/VEGF signaling ligands are also secreted from the skeletal muscles; however, the biological roles of muscle-derived PDGF/VEGF ligands remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catoire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henningsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raschke et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The PDGF/VEGF family of signaling ligands have co-evolved with multicellularity and are proposed to signal in the context of organisms with tissue-level organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holmes and Zachary, 2005</xref>). VEGF family ligands, including VEGF-A and VEGF-B, influence metabolic responses such as adiposity, insulin resistance and browning of fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robciuc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). However, mechanisms by which these molecules regulate lipid metabolism are complex and multiple context dependent and confounding models of their action have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robciuc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, in all these studies the effect of VEGFs on obesity and insulin resistance have been attributed to their roles in modulating tissue micro-vascularization and endothelial cell biology. Similarly, PDGF signaling ligands PDGF-BB and -CC have also been implicated in adipose tissue expansion, glucose metabolism, and thermogenesis in beige fat, by influencing remodeling of tissue vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Onogi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seki et al., 2016</xref>). VEGFs and PDGFs are well-known regulators of vascularization and endothelial cell biology, and tissue vascularization definitely plays an important role in adipose tissue health, inflammation, and ultimately insulin resistance. Nevertheless, signaling to non-endothelial cell types by PDGF/VEGF ligands could play equally important roles in regulating obesity and insulin resistance.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the PDGF/VEGF pathway ligands are encoded by three genes, <italic>pvf1</italic>, <italic>pvf2,</italic> and <italic>pvf3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duchek et al., 2001</xref>). Similar to vertebrate PDGFs/VEGFs, these molecules signal through a receptor-tyrosine Kkinase (RTK) encoded by <italic>pvr</italic>. Once bound to the receptor, Pvfs are known to primarily activate the Ras/Raf/ERK intracellular cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duchek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heino et al., 2001</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of the Pvfs show that Pvf1 is closely related to both VEGFs and PDGFs and most likely plays the dual role of representing both these divergent signaling pathways in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holmes and Zachary, 2005</xref>). Pvf2 and Pvf3 are more ancestral forms of the protein and are phylogenetically distinct with Pvf2 lacking the conserved cysteine necessary for forming the cysteine knot structure characteristic of this family of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holmes and Zachary, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kasap, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Core metabolic organs and signaling mechanisms that regulate metabolic homeostasis are also highly conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Droujinine and Perrimon, 2016</xref>). Metabolic organ systems that are functionally and structurally analogous to the vertebrate adipose tissue, muscle, intestine, and liver exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutierrez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leopold and Perrimon, 2007</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> adipose tissue (also called the fat body) functions as the primary site for lipid storage. The adipose tissue is also the key site for sensing the nutrient status of the animal and coupling it to systemic growth, metabolism, and feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grönke et al., 2007</xref>). The roles of the liver are shared between the adipose tissue and specialized hepatocyte-like cells called the oenocytes, with the adipose tissue being the primary site of glycogen storage and the oenocytes playing the roles of lipid mobilization and synthesis of specialized lipid molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutierrez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Storelli et al., 2019</xref>). However, much remains to be learned about the biological roles of the specialized organ systems in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and how they relate to organ systems in vertebrates.</p><p>A number of hormonal signals emanating from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adipose tissue, gut, and muscle have been characterized and shown to play roles as diverse as regulation of insulin and glucagon (AKH in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) release, nutrient uptake in the gut, and mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Droujinine and Perrimon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghosh and O'Connor, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Components of core metabolic pathways such as the TOR signaling pathway are also highly conserved in the fly and much has been learned about the fundamental principles of the regulation of TOR and its roles in growth and aging from studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antikainen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Piper and Partridge, 2018</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pvfs have been primarily studied in the context of their roles in embryonic development, cell motility, and specification of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duchek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ishimaru et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rosin et al., 2004</xref>). However, the role of these signaling peptides in metabolism remains less explored.</p><p>Here, we identify the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PDGF/VEGF ortholog, Pvf1, as a tubular muscle derived signaling factor (myokine) that regulates systemic lipid stores by inhibiting lipid synthesis. Additionally, by subjecting the metabolically active organ systems that reside in <italic>Drosophila</italic> abdomen (muscle, oenocytes, and adipose tissue) to single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq), we identify the adult oenocytes to be one of the primary targets of Pvf signaling. We provide further evidence that muscle-derived Pvf1 signals to the oenocytes where it activates the PvR/Pi3K/Akt1/TOR signaling pathway that in turn inhibits lipid synthesis in the organism. We also find that muscle-derived <italic>pvf1</italic> plays an important role in regulating the build up of adult adipose tissue lipid stores in newly eclosed flies. Flies eclose from their pupal case with limited adult adipose tissue lipid stores. Post eclosion they enter a developmental stage that is marked by increased lipid synthesis needed for accumulation of the adipose tissue lipid stores. <italic>pvf1</italic> expression in the muscle increases rapidly during this stage and premature expression of <italic>pvf1</italic> in the muscle interferes with the process of lipid accumulation. Taken together our study indicates that muscle-Pvf1 serves as an inhibitory signal for suppressing de-novo lipid synthesis once the adult adipose tissue has accumulated sufficient lipid stores at the end of the adipose tissue lipid build-up phase. Our snRNA-seq data of the adult abdominal region that includes adipose tissue, oenocytes, and abdominal muscles will also serve as an invaluable resource to further understand the biology of these organs. To facilitate visualization of this rich resource of gene expression profiles, we have created a searchable webtool where users can mine and explore the data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.flyrnai.org/scRNA/abdomen/">https://www.flyrnai.org/scRNA/abdomen/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Muscle-specific loss of Pvf1 leads to increased lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue and oenocytes</title><p>To investigate tissue-specific roles of Pvfs in regulating lipid homeostasis, we knocked down <italic>pvf1</italic>, <italic>pvf2,</italic> and <italic>pvf3</italic> in various metabolically active tissues in the adult male fly using temperature-inducible drivers and looked for effects on the adiposity of the fly. Strikingly, knockdown of <italic>pvf1</italic> in the adult muscle (<italic>mus<sup>ts</sup>&gt;pvf1-i</italic>), but not in other organs such as the gut, adipose tissue, or oenocytes, was associated with a severe obesity phenotype characterized by increased lipid droplet size in the adipose tissue cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We regularly retrieved ~ 30–40 males and an equal number of females from our crosses that were carried out in standard 10 cm food vials. We discarded vials that had an aberrantly low (≤60) or high number (≥80) of adults eclosing from them. The adult adipose tissue dissection, staining, and imaging protocol is quite laborious. This makes inclusion of a large number of controls in every experiment quite difficult. Therefore, we kept the number of control genotypes that were processed in parallel in a given experiment to a manageable number while processing additional control genotypes separately to determine the baseline for lipid droplet size in the adult adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>).

The use of GFP overexpression or knockdown of an unrelated gene such as vermillion is often used in the field as a genetic background control. These controls sometimes tend to manifest unpredictable phenotypes either due to toxicity from GFP or yet unknown function for the presumed to be unrelated gene while providing little to no benefit in terms of being ideal genetic background control. Hence, we did not use them in our study. Rather we relied on the fact that multiple experimental approaches in our study culminated to the same logical end to draw our conclusions.</p><p>To verify the presence and distribution of Pvf1 protein in adult muscles, we immunostained the indirect flight muscles (IFMs) and leg muscles using an anti-Pvf1 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duchek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rosin et al., 2004</xref>).

Similarly, in adult flies the oenocytes play a role in imparting starvation resistance by regulating production of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) for waterproofing of the cuticle, especially when flies are starved under lower humidity conditions, and possibly by regulating lipid mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Storelli et al., 2019</xref>).

The improved starvation resistance of <italic>mus<sup>ts</sup>&gt;pvf1-i</italic> and <italic>oeno<sup>ts</sup>&gt;pvr<sup>DN</sup></italic> flies most likely reflects the fact that these animals had higher levels of stored TAGs and hence were able to use these reserves for a longer duration.

We labeled the TAG stores of control and experimental flies with [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-Oleate for 3 days.

Additionally, understanding the tissue-specific roles of these molecules, while circumventing the critical role they play in regulating tissue vascularization, is equally challenging in vertebrate models. Here, we investigated the tissue-specific roles of the ancestral PDGF/VEGF-like factors and the single PDGF/VEGF-receptor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in lipid homeostasis. Our results demonstrate that in adult flies the PDGF/VEGF like factor, Pvf1, is a muscle-derived signaling molecule (myokine) that suppresses systemic lipid synthesis by signaling to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> hepatocyte-like cells/oenocytes.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval and adult adipose tissues have distinct developmental origins. The larval adipose tissue undergo drastic morphological changes during metamorphosis and dissociate into individual large spherical cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nelliot et al., 2006</xref>). These free-floating adipose cells persist to the young adult stage where they play a crucial role in protecting the animal from starvation and desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguila et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Storelli et al., 2019</xref>). These larval adipose tissue cells are ultimately removed via cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguila et al., 2007</xref>). Adult-specific adipose tissue cells develop during the pupal stage from yet unknown progenitor cells and have very little lipid stores in newly eclosed flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Over the period of next 3–5 days the adult adipose tissue builds up its lipid reserves through feeding and de-novo lipid synthesis. However, at the end of the lipid build-up phase, the rate of lipid synthesis must be suppressed to avoid over-loading of the adipose tissue and prevent lipid toxicity. Our data suggests that muscle Pvf1 signaling suppresses lipid synthesis at the end of the adult adipose tissue lipid build-up phase. Pvf1 production in the adult muscles peaks around the time when adult adipose tissue lipid stores reach steady state capacity. In turn, muscle-derived Pvf1 suppresses lipid synthesis and lipid incorporation by activating TOR signaling in the oenocytes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Pvf1 functions as a myokine that suppresses lipid synthesis</title><p>Our study reveals that Pvf1 is abundant in the tubular muscles of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> leg and abdomen. In these striated muscles, the protein localizes between individual myofibrils and is particularly enriched at the M and Z bands. <italic>Drosophila</italic> musculature can be broadly categorized into two groups, the fibrillar muscles and the tubular muscles, with distinct morphological and physiological characteristics. <italic>Drosophila</italic> IFMs of the thorax belong to the fibrillar muscle group and are stretch-activated, oxidative, slow twitch muscles that are similar to vertebrate cardiac muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schönbauer et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> leg muscles and abdominal muscles belong to the tubular muscle group. These muscles are striated, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated, and glycolytic in nature. The tubular muscles are structurally and functionally closer to vertebrate skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schnorrer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schönbauer et al., 2011</xref>). Expression of Pvf1 in the tubular muscles of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> leg may reflect a potentially conserved role of this molecule as a skeletal-muscle-derived myokine. The fact that most of the myokines in vertebrates were identified in striated skeletal muscles supports this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">So et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, vertebrate VEGF ligands, VEGF-A and VEGF-B, have also been shown to be stored and released from skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boström et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vind et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in vertebrates, the expression and release of VEGF ligands are regulated by muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boström et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vind et al., 2011</xref>). In mice, expression of VEGF-B in the skeletal muscles is regulated by PGC1-α, one of the key downstream effectors of muscle activity. Additionally, expression of VEGF-B is upregulated in both mouse and human skeletal muscles in response to muscle activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boström et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vind et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, expression of VEGF-A is induced by muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boström et al., 2012</xref>). We did not see any effect of muscle activity on the expression levels of <italic>pvf1</italic> in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles. We also could not demonstrate whether muscle activity regulates release of Pvf1 primarily due to the difficulty in collecting adequate amounts of hemolymph from the adult males. However, the localization of Pvf1 to the M/Z bands suggests a potential role for muscle activity in Pvf1 release. The M and Z bands of skeletal muscles are important centers for sensing muscle stress and strain. These protein-dense regions of the muscle house a number of proteins that can act as mechano-sensors and mediate signaling events including translocation of selected transcription factors to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoshijima, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lange et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). Pvf1, therefore, is ideally located to be able to sense muscle contraction and be released in response to muscle activity. Further work, contingent on the development of new tools and techniques, will be necessary to measure Pvf1 release into the hemolymph and study the regulation of this release by exercise.</p><p>We have previously shown that Pvf1 released from gut tumors generated by activation of the oncogene <italic>yorkie</italic> leads to wasting of <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Adipose tissue wasting in these animals is characterized by increased lipolysis and release of free fatty acids (FFAs) in circulation. However, we did not observe any role of Pvf signaling in regulating lipolysis in the adipose tissue of healthy well-fed flies without tumors. Loss of PvR signaling in the adipose tissue did not have any effect on lipid content. Additionally, over-expressing Pvf1 in the muscle did not lead to the bloating phenotype commonly seen in cachectic animals with gut tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Song et al., 2019</xref>). We conclude that Pvf1 affects wasting of the adipose tissue only in the context of gut tumors and that the effect could involve the following mechanisms: (1) the gut tumor releases pathologically high levels of Pvf1 into circulation leading to ectopic activation of PvR signaling in the adipose tissue, and, that such high levels of Pvf1 are not released by the muscle (even when <italic>pvf1</italic> is over-expressed in the muscle); (2) Pvf1 causes adipose tissue wasting in the context of other signals that emanate from the gut tumor that are not available in flies that do not have tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> oenocytes regulate lipid synthesis and lipid content of the adipose tissue</title><p>Only oenocyte-specific loss of PvR signaling phenocopies the obesity phenotype caused by muscle-specific loss of Pvf1, indicating that muscle-Pvf1 primarily signals to the oenocytes to regulate systemic lipid content. Additionally, muscle-specific loss of Pvf1, as well as oenocyte-specific loss of PvR and its downstream effector TOR, leads to an increase in the rate of lipid synthesis. These observations indicate a role for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oenocytes in lipid synthesis and lipid accumulation in the adipose tissue. Oenocytes have been implicated in lipid metabolism previously and these cells are known to express a diverse set of lipid metabolizing genes including but not limited to fatty acid synthases, fatty acid desaturases, fatty acid elongases, fatty acid β-oxydation enzymes and lipophorin receptors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makki et al., 2014</xref>). Functionally, the oenocytes are proposed to mediate a number of lipid metabolism processes. Oenocytes tend to accumulate lipids during starvation (presumably for the purpose of processing lipids for transport to other organs and generation of ketone bodies) and are necessary for starvation induced mobilization of lipids from the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutierrez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makki et al., 2014</xref>). This role is similar to the function of the liver in clearing FFAs from circulation during starvation for the purpose of ketone body generation, and redistribution of FFAs to other organs by converting them to TAG and packaging into very-low density lipoproteins. However, our [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-oleate chase assay did not show any effect of oenocyte-specific loss of PvR/TOR signaling on the rate of lipid utilization, indicating that this pathway does not affect oenocyte-dependent lipid mobilization.</p><p>Oenocytes also play a crucial role in the production of VLCFAs needed for waterproofing of the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Storelli et al., 2019</xref>). Results of our starvation resistance assay indicate that loss of the muscle-to-oenocyte Pvf1 signaling axis does not affect waterproofing of the adult cuticle. Storelli et al. have recently shown that the lethality observed in traditionally used starvation assays is largely caused by desiccation unless the assay is performed under saturated humidity conditions. Since our starvation assay was performed under 60% relative humidity (i.e. non-saturated levels), it is likely that desiccation played a partial role in causing starvation-induced lethality. Any defects in waterproofing of the adult cuticle would have led to reduced starvation resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nguyen et al., 2008</xref>). However, both muscle-specific loss of Pvf1 and oenocyte-specific loss of PvR led to increased starvation resistance suggesting normal waterproofing in these animals. The increased starvation resistance in these animals is likely the result of these animals having higher stored lipid content that helps them to survive longer without food.</p><p>Insect oenocytes were originally believed to be lipid synthesizing cells because they contain wax-like granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makki et al., 2014</xref>). These cells express a large number of lipid-synthesizing genes and the abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum further suggest a role for this organ in lipid synthesis and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jackson and Locke, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wigglesworth, 1988</xref>). However, evidence for potential involvement of the oenocytes in regulating lipid synthesis and lipid deposition in the adipose tissue has been lacking. The fact that two of the three fatty acid synthases (<italic>fasn2</italic> and <italic>fasn3</italic>) encoded by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome are expressed specifically in adult oenocytes suggests a potential role for these cells in lipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Our observation that oenocyte-specific loss of PvR and its downstream effector TOR leads to increased lipid synthesis and increased lipid content of the adipose tissue strongly supports this possibility. Our data further suggests that involvement of the oenocytes in mediating lipid synthesis is more pronounced in newly eclosed adults when the adipose tissue needs to actively build up its lipid stores. In later stages of life, the lipid synthetic role of the oenocytes is repressed by the muscle-to-oenocyte Pvf1 signaling axis. Our observation also raises the question of whether FFAs made in the oenocytes can be transported to the adipose tissue for storage. We tested this possibility by over-expressing the lipogenic genes <italic>fasn1</italic> and <italic>fasn3</italic>, which regulate the rate limiting steps of de-novo lipid synthesis, in the oenocytes. We found that excess lipids made in the oenocytes do end up in the adipose tissue of the animal leading to increased lipid droplet size in the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results provide evidence for the role of <italic>Drosophila</italic> oenocytes in lipid synthesis and storage of neutral lipids in the adipose tissue of the animal. Interestingly, the vertebrate liver is also one of the primary sites for de-novo lipid synthesis and lipids synthesized in the liver can be transported to the adipose tissue for the purpose of storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gibbons et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meex and Watt, 2017</xref>). Hence, the fundamental role of the oenocytes and the mammalian liver converge with respect to their involvement in lipid synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A unique role of oenocyte-specific TOR signaling in lipid synthesis</title><p>We observed that oenocyte-specific loss of the components of the Pi3K/Akt1/TOR signaling pathway leads to increased lipid synthesis. The increased rate of lipid synthesis in flies lacking TOR signaling in the oenocytes is paradoxical to our current knowledge of how TOR signaling affects expression of lipid synthesis genes. In both vertebrates and flies, TOR signaling is known to facilitate lipid synthesis by inducing the expression of key lipid synthesis genes such as <italic>acetyl CoA-carboxylase</italic> and <italic>fatty acid synthase</italic> via activation of SREBP-1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han and Wang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heier and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Porstmann et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore checked how oenocyte-specific loss of TOR signaling affects expression of oenocyte-specific fatty acid synthases (<italic>fasn2</italic> and <italic>fasn3</italic>) and oenocyte non-specific fatty acid synthesis genes (<italic>fasn1</italic> and <italic>acc</italic>). We observed that oenocyte-specific loss of TOR strongly down-regulates only <italic>fasn2</italic> and <italic>fasn3,</italic> while the expression of adipose tissue specific <italic>fasn1</italic> and <italic>acc</italic> did not change, indicating that TOR signaling is required for the expression of lipogenic genes in the oenocytes. An increase in lipid synthesis in response to loss of TOR in the oenocytes is quite intriguing and the mechanism remains to be addressed. We do not think the increase in lipid synthesis happens in the oenocytes since loss of TOR signaling rather reduces expression of lipogenic genes in the oenocytes. The increase in lipid synthesis could happen either as a result of compensatory upregulation of lipid synthesis in the adipose tissue or due to disruption of an as yet unknown role of the oenocytes in lipid synthesis that hinges on TOR signaling. The fact that the expression levels of <italic>fasn1</italic> and <italic>acc</italic> does not change significantly in animals lacking TOR signaling in the oenocytes indicates that compensatory upregulation of lipid synthesis, if present, does not happen through transcriptional upregulation of lipid synthesis genes in the adipose tissue. It is still possible, however, that the increase in lipid synthesis is caused by post-translational modifications of the enzymes. Alternatively, loss of TOR in the oenocyte could affect tissue distribution of lipids or impair clearing of dietary lipids via formation of cuticular hydrocarbons. Understanding the tissue specific alterations in gene expression and changes in the phosphorylation states of key lipogenic proteins in the adipose tissue of animals lacking TOR signaling in oenocytes could shed more light on the mechanisms involved.</p><p>Interestingly, our data suggests that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> InR does not play a role in activating TOR signaling in the oenocytes. While loss of TOR signaling in the oenocytes leads to obesity, loss of InR signaling does not. Additionally, loss of oenocyte specific InR signaling did not have any effect on p4EBP levels in oenocytes. Moreover, InR signaling and TOR signaling also diverge in their roles in regulating the size of oenocytes. While loss of InR signaling leads to a significant reduction in the size of oenocytes, loss of TOR does not. Further suggesting that TOR does not act downstream of InR in oenocytes. Rather, our data suggests that in wildtype well-fed flies TOR signaling in oenocytes is activated by the Pvf receptor. Interestingly, insulin dependent activation of TOR is not universal. For instance, in the specialized cells of non-obese mouse liver, InR does not play any role in activation of TOR and downstream activation of SREBP-1c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haas et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larval oenocytes are known to accumulate lipids in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutierrez et al., 2007</xref>). Chatterjee et al. also showed that starving adult females for 36 hr is capable of inducing lipid accumulation in the oenocytes and that this response is dependent of InR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>). Since TOR signaling is a known metabolic regulator, one alternate hypothesis that could explain some of our data is that loss of PvR/TOR signaling leads to a starvation like response specifically in the oenocyte leading to InR-dependent accumulation of lipid droplets. To address this possibility, we performed single nuclei sequencing of the adult male abdominal cuticle (and the tissues residing within) derived from <italic>oeno<sup>ts</sup>&gt;tsc1,tsc2</italic> flies. The animals were raised under identical experimental conditions as control animals reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We then re-analyzed the two snRNA-seq data sets after correcting for batch effects using harmony. The resulting UMAP plots for both genotypes look similar to our original UMAP plot for the control flies and identifies all the clusters reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). The percentage of nuclei that constitute each of our major clusters remained similar in both genotypes and the top marker genes for each of the clusters did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>). We subsequently converted the oenocyte-specific gene expression profiles from both data sets to pseudobulk expression for the genes that were detected. This allowed us to compare the expression profiles of the oenocytes from control animals and animals lacking TOR signaling in oenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). We specifically looked at the effect of losing TOR on the expression of the 47 genes that Chatterjee et al. had reported to be up-regulated in oenocytes in response to starvation. Thirty-six of these genes were detected by our single nuclei sequencing analysis, however, none of them changed significantly (we used a cutoff of 1.5-fold change) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Based on this observation, we conclude that loss of TOR signaling most likely does not mount a starvation like response in the oenocytes.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Differential snRNA-seq of the abdominal cuticle upon oenocyte-specific loss of TOR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Integrated Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plot of snRNA-seq data derived from the abdominal cuticle samples pertaining to oenocyte-specific overexpression of <italic>tuberous sclerosis complex 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> (<italic>tsc1</italic>, <italic>tsc2</italic>), which results in the blockade of TOR activity.

Indeed, we saw changes in oenocyte size when we disrupted some of these pathways. Since all our studies involved conditional knockdown or over-expression in post-developmental adult animals, the effect on size is most likely caused by changes in the size of individual oenocytes. Consistently, we find that genotypes that lead to smaller oenocytes tend to have more densely packed nuclei. We therefore used nuclei density as a readout to quantify the effect of losing PvR, TOR, Akt1, or InR signaling on oenocyte size. Loss of PvR signaling did not have any effect on oenocyte size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>) and loss of TOR signaling leads to a small but not significant increase in oenocyte size. Whereas loss of <italic>InR</italic> signaling or <italic>akt1</italic> leads to significant decrease in oenocyte size. However, we did not observe any clear correlation between oenocyte size and the obesity phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Thus, while oenocyte size could potentially affect lipid metabolism, at least in our study, the size of the oenocytes was not the driving force for the phenotypes observed.</p><p>Serum levels of VEGF-A is high in obese individuals and drops rapidly in response to bariatric surgery, suggesting a role for VEGF-A in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">García de la Torre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loebig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Silha et al., 2005</xref>). However, evidence on whether VEGF-A or other VEGFs are deleterious vs beneficial in the context of the pathophysiology of obesity is unclear. Adipose tissue-specific over-expression of both VEGF-B and VEGF-A has been shown to improve adipose tissue vascularization, reduce hypoxia, induce browning of fat, increase thermogenesis, and protect against obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robciuc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sung et al., 2013</xref>). At the same time, blocking VEGF-A signaling in the adipose tissue of genetically obese mice leads to reduction of body weight gain, improvement in insulin sensitivity, and a decrease in adipose tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, systemic inhibition of VEGF-A or VEGF-B signaling by injecting neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have also shown remarkable effects in improving insulin sensitivity in the muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver of high-fat diet-induced mouse models of obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hagberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Although the evidence on the roles of VEGF/PDGF signaling ligands in obesity and insulin resistance is well established, the mechanisms clearly are quite complex and are often context dependent. Consequently, a wider look at various tissue specific roles of PDGF/VEGF signaling will be necessary to comprehensively understand the roles of PDGF/VEGF signaling in lipid metabolism. Our work demonstrates an evolutionarily conserved role for PDGF/VEGF signaling in lipid metabolism and a non-endothelial cell dependent role of the signaling pathway in lipid synthesis. Additionally, our findings suggest an atypical tissue-specific role of TOR signaling in suppressing lipid synthesis at the level of the whole organism. Further studies will be required to determine whether vertebrate VEGF/PDGF and TOR signaling exerts similar roles either in the vertebrate liver or in other specialized organ.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A transcriptomic resource of adipose/oenocyte/muscle tissues</title><p>We made use of snRNA-Seq technology to identify expression of Pvr precisely in certain tissues in the complex abdominal region, which harbors several metabolically active tissues including adipose tissues, oenocytes, and muscle in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

The sucrose was thoroughly mixed and dissolved completely before pouring 3 ml of food in standard vials. For all experiments fly crosses were maintained at 18°C on SF. We ensured that the density of our experimental animals was kept optimum for proper growth and uniformity of growth conditions. To do so, all crosses consisted of 8 virgin females that were crossed to six males in standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> food vials. The crosses were allowed to sit in a vial for 6 days at 18°C and then the adults were discarded. We found that 6 days of egg laying at 18°C led to eclosion of 30–40 healthy adult males and an equal number of females. These animals were very comparable in size. We discarded animals that came from vials that yielded ≤ 60 adults or ≥ 80 adults. We regularly reared multiple crosses in parallel to obtain the final number of males that are necessary for a given experiment. Once adults eclosed, they were aged 3–5 days at 18°C and then shifted to 29°C for respective experimental regimes. For knockdown experiments, flies were maintained at 29°C for 7 days on SF and then shifted to HSD (29°C) for another 7 days before collection. For over-expression experiments, flies were maintained at 29°C for 3–4 days and then transferred to HSD (29°C) for 4–5 days before collection.</p><p>For all radioactivity feeding experiments, the radioactive compounds were added in the HSD and feeding was started from day 1 of transfer to HSD (29°C). For lipid mobilization assays, the flies were kept on [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-oleate containing HSD for 3 days and then transferred to cold SF for radioactive chase. For lipid incorporation assays, the flies were transferred to [U-<sup>14</sup>C]-Sucrose containing HSD and samples were collected every 24 hr. U-<sup>14</sup>C-Glucose feeding behavior assay was performed as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>). For all radio-isotope feeding experiments, we reared the flies on cold food for 7–8 hr between the time that the flies stopped feeding on hot food and the start of our experiment. This ensured that radiolabeled food from the gut is eliminated and that the signal measured comes only from the radioactivity that was incorporated in the cells of the animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Preparation of radioactive food</title><p>4 μCi of radioactive material was prepared in 15 μl Ethanol ([1-<sup>14</sup>C]-oleate) or water ([U-<sup>14</sup>C]-Sucrose) along with 5 μl of FIDC blue food dye (to visually confirm that the radioactive material is spread evenly on the food surface). HSD food was poured into empty vials without creating any bubbles to make sure to have an even surface when the food solidifies. The radioactive mixture was added on the surface of solidified HSD food dropwise using a pipette and making sure that it is evenly distributed. Importantly, the vials were then appended to a rotor that allowed slow rotation of the vials along the longitudinal axis to assist even spreading of the liquid as it dries overnight.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>BODIPY staining and imaging</title><p>The abdominal dorsal cuticle was dissected in relaxing buffer (1X PBS, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM EGTA) using micro-scissors with the adipose tissue attached to the cuticle as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajan et al., 2017</xref>). The samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in relaxing buffer for 20 min. Subsequently the samples were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% PBT (PBS + 0.1% TritonX100) in PBS for 30 min. PBT was removed by washing with PBS, three times, 5 min each, before adding BODIPY. For BODIPY staining, 500 μl of BODIPY in PBS (1/500 dilution of a 1 mg/ml stock in DMSO) was added to the samples and the samples were placed on a rotator for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then washed in PBS, two times, 10 min each, incubated in PBS with DAPI for 10 min, washed two more times in PBS, 10 min each, and then mounted with Vectashield mounting media (VectaShield 1000). Samples were mounted with a bridge using two pieces of scotch tapes (3M) with the adipose tissue facing the cover slip. Samples were imaged using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope.

The samples were permeabilized with 1X PBS+0.1% TritonX100 (PBT) for 30 min and then incubated with BS for 2 hr at room temperature. Primary antibody staining was performed in BS at 4°C overnight or 48 hr for staining the oenocytes with constant rotation (a long incubation is necessary for the antibody to percolate into the oenocytes) with constant rotation. Post primary incubation, samples were washed generously (five times, 15 min washes with PBT) at room temperature. Secondary, antibody incubation was done at room temperature for 2 hr in BS diluted 1/5 in PBT. Post secondary-incubation samples were washed in PBT and mounted with Vectashield mounting media. For phalloidin staining, PBT was exchanged with PBS with three washes and samples were incubated with phalloidin in PBS for 30 min at RT. Samples were then washed in PBS and mounted with vecta-shield mounting media.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Muscle</title><p>Adult male thoraxes were prepared for fixation by removing the head and abdomen. Additionally, the tips of the legs were cut using micro-scissors to allow easy access to the leg muscles for the fixative. The dissected samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The samples were subsequently embedded in 4% low-melt agarose and left at 4°C over night for the agarose to solidify. Samples in agarose blocks were mounted on to the stage of a vibratome (Leica VT1000M) in ice-cold PBS and 100 μm sections were cut. The sections were further trimmed under the microscope tissue sections with some surrounding agarose were transferred to 2 ml tubes. Subsequent immuno-staining steps were similar to as discussed in the previous section. Stained sections were mounted in Vectashield mounting media and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RT-qPCR</title><p>Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) experiments were conducted using a Biorad CFX 96/384 device. The iQ SYBR green super mix and i-Script RT-reaction mix was used as per the manufacturer’s instructions for the qPCR reactions. 7.5 μl of the 2x reaction mix, primer-mix final concentration of 133 nM and 20 ng of cDNA (assuming 1:1 conversion of RNA to cDNA) were regularly used per reaction. Reagents and samples were dispensed using a Formulatrix Mantis small volume liquid handler. The ΔΔCt method was used to calculate fold change in experimental conditions. Four to five biological replicates were used in all experiments. Transcript levels were normalized to <italic>Drosophila Rp49</italic>, <italic>tub</italic> and <italic>gapdh</italic>. Standard curves were run for each primer before use and we only used primers that showed an efficiency above 95%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Folch extraction and thin-layer chromatography (TLC)</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Folch extraction</title><p>Animals were collected in 1.5 ml screw cap tubes along with 1 mm zirconium beads and were frozen on dry ice. Samples were stored at −80°C if necessary, until all samples were ready for processing. For processing of the samples, 600 μl of Methanol:ChCl<sub>3</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O (10:5:4) was added to the tubes using a graduated glass Hamilton syringe and the animals were homogenized using the Qiagen TissueLyser II instrument. Two rounds of homogenization at a frequency of 30/sec and total duration of 30 s per round were performed to ensure complete homogenization of the tissues. The samples were placed on a rotor at 37°C for 1 hr. Subsequently, 160 μl of ChCl<sub>3</sub> and 160 μl of 1 M KCl were added to each sample. The samples were shaken vigorously for 5 s and briefly vortexed before centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 2 min on a standard Eppendorf bench top centrifuge for phase separation. 220 μl of the organic phase (bottom layer) was pipetted out into new clean 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes using a graduated glass Hamilton syringe. The samples were then placed in a vacuum concentrator (Labcono centrivap console) and the organic solvent was completely removed. The dried samples were stored at −80 if needed or run directly on a TLC plate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Thin-layer chromatography</title><p>For TLC, the dried samples were resuspended in 40 μl CHCl<sub>3</sub> and the entire volume was loaded on to Analtech channeled TLC plates with preadsorbent zones that allow loading of large volumes of samples (Analtech P43911). The lipids were then separated using hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1) solvent system. The plates were exposed to phosphor imager screens overnight and revealed by using a Typhoon FLA 7000 phosphor imager. The density of the TAG bands was calculated using imageJ/Fiji.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Preparation of single nuclei suspension from adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> abdominal cuticle</title><p>Forty adult male abdomens were quickly dissected in ice cold relaxing buffer (1xPBS, 10 mM EGTA and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) by cutting off the last 2nd and abdominal segment with micro-scissors and hollowing out the abdomen by removing the intestines and male reproductive organs. The dissected tissue was then roughly chopped and transferred to a Dounce homogenizer. The relaxing buffer was replaced with 1.3 ml of nuclei lysis buffer from the Sigma NUC-201 Nuclei isolation kit. Single nuclei suspension from the homogenate was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instruction the in the NUC-201 kit. Briefly, a 1.5 M sucrose cushion was used for generating the gradient for density gradient centrifugation. Density gradient centrifugation was performed in 2 ml tubes using a SW55Ti rotor on a Beckman ultracentrifuge.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of snRNA-Seq data</title><p>We used the 10X Genomics cellranger count pipeline (version 3.1.0) to analyze the demultiplexed FASTQ data and generated the single cell count matrix, once for each sample. We aligned the reads to a custom ‘pre-mRNA’ reference which was generated as described by 10X Genomics based on FlyBase R6.29. We applied SoupX (version 0.3.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Young and Behjati, 2018</xref>) to directly correct the count matrix from cellranger with fixed contamination value equals 0.45 for each sample. We filtered the cells beyond UMI counts ± 2 fold Standard Deviation of the average total sample counts (log10) after SoupX, which were regarded as doublets or dead cells in droplet. The quality filtered datasets were combined into a single Seurat (version 3.1.2) object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) and integrated using Harmony (version 1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>) with default analysis workflow and parameters. FindClusters function in Seurat was applied to identify cell clusters. The number of cell clusters identified depended on the number of PCs used for the clustering analysis (resolution). A resolution of 0.1 was chosen as clustering parameter for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.

We performed pathway enrichment analysis on marker genes with positive fold change for each cluster as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2018</xref>. Gene sets of Transcription Factor (TF) target genes of major signaling pathways were assembled manually (unpublished data). Enrichment p-value was calculated based on the hypergeometric distribution using the background of 11863 genes identified as expressed in this dataset. The strength of enrichment was calculated as negative of log10(p-value), which is used to plot the heatmap. The snRNA-seq data is available at the gene expression omnibus (GEO) under the accession code GSE147601.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Graphical representation and statistical analysis of all quantitative data was performed using GraphPad Prism eight software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to their labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Ghosh et al. describes a role for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PDGF/VEGF homolog <italic>pvf1</italic> in regulating adult lipid accumulation. Using a series of tissue-specific RNAi experiments, the authors demonstrate that knockdown of <italic>pvf1</italic> expression in adult muscles induces excess lipid accumulation in adipose tissues and oenocytes. This result suggests that <italic>pvf1</italic> acts as a myokine that inhibits lipid accumulation in these tissues. Consistent with this possibility, inhibition of PvR activity in the oenocytes, but not the fat body, also led to elevated lipid accumulation, indicating that <italic>pvf1</italic> regulates systemic lipid metabolism by acting through these hepatocyte-like cells. These results, together with a series of <sup>14</sup>C pulse-chase experiments, are quite important because they reveal that lipid synthesis in adults is controlled by a muscle-derived signal acting on the oenocytes.</p><p>After careful review and discussion all three reviewers have agreed that this is exciting work with a few major points requiring attention.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Oenocytes are well known to accumulate lipid droplets upon starvation. Since Tor functions as a key nutrient sensor, any disruption of Tor activity within these cells could trigger a starvation response and induce lipid accumulation. Based on earlier studies (see for example Chatterjee et al.), the findings in this manuscript could easily be reinterpreted, that loss of Pvf1 signaling triggers the oenocytes to inappropriately activate a starvation response. Could a starvation response be the basis of what is going on here? Please address.</p><p>2) The authors state that Tor activity within the oenocytes is independent of insulin signaling. The reviewers see little evidence for this statement based on what is known about the unusual way that IIS signaling influences lipid metabolism in oenocytes. As demonstrated by Chatterjee et al., expression of an active InR is required for lipid droplet accumulation in oenocytes. The experiment described in Figure 3D,E of this manuscript gave exactly the expected result and one that was previously shown by Chatterjee et al. overexpression of InR dominant negative does not induce excess lipid accumulation in oenocytes (this previous result should be referenced and adequately discussed in the manuscript). If the authors want to demonstrate that the PvR-RNAi phenotype within the oenocytes is independent of IIS signaling regarding lipid accumulation, they should coexpress the InR-dominant negative construct with PvR-RNAi in the oenocytes and look for suppression of the excess lipid phenotype. Also, what happens to lipid droplet accumulation and total TAGs if constitutive active InR is overexpressed? And Tcs1-2 are downregulated? Please address experimentally.</p><p>3) Growth and metabolism are tightly coregulated. Since most of the genes manipulated here also control cellular growth, is there a correlation between differences in the size of oenocytes and how much lipid content they accumulate? How can the authors distinguish their model from a model that suggests that Pvf1/PvR expression at the proper timing in muscle/oenocyte is required for the proper development of proper sized oenocytes? And that lack of such proper development would impair their function? Please address this experimentally and in the Discussion.</p><p>4) In general the model where PVF1 plays a role in re-establishing lipid metabolism in adults is appealing. Reviewers request the authors discuss alternative interpretations of their results and potential alternative models, as the data presented here can support various models. Related to this, in the Discussion please develop the paragraph describing adult fat body development. It is oversimplified and seems to suggest that the same larval fat body expands to make an adult fat body. From what has been (still poorly) studied these two tissues have different origins (see for example Aguila et al., 2007 and Nelliott, Bond and Hoshizaki, 2006).</p><p>Additionally, the authors claim that newly emerged flies contain lower lipid stores that must be restored in the adult. The situation is a bit more complicated, as shown by Aguila et al. (2007): larval fat body survives in newly emerged flies as floating cells, making these flies more resistant to fasting. Consistently, Wicker-Thomas et al. (2015) and Storelli et al. (2019) have shown that total amounts of TAGs are higher in newly emerged than in older fed flies. The word &quot;restoration&quot; suggests that the adult fat body needs to be replenished, but it is not known and rather unlikely that adult fat body contains high lipid stores in pupae. Prepupae contain high lipid stores that are used to some extent during metamorphosis and newly emerged flies still contain high lipid content in the remaining larval fat body (Storelli et al., 2018). Adult feeding does not result in restoration of lipid stores, rather lipids incorporate into the adult fat body, and the overall TAG levels never reaches those of newly emerged flies. Please rewrite the conclusions to provide a clearer picture of how your newly proposed model fits with what is known about fat body restructuring during the transition into adulthood.</p><p>5) The data must be revised with additional controls, and the number of animals per sample, and number of biological repeats, should be clarified. Genetics, growth conditions and age strongly influence metabolic and lifespan outcomes. Therefore, we request that the following controls are presented for the experiments:</p><p>a) All experiments need the genetic background control for each line, not just the drivers but also the RNAi lines and UAS-overexpression lines (unless all lines have been backcrossed and isogenized to the same background).</p><p>b) Each experiment needs an overexpression control (GFP or similar) or a RNAi control (as done in Figure 1C).</p><p>c) Careful control of growth conditions is required in metabolic research. Overcrowding or underpopulation of animals per vial/bottle can influence their ultimate size and lipid amount. How were these variables controlled and what were the conditions?</p><p>d) Changes in temperature also greatly alter metabolic outcomes in flies. What controls were done for temperature changes? Temperature shifts have to be properly controlled and described for all experiments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> PDGF/VEGF signaling from muscles to hepatocyte-like cells protects against obesity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>In this study, Ghosh and collaborators investigate the physiological role of muscle Pvf1, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of PDGF/VEGF, in organismal metabolism. Currently, homeostatic mechanisms that regulate energy homeostasis are still poorly known and explored. The whole organismal context of these studies, involving physiology and several organs, make these studies exciting and powerful.</p><p>In the revised version, Ghosh and collaborators provide novel data that clearly dissociate the described phenotype from that induced by starvation. In their resubmission the authors have addressed most of our major concerns. However, we request that the authors address three remaining major points:</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) We maintain our initial reservation about the fact that the authors do not show in Figure 5A that &quot;these flies are not defective in production of VLCFAs needed for waterproofing of the cuticle&quot;. We request this point be removed.</p><p>2) We also request the authors reproduce in the body text of the Results (not the Materials and methods) their statement of justification for why overexpression and RNAi controls were not used (response to point 5c). I suspect that many readers will share our concerns about the authors' approach and I think it is crucial that readers are able to decide for themselves whether there might be caveats to the authors' conclusions.</p><p>3) It is widely known that crosses from different genotypes, and especially small crosses as used by the authors (8 virgins with 6 males), often result in a wide range of numbers of healthy progeny. It is for this reason that, in order to tightly control for growth conditions, crosses are typically performed with a higher number of parents, and an equal number of progeny (often as L1s) are transferred from the vial to new growth media. Since this was not the approach, we request the authors be more precise when they state that the range of numbers of healthy adults obtained from each cross was &quot;about 80&quot;. If the range was, for example, 75-85, then this is acceptable; if the range was 50-110, then this is a point of concern. We think this is crucial information that can support readers with the conclusions they make when interpreting the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56969.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Oenocytes are well known to accumulate lipid droplets upon starvation.

We agree that a starvation like response to loss of TOR in the oenocyte can lead to lipid accumulation in the oenocytes. We first tested whether flies lacking the muscle to oenocyte Pvf1 signaling axis have a systemic starvation-like response. We measured the expression levels of bmm, thor and InR (genes that are upregulated in response to starvation) in the Adipose tissue of animals lacking Pvf1 in their muscle or PvR signaling in their oenocytes. Compared to control animals, both experimental animals did not show any change in the expression of these genes indicating a lack of systemic starvation response.</p><p>We next tested the possibility that loss of PvR/TOR pathway in the oenocyte leads to inappropriate activation of the starvation response in the oenocytes. As reported in our original version of the paper, we performed single-nuclei RNA sequencing of wild type adult abdominal cuticles and were able to identify the oenocyte-specific gene expression using this technique. In addition, we performed a similar sn-RNAseq of nuclei isolated from the abdominal cuticle of <italic>oeno&gt;TOR<sup>KD</sup></italic> (<italic>oeno&gt;tsc1, tsc2</italic>) flies. To identify differentially expressed genes, we converted the oenocyte-specific gene expression profiles from both data sets to pseudobulk expression for the genes that were detected. This allowed us to compare the expression profiles of the oenocytes from control animals and animals lacking TOR signaling in the oenocytes. Next, we specifically looked at the effect of loss of TOR on the expression of the 47 genes that Chaterjee et al. had reported to be up-regulated specifically in the oenocytes in response to starvation. Interestingly, we did not observe any significant change in the expression of any of these genes in our experimental flies. These observations support that loss of TOR does not lead to a starvation like response in the oenocytes. We have included the new dataset and discussed the proposed hypothesis in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state that Tor activity within the oenocytes is independent of insulin signaling. The reviewers see little evidence for this statement based on what is known about the unusual way that IIS signaling influences lipid metabolism in oenocytes.

Please address experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide a number of evidence that shows that under steady state conditions TOR signaling in the oenocytes suppresses lipid accumulation in the oenocytes and in the adipose tissue.</p><p>First, we show that oenocyte-specific loss of TOR signaling by over-expression of <italic>tsc1</italic> and <italic>tsc2</italic> leads to massive accumulation of lipids in the oenocytes and the adipose tissue (Figure 3B,C).</p><p>Second, we show that oenocyte-specific activation of TOR by knocking down <italic>tsc2</italic> can completely rescue the lipid accumulation phenotype observed in the <italic>oeno<sup>ts</sup>&gt;PvR<sup>DN</sup></italic> flies (Figure 4D, E).</p><p>Third, we show that oenocyte-specific activation of TOR by over-expressing a constitutively active form of Rheb can also completely rescue the lipid accumulation of phenotype observed in the <italic>oeno<sup>ts</sup>&gt;PvR<sup>DN</sup></italic> flies (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Assuming that InR in the oenocyte is involved in the activation of the TOR pathway under steady state feeding conditions, it is reasonable to predict that loss of InR signaling should mimic the phenotype of loss of TOR signaling. However, our data shows that this is not the case and that loss of InR signaling does not lead to excessive accumulation of lipids (Figure 3D). Additionally, we show that loss of InR signaling in the oenocytes of feeding animals does not have any effect on p4EBP levels, further supporting the claim that in feeding steady state animals InR does not activate TOR (Figure 4B,C). Moreover, we find that loss of InR signaling reduces oenocyte size whereas loss of TOR does not. These discrepancies between the phenotypes caused by loss of InR signaling and loss of TOR signaling in the oenocytes strongly suggest that InR does not activate TOR pathway in the oenocytes of feeding <italic>Drosophila</italic> adults. However, since our data does not comprehensively investigate whether InR signaling works independently to TOR in the oenocyte, we have stopped short of making that claim and only present the data as it is.</p><p>In our original work, we had not tested whether oenocyte-specific activation of TOR can lead to lipid accumulation in the oenocyte or adipose tissue. Neither had we tested whether InR signaling is still necessary for the manifestation of the lipid accumulation phenotypes we see in our TOR knockdown animals. We thank the reviewers for suggesting experiments that directly test these possibilities which we have now included.</p><p>Specifically, in our revised manuscript we present data that shows that oenocyte specific activation of TOR signaling (via oenocyte specific knock down of <italic>tsc2</italic>) does not lead to accumulation of lipids either in the oenocyte or the adipose tissue (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D). While this does not challenge the findings of the Chatterjee et al. paper that show that InR signaling is required for oenocyte lipid build up, this data does show that InR signaling most likely works independent of TOR in mediating its effects on lipid accumulation.</p><p>We also checked the effect of co-expressing <italic>pvr<sup>DN</sup></italic> and <italic>inr<sup>DN</sup></italic> in the oenocyte on lipid accumulation. Oenocyte specific loss of InR signaling did not suppress the accumulation of lipids in adipose tissue observed in flies co-expressing <italic>pvr<sup>DN</sup></italic> in the oenocytes (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B). However, we were surprised to see that co-suppression of InR signaling did rescue the accumulation of lipid in the oenocytes. This data shows that InR signaling is indeed required for accumulation of lipids in the oenocyte but the role does not extend to the systemic effects on lipid accumulation that oenocyte specific loss of PvR signaling has.</p><p>Understanding the complex interplay between InR, PvR and TOR in feeding and starvation conditions will be an exciting direction to pursue in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Growth and metabolism are tightly coregulated.

It is indeed possible that changes in the size of oenocytes can affect lipid metabolism. Since all of our studies involved conditional genetic manipulations in the oenocytes on post developmental adult flies that were at least 5 days old, it is quite unlikely that our experimental animals have developmental defects in the oenocytes. It is however possible that loss of some of these pathways could influence post developmental size of the oenocytes by affecting the size of the cells. We do observe that loss of either InR signaling or Akt1 in the oenocytes causes a strong reduction in overall size of the oenocytes. Contrarily, loss of TOR signaling tends to cause an overall increase in oenocyte size, although this change was not significant when measured. Loss of PvR signaling did not have any obvious effects on oenocyte size. Interestingly, we did not observe any correlation between the size of the oenocytes and the obesity phenotype. Based on this observation and the observation that loss of PvR signaling in the oenocyte did not cause any change in oenocyte size we conclude that the muscle-to-oenocyte Pvf1 signaling axis does not regulate lipid accumulation by affecting oenocyte size. We have presented the relevant data in the updated manuscript (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D) and have discussed the above mentioned possibilities in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In general the model where PVF1 plays a role in reestablishing lipid metabolism in adults is appealing.

It is oversimplified and seems to suggest that the same larval fat body expands to make an adult fat body. From what has been (still poorly) studied these two tissues have different origins (see for example Aguila et al., 2007 and Nelliott, Bond and Hoshizaki, 2006).</p><p>Additionally, the authors claim that newly emerged flies contain lower lipid stores that must be restored in the adult. The situation is a bit more complicated, as shown by Aguila et al. (2007): larval fat body survives in newly emerged flies as floating cells, making these flies more resistant to fasting. Consistently, Wicker-Thomas et al. (2015) and Storelli et al. (2019) have shown that total amounts of TAGs are higher in newly emerged than in older fed flies. The word &quot;restoration&quot; suggests that the adult fat body needs to be replenished, but it is not known and rather unlikely that adult fat body contains high lipid stores in pupae. Prepupae contain high lipid stores that are used to some extent during metamorphosis and newly emerged flies still contain high lipid content in the remaining larval fat body (Storelli et al., 2018). Adult feeding does not result in restoration of lipid stores, rather lipids incorporate into the adult fat body, and the overall TAG levels never reaches those of newly emerged flies. Please rewrite the conclusions to provide a clearer picture of how your newly proposed model fits with what is known about fat body restructuring during the transition into adulthood.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the information on adult adipose tissue development was not articulated clearly and could be mis-interpreted. We have now rephrased the section in the Discussion and also changed the wordings in the Abstract to better reflect the sequence of events that leads to adult adipose tissue development and lipid build up in the adipose tissue of a young adult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The data must be revised with additional controls, and the number of animals per sample, and number of biological repeats, should be clarified. Genetics, growth conditions and age strongly influence metabolic and lifespan outcomes. Therefore, we request that the following controls are presented for the experiments:</p><p>a) All experiments need the genetic background control for each line, not just the drivers but also the RNAi lines and UAS-overexpression lines (unless all lines have been backcrossed and isogenized to the same background).</p></disp-quote><p>The adult adipose tissue dissection, staining and imaging protocol is quite laborious and makes inclusion of a large number of controls in every experiment quite difficult. As such we had kept the number of control genotypes in a given experiment low to have a manageable number of genotypes. Further, although some of our experiments could have been performed with additional control lines, we believe that the fact that we used more than one genetic approach to drive home our conclusions and that those independent approaches culminated to the same conclusion addresses the issue.</p><p>At this point it is impossible for us to repeat all our experiments with additional controls. However, since all our imaging was done under identical conditions it is possible to compare lipid droplet quantifications between experiments. We would like to bring to light that the 5 genetic background controls used in the original manuscript</p><p><italic>pvf1-i/+</italic></p><p><italic>oeno<sup>ts</sup>/+</italic></p><p><italic>oeno<sup>ts</sup>&gt;UAS</italic></p><p><italic>inr<sup>DN</sup>/+</italic></p><p><italic>tsc2-i/+</italic></p><p>all show very similar average adipose tissue lipid droplet size. We have now analyzed and compared the lipid droplet size of 4 additional controls lines (Figure 4—figure supplement 3)</p><p><italic>akt1-i/+</italic></p><p><italic>Pi3K21B-i/+</italic></p><p><italic>Pi3K92E-i/+</italic></p><p><italic>UAS-tsc1,tsc2/+</italic></p><p>to the <italic>oeno<sup>ts</sup></italic> line that we have most commonly used as a control. The new data demonstrates that all our controls show similar baseline adipose tissue lipid droplet size across multiple genotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Each experiment needs an overexpression control (GFP or similar) or a RNAi control (as done in Figure 1C).</p></disp-quote><p>While GFP overexpression or a control RNAi expression is often used in the field as valid controls, they by no means represent ideal controls for our experiments and each of them come with significant drawbacks. Overexpressing GFP in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells could be toxic in some contexts leading to unpredictable physiological effects. Similarly knocking down another unrelated gene such as Vermillion could also have unpredictable effects on the biology being studied.</p><p>However, we think that the best way to test a hypothesis is by making sure that multiple lines of evidence converge at the same conclusion and not necessarily by playing with a large number of control lines. As explained in the previous point, we do draw our conclusions based on multiple experimental evidences that point toward the same logical explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Careful control of growth conditions is required in metabolic research. Overcrowding or underpopulation of animals per vial/bottle can influence their ultimate size and lipid amount. How were these variables controlled and what were the conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>The growth conditions and densities of animals were tightly controlled to make sure that they were not the deciding factor for our observations. The details involved are now included in the updated Materials and methods section</p><p>“We ensured that the density of our experimental animals was optimal for proper growth and uniformity of growth conditions. To do so, all crosses consisted of 8 virgin females that were crossed to 6 males in standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> food vials. The crosses were allowed to remain in a vial for 6 days at 18 <sup>o</sup>C and then the adults were discarded. We found that 6 days of egg laying at 18 <sup>o</sup>C led to eclosion of about 80 healthy adults that were very comparable in size. We often reared multiple crosses in parallel to obtain the final number of males that are necessary for a given experiment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Changes in temperature also greatly alter metabolic outcomes in flies. What controls were done for temperature changes? Temperature shifts have to be properly controlled and described for all experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have controlled our temperature shifts meticulously and the protocol is described in the Materials and methods section. Indeed, temperature shifts could have effects on metabolism, however since both our control and experimental flies were temperature shifted at the same time and were maintained at 29°C for at least 6 days before any experiments, we assume that any effects of temperature equally influenced all genotypes and any effects that we see in our experimental flies come from the genetic manipulations we are doing. Thus, we stand by our conclusions, which are well controlled at the level of rearing our control and experimental flies.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) We maintain our initial reservation about the fact that the authors do not show in Figure 5A that &quot;these flies are not defective in production of VLCFAs needed for waterproofing of the cuticle&quot;. We request this point be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the above-mentioned line from the text as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We also request the authors reproduce in the body text of the Results (not the Materials and methods) their statement of justification for why overexpression and RNAi controls were not used (response to point 5c). I suspect that many readers will share our concerns about the authors' approach and I think it is crucial that readers are able to decide for themselves whether there might be caveats to the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved our response to both point 5b and 5c of the original decision letter to the main body of the paper in the Results section as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is widely known that crosses from different genotypes, and especially small crosses as used by the authors (8 virgins with 6 males), often result in a wide range of numbers of healthy progeny. It is for this reason that, in order to tightly control for growth conditions, crosses are typically performed with a higher number of parents, and an equal number of progeny (often as L1s) are transferred from the vial to new growth media. Since this was not the approach, we request the authors be more precise when they state that the range of numbers of healthy adults obtained from each cross was &quot;about 80&quot;. If the range was, for example, 75-85, then this is acceptable; if the range was 50-110, then this is a point of concern. We think this is crucial information that can support readers with the conclusions they make when interpreting the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We regularly retrieved ~30-40 males and an equal number of females from our crosses that were carried out in standard 10 cm food vials. We discarded vials that had an aberrantly low (≤60) or high number (≥80) of adults eclosing from them. We have now added this information in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
