understood. We observed that <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA levels are lower in ovarian cancer patient samples compared to non-cancerous tissue, but PARP-7 protein nonetheless contributes to several cancer-related biological endpoints in ovarian cancer cells (e.g. growth, migration). Global gene expression analyses in ovarian cancer cells subjected to PARP-7 depletion indicate biological roles for PARP-7 in cell-cell adhesion and gene regulation. To identify the MARylated substrates of PARP-7 in ovarian cancer cells, we developed an NAD<sup>+</sup> analog-sensitive approach, which we coupled with mass spectrometry to identify the PARP-7 ADP-ribosylated proteome in ovarian cancer cells, including cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins. Specifically, we found that PARP-7 MARylates α-tubulin to promote microtubule instability, which may regulate ovarian cancer cell growth and motility. In sum, we identified an extensive PARP-7 ADP-ribosylated proteome with important roles in cancer-related cellular phenotypes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is a complex illness where changes inside healthy cells causes them to grow and reproduce rapidly. Specialized proteins called enzymes – which regulate chemical reactions in the cell – often help cancer develop and spread through the body. One such enzyme called PARP-7 labels other proteins by attaching a chemical group which changes their behavior. However, it was unknown which proteins PARP-7 modifies and how this tag alters the actions of these proteins.</p><p>To investigate this, Parsons, Challa, Gibson et al. developed a method to find and identify the proteins labelled by PARP-7 in ovarian cancer cells taken from patients and cultured in the laboratory. This revealed that PARP-7 labels hundreds of different proteins, including adhesion proteins which affect the connections between cells and cytoskeletal proteins which regulate a cell’s shape and how it moves.</p><p>One of the cytoskeletal proteins modified by PARP-7 is α-tubulin, which joins together with other tubulins to form long, tube-like structures known as microtubules. Parsons et al. found that when α-tubulin is labelled by PARP-7, it creates unstable microtubules that alter how the cancer cells grow and move. They discovered that depleting PARP-7 or mutating the sites where it modifies α-tubulin increased the stability of microtubules and slowed the growth of ovarian cancer cells.</p><p>Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in the United States. A new drug which suppresses the activity of PARP-7 has recently been developed, and this drug could potentially be used to treat ovarian cancer patients with high levels of PARP-7. Clinical trials are ongoing to see how this drug affects the behavior of cancer cells in patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adp-ribosylation</kwd><kwd>PARP-7</kwd><kwd>ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>chemical genetics</kwd><kwd>alpha-tubulin</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK069710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kraus</surname><given-names>W Lee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PARP-7 is a mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase that directs an extensive ADP-ribosylated proteome to control microtubule stability, and regulate ovarian cancer cell growth and motility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Members of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes catalyze ADP-ribosylation (ADPRylation), a posttranslational modification of proteins, through covalent transfer of ADP-ribose (ADPR) from β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) onto a variety of amino acid residues, including glutamate, aspartate, and serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupte et al., 2017</xref>). ADPRylation can occur as a single ADP-ribose (i.e. mono(ADP-ribose), [MAR]) or multiple ADP-ribose moieties (i.e. poly(ADP-ribose), [PAR]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>). Both MAR and PAR modifications are reversible and can be removed by a variety of ADPR hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rack et al., 2020</xref>). Free and protein-linked ADP-ribose moieties can be bound by proteins (‘readers’) containing ADPR-binding domains (e.g. macrodomains, WWE domains), allowing MAR or PAR to be interpreted or ‘read’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Teloni and Altmeyer, 2016</xref>). ADPRylation can modulate target protein functions, including enzymatic activity, interactions with binding partners, and protein stability through both direct effects resulting from chemical modification and indirect effects mediated by ADPR-binding ‘reader’ proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In humans, the PARP family includes 17 members, each with unique structural domains, expression patterns, targets, enzymatic activity, localization, and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amé et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vyas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vyas et al., 2014</xref>). In spite of the moniker, PARP family members are mostly monoADPR transferases (MARTs). PARP family MARTs include PARPs 3, 4, 6–12, and 14–16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vyas et al., 2014</xref>). Much of the research on the PARP family has focused on its founding member, PARP-1, which plays roles in transcription and DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pascal, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ray Chaudhuri and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>), but the molecular and cellular functions of the PARP family are considerably more diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vyas et al., 2013</xref>). Recent efforts to understand how ADP-ribosylation by other PARPs modulates cellular biology have identified roles in stress responses, cellular metabolism, and immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo and Kraus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luo and Kraus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>). Further understanding of the diversity of functions of PARP family members will require more information about the catalytic activities of these enzymes, as well as identification of their substrate proteins. In this study, we addressed these questions for PARP-7 through an examination of its catalytic activity and identification of its substrates.</p><p>PARP-7 is a MART that localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacPherson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vyas et al., 2014</xref>). PARP-7 is also known as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-inducible PARP (TiPARP) because it is induced by TCDD as a target gene of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2001</xref>). PARP-7 contains a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain, as well as central region containing a WWE (tryptophan-tryptophan-glutamate) motif thought to bind PAR and a single CCCH-type zinc-finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravind, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schreiber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike true PARPs, which contain a signature H-Y-E motif in their catalytic domains, PARP-7 contains H-Y-I (H532, Y564, and I631), which underlies its MART activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacPherson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vyas et al., 2014</xref>). The histidine and tyrosine residues of the H-Y-E catalytic triad are required for the binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the ADP-ribosyl transferase catalytic site, whereas the glutamate residue is required for catalysis of PARylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marsischky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Papini et al., 1989</xref>). Little is known about the catalytic activity and substrates of PARP-7, although previous studies have identified a few targets, including PARP-7 itself through automodification, as well as histones, AHR, and liver X receptors (LXRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bindesbøll et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gomez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacPherson et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gomez et al., 2018</xref> showed that the sites of PARP-7 automodification are resistant to meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), an inhibitor of arginine-specific MARTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loesberg et al., 1990</xref>), but are sensitive to iodoacetamide and hydroxylamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), implicating cysteines and acidic side chain residues (e.g. glutamate and aspartate), respectively, as target residues for MARylation. More work is needed in this area, with higher throughput substrate identification.</p><p>Although some progress has been made, the biology of PARP-7 is poorly characterized and limited in scope. PARP-7 is involved in a negative feedback loop regulating AHR responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacPherson et al., 2013</xref>), but also plays a role in other cellular processes, including stem cell pluripotency, transcriptional regulation, mitotic spindle formation, viral replication, immune responses, and neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grimaldi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kozaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vyas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>). PARP-7 has recently emerged as a potentially interesting target for cancer therapy, in part because breast cancers have altered expression of <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to studies in breast cancer, the <italic>PARP7</italic> gene (located at 3q25) was identified in a susceptibility locus for ovarian cancer in a genome-wide association study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goode et al., 2010</xref>). Determining its role in cellular signaling remains an important step in determining the utility of PARP-7 as a therapeutic target for breast and ovarian cancers.</p><p>Here, we describe a chemical genetics approach for the identification of PARP-7 substrates based on a previously described NAD<sup>+</sup> analog-sensitive PARP (asPARP) approach developed for PARPs 1, 2, and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibson and Kraus, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibson et al., 2016</xref>). In this asPARP approach, NAD<sup>+</sup> with an alkyne-containing R group at position 8 of the adenine ring works in concert with PARP proteins mutated at gatekeeper residues within their active site to facilitate ‘click’-able ADP-ribosylation of asPARP-specific protein targets. This approach is conceptually similar to one described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter-O'Connell et al., 2014</xref> in which analog sensitivity is conferred through an addition to the nicotinamide moiety, with click functionality conferred by an alkyne moiety added at position 6 of adenine. We used the asPARP approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibson et al., 2016</xref> in combination with mass spectrometry to determine the PARP-7 MARylated proteome, as well as complementary genomic, biochemical, cell-based, and biological analyses. Our studies have revealed an expansive set of PARP-7 protein substrates, including α-tubulin, which reduces microtubule stability when MARylated by PARP-7.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PARP-7 regulates cell growth and invasion in ovarian cancer cells</title><p>Recent studies linking PARP-7 to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goode et al., 2010</xref>) prompted us to examine the expression of <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA in human cancer samples. We mined the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx; normal) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; cancer) databases to quantify <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA expression across different normal and cancerous human tissues, including ovary, breast, pancreas, and kidney. Of these four tissues, <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA was expressed to the highest levels in ovary and the lowest levels in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The levels of <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA in cancers compared to the cognate noncancerous tissues varied; ovarian cancer tissues had decreased levels of <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA, while pancreatic cancers had elevated levels of <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA, when compared to noncancerous tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, analysis at a more granular level using single-cell RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Izar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>) revealed that (1) the cell types in normal ovarian tissue are different than those in cancerous tissue and (2) malignant cells from ovarian cancer have a higher average <italic>PARP7</italic> expression level than any of the normal ovarian cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The latter is supported by data from the Pan-Cancer Atlas in the TCGA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoadley et al., 2018</xref>) showing a high frequency of <italic>PARP7</italic> gene gains and amplifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Given the difference in cell types and the possibility that ovarian cancers actually arise from cells in the Fallopian tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erickson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labidi-Galy et al., 2017</xref>), direct comparisons between <italic>PARP7</italic> expression levels in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues are difficult. But, the available data suggest the possibility that gene amplifications drive elevated <italic>PARP7</italic> expression in malignant cells in ovarian cancers, which may portend a dependence of ovarian cancers on PARP-7.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PARP-7 expression in cancers and role in ovarian cancer cell phenotypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Violin plots showing normalized expression of <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA from GTEx data presented as log<sub>10</sub>(TPM+1) (Transcripts Per Million), calculated from a gene model with all isoforms collapsed to a single gene.

Similar results were observed in a parallel experiment in cells treated with Nocodazole, a drug that depolymerizes microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pillai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Similar results were observed in three other cell lines: OVCAR3, HeLa, and A704 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the effects are not restricted to ovarian cancer cells. The levels of α-tubulin MARylation and PARP-7 increase after treatment with cold or Nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), linking PARP-7 levels, α-tubulin MARylation, and microtubule depolymerization.</p><p>To connect the catalytic activity of PARP-7 more directly to the function of α-tubulin in cells, we used two approaches. First, we used a catalytically dead PARP-7 mutant (Y564A), which we expressed using a Flag-tagged mouse <italic>Parp7</italic> cDNA to produce an siRNA-resistant mRNA that could be used in knockdown-addback experiments (the <italic>PARP7</italic> siRNAs that we used were designed against the human <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA). Ectopic expression of the catalytically dead PARP-7 mutant resulted in a loss of α-tubulin MARylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, expression of the catalytically dead PARP-7 mutant after depletion of endogenous PARP-7 phenocopied <italic>PARP7</italic> knockdown in the microtubule stability assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and the cell migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2, C and D</xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>) (i.e. it was impaired versus wild-type PARP-7 in both cases). These results demonstrate that PARP-7 catalytic activity is required for the observed effects of PARP-7.</p><p>Second, we identified the sites of PARP-7-mediated MARylation on α-tubulin using our asPARP-7 approach, mutated them, and performed functional analyses with the MARylation site mutant. To do so, we eluted trypsin-digested, 8-Bu(3-yne)T-ADP-ribose-labeled proteins from the azide-agarose beads described above using hydroxylamine and analyzed them by mass spectrometry. Hydroxylamine-cleaved ADPR modifications produce a 15.019 <italic>m/z</italic> shift identifying the specific site of glutamate or aspartate modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Our analysis identified multiple sites of PARP-7-mediated MARylation on α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). We focused on three residues in the critical amino-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (i.e. D69, E71, E77), all of which were contained in a single peptide that was identified in all four replicates (two each for OVCAR4 and HeLa cells). We mutated all three of these residues to similar, but non-modifiable, residues (D → N and E → Q) and then expressed the mutant protein in OVCAR4 cells. Mutation of these sites impaired MARylation of α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), and ectopic expression of the α-tubulin mutant phenocopied <italic>PARP7</italic> knockdown and expression of a catalytically dead PARP-7 mutant in the microtubule stability assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>; compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results show that direct MARylation of α-tubulin is required for the observed effects of PARP-7.</p><p>Collectively, these results indicate that PARP-7 reduces cellular microtubule content following recovery from depolymerization, likely in part through direct MARylation of α-tubulin. Moreover, the PARP-7-mediated microtubule control may play a role in the regulation of cancer cell growth and motility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Studies over the past two decades have begun to elucidate the biological functions of PARP-7. The earliest studies focused on the role of PARP-7 as a component of the AHR signaling pathway in response to the environmental contaminant dioxin (TCDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacPherson et al., 2013</xref>). This led to the observation that PARP-7 is a negative regulator of AHR activity that acts to reduce sensitivity to dioxin-induced steatohepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hutin et al., 2018</xref>). More recent studies have implicated PARP-7 in immune responses to viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atasheva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kozaki et al., 2017</xref>), maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roper et al., 2014</xref>), and promotion of neural progenitor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grimaldi et al., 2019</xref>). And, as discussed in more detail below, PARP-7 has also been implicated in cancer, although its role has been less clear and may vary in different cancer types. Herein, we described a chemical genetics approach that has allowed us to identify substrates of PARP-7, providing insights into the biology of PARP-7.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Substrate identification as a window into the biology of PARP-7</title><p>Information on the protein substrates of PARP-7 has been limited, although previous studies have identified a few targets, including PARP-7 itself through automodification, as well as histones, AHR, and LXRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bindesbøll et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gomez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacPherson et al., 2013</xref>). To identify the MARylated substrates that underlie PARP-7-mediated ovarian cancer cell phenotypes, we developed a chemical genetics approach for NAD<sup>+</sup> analog-sensitivity comprising an NAD<sup>+</sup> binding pocket PARP-7 mutant (S563G) paired with the NAD<sup>+</sup> analog 8-Bu(3-yne)T-NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). We used this approach coupled with mass spectrometry to identify an extensive PARP-7 ADP-ribosylated proteome in OVCAR4 and HeLa cells, including cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Interestingly, similar gene ontologies were enriched in our gene expression experiments in OVCAR4 cells after knockdown of <italic>PARP7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting a coordination of the regulatory functions of PARP-7.</p><p>One PARP-7 substrate that we identified, α-tubulin, has links to cancer, playing a role in cell migration and mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boggs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pillai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piperno et al., 1987</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that MARylation of α-tubulin by PARP-7 supports proper organization of the mouse neuronal cortex, including the correct distribution and number of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grimaldi et al., 2019</xref>). In our studies, we observed that PARP-7 reduces cellular microtubule content following recovery from depolymerization, likely in part through direct MARylation of α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This may result from changes in the polymerization rate, tubulin dimer stability, microtubule stability, etc. PARP-7-mediated microtubule control is likely to underlie the regulation of cell growth and motility that we observed in ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-H</xref>).</p><p>Why might PARP-7 MARylate α-tubulin to destabilize microtubules in ovarian cancer cells? How does this benefit the cancer cells? One possibility is that the ability to quickly depolymerize and disassemble microtubules is important for efficient cell proliferation and migration. Indeed, there is evidence for this in the literature. Taxanes and related molecules comprise a class of anticancer drugs that stabilize microtubules, leading to the arrest of proliferation and mitosis. Moreover, previous studies have shown that well-characterized tumor suppressors, such as RASSF1A and APC, act to stabilize microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Es et al., 2001</xref>). These observations provide a plausible explanation for the observed effects of PARP-7 on α-tubulin and microtubules in our assays. Rodriguez et al. (co-submitted) did not identify α-tubulin as a PARP-7 substrate in their analysis, but they did identify tubulin-specific chaperone E, a key chaperone for α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tian and Cowan, 2013</xref>), perhaps indicating a broader role for PARP-7 in regulating microtubule formation.</p><p>Together, our results demonstrate a functional link between PARP-7, its catalytic activity toward a specific substrate (i.e. α-tubulin), a defined cellular process (i.e. microtubule control), and a broader biological outcome (i.e. cancer-related phenotypes).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interplay among PARP family members</title><p>Among the PARP-7 substrates that we identified in our analyses, we found other PARP family members, including PARP-1 (both replicates from OVCAR4 and HeLa cells), PARP-4 (one replicate from OVCAR4 cells and both replicates from HeLa cells), and PARP-2 (one replicate from HeLa cells) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). PARPs 1 and 2 are nuclear proteins with functions in DNA repair and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryu et al., 2015</xref>), whereas PARP-4 (a.k.a. vault PARP) is a component of enigmatic cell structures known as vault particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kickhoefer et al., 1999</xref>). In previous studies of PARPs 1, 2, and 3, we observed extensive crosstalk between them, each acting as a substrate for the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibson et al., 2016</xref>). Such crosstalk may be a universal feature of PARPs. In this regard, Rodriguez et al. (co-submitted) identified PARP-13 as a substrate of PARP-7 using a similar chemical genetics approach, which also included MARylation site identifications. Their analysis identified cysteine as a major ADPR acceptor for PARP-7, consistent with observations by Gomez et al. implicating cysteines and acidic residues as targets for MARylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gomez et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Context-specific roles of PARP-7 in cancers and therapeutic opportunities</title><p><italic>TIPARP</italic> (the gene encoding PARP-7, located at 3q25) was identified in a susceptibility locus for ovarian cancer in a recent genome-wide association study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goode et al., 2010</xref>). We have recently shown that ADP-ribosylation levels and patterns correlate with gene expression and clinical outcomes in ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conrad et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, we and others have observed that <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA expression is lower in ovarian cancers compared to normal ovarian epithelium, both in patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goode et al., 2010</xref>). However, a more detailed analysis using single cell RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Izar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>) revealed that malignant cells from ovarian cancer have a higher average <italic>PARP7</italic> expression level than any of the normal ovarian cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The latter is supported by data from the Pan-Cancer Atlas in the TCGA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoadley et al., 2018</xref>) showing a high frequency of <italic>PARP7</italic> gene gains and amplifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although direct comparisons between <italic>PARP7</italic> expression level in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues are difficult, the available data suggest the possibility that gene amplifications drive elevated <italic>PARP7</italic> expression in malignant cells in ovarian cancers.</p><p>In breast cancers, <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA expression is lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and higher <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA is associated with better survival outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, in breast and colon cancer cells, PARP-7 acts to suppress multiple oncogenic transcription factors, including HIF-1α, to reduce tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>PARP7</italic> in breast and colon cancer xenografts promotes enhanced tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>These observations stand in contrast to our results with ovarian cancer cells, in which <italic>PARP7</italic> knockdown resulted in reduced cell growth, migration, and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-H</xref>), as well as increased microtubule content, which may reduce cancer-related outcomes. Thus, PARP-7 may have context-specific effects in cancer cells. In ovarian cancers and other cancers that respond similarly to <italic>PARP7</italic> knockdown, inhibition of PARP-7 catalytic activity with small molecules would be expected to have positive therapeutic effects. In this regard, the first PARP-7 inhibitor (RBN-2397) is now in Phase I clinical trials for solid tumors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT04053673). In contrast to the current FDA-approved PARP1/2 inhibitors, RBN-2397 is the first inhibitor of a MART, representing a previously unexplored therapeutic target.</p><p>Finally, treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel is the primary initial treatment regimen for the vast majority of ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyd and Muggia, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kampan et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, paclitaxel is a microtubule-stabilizing drug that prevents mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weaver, 2014</xref>). Although paclitaxel binds specifically to β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orr et al., 2003</xref>), overexpression of α-tubulin can increase the resistance of cancer cells to paclitaxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2000</xref>). These observations, viewed in light of our results, suggest an intriguing link between PARP-7, α-tubulin, microtubules, and the sensitivity of cancer cells to paclitaxel.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

We generated lentiviruses by transfection of the pINDUCER20 constructs described above, together with: (i) an expression vector for the VSV-G envelope protein (pCMV-VSV-G, Addgene 8454), (ii) an expression vector for GAG-Pol-Rev (psPAX2, 12260), and (iii) a vector to aid with translation initiation (pAdVAntage, Promega) into 293 T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen, L3000015) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting viruses were collected in the culture medium, concentrated by using a Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech, 631231), and used to infect OVCAR4 cells. Stably transduced cells were selected with G418 sulfate (Sigma, A1720; 1 mg/ml). The cells were treated with 1 µg/mL Dox for 24 hr to induce protein expression. Inducible ectopic expression of the cognate proteins was confirmed by western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Immunofluorescent staining of cultured cells</title><p>OVCAR4 cells grown in six-well plates were transfected with 30 nM control siRNA or two different siRNAs targeting PARP-7. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and seeded into eight-well chambered slides (Thermo Fisher, 154534). For rescue experiments in OVCAR4 cells expressing wild-type or catalytically dead mutant PARP-7, the cells were plated as above and then treated with 1 µg/mL Dox. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were either placed on ice for 45 min or treated with 6 μM nocodazole for 1 hr and then washed with warm medium. The cells were allowed to recover by incubation in normal growth medium at 37°C for 15 min and were then washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS. The cells were permeabilized for 5 min using Permeabilization Buffer (PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100), washed three times with PBS, and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in Blocking Solution (PBS containing 1% BSA, 10% FBS, 0.3 M glycine and 0.1% Tween-20). The fixed cells were incubated with α-tubulin antibody (1:1000 Santa Cruz, sc-8035) or HA antibody (1:200 Abcam, ab9110) in PBS overnight at 4°C. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500, ThermoFisher, A-11001) in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, coverslips were mounted with the VectaShield Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, H-1200). All images were acquired using an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope and the fluorescence intensities were measured using Fiji ImageJ software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Kraus lab for critical comments on this manuscript.

represent the first systematic investigations on PARP-7 regulated proteome. Particularly, this study not only identifies PARP-7 substrates but also dissects the biological roles of α-tubulin ADP-ribosylation and PARP-7 catalytic activity in cancer phenotypes. Intriguingly, this study identifies part of the PARP-7 specificity being towards the acidic residues, in contrast to the cysetine specificity in the Cohen study. Given the recent findings on the role of PARP-7 in viral infection and the development of PARP-7 inhibitors for cancer therapy, this work is timely for the field and beyond.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification of PARP-7 substrates reveals a role for MARylation in microtubule control in ovarian cancer cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Anthony K L Leung as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: and Ivan Matic (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Parsons, Gibson, Challa et al. created a new variant of their chemical genetics methods to identify PARP7 targets. The authors identified two PARP7 gatekeeper residues and generated 10 different mutants, which were screened for their catalytic activity in the presence of four different NAD analogs. The authors used S563G mutant with the 8-Bu(3-yne)T-NAD+ analog to identify PARP7 substrates by mass spectrometry, which represents an important resource of PARP7 targets that can be explored in future studies. In addition, the authors reported the mRNA expression of PARP7 is lower in cancer than with normal tissue. Among the identified targets, they focus on α-tubulin, indicating that PARP7 is important for the maintenance of microtubules dynamics, suggesting a possible mechanistic bridge between ovarian cancer growth and PARP7 activity. Given that PARP7 inhibitor is now in Phase I clinical trials for solid tumors, this manuscript represents a significant advance and should be considered for publication with the following improvements:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Extend the mechanistic insights on PARP7 and microtubules: &quot;PARP-7 mediated microtubule control may play a role in the regulation of cancer cell growth and motility&quot; This statement is premature without further experimental data. The mechanism of the observed PARP7-dependent change in α-tubulin in two tubulin-sensitized conditions (cold and nocodazole treatment) is unclear. Would the level of α-tubulin and its ADP-ribosylation change at the basal, stressed (cold/nocodazole) and recovered in wild-type and PARP7 knockdown condition? Along the same lines, Figure 7C lacks immunofluorescence data of WT and PARP7 KD cells not treated with cold or nocodazole, which is an important control to aid in interpretation of the results.</p><p>How does this observed change in α-tubulin status relate to cancer phenotype? It is hard to reconcile the observations that PARP7 depletion stabilizes microtubule structure with the decreased cell growth, migration, and invasion observed upon PARP7 knockdown. Is the ability to quickly polymerize and assemble microtubules important for efficient cell growth and migration in cancer cells? If so, it might indicate that the observed phenotype in this cell line is not dependent upon PARP7 ADP-ribosylation of α-tubulin, and may be partially hampered by it. Providing in the text a more thorough exposition of the consequences of α-tubulin dynamics and dysregulation in ovarian cancer may help resolve this apparent contradiction, especially for readers not familiar with the field.</p><p>Lastly, without identifying α-tubulin residues that are MARylated by PARP7 and showing that their mutation has an impact on miroctubule stability, the authors cannot claim, at this stage, a direct link between PARP7 and microtubules. Therefore, the authors may need to limit their claims in the Title, Abstract and Discussion.</p><p>2) Is the observed effect due to PARP7 catalytic activity? Although PARP7 knockdown resulted in less MARylation on α-tubulin, it is unclear whether the effect is direct or indirect. Can the author rescue the ADP-ribosylation of α-tubulin by wild-type PARP7 but not catalytically inactive PARP7 in the PARP7 knockdown cells? Would the effects identified in α-tubulin be reproducible using the PARP7-specific inhibitor such as RBN-2397? Would the inhibitor reduce proliferation in ovarian cancer cells through cell growth and motility?</p><p>3) PARP7 expression in ovarian cancer cell and oncogenesis: Figure 1 legend states that expression levels across tissues were normalized under B) but not A). Could the authors describe how the data were normalized under B) and could they also show normalized data under A). Would the use of GEPIA as mentioned in the Materials and methods be sufficient in this normalization? Do the authors have data to support the case? TPMs presume that the total RNA content between the tissues is the same. This is, however, often not the case. Therefore, it would be good to normalize the data using housekeeping genes. The following article provides a list of genes that have been found to have stable expression over human tissues: https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/pdf/S0168-9525(13)00089-9.pdf</p><p>Gene expression levels in an ovarian cancer cell line such as OVCAR4 can be very different compared to ovarian cancer tissue. Therefore, PARP7 expression levels should be compared between non-ovarian versus ovarian cells and ovarian normal vs ovarian cancer cells. As mentioned in the Discussion, it is puzzling how PARP7 expression levels are reduced in ovarian cancer tissue, which would suggest a tumor suppressor role for PARP7, and yet PARP7 silencing reduces proliferation and migration properties of OVCAR4 cells as reported in this manuscript, suggesting that it acts as an oncogene. This conundrum could be due to different PARP7 expression levels in ovarian tissue versus ovarian cell lines or specifically the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR4 used in this study. One issue with the current analysis is that the authors are not comparing PARP7 expression in normal vs ovarian cancer cells. Instead they are comparing tissues, which consists of different cell types (stromal cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, etc.). In this case, the authors may want to check the expression of PARP7 in individual ovarian cell types from single cell data:</p><p>Healthy: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7052271/</p><p>Ovarian cancer: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0926-0</p><p>If properly analyzed, these data should elucidate how PARP7 behaves during carcinogenesis.</p><p>4) Would the observed effect be restricted to OVCAR4 (e.g., α-tubulin effects and reduction proliferation due to PARP7 knockdown)? The reported PARP7-dependent ADPr of α-tubulin, and its role as mediator of microtubule dynamics in ovarian cancer cells is intriguing, but it is not clear if this role is specific for ovarian cancer cell lines or a general property of PARP7-expressing cells. For successful translation of these results into a clinically-relevant settings, an important step is to clarify this point by comparing the α-tubulin behaviour of OVCAR4 cell line to that of other cell lines. Similarly, the authors show that cell growth of OVCAR4 with PARP7 knockdown is impaired compared to WT, but how does PARP7 knockdown affect other highly-proliferative cell lines?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60481.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Extend the mechanistic insights on PARP7 and microtubules: &quot;PARP-7 mediated microtubule control may play a role in the regulation of cancer cell growth and motility&quot; This statement is premature without further experimental data.

We have added new data showing that recovery from tubulin sensitizing treatments, such as nocodazole or cold, leads to enhanced expression of PARP-7 and increased MARylation of ⍺-tubulin (new Figure 7D). Together with our previous observation that PARP-7 regulates ⍺-tubulin MARylation, our results identify a novel regulatory pathway of ⍺-tubulin dynamics in which PARP-7 upregulation enhances ⍺-tubulin MARylation when the cells recover from tubulin stressors.</p><p>More specifically, to address the reviewer’s concern, we added new experiments examining the ADPRylation of α-tubulin and microtubule stability under an additional set of conditions:</p><p>1) α-tubulin MARylation under basal conditions and after nocodazole or cold treatment (new Figure 7D).

As the reviewers noted, at face value, our results suggest that enhanced microtubule stability upon depletion of PARP-7 or loss of its catalytic activity has negative consequences for cancer phenotypes (i.e., it’s bad for the cancer cells). This suggests that in ovarian cancer cells, PARP-7 acts to MARylate α-tubulin to destabilize microtubules. How does this help cancer cells?</p><p>One possibility, as the reviewer suggested, is that the ability to quickly depolymerize and disassemble microtubules is important for efficient cell growth and migration. Indeed, there is evidence for this in the literature. In fact, there is a class of anticancer drugs that stabilize microtubules (e.g., taxanes), leading to the arrest of proliferation and mitosis. Moreover, previous studies have shown that well characterized tumor suppressors such as RASSF1A and APC act to stabilize microtubule polymerization (PMIDs: 14603253 and 11237529). We have now addressed more clearly the implications of our results for cancer biology and therapeutics in the Discussion.</p><p>As described in our response below, our new results with an α-tubulin MARylation site mutant do indeed indicate that the observed phenotype is dependent upon PARP-7 MARylation of α-tubulin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, without identifying α-tubulin residues that are MARylated by PARP7 and showing that their mutation has an impact on miroctubule stability, the authors cannot claim, at this stage, a direct link between PARP7 and microtubules.

To strengthen our conclusions, we have identified the sites of PARP-7-dependent MARylation on α-tubulin, mutated them, and performed functional analyses with the mutant (new Figure 7E-G). Our analysis identified three sites of MARylation: D69, E71, E77. We mutated each of the residues to similar, but non-modifiable residues (D à N and E à Q), generated expression vectors, and expressed the wild-type or mutant versions of α-tubulin in OVCAR4 cells. Mutation of these sites inhibited MARylation of α-tubulin (Figure 7E). Importantly, expression of the α-tubulin MARylation site mutant phenocopied <italic>PARP7</italic> knockdown (Figure 7C) and expression of a catalytically dead PARP-7 mutant (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2B) in the microtubule stability assay (new Figure 7F and G). These results show that MARylation of α-tubulin is required for the observed effects of PARP-7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is the observed effect due to PARP7 catalytic activity?

Would the inhibitor reduce proliferation in ovarian cancer cells through cell growth and motility?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We performed additional experiments to test whether PARP-7 catalytic activity is required for the observed phenotype. We used a catalytically dead PARP-7 mutant (Y564A) suggested by the reviewer (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2). We expressed the mutant from an Flag-tagged mouse <italic>Parp7</italic> cDNA to produce an shRNA-resistant mRNA that could be used in knockdown-addback experiments (the <italic>PARP7</italic> shRNAs that we used were designed against the human <italic>PARP7</italic> mRNA). Expression of the catalytically dead PARP-7 mutant resulted in a loss of α-tubulin MARylation (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2A). In addition, expression of the catalytically dead PARP-7 mutant phenocopied <italic>PARP7</italic> knockdown and expression of the α-tubulin ADPRylation site mutant in the microtubule stability assay (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2B) and the cell migration assay (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2C and D) (i.e., it was impaired versus wild-type PARP-7 in both cases). These results show that PARP-7 catalytic activity is required for the observed effects of PARP-7. We preferred this approach to the use of a chemical inhibitor of PARP-7, such as RBN2397, to eliminate potential off target effects and uncertainty of proper dosing in OVCAR4 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) PARP7 expression in ovarian cancer cell and oncogenesis: Figure 1 legend states that expression levels across tissues were normalized under B) but not A).

First, we have edited the text to remove the impression that the analysis in Figure 1A was not normalized; this is not true. The GTEx data in Figure 1A were obtained from the GTEx portal and used as normalized TPM scores as described by Li et al., 2010. We have clarified this in the text. Second, we normalized the GTEx data in Figure 1A to 50 housekeeping genes, as suggested by the reviewer (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). This normalization did not fundamentally change the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gene expression levels in an ovarian cancer cell line such as OVCAR4 can be very different compared to ovarian cancer tissue.

Our new analyses, as well as additional information about the origins of ovarian cancer from the literature, suggest that the mixed cell populations in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues are a complicating factor when analyzing and comparing <italic>PARP7</italic> expression. We used the scRNA-seq data suggested by the reviewer to analyze <italic>PARP7</italic> expression in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues at the single-cell level (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). We observed that the identifiable cell types in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues are quite different. The main cell types identifiable as “ovarian” in normal ovary (oocyte, granulosa, stroma) are not well represented in ovarian cancer. Thus, as the reviewer noted, it is difficult to compare <italic>PARP7</italic> expression in the two tissues. By these metrics, <italic>PARP7</italic> expression in the “ovarian” cell types varies quite a bit, and may actually be lower on average than in the “malignant” ovarian cancer cell types (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). In this regard, <italic>PARP7</italic> gene gain and amplification is a common feature of ovarian cancers (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>Furthermore, when contemplating these results, we were drawn to a growing body of work indicating that ovarian cancers may actually arise from cells in the Fallopian tubes. Thus, attempts to compare <italic>PARP7</italic> expression in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues may be like comparing apples and oranges: (1) the cellular origins of the tissues are different and (2) the cellular compositions are different. Thus, while the results presented in Figure 1B are correct, the require some context and qualification. We have now provided this through (1) new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B, (2) presentation of these data in the appropriate section of the Results, and (3) discussion of the results in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Would the observed effect be restricted to OVCAR4 (e.g., α-tubulin effects and reduction proliferation due to PARP7 knockdown)?

In all three cell lines and all three assays, <italic>PARP7</italic> knockdown caused an inhibition of the cancer-related phenotypes (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-L) and microtubule dynamics (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1A-C) similar to what we observed in OVCAR4 cells. Thus, the observed effects of PARP-7 on cancer-related endpoints are not restricted to OVCAR4 cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
