progenitor cells (INPs) need to avoid differentiation and cell cycle exit while maintaining restricted developmental potential, but mechanisms preventing differentiation and cell cycle exit of INPs are not well understood. In this study, we report that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of mammalian Sp8 transcription factor Buttonhead (Btd) prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of INPs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval type II neuroblast (NB) lineages. We show that the loss of Btd leads to elimination of mature INPs due to premature differentiation of INPs into terminally dividing ganglion mother cells. We provide evidence to demonstrate that Btd prevents the premature differentiation by suppressing the expression of the homeodomain protein Prospero in immature INPs. We further show that Btd functions cooperatively with the Ets transcription factor Pointed P1 to promote the generation of INPs. Thus, our work reveals a critical mechanism that prevents premature differentiation and cell cycle exit of <italic>Drosophila</italic> INPs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03596.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03596.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03596.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Whereas the majority of cells in the brain are unable to divide to produce new cells, neural stem cells can divide numerous times and have the potential to become many different types of brain cells.

Transient amplification of INPs dramatically boosts the neural output from neural stem cells (NSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>). Recent studies in developing human brains as well as other mammalian brains suggest that an expansion of the number of transiently amplifying INPs, the outer sub-ventricular zone radial glia-like cells (oRGs), likely contributes to the increased cortical size and complexity in humans and other gyrencephalic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fietz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, accumulating body of evidence suggests that brain tumors could originate from dedifferentiation and unrestricted proliferation of INPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Persson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zong et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is fundamentally important to understand how the generation and proliferation of INPs are regulated.</p><p>The recently discovered type II neuroblasts (NBs, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NSCs) in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brains provide an excellent model system for studying mechanisms regulating the generation and proliferation of INPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). There are 8 type II NBs in each brain lobe. Like mammalian NSCs, <italic>Drosophila</italic> type II NBs produce neurons and glia indirectly by generating INPs. Individual INPs undergo 4–6 rounds of asymmetric divisions to produce a new INP to self-renew and a ganglion mother cell (GMC), which divides terminally to produce neurons and/or glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayraktar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Viktorin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, individual INPs produce distinct types of neurons by sequentially expressing a set of distinct transcription factors to specify the identity of their progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Through self-renewing divisions, INPs not only amplify the number but also increase the diversity of neural progeny generated from type II NBs. Therefore, the neurogenesis pattern in type II NB lineages is remarkably similar to that in mammalian brains and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> INPs are functionally analogous to mammalian INPs, particularly oRGs.</p><p>The generation of INPs in type II NB lineages involves multiple steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). Newly generated INPs are immature and do not express any NB markers, such as the proneural protein Asense (Ase) or the bHLH protein Deadpan (Dpn), except for Miranda (Mira). The Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs first turn on the expression of Ase to become Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs. Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs then further differentiate to become mature INPs, which express both Ase and Dpn. INPs do not divide until they are fully mature. The maturation of INPs requires Numb, the NHL family protein Brain tumor (Brat), the transcription factor Earmuff (Erm), as well as the BAP and Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) chromatin remodeling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eroglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koe et al., 2014</xref>). Both Numb and Brat are segregated into Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs during the division of type II NBs to prevent them from dedifferentiating into NB fate, but they function through independent pathways. Numb inhibits Notch activity in Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs, whereas Brat likely antagonizes the activity of the EGR family transcription factor Klumpfuss (Klu) and Armadillo/β-Catenin in Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Komori et al., 2014</xref>). Erm functions together with BAP and HDAC3 chromatin remodeling complexes after Brat and Numb to further restrict the developmental potential of INPs by attenuating the response of INPs to self-renewal factors such as Klu and Dpn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koe et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the BAP chromatin remodeling complex limits the self-renewal of INPs by activating the expression of Prdm protein Hamlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eroglu et al., 2014</xref>). In the absence of Numb, Brat, Erm, or chromatin remodeling complexes, INPs dedifferentiate into type II NBs and initiate tumorigenic overproliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eroglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koe et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, these proteins are critical to prevent dedifferentiation of INPs.</p><p>However, despite the significant progress on elucidating mechanisms that promote maturation and prevent dedifferentiation of INPs in the past few years, much less is known about why only type II NBs produce self-renewing INPs but not the type I NBs, which produce neurons by generating terminally dividing GMCs. One major difference between INPs and GMCs is that INPs divide to self-renew whereas GMCs divide terminally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, in addition to avoiding dedifferentiation and unrestricted tumorigenic overproliferation, INPs need to overcome another challenge–to avoid over-differentiation and cell cycle exit–in order to maintain their progenitor state and self-renewal while they differentiate to mature and undergo self-renewing divisions. Type II NBs and newly born Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs differ from type I NBs and GMCs by the lack of the expression of Ase and the homeodomain protein Prospero (Pros) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). In type I NB lineages, Pros is expressed in the cytoplasm in the NBs and translocates to the nucleus in GMCs to promote differentiation and cell cycle exit by inhibiting NB self-renewing genes and activating neural differentiation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Vaessin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>). In type II NB lineages, Pros is not expressed in the NB or Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs. In Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs and mature INPs, Pros is expressed at low levels in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the lack of Ase and Pros in type II NBs and Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs is essential for the generation of self-renewing INPs in type II NB lineages. Forced expression of Ase or Pros in type II NBs and their progeny is sufficient to eliminate INPs although removing Ase or Pros in type I NBs does not change the identity of type I NBs or induce the generation of INPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayraktar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Our recent studies demonstrated that the Ets family transcription factor Pointed P1 (PntP1) suppresses Ase in type II NBs and is required for the generation of INPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). However, mechanisms that prevent premature differentiation of INPs and/or inhibit Pros expression in type II NBs and immature INPs are not known.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the role of the Sp family transcription factor Buttonhead (Btd) in type II NB lineage development. Btd is a homolog of mammalian Sp8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Treichel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Estella and Mann, 2010</xref>). In developing mammalian brains, Sp8 is expressed in neural progenitor cells to regulate forebrain patterning and interneuron development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Griesel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Waclaw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sahara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, Btd is required for the formation of specific head segments and NB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wimmer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Younossi-Hartenstein et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, Sp8/Btd also promotes the growth of limbs and other appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Estella et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Treichel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawakami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Estella and Mann, 2010</xref>). In this study, we report that Btd is expressed in type II NB lineages to prevent premature differentiation of INPs into GMCs by suppressing Pros expression in immature INPs. We also demonstrate that PntP1 and Btd function cooperatively to specify type II NB lineages and promote the generation of INPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of Btd results in a complete elimination of mature INPs in type II NB lineages</title><p>Our recent studies demonstrated that the Ets family transcription factor PntP1 is specifically expressed in type II NB lineages to promote the generation of INPs. However, although forced expression of PntP1 suppress Ase expression in nearly all type I NB lineages, it induces the generation of INP-like cells only in a subset of type I NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that other protein(s) may function together with PntP1 to specify type II NB lineages and promote the generation of INPs. A recent functional genomic study showed that in addition to PntP1, there are other nine genes that are highly expressed in brain tumors derived from type II NB lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carney et al., 2012</xref>). We wondered whether any of these genes could function together with PntP1 to promote INP generation. To test this idea, we first examined how knockdown of these genes would affect INP generation in type II NB lineages. A normal type II NB lineage contains 2–3 Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs, 2–3 Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INP, and about 20–30 (26.9 ± 4.1, mean ± SD) Ase<sup>+</sup> Dpn<sup>+</sup> mature INPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A′,C–C′,G</xref>). Interestingly, RNAi knockdown of Btd using the type II NB lineage-specific <italic>pntP1-GAL4</italic> (named as <italic>GAL4</italic><sup><italic>14−94</italic></sup> previously) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>) as a driver led to a complete elimination of mature INPs in about 50% of type II NB lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–B′,G–H</xref>). Instead, only a few (3.7 ± 1.2) Ase<sup>+</sup> Dpn<sup>−</sup> cells were observed next to the Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–B′</xref>). However, type II NBs remain Ase<sup>−</sup> as normal type II NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–B′</xref>), suggesting that the identity of the type II NBs was not affected by Btd RNAi knockdown.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03596.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of Btd eliminates mature INPs in type II NB lineages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>A′</bold>, <bold>C</bold>–<bold>C′</bold>) Wild-type type II NB lineages in a third instar larval brain. mCD8-GFP driven by pntP1-GAL4 labels all type II NB lineages (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>A′</bold>) or a single type II NB clone (<bold>C</bold>–<bold>C′</bold>).

When mature INPs are eliminated in the absence of Btd, the type II NBs without the ectopic Ase expression still produce Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs and a few Ase<sup>+</sup> Dpn<sup>−</sup> daughter cells. In normal type II NB lineages, Ase<sup>+</sup> Dpn<sup>−</sup> cells can be either Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs or GMCs. Therefore, three possible scenarios could happen when mature INPs are eliminated in the absence of Btd: 1) Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs differentiate into GMCs instead of Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs; 2) Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs differentiate into Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs, which then directly differentiate into neurons/glia without further dividing; 3) Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs differentiate into Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs, which in turn differentiate into terminally dividing GMCs. To distinguish these possibilities, we first wanted to determine if Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs still differentiate into Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INP in the absence of Btd by examining the expression of INP specific marker R9D11<italic>-</italic>CD4<italic>-tdTomato</italic> and progenitor marker Miranda (Mira) in the Ase<sup>+</sup> cells next to the Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs<italic>.</italic> R9D11<italic>-</italic>CD4<italic>-tdTomato</italic> utilizes a DNA fragment R9D11 from the <italic>erm</italic> promoter to drive the expression of CD4-tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2011</xref>). In normal type II NB lineages, R9D11<italic>-</italic>CD4<italic>-tdTomato</italic> is first turned on in Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs and becomes stronger as INPs mature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–A′</xref>), which is similar to R9D11<italic>-mCD8-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Mira is expressed in all NBs as well as INPs but not (or very weakly) in GMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—–figure supplement 1</xref>). In Btd RNAi knockdown type II NB lineages without mature INPs, we found that R9D11<italic>-</italic>CD4<italic>-tdTomato</italic> was expressed in Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells next to the Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs but its overall expression was much weaker than that in normal type II NB lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–B′,I</xref>).

GMCs express both Ase and nuclear Pros and divide terminally but do not form a Mira crescent while dividing. If Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs directly differentiate into neurons/glia, then all the Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells should be Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs and none of them should be dividing. In contrast, if Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs differentiate into GMCs, then some Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells will become mitotically active and express nuclear Pros but will not form a Mira crescent at the metaphase or telophase. Immunostaining with the mitotic marker phospho-histone 3 (pH3) showed that unlike Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs, which never become pH3-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–C′</xref>), some Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells generated in both Btd RNAi knockdown type II NB lineages without mature INPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–D′</xref>) and <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NB lineages became mitotically active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–E′</xref>). However, the pH3 positive cells were always the furthest from the Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs among the Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–D′</xref>), suggesting that the Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells divide terminally like GMCs. Consistently, unlike in mature INPs, which form a Mira crescent at metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we did not observe any Mira crescents in the Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells at metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The terminal division and the lack of the Mira crescent strongly argue that Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs differentiate into GMCs in the absence of Btd.</p><p>To further confirm that late immature INPs differentiate into GMCs in the absence of Btd, we then examined the expression of nuclear Pros in the Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells. Nuclear Pros is a cell fate determinant of GMCs. In normal type II NBs lineages, Pros is expressed in the cytoplasm of Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs and mature INPs and in the nucleus of GMCs and post-mitotic neurons, but not in type II NBs or Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–F′</xref>). If Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs differentiate into GMCs in the absence of Btd, we expected that some of the Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells express nuclear Pros. Interestingly, immunostaining of Pros showed that nuclear Pros was expressed not only in all Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells but also in Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs generated in Btd RNAi knockdown or <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NB lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H′</xref>). Given that Pros promotes cell cycle exit and GMC differentiation and that forced expression of Pros is sufficient to eliminate INPs in type II NB lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Vaessin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayraktar et al., 2010</xref>), the ectopic expression of nuclear Pros in immature INPs resulting from the loss of Btd very likely promotes the premature differentiation of Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs into GMCs and cell cycle exit, leading to the loss of mature INPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These results also reveal that it is Btd that is responsible for the suppression of Pros in immature INPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Reducing Pros expression rescues the elimination of mature INPs resulting from the loss of Btd</title><p>To determine if the ectopic expression of nuclear Pros in immature INPs is indeed responsible for the elimination of mature INPs in the absence of Btd, we next examined if reducing Pros expression was able to rescue the elimination of INPs in Btd RNAi knockdown or <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NB lineages.

Since Btd is expressed in much more type I NB lineages in VNCs than in larval brains and Btd is required to prevent the premature differentiation of INPs, we wondered if ectopic PntP1-induced generation of INP-like cells requires Btd activity and occurs mostly in Btd-positive type I NB lineages. To test this idea, we examined if co-expression of PntP1 and Btd in type I NB lineages was sufficient to induce the generation of INPs and if the ectopic PntP1-induced generation of INP-like cells would be impaired in the absence of Btd.</p><p>To coexpress PntP1 and Btd in type I NB lineages, we used either <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> to drive the expression of <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> in Btd-positive type I NB lineages or <italic>insc-GAL4</italic> to drive the expression of <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> and <italic>UAS-btd</italic> simultaneously in all type I NB lineages. INP-like cells were identified by their expression of Ase and Dpn as well as INP-specific marker R9D11<italic>-</italic>CD4<italic>-tdTomato</italic>. Since the <italic>GAL4</italic> insertion in the <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> line causes a lethal mutation in <italic>btd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Estella et al., 2003</xref>), we examined the phenotype of the expression of <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> driven by <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> only in <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> heterozygous female larvae. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–A′</xref>, type II NB lineages in <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> heterozygous mutant larvae are indistinguishable from those in wild-type animals (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A′</xref>). Furthermore, as mentioned above, <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> homozygous mutant type II NB clones develop normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the generation of INPs is not affected in the <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> line. Interestingly, ectopic expression of PntP1 using <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> as a driver induced the generation of INP-like cells in about 90% Btd-positive type I NB lineages in both larval brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C′,J</xref>) and VNCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistently, the co-expression of <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> and <italic>UAS-btd</italic> driven by <italic>insc-GAL4</italic> induced INP-like cells in about 95% of type I NB lineages in both larval brains and VNCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–F′,I–I′,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The expression of <italic>UAS-btd</italic> alone neither suppressed Ase nor induced the generation of INP-like cells in VNCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereas in larval brains, the expression of <italic>UAS-btd</italic> driven by <italic>insc-GAL4</italic> suppressed/reduced the expression of Ase in the NB and promoted the generation of INP-like cells in about 20% of type I NB lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–G′,J</xref>). These ectopic INP-like cells induced by the expression of <italic>UAS-btd</italic> also expressed INP-specific marker R9D11<italic>-</italic>CD4<italic>-tdTomato</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate that the generation of INP-like cells induced by the ectopic PntP1 expression requires Btd activity, whereas the expression of either PntP1 or Btd alone has limited ability to induce the generation of INP-like cells in type I NB lineages.</p><p>To further confirm if Btd is required for ectopic PntP1 to induce the generation of INP-like cells, we then examined if the generation of INP-like cells induced by ectopic PntP1 expression would be impaired in the absence of Btd. To this end, we expressed <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> in wild-type or <italic>btd</italic> mutant type I NB clones in VNCs in that there are more Btd-positive type I NB lineages and the expression of <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> can induce INP-like cells in much more type I NB lineages in VNCs than in larval brains. Consistent with the induction of INP-like cells in nearly all type I NB lineages when PntP1 and Btd were coexpressed, the efficiency of PntP1 to induce the generation of INP-like cell was drastically reduced in the absence of Btd. Our results showed that the expression of <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> driven by <italic>tub-GAL4</italic> could have induced the generation of INP-like cells in about 50% of wild-type type I NB clones but not in <italic>btd</italic> mutant type I NB clones, although the expression of PntP1 equally suppressed the expression of Ase in both wild-type and <italic>btd</italic> mutant type I NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E′,J</xref>). These results provide additional evidence to support that only in the presence of Btd could PntP1 induce the generation of INP-like cells in type I NB lineages.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the generation of INPs requires the cooperative action of PntP1 and Btd. Thus this study together with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>) identified two key factors, PntP1 and Btd, a combination of which is sufficient to specify type II NB lineages and promote INP generation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that the Sp family transcription factor Btd is required to prevent the premature differentiation of INPs by suppressing the expression of Pros in immature INPs.

Thus, our work reveals a critical mechanism that regulates INP generation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Btd prevents premature differentiation of INPs into GMCs</title><p>The most striking phenotype resulting from the loss of Btd is the elimination of mature INPs. In addition, about 40% of <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NB lineages ectopically express Ase in the NB and become type I-like NB lineages. However, although forced expression of Ase in type II NBs is sufficient to eliminate INPs in type II NB lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>), the loss of INPs is obviously not primarily due to the ectopic Ase expression or the transformation of type II NB lineages into type I-like NB lineage in that the loss of mature INPs occurs independently of the ectopic Ase expression in most <italic>btd</italic> mutant or Btd RNAi knockdown type II NB lineages. Instead, we demonstrate that the loss of mature INPs in the absence of Btd is due to the premature differentiation of Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs into GMCs. We show that in Btd RNAi knockdown or <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NB lineages without the ectopic Ase expression, Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs differentiate into Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs normally as indicated by the expression of R9D11-mCD8-GFP, Mira, as well as PntP1 in Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells next to the Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs. However, instead of differentiating into mature INPs, we argue that Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs prematurely differentiate into GMCs based on the following two pieces of evidence. First, Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells eventually undergo terminal divisions as indicated by the positive pH3 staining and the position of the pH3-positive cells. Second, unlike mature INPs, the dividing Ase<sup>+</sup> daughter cells do not form basal Mira crescent at metaphase. The terminal division and the lack of Mira crescent during the division are two unique features that distinguish GMCs from INPs in addition to the expression of nuclear Pros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikeshima-Kataoka et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsuzaki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schuldt et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, the elimination of mature INPs resulting from the loss of Btd is due to the premature differentiation of Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs into GMCs.</p><p>Why does the loss of Btd lead to premature differentiation of INPs? Our results show that the loss of Btd results in a reduction or loss of PntP1 in type II NBs and immature INPs as well as ectopic expression of Pros in early immature INPs. Our previous studies show that PntP1 suppresses Ase in type II NBs and that inhibiting PntP1 activity leads to ectopic expression of Ase in type II NBs and elimination of INPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). Given that the ectopic Ase expression in <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NBs is closely associated with the severe reduction or complete loss of PntP1 and that expression of <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> largely suppresses the ectopic Ase expression in <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NBs, the severe reduction or loss of PntP1 most likely accounts for the ectopic Ase expression in <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NBs. However, although the loss of PntP1 could lead to the loss of INPs, we provide several lines of evidence to demonstrate that the elimination of INPs in <italic>btd</italic> mutant or Btd RNAi knockdown type II NB lineages is primarily due to the ectopic activation of Pros in immature INPs rather than the reduction or loss of PntP1. First, ectopic nuclear Pros is consistently expressed in Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs when mature INPs are eliminated. Second, the loss of mature INPs can be fully rescued by Pros RNAi knockdown or even just by removing one wild-type copy of <italic>pros</italic>. Third, Pros RNAi knockdown also rescues the reduction of PntP1 and suppresses the ectopic Ase expression in <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NBs. In contrast, the expression of <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> fails to rescue mature INPs in most <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NB lineages although it largely suppresses the ectopic Ase expression in the NBs. Furthermore, the complete elimination of mature INPs is also observed occasionally in <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NB lineages without the reduction of PntP1. Therefore, the elimination of mature INPs resulting from the loss of Btd is primarily due to the ectopic Pros expression, which likely promotes premature differentiation of INPs into GMCs and cell cycle exit. The severe reduction or loss of PntP1 is responsible for the ectopic Ase expression in <italic>btd</italic> mutant type II NBs and is more likely a secondary effect due to the ectopic Pros expression and/or the loss of INPs. INPs and/or other progeny may provide feedback signals to the NBs as has been demonstrated in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The ectopic expression of Pros in Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs resulting from the loss of Btd suggests that Btd is critical for suppressing Pros expression in Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs. Btd was known as a head gap gene. It has been suggested that gap factors act largely as transcriptional repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schroeder et al., 2004</xref>). Btd could directly suppress Pros by binding to the <italic>pros</italic> promoter as a transcriptional repressor. Alternatively, Btd could suppress Pros indirectly by regulating the expression or antagonizing the activity of factor(s) that activate(s) <italic>pros</italic> expression. Our results show that ectopic/overly expression of Btd in type I NB lineages or mature INPs does not lead to overproliferation of type I NBs as observed in <italic>pros</italic> mutant type I NB lineages. Instead, ectopic expression of Btd promotes the generation of INP-like cells from type I NBs and transforms some type I NB lineages into type II-like NB lineages. Therefore, it is more likely that Btd suppresses Pros indirectly by regulating the expression or antagonizing the activity of <italic>pros</italic> activator(s). Previous studies have suggested that Ase, Daughterless, Numb, and Erm could activate <italic>pros</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reddy and Rodrigues, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Southall and Brand, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yasugi et al., 2014</xref>). Since Ase and R9D11-Cd4-tdTomato, which are under the control of <italic>erm</italic> promoter, are not expressed in Ase<sup>−</sup> immature INPs in the absence of Btd, it is unlikely that they are involved in the activation of <italic>pros</italic> in immature INPs. It would be interesting to investigate in the future if Numb or Daughterless could activate <italic>pros</italic> in immature INPs in the absence of Btd.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Btd and PntP1 function cooperatively to promote the generation of INPs</title><p>In this study, we provided several lines of evidence to demonstrate that Btd and PntP1 function cooperatively to specify type II NB lineages and promote the generation of INPs. Results from this study as well as our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>) show that ectopic expression of <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> or <italic>UAS-btd</italic> alone can only promote the generation of INP-like cells in a subset of type I NB lineage, whereas ectopic expression of <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> in Btd-positive type I NB lineages or co-expression of <italic>UAS-btd</italic> and <italic>UAS-pntP1</italic> can promote the generation of INP-like cells in nearly all type I NB lineages and transforms all these lineages into type II-like NB lineages. Consistently, the ability of PntP1 to promote the generation of INP-like cells in <italic>btd</italic> mutant type I NB lineages is largely impaired. These results suggest that the specification of type II NB lineages and the generation of INPs requires both PntP1 and Btd and that the combinatorial PntP1 and Btd is sufficient to promote the generation of INPs.</p><p>We propose that PntP1 and Btd function cooperatively but through different mechanisms to promote INP generation. PntP1 is responsible for the suppression of Ase in type II NBs. Meanwhile, PntP1 must be regulating the expression of other unknown target gene(s) that are/is essential for the generation of INPs, such as specification of immature INPs, because loss of Ase is not sufficient to promote the generation of INP-like cells in any type I NB lineages. Btd likely acts after PntP1 to mainly prevent premature differentiation of INPs into GMCs by indirectly suppressing <italic>pros</italic> in immature INPs. The role of Btd in suppressing Ase in type II NBs is minimal if there is any because unlike PntP1, which suppresses <italic>ase</italic> in nearly all type I NBs when it is ectopically expressed, overexpression of Btd only suppresses Ase in a small subset of type I NBs that produce INP-like cells in larval brains. Furthermore, Ase is expressed in Btd<sup>+</sup> type I NBs, indicating that Btd does not suppress Ase in type I NBs when it is expressed at normal levels. Studies in mammals as well as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that the Btd/Sp8 could function downstream of Wnt signaling to regulate the expression of Fgf8 as well as Distal-less (Dll) and Headcase (Hdc) during the forebrain patterning as well as limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Estella et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Treichel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawakami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sahara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Estella and Mann, 2010</xref>). However, inhibiting Wnt signaling alone in type II NB lineages does not have any obvious phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Komori et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that Btd unlikely functions downstream of Wnt signaling in type II NB lineages. Whether Fgf8, Dll, or Hdc could function downstream of Btd to regulate INP generation remains to be investigated in the future.</p><p>In mammals, the Btd homolog Sp8 plays important roles in brain development. In the developing mouse forebrain, Sp8 is expressed in cortical progenitors in a mediolateral gradient across the ventricular zone as well as in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) and medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sahara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zembrzycki et al., 2007</xref>). In developing human brains, Sp8 is abundantly expressed in the ventricular zone and the outer sub-ventricular zone where RGs and oRGs reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to its roles in interneuron development and the patterning of developing mammalian brains and spinal cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Griesel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Waclaw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sahara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2011</xref>), it was also shown that the loss of Sp8 led to the reduction of the progenitor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zembrzycki et al., 2007</xref>). Our results show that mammalian Sp8 can rescue the loss of mature INPs resulting from the loss of Btd in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting that Btd/Sp8 could have conserved functions across different species. It would be interesting to investigate if Sp8 has similar roles in promoting the generation of transient amplifying INPs, such as oRGs, in developing mammalian brains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>For <italic>btd</italic> loss-of-function analyses, <italic>yw btd</italic><sup><italic>XA</italic></sup> <italic>FRT19A/FM7c</italic> and <italic>yw btd</italic><sup><italic>XG81</italic></sup> <italic>FRT19A/FM7c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wimmer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Estella and Mann, 2010</xref>) were used for generating <italic>btd</italic> mutant clones and <italic>UAS-btd RNAi</italic> (#29453; Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> stock Center, Bloomington, Indiana) for Btd RNAi knockdown<italic>.</italic> Type II NB lineage-specific <italic>pntP1-GAL4</italic> (also named as <italic>GAL4</italic><sup><italic>14−94</italic></sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>erm-GAL4</italic> (II) or (III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>) were used to drive the expression of <italic>UAS-transgenes</italic> in type II NB lineages or in immature as well as mature INPs, respectively. <italic>insc-Gal4</italic> (<italic>Gal4</italic><sup><italic>1407</italic></sup> inserted in <italic>inscuteable</italic> promoter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 1994</xref>) was used to drive <italic>UAS-transgenes</italic> in all NB lineages. <italic>UAS-mCD8-GFP</italic> driven by <italic>Btd-GAL4</italic> was utilized as reporter for <italic>btd</italic> expression<italic>.</italic> The R9D11<italic>-</italic>CD4<italic>-tdTomato</italic> transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2011</xref>) was used for labeling Ase<sup>+</sup> immature INPs and mature INPs<italic>.</italic> Other fly stocks include: <italic>hs-Flpase tub-GAL80 FRT19A; UAS-mCD8-GFP; pntP1-GAL4</italic> for generating type II NB clones; <italic>pros</italic><sup><italic>17</italic></sup><italic>/TM6 Tb, pros</italic><sup><italic>10419</italic></sup><italic>/</italic>Tm3 <italic>Sb,</italic> and <italic>UAS-pros RNAi</italic> (#26745; Bloomington stock) for rescuing Btd loss-of-function phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RNAi knockdown and clonal analyses</title><p>For RNAi knockdown analyses of Btd and Pros, larvae were raised at 29°C to increase the expression of <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> transgenes after hatching.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor), and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages produce neural cells indirectly, by generating transiently amplifying Intermediate Neural Progenitors (INPs). INPs play a crucial role in mammalian brain development and understanding how they form and proliferate is therefore a central question in neurobiology. In a previous study, the authors have shown that the Ets transcription factor Pointed P1 (PntP1) is required for the specification of Type-II NB lineages in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brains. PntP1 suppresses Asense (As) expression in NBs, which promotes the formation of INPs. Here, Xie et al. show that the product of the button head gene (btd) works cooperatively with PntP1 to generate functional INPs.</p><p>They first show that btd is required for the maturation of INPs: In its absence, INPs are still generated but they undergo premature cell cycle exit and differentiate into Ganglion Mother Cells (GMCs). Xie et al. elegantly demonstrate that this phenotype is due to the ectopic expression of Prospero (Pros) in the nuclei of newly generated INPs. Thus, btd prevents premature differentiation of INPs by repressing early Pros expression. The authors then test whether the btd phenotype might be due to the loss of PntP1. They show that although PntP1 expression decreases in the NBs of btd mutant type-II lineages (leading to ectopic Ase expression in a subset of these NBs), this defect is not at the origin of the loss of mature INPs. It is instead a secondary effect of the ectopic expression of Pros. These results nicely confirm the key role played by btd in the formation of mature INPs. Finally, Xie et al. show that co-expressing btd with PntP1 in type-I NB lineages is sufficient to convert most of them into type-II NB lineages. The major finding reported is that the transcription factor encoding btd gene is required in INPs to prevent their premature differentiation, and that this occurs because btd suppresses the (nuclear) expression of the homeodomain protein Prospero in INP sublineages. These interesting data add to our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of the (limited) proliferative potential of INPs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural stem cell model. This paper is interesting, well written, and the data are convincing.</p><p>Major concerns that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Some of the data presented has been published previously and are not declared as such. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, A'</xref> in this paper correspond to that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, B'</xref> in previously published paper by the same senior author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>), with only artwork and magnification changed. The authors should check all figures carefully to ensure that this does not happen and not recycle the same data.</p><p>2) The authors should mention clearly that the use of btd-Gal4 to study Btd expression and drive transgenes might not faithfully reproduce the endogenous expression pattern of Btd. There are two reasons for this. First, enhancer-reporter constructs do not necessarily reflect endogenous protein expression. Moreover, if enhancer-reporter constructs do mimic endogenous expression in one tissue, this does not prove that the constructs mimic endogenous expression in other tissues.

We will also make sure that similar things do not happen again in the future.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should mention clearly that the use of btd-Gal4 to study Btd expression and drive transgenes might not faithfully reproduce the endogenous expression pattern of Btd. There are two reasons for this. First, enhancer-reporter constructs do not necessarily reflect endogenous protein expression. Moreover, if enhancer-reporter constructs do mimic endogenous expression in one tissue, this does not prove that the constructs mimic endogenous expression in other tissues. Clearly, immunolabelling or in situ hybridization would be preferable and should be added to the paper if an antibody is available. If this is not available, the authors should make sure that they explain that they have made all the controls to test whether the Gal4 line reproduces the expression pattern. In particular, the ability to rescue the loss of function phenotype with the human construct is a good argument that the Gal4 line is expressed in the right tissue. Rescue with the fly UAS construct should be added to confirm this.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that a GAL4 enhancer trap line like <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> does not always reflect endogenous expression patterns of the affected gene and it is essential to verify the <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> expression by immunostaining or <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. However, we tried to generate btd antibodies using two different approaches (using a synthesized peptide and GST-btd fusion proteins), but had no luck. We also tried very hard to detect <italic>btd</italic> mRNAs by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. We got very nice in situ hybridization signals in the larval optic lobe (which is consistent with the expression of <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> in the optic lobe) and ventral imaginal discs, but we were not able to detect strong signals in the central brain or in the ventral nerve cord. Therefore, in order to test whether the <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> line reproduces the endogenous expression pattern, we tried to rescue the loss of function phenotype of Btd with the expression of mouse Sp8 construct (sorry we did not have the human Sp8 construct) or fly btd construct driven by <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> as reviewers suggested. Ideally this rescue should be done in <italic>btd</italic> mutant clones. However, we were not able to do such rescue experiments for the following two reasons:</p><p>(A) Although the <italic>GAL4</italic> insertion in the <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> line causes a lethal mutation of <italic>btd</italic>, we did not observe any obvious phenotypes in <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> homozygous mutant type II NB clones, indicating that the <italic>GAL4</italic> insertion does not affect the expression of <italic>btd</italic> in type II NB lineages (please see the new figure: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>), which is possible given that the <italic>GAL4</italic> is inserted at 753bp upstream of the transcription start site of <italic>btd</italic> and the insertion of <italic>GAL4</italic> may not disrupt the enhancer elements that drive the expression of <italic>btd</italic> in type II NB lineages. The embryonic lethality of the <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> line could be due to the loss of Btd in other tissue or cells. Therefore, we could not do the rescue by using <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> to drive the expression of <italic>UAS-mSp8</italic> or <italic>UAS-btd</italic> in <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> homozygous mutant type II NB clones. In any event, we were able to rescue the lethality of <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> line by driving the expression of <italic>UAS-btd</italic> and type II NB lineages developed normally in those rescued <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> mutant larvae (data not shown, but we would be happy to provide images if needed).</p><p>(B) Since <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> is inserted in the promoter of <italic>btd</italic>, we could not do the rescue by using <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> to drive the expression of <italic>UAS-mSp8</italic> or <italic>UAS-btd</italic> in type II NB clones homozygous mutant for other <italic>btd</italic> mutant alleles, such as <italic>btd</italic><sup><italic>XG81</italic></sup>.</p><p>Therefore, in order to rescue the loss of function phenotype of Btd with the expression of mouse Sp8 or fly Btd driven by <italic>btd-GAL4</italic>, we tried to rescue the Btd RNAi knockdown phenotypes in type II NB lineages by the expression of <italic>UAS-mSp8</italic> or <italic>UAS-btd</italic> driven by <italic>btd-GAL4</italic>. In a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>), we showed that Btd RNAi knockdown driven by <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> completely eliminated mature INPs in nearly all type II NB lineages, which is much stronger than that of Btd RNAi knockdown driven by <italic>pntP1-GAL4</italic> (this could also indicate that the expression of <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> is likely more close to the endogenous expression pattern of Btd than <italic>pntP1-GAL4</italic> so that the knockdown of Btd driven by <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> is more efficient <italic>pntP1-GAL4</italic>, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the higher RNAi knockdown efficiency is due to the difference of the expression levels of <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> and <italic>pntP1-GAL4</italic>). This Btd RNAi knockdown phenotype could be fully rescued by the expression of <italic>UAS-mSp8</italic> driven by the same <italic>btd-GAL4</italic>. However, the expression of <italic>UAS-btd</italic> driven by <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> could only partially rescue the Btd RNAi knockdown phenotype. The incomplete rescue by <italic>UAS-btd</italic> is most likely because the <italic>UAS-btd</italic> construct contains the target sequence of <italic>UAS-btd RNAi</italic>. In any event, the rescue of the Btd RNAi knockdown phenotypes by the expression of <italic>UAS-mSP8</italic> and <italic>UAS-btd</italic> driven by <italic>btd-GAL4,</italic> together with strong <italic>btd</italic> mutant phenotypes in type II NB lineages (and the failure of PntP1 to induced INP-like cells in btd mutant type I NB lineages), strongly argue that <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> reflects the endogenous expression pattern of <italic>btd</italic>.</p><p><italic>3) Second, the btd-Gal4 construct used by the authors is an insertion in the</italic> btd <italic>gene that actually causes a mutation in the gene (Estella et al., 5929). This is not a serious issue since the authors always use it as heterozygous (the authors should confirm this in the text), but this fact should be explained and the authors should explain the controls that explain why this is not an issue</italic>.</p><p>Thanks for reviewers’ suggestions. We now mentioned in the text that the insertion of GAL4 transgene in the <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> enhancer trap line causes a lethal mutation of <italic>btd</italic> and we only used <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> heterozygous female larvae for phenotypic analyses. We also explained in the text that the generation of INPs are not affected in <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> heterozygous mutant type II NB lineages as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-A’</xref> or in <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> homozygous mutant type II NB clones as mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> heterozygous mutant background would not affect the generation of INP-like cells and thus it should not cause any problems when the <italic>btd-GAL4</italic> line was used for our research.</p><p><italic>4) In some quantifications, the authors have a sample size of n=3. They should quantify at least 6 or 7 samples for each experiment to further support their conclusions.</italic></p><p>We have increased the sample size as the reviewers suggested and did the statistical analyses again based on new sample sizes. We also indicated in the figure legends the samples sizes are the number of brain lobes or the number of type II or type I NB lineages/clones.</p></body></sub-article></article>
