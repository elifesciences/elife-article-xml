The rationale behind such evolutionary efforts is often poorly understood. Here, we provide atomic-resolution insights into how the dynamic building of a structurally complex enzyme with higher order symmetry offers amenability to intricate regulation. We have established the functional coupling between enzymatic activity and protein morphological states of glutamine synthetase (GS), an old multi-subunit enzyme essential for cellular nitrogen metabolism. Cryo-EM structure determination of GS in both the catalytically active and inactive assembly states allows us to reveal an unanticipated self-assembly-induced disorder-order transition paradigm, in which the remote interactions between two subcomplex entities significantly rigidify the otherwise structurally fluctuating active sites, thereby regulating activity. We further show in vivo evidences that how the enzyme morphology transitions could be modulated by cellular factors on demand. Collectively, our data present an example of how assembly status transition offers an avenue for activity modulation, and sharpens our mechanistic understanding of the complex functional and regulatory properties of supramolecular enzymes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>disorder-order transition</kwd><kwd>dihedral symmetry</kwd><kwd>supramolecular enzyme</kwd><kwd>glutamine synthetase</kwd><kwd>regulatory mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Chengdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31971144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Chengdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Tea Plant Biology and Utilization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SKLTOF20190102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Chengdong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project in Green Bio-production 2021YFC2100100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xing</surname><given-names>Qiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFD1000601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Research and Development (R&amp;D) Program of Anhui Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18030701155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanistic studies of glutamine synthetase reveals how the complex quaternary structure organizations of a supramolecular enzyme provides a platform necessary for intricate activity regulation machinery to take place.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent studies have evidenced that only a small portion of proteins function in isolation in cells, whereas the majority is assembled into complexes through protein-protein interactions with identical or different protein subunit(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsh et al., 2013</xref>). The rationale behind such an evolutionary selection has been the subject of considerable speculation; proposals for the advantages associated with a multimeric-units complex instead of a long single polypeptide chain include better error control in synthesis, greater coding and folding efficiency, and possibility of allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodsell and Olson, 2000</xref>). Morphologically speaking, many protein complexes especially homomeric ones adopt a symmetric spatial arrangement, either cyclic (C<sub>n (n&gt;1)</sub>) or dihedral (D<sub>n (n&gt;1)</sub>) symmetry, characterized by a rotational symmetry or two orthogonal symmetry axes, respectively. In contrast to the cyclic complexes which evolve in one step (e.g. C1→C5), evolution of dihedral complexes takes place in multiple steps (e.g. C1→C5→D5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levy et al., 2008</xref>), and adds another layer of structural complexity. Intriguingly, pioneering studies have revealed many supramolecular enzymes organized in dihedral symmetry, with subcomplex entities in cyclic symmetry holding, at least outwardly, multiple integral active sites. Thus, a fundamental question arises here is that why nature builds these protein complexes with a seemingly oversophisticated quaternary design, if the subcomplexes alone possess complete elements for action? In other words, is the extra assembly step, e.g. C5→D5, is a futile evolutionary effort for these supramolecular protein complexes?</p><p>One such an example is glutamine synthetases (GSs) (EC 6.3.1.2), one of the most ancient functioning enzymes in existence and a central enzyme in nitrogen metabolism of all living organisms, catalyzing the formation of glutamine by condensation of glutamate with ammonia using ATP as an energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eisenberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stadtman and Ginsburg, 1974</xref>). Three classes of GS enzymes have been identified in different organisms, namely, GSI, GSII, and GSIII. Decades of studies have established a striking notion that all three classes of GS enzymes, despite of dramatic differences in amino acid sequences and protein sizes, share quaternary geometry in dihedral symmetry assembled with two oligomeric rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Rooyen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almassy et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gill and Eisenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gill et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Unno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Torreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krajewski et al., 2008</xref>). Considering that the active sites of GS are located at the clefts formed between two neighboring protomers within the same ring and distal to the ring-ring interface, each isolated GS subcomplex ring holds multiple integral catalytic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eisenberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betti et al., 2012</xref>). The functional demand for this evolutionary conservation, the quaternary organization of GS with dihedral symmetry, remains elusive.</p><p>Here, we sought out to explore the functional link between the oligomeric conformation and catalysis activity, and mechanistically justify the seemingly oversophisticated assembly design in this supramolecular enzyme. Our results unveil a previously uncharacterized structural disorder-order transition along with activity regulation mechanism induced by assembly status transition of GS, and present an example that how a particular quaternary geometry selectively defines the oligomer dynamics congruent with required activities. We further show in vivo evidence how this regulatory machinery is elegantly utilized by the cell to meet the ever-changing metabolic needs. The functional implications of these findings are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two highly conserved GSIIs demonstrate distinct quaternary structure organization propensities</title><p>With the aim of clarifying the functional role of dihedral symmetry in GS functions, we first carried out a quest for GSs that share a high degree of sequence conservation, but demonstrate distinct quaternary structural assembly properties. We made use of the weak ring-ring interaction of GSII, a prominent structural difference between the type I and type II GSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Unno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Torreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krajewski et al., 2008</xref>), built model structures for the candidate GSIIs based on the crystal structure of the maize GSII (pdb code:2D3B) and analyzed the amino acid variations in the context of model structures. Primary structure analysis reveals GSIIs from the plants of <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (CsGSIb) and <italic>Glycine max</italic> (GmGSβ2) share an overall very high sequence homology (~90 % identical and ~97 % conserved) and absolutely conserved substrate-binding and catalytic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), with, however, a significant portion of amino acid variations clustered at the interface between two pentamer rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). We then recombinantly expressed both CsGSIb and GmGSβ2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified these two GSII homologs. To assess the oligomerization status, we performed size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to both multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS). MALS analysis shows the GSII from <italic>Glycine max</italic> being largely a homogeneous decamer in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In contrast, under the same condition the majority fraction (~82%) of CsGSIb adopts a pentameric configuration, along with a minor fraction (~18%) being decameric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We further show that CsGSIb exists in pentamer-decamer dynamic equilibrium in solution and a mixture of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions is responsible for attaching of two pentameric rings; whereas substrates or ligands show no appreciable effect on the decamer-forming properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Quaternary assembly property comparison of GSIIs from <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (CsGSIb) and <italic>Glycine max</italic> (GmGSβ2).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Amino acid sequence alignment of CsGSIb and GmGSβ2 reveals very high level of conservation.

SEC-MALS measurements revealed both mutations of I143L and EVK138DIQ led to a drastic shift in the oligomerization equilibrium towards decamer assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and f</xref>), causing significant increase in the distribution of decameric state from ~18 % in the WT-CsGSIb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) to &gt;95% and ~ 72%, respectively. These observations confirmed that both mutations introduced at the interface, albeit largely conservative, dramatically fortified the decamer edifice assembly. In contrast, substitution of the tyrosine at the residue 150 with a phenylalanine showed no appreciable change in its quaternary organization mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>), suggesting no critical role for the residue Y150 in maintaining two CsGSIb pentameric ring subcomplexes attached.

As all mutated amino acids are distal to either the catalytic site or substrate binding regions with distances &gt; 20 Å and hence are unlikely to be directly involved in catalytic reaction, we infer that the stimulations of the enzymatic activity of CsGSIb upon residue perturbations are induced by remote contacts between two pentamer rings. As expected, the mutation of Y150F, which did not alter pentamer-decamer equilibrium of CsGSIb, showed no noticeable change in enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The disorder-order transition induced by quaternary assembly triggers enzymatic activation of GSII</title><p>To elucidate the detailed mechanism of how the interactions between two GSII pentameric rings remotely trigger enzymatic activity, we next employed single-particle cryo-EM imaging technique and first determined the structures of GmGSβ2 decamer, as well as that of the CsGSIb that adopts decameric configuration (thereafter named as CsGSIb<sup>Dec</sup>). 3D classifications of 104,717 and 43,876 particles for GmGSβ2 and CsGSIb<sup>Dec</sup>, respectively, revealed that both molecules were arranged in D5 symmetry with two pentameric rings stacked in a head-to-head manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>), a strikingly conserved structural feature for type II GS species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Unno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Torreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krajewski et al., 2008</xref>).

This highlights the weakness of the inter-ring contacts, characteristic of type II GS. Indeed, in both structures the inter-ring contacts are established by only a limited number of hydrophobic and polar interactions provided by the residues 136–141 and 146–152 segments of each of the intervening subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), which behave as two gear teeth (thereafter named as tooth-1 and tooth-2, respectively) interlocking the two pentameric rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–f</xref>). This observation is in line with the above result that mutations to tooth-1 resulted in drastic change in oligomeric states behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–g</xref>), and the mixed nature of the inter-ring interactions is consistent with the MALS analysis result of CsGSIb under various buffer conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Intriguingly, the local structure of the teeth regions that mediate inter-ring interactions remains largely the same in GmGSβ2 and CsGSIb<sup>Dec</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–e</xref>), suggesting the dramatically different propensities of GmGSβ2 and CsGSIb for decamer formation are due to the nature of the amino acids involved in inter-ring contacts, rather than the structure. Although the residue of I143 is not directly involved in inter-ring contact, we argue that its replacement with leucine may stabilize the conformation of tooth-1 via its interaction with the residue of L134, thus playing an important role in stabilizing decamer architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>).</p><p>In order to elucidate the mechanism of how the pentameric CsGSIb (thereafter named as CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup>) demonstrates distinct enzymatic properties than CsGSIb<sup>Dec</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>), we next determined the structure of CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup>. Lowering the sample concentration, which favored pentamer dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>), allowed us to obtain sufficient number of CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>), which, in turn, enabled us to solve the cryo-EM structure of the inactive single-ringed GSII for the first time. Interestingly, we observed additional class averages in which the two masses of density attributed to the pentameric rings are no longer parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). These nonparallel ring particles may reflect intermediate assembly stages in the formation/disruption of the enzyme decamer, again confirming the flexibility of the inter-ring interactions of the type II GS.</p><p>Unexpected, CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> exhibited high conformational heterogeneity and 3D particles classification generated three similar structures with the r.m.s.d. ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 Å, differing in a few peripheral regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The most striking difference between CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> and CsGSIb<sup>Dec</sup> is that several regions are missing in the electron density map of all three classifications of CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> particles, with only 229–255 out of 356 residues electron densities in presence. As a result, CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> demonstrated a decagram-shaped density map with a few regions missing at the rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), in sharp contrast to a pentagon-shaped map yielded by the CsGSIb<sup>Dec</sup> particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). For the 229–255 residues that show clear density in CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> particles, the conformation of each subunit in three CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> EM structures, as well as the arrangement pattern, closely resembles that of the CsGSIb<sup>Dec</sup>, as evidenced by r.m.s.d. in the range of 0.7–1.0 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b-d</xref>). The density-missing regions include the segments around residues of 110–117, 140–166, and 260–334, among which, the fragment around residues 260–334 is a major component making up an integral catalytic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), while the segment of residues 140–166 comprising of the two gear teeth is responsible for ring-ring interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3d–f ,</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4d</xref>). As electron density missing often reflects the conformational heterogeneity arising from internal motions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armache and Cheng, 2019</xref>, these observation strongly suggest that the conformation of CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> active site is highly dynamic, contrasting sharply to the conformationally largely homogeneous CsGSIb<sup>Dec</sup>. In support this, thermal shift assays show the melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of wild-type CsGSIb is significantly lower than that of its mutants of I143L or EVK138DIQ, indicating of structural instability for the pentameric GSII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In particular, self-dimerization of 14-3-3 proteins, which induces dimerization of their clients, plays a key role in its functional scaffolding and subsequent activity regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tzivion et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevalier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kondo et al., 2019</xref>).

Based on these findings, here we tentatively provide the missing link in mechanistically assigning the role 14-3-3 proteins play in regulating GS activity: One protomer of the 14-3-3 protein recognizes one phosphorylated GSII pentamer, and its self-dimerization brings two pentamer rings in close proximity and therefore promotes decamer assembly, which, in turn, switches on the GS activity via rigidification of the catalytic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). One prerequisite for this proposal is that, for the GS species whose activities being 14-3-3 protein-dependent, they must have an intrinsically weak decamer-forming propensity that is to be overcome by 14-3-3.

Here, by using GS as a model system, we unveil a previously uncharacterized functionally regulatory code buried in a supramolecular protein complex with dihedral symmetry, and show how dynamic packing of protein subcomplexes could build an extra control for activity modulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The disorder-order transition mechanism of GSII offers a robust and tunable regulatory machinery</title><p>Being a key enzyme implicated in many aspects of the complex matrix of nitrogen metabolism, GS must be strictly regulated. Decades of efforts have been applied to understand how GS is controlled at gene, transcript and protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernard and Habash, 2009</xref>). Studies have demonstrated positive cooperativity of GS with regard to different substrates and cofactors, such as L-glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Montanini et al., 2003</xref>) and metal cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sakakibara et al., 1996</xref>); and GS functions are regulated by multiple post-translational mechanisms including nitration, oxidative turnover and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seabra and Carvalho, 2015</xref>), and by the 14-3-3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Finnemann and Schjoerring, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pozuelo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Riedel et al., 2001</xref>). Our results reconcile with many of the above observations, and allow us to gain a more complete picture of how GS activity is regulated in cells by an exquisite machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). While the protein turnovers machineries to adjust cellular enzyme level can always provide means to modulate pentamer-decamer transitions and thus deactivation-activation conversion of GSII, we argue that phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes, coupled with 14-3-3 binding and subsequent activation, may enable a more efficient regulatory way. When sufficient reaction products are available demanding low glutamine synthesis activity, GSII is kept in the dephosphorylated state and exists as isolated inactive single-ringed pentamers. In the physiological context of high demand of glutamine, phosphorylation of GSII by certain kinase prompts 14-3-3 protein binding, and the intrinsic dimerization property of 14-3-3 recruits two GSII pentamer rings in close proximity and in doing so, result in a rapid transition of quaternary assembly from the pentamer to decamer, and eventually enzymatic activation. In this manner, the poised GSII pentamer ring itself acts as a positive effector and the functional ring-ring association offers a great advantage of immediate response to precisely meet the ever-changing metabolic needs, whereas the reversible assembly-disassembly behavior enables a tunable mode for activity modulation. Indeed, the dynamic association-disassociation of GSII subcomplexes, a prerequisite for this modulatory machinery, have been widely observed in various species including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Denman and Wedler, 1984</xref>), plants other than <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Torreira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Llorca et al., 2006</xref>) and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mora, 1990</xref>). Therefore, the activation mechamism shown here may represent a general regulatory machinery harnessed by many eukaryotes to ensure optimal utilization of nitrogen sources, and the infrastructure of fragile ring-ring contacts evolutionarily chosen by many eukaryotes offers a convenient and robust avenue for activity regulation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic model of how activity of GSII is regulated by assembly states transition in cells to meet metabolic needs.</title><p>In low demand of glutamine, GSII is kept in the dephosphorylated state and exists as isolated inactive pentamers (orange); In the physiological context of high demand of glutamine, phosphorylation and subsequent binding to 14-3-3 (or by increase in cellular concentration) trigger a rapid transition of quaternary assembly of GSII from the pentamer to decamer (green) and activates GSII.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72535-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Practical implications</title><p>As a crucial enzyme to all living organisms, which is involved in all aspects of nitrogen metabolism, GS has emerged as an attractive target for drug design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mowbray et al., 2014</xref>) and herbicidal compounds development, as well as a suitable intervention point for the improvement of crop yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thomsen et al., 2014</xref>). However, because the overall geometry of the active site is the most conserved structural element amongst GS enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eisenberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Rooyen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Unno et al., 2006</xref>), the traditional strategy of selective inhibition, which relies heavily on the subtle difference in the active sites from different species, has only achieved limited success. Thus, the regulatory mechanism discovered here will help guide the search for specific inhibitors of potential therapeutic interest. For example, inhibition of the GS in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> has long been recognized as a novel antibiotic strategy to treat tuberculosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harth and Horwitz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gising et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kumari and Subbarao, 2020</xref>). Our result opens new possibilities to develop chemicals to target the drugable ring-ring interface region and specifically interrupt the interactions between two GS subcomplexes in pathogens or unwanted plants to develop new types of herbicide. Moreover, although overexpression of GS has been investigated extensively for decades with the goal of improving crop nitrogen use efficiency, the outcome has not been consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thomsen et al., 2014</xref>). The modulatory ‘hot-spots’ identified here, which mediate inter-ring communication and in turn stimulate GS activity, will guide engineering catalytically more powerful GSs for crops in which pentamer units only weakly associate, and thus increase plant nitrogen use efficiency and crop production.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The time dependence of the absorbance at different radial positions was monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm by an UV–Vis absorbance detector, and the data were analyzed by the software SEDFIT (version 15.01b) using c(s) model to obtain the sedimentation coefficient distribution. Viscosity and density of the buffer solution were calculated by the Sednterp software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy data collection</title><p>Purified protein samples of CsGSIb (4 μL, 0.02 mg/mL) and GmGSβ2 (4 μL, 0.02 mg/mL) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 1.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol were negatively stained with uranyl acetate 1 % (w/v) on carbon-film 400 mesh copper grids. Samples were imaged using a FEI T12 operated at 120 keV with a 3.236 Å pixel size, 68,000× nominal magnification, and defocus range about 1.5 μm. For cryo-EM, 3 μL of CsGSIb (0.1 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL) and GmGSβ2 (0.1 mg/mL) were added onto glow-discharged Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 100 holey-carbon Cu grids with a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The grids were blotted for 3.5 s at 8 °C with 100 % humidity, and then plunged frozen into liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Cryo-grids were first screened on a FEI TF20 operated at 200 keV. Images of CsGSIb and GmGSβ2 were collected using Titan Krios G3i microscope (FEI) operated at 300 kV with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detection camera. Two datasets were acquired using the SerialEM in super-resolution mode with a nominal magnification of 29,000 x, yielding a pixel sizes of 0.505 Å with a total dose of 51 e/ Å<sup>2</sup>. The defocus ranges were set from −1.6 μm to −2.3 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cryo-electron microscopy image processing, 3D reconstruction, and analysis</title><p>All processing steps were performed using cryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). A total of 4051 raw movie stacks acquired for CsGSIb and 1777 raw movie stacks for GmGSβ2 were subjected to patch motion correction and patch CTF estimation. An initial set of about 500 particles were manually picked to generate 2D templates for auto-picking. The auto-picked particles were extracted by a box size of 512 pixel and then subjected to reference-free 2D classification. After particle screening using 2D and 3D classification, the final 355,289 particles for CsGSIb and 115,795 particles for GmGSβ2 were subjected to Ab-Initio Reconstitution and followed by 3D Refinement with C5 symmetry imposed. Four different conformational states were obtained for CsGSIb, resulting in a 3.3 Å density map for CsGSIb<sup>Dec</sup>, 3.5 Å density map for CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> State I, 3.6 Å density map for CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> State II, and 3.4 Å density map for CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> State III. Only one major conformation was obtained with 2.9 Å density map for GmGSβ2. The global resolution of the map was estimated based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) using the 0.143 criterion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Model building and structural refinement</title><p>Homology models of CsGSIb and GmGSβ2 were generated with the I-TASSER server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang and Zhang, 2015</xref>) and docked into the cryoEM maps using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). The sequences were mutated with corresponding residues in CsGSIb and GmGSβ2, followed by rebuilding in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). The missing residues of CsGSIb<sup>Pen</sup> were not built due to the lack of corresponding densities. Real-space refinement of models with geometry and secondary structure restraints applied was performed using PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>).

The authors show that one enzyme is less active in vitro, due to the equilibrium between the inactive pentamer and the active dimer-of-pentamer forms, and the other is a stable dimer-of-pentamer decamer and is highly active. Through structural analysis, they show – for the first time – that the rim regions of the pentameric – where the active site residues – are flexible, explaining the low activity of the pentamer and the need to assemble the dimer-of-pentamers. This molecular level insight is complemented with a cellular study in which they show that the weakly-binding pentamers require the scaffolding protein 14-3-3 in vivo, which mediates dimerization of the GS pentamers. The structural analysis is solid. The work does improve our understanding of the GS, an important enzyme in plant as well as in other organisms.</p><p>A major weakness is the presentation and interpretation of the experimental results. I don't see the need to invoke the &quot;dynamics-driven assembly&quot; or &quot;allosteric modulation&quot;, and I believe these terms are used inaccurately here.
