electrophysiological recordings reflects functional coupling. We investigated the direction of information flow between auditory cortex and hippocampus while participants heard and then mentally replayed strings of letters in WM by activating their phonological loop. We recorded local field potentials from the hippocampus, reconstructed beamforming sources of scalp EEG<italic>,</italic> and – additionally in four participants – recorded from subdural cortical electrodes. When analyzing Granger causality, the information flow was from auditory cortex to hippocampus with a peak in the [4 8] Hz range while participants heard the letters. This flow was subsequently reversed during maintenance while participants maintained the letters in memory. The functional interaction between hippocampus and the cortex and the reversal of information flow provide a physiological basis for the encoding of memory items and their active replay during maintenance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every day, the brain’s ability to temporarily store and recall information – called working memory – enables us to reason, solve complex problems or to speak. Holding pieces of information in working memory for short periods of times is a skill that relies on communication between neural circuits that span several areas of the brain. The hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped area at the centre of the brain, is well-known for its role in learning and memory. Less clear, however, is how brain regions that process sensory inputs, including visual stimuli and sounds, contribute to working memory.</p><p>To investigate, Dimakopoulos et al. studied the flow of information between the hippocampus and the auditory cortex, which processes sound. To do so, various types of electrodes were placed on the scalp or surgically implanted in the brains of people with drug-resistant epilepsy. These electrodes measured the brain activity of participants as they read, heard and then mentally replayed strings of up to 8 letters. The electrical signals analysed reflected the flow of information between brain areas.</p><p>When participants read and heard the sequence of letters, brain signals flowed from the auditory cortex to the hippocampus. The flow of electrical activity was reversed while participants recalled the letters. This pattern was found only in the left side of the brain, as expected for a language related task, and only if participants recalled the letters correctly.</p><p>This work by Dimakopoulos et al. provides the first evidence of bidirectional communication between brain areas that are active when people memorise and recall information from their working memory. In doing so, it provides a physiological basis for how the brain encodes and replays information stored in working memory, which evidently relies on the interplay between the hippocampus and sensory cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Granger causality</kwd><kwd>phase-locking value</kwd><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>theta rhythm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>funded by SNSF 204651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarnthein</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PZ00P3_167836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mégevand</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005302</institution-id><institution>Alexander S.

Also in the hippocampus, WM maintenance was associated with sustained theta-alpha oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Vugt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boran et al., 2019</xref>). As a hallmark for WM maintenance, persistent neuronal firing was reported during the absence of sensory input, indicating the involvement of the medial temporal lobe in WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kamiński et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kornblith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boran et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>At the network level, synchronized oscillations have been proposed as a mechanism for functional interactions between brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fries, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pesaran et al., 2018</xref>). It is thought that these oscillations show temporal coupling of the low-frequency phase for long-range communication between cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sarnthein et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Polanía et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Johnson et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johnson et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Solomon et al., 2017</xref>). This synchronization suggests an active maintenance process through reverberating signals between brain regions.</p><p>We here extend previous studies with the same task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Michels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boran et al., 2019</xref>) by recording from four participants with hippocampal LFP and direct cortical recordings (ECoG) from electrodes over primary auditory, parietal, and occipital cortical areas. Given the low incidence of the epileptogenic zone in parietal cortex, parietal ECoG recordings are rare. To benefit from the wide spatial coverage of scalp EEG, we analyzed the directed functional coupling between hippocampal LFP and the beamforming sources of scalp EEG in all 15 participants. We found that the information flow was from auditory cortex to hippocampus during the encoding of WM items, and the flow was from hippocampus to auditory cortex for the replay of the items during the maintenance period.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Task and behavior</title><p>Fifteen participants (median age 29 years, range [18–56], 7 male, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) performed a modified Sternberg WM task (71 sessions in total, 50 trials each). In the task, items were presented all at once rather than sequentially, thus separating the encoding period from the maintenance period. In each trial, the participant was instructed to memorize a set of 4, 6, or 8 letters presented for 2 s (encoding). The number of letters was thus specific for the memory workload. The participants read the letters themselves and heard them spoken at the same time. Since participants had difficulties reading eight letters within the 2 s encoding period, also hearing the letters assured their good performance. After a delay (maintenance) period of 3 s, a probe letter prompted the participant to retrieve their memory (retrieval) and to indicate by button press (‘IN’ or ‘OUT’) whether or not the probe letter was a member of the letter set held in memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). During the maintenance period, participants rehearsed the verbal representation of the letter strings subvocally, i.e., mentally replayed the memory items. Participants had been instructed to employ this strategy, and they confirmed after the sessions that they had indeed employed this strategy. This activation of the phonological loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baddeley, 2003</xref>) is a component of verbal WM as it serves to produce an appropriate behavioral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christophel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task and recording sites.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) In the task, sets of consonants are presented and have to be memorized. The set size (4, 6, or 8 letters) determines working memory workload. In each trial, presentation of a letter string (encoding period, 2 s) is followed by a delay (maintenance period, 3 s).

Across the participants, the memory capacity averaged 6.1 (Cowan’s K, [correct IN rate +correct OUT rate –1]×set size), which indicates that the participants were able to maintain at least six letters in memory.

PLV in the [4 8] Hz theta range increased significantly with several contacts over auditory cortex (permutation test p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>).

We used spectral Granger causality (GC) as a measure of directed functional connectivity to determine the direction of the information flow between auditory cortex and hippocampus in Participant 1 during the trials. During encoding, the information flow was from auditory cortex to hippocampus with a maximum in the theta frequency range (dark blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). The net information flow ΔGranger (GC hipp→cortex – GC cortex→hipp) during encoding was significant in the [6 8] Hz range (blue bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, p&lt;0.05 permutation test against a null distribution). During maintenance, the information flow in the theta frequency range was reversed (dark red curve), i.e., from hippocampus to auditory cortex (dark red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). The net information flow ΔGranger during maintenance was significant in the [5 8] Hz range (red bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, p&lt;0.05 permutation test against a null distribution). Concerning the spatial spread of the theta GC, the maximal net information flow ΔGranger (GC hipp→cortex – GC cortex→hipp) during encoding occurred from auditory cortex to hippocampus (p&lt;0.05, permutation test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). During maintenance, the theta ΔGranger was significant from hippocampus to both auditory cortex and occipital cortex (permutation test p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>). Interestingly, in Participant 1, the distribution of high ΔGranger coincides with the distribution of high PLV: both show a spatial maximum to grid contacts over auditory cortex and both appear in the theta frequency range.</p><p>We next tested the statistical significance of the spatial spread of contacts with high ΔGranger ([4 8] Hz) during maintenance ([−2 0] s). To provide a sound statistical basis, we tested the spatial distribution of GC on the grid contacts against a null distribution. The activation on grid contacts was reshaped into a grid vector. The spatial collinearity of two grid vectors was captured by their scalar product. We next performed 200 iterations of random trial permutations. For each iteration, we selected two subsets of trials, and we calculated the scalar product between the two vectors corresponding to these subsets. We then tested the statistical significance of the scalar product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>). The true distribution (red) is clearly distinct from the null distribution (gray, blue bar marks the 95th percentile).

Among the participants that had both LFP and temporo-parietal ECoG recordings, Participant 3 had an electrode contact over left visual cortex; the sensory localization was indexed by the strong gamma activity in the most posterior contact of the strip electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). The time course of information flow between visual cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i and j</xref>) followed the same pattern as described for the auditory cortex above.

Our findings suggest that this cognitive function is subserved by bidirectional oscillatory interactions between memory neurons in the hippocampus and sensory neurons in the auditory cortex as indicated by phase synchrony and GC. In our verbal WM task, the encoding of letter items is isolated from the maintenance period in which the active rehearsal of memory items is central to achieve correct performance. First, analysis of task-induced power showed sustained oscillatory activity in cortical and hippocampal sites during the maintenance period. Second, analysis of the inter-electrode phase synchrony and the directional information flow showed task-induced interactions in the theta band between cortical and hippocampal sites. Third, the directional information flow was from auditory cortex to hippocampus during encoding, and during maintenance, the reverse flow occurred from hippocampus to auditory cortex. This pattern was found only to the left cortical hemisphere, as expected for a language-related task. Fourth, the comparison between correct and incorrect trials suggests that the participants relied on timely information flow to produce a correct response. Our data suggests a surprisingly simple model of information flow within a network that involves sensory cortices and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>): during encoding, letter strings are verbalized as subvocal speech. The incoming information flows from sensory cortex to hippocampus (bottom-up). During maintenance, participants actively recall and rehearse the subvocal speech in their phonological loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baddeley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christophel et al., 2017</xref>). The GC indicates the information flow from hippocampus to cortex (top-down) as the physiological basis for the replay of the memory items, which finally guides action.</p><p>The current study is embedded in previous studies using the same or similar tasks. Persistent firing of hippocampal neurons indicated hippocampal involvement in the maintenance of memory items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kamiński et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kornblith et al., 2017</xref>). An fMRI study reports salient activity in the auditory cortex during maintenance in an auditory WM task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>), which indicates that sensory cortical areas are involved in the maintenance of WM items. During encoding, the activity of local assemblies was associated with gamma frequencies and local processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a b c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g l</xref>) while GC inter-areal interactions took place in theta frequencies, in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Solomon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Stein and Sarnthein, 2000</xref>). Parietal generators of theta-alpha EEG indicated involvement of parietal cortex in WM maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Michels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tuladhar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Näpflin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boran et al., 2020</xref>). The hippocampo-cortical phase synchrony (PLV) was high during maintenance of the high workload trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boran et al., 2019</xref>). Building on these previous studies, the current study focused on high workload trials and extended them by the analysis of directional information flow.</p><p>In the design of the task, we aimed to separate in time the encoding of memory items from their maintenance. In the choice of the 2 s duration for the encoding period were guided by the magic number 7±2, which may correspond to ‘how many items we can utter in 2 s’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baddeley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christophel et al., 2017</xref>). The median Cowan’s K=6.1 shows that high workload trials were indeed demanding for the participants, where both encoding and maintenance may limit performance. We therefore presented the letters both as a visual and an auditory stimulus. Certainly, maintenance processes are likely to appear already during the encoding period as maintenance neurons ramp up their activity already during encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boran et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, encoding may extend past the visual stimulus (t=–3 s). We therefore focused our analysis on the last 2 s of maintenance [–2 0] s. With this task design, we found patterns of GC that were clearly distinct between encoding and maintenance.</p><p>Our study capitalizes on a unique dataset. We first benefitted from direct cortical recordings that assured the neuronal origin of the signals. We then confirmed the GC results by using the wide spatial coverage of scalp EEG, where we used beamforming to localize the cortical sources that generate the scalp EEG. The interaction between recordings from different brain regions has to be discussed with respect to volume conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trongnetrpunya et al., 2015</xref>). On the recording level, the choice of two separate references for LFP and ECoG has been shown to avoid spurious effects in GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos and Schoffelen, 2015</xref>). On the level of scalp EEG analysis, we used beamforming as a source reconstruction technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Popov et al., 2018</xref>) to characterize the primary neuronal generators that were localized specifically in left auditory cortex. A similar GC pattern emerged when using the signals from left temporal scalp electrodes but it was eliminated when using a Laplacian derivation. When looking at the GC frequency spectra, there was a strong frequency dependence of GC from hippocampus to ECoG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d i</xref>). Likewise, GC to EEG sources showed a strong frequency dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This speaks against volume conduction because the transfer of signal through tissue by volume conduction is independent of frequency in the range of interest here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miceli et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, there was a strong task dependence of GC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a d</xref>), again speaking against a strong contribution of volume conduction.</p><p>In the literature, there are several studies investigating the WM network.

The middle four, six, or eight letters were the memory items, which determined the set size for the trial (4, 6, or 8 respectively). The outer positions were filled with ‘X’, which was never a memory item. The participants read the letters and heard them spoken at the same time. After the stimulus, the letters disappeared from the screen, and the maintenance interval started ([−3, 0] s). Since the auditory encoding may have extended beyond the 2 s period, we restrict our analysis to the last 2 s of the maintenance period ([−2, 0] s). A fixation square was shown throughout fixation, encoding, and maintenance. After maintenance, a probe was presented. The participants responded with a button press to indicate whether the probe was part of the stimulus. The participants were instructed to respond as rapidly as possible without making errors. After the response, the probe was turned off, and the participants received acoustic feedback regarding whether the response was correct or incorrect. The participants performed sessions of 50 trials in total, which lasted approximately 10 min each.

To compute the GC, we first downsampled the signals to the Nyquist frequency=40 Hz. We then computed the GC between hippocampal contacts and ECoG grid contacts. We also computed GC between the same hippocampal contacts and EEG sources located over the regions of interest. GC examines if the activity on one channel can forecast activity in the target channel. In the spectral domain, GC measures the fraction of the total power that is contributed by the source to the target. We transformed signals to the frequency domain using the multitaper frequency transformation method (two Hann tapers, frequency range [4 20] Hz with 20 s padding) to reduce spectral leakage and control the frequency smoothing.</p><p>We used a non-parametric spectral approach to measure the interaction in the channel pairs at a given interval time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos and Schoffelen, 2015</xref>). In this approach, the spectral transfer matrix is obtained from the Fourier transform of the data. We used the FieldTrip toolbox to factorize the transfer function H(f) and the noise covariance matrix Σ. The transfer function and the noise covariance matrix were then employed to calculate the total and the intrinsic power, S(f)=H(f)ΣH×(f), through which we calculated the Granger interaction in terms of power fractions contributed from the source to the target.<disp-formula id="equ2"> <mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">→=</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>xx</italic></sub><italic>(f)</italic> is the total power and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">~</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the instantaneous power. To average over the group of participants, we calculated the Granger spectra for the selected channel pairs and averaged these spectra over participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p>To illustrate the time course of GC over time, we calculated time-frequency maps with the multitaper convolution method of Fieldtrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>To analyze statistical significance, we used cluster-based non-parametric permutation tests. To assess the significance of the difference of the Granger between different directions, we compared the difference of the true values to a null distribution of differences. We recomputed GC after switching directions randomly across trials, while keeping the trial numbers for both channels constant. Then we computed the difference of GC for the two conditions. We repeated this n=200 times to create a null distribution of differences. The null distribution was exploited to calculate the percentile threshold p=0.05. In this way, we compare the difference of the dark and light spectra against a null distribution of differences. We mark the frequency range of significant GC with a blue bar for encoding (dark blue spectrum exceeds light blue spectrum, information flow from cortex to hippocampus) and with a red bar for maintenance (dark red spectrum exceeds light red spectrum, information flow from hippocampus to cortex).</p><p>To test the statistical significance of the spatial spread of contacts with high PSD, PLV, or ΔGranger, we calculated the spatial collinearity on the grid contacts against a null distribution. First, we transform the activation on grid contacts into a grid vector. We then performed 200 iterations of random trial permutations. For each iteration, we selected two subsets (50%) of trials and we calculated the scalar product between the vectors corresponding to the two subsets. The null distribution was created by randomly mixing trials from the two task periods fixation and encoding. We finally tested the statistical significance of the scalar product. The true distribution was established to be statistically distinct from the null distribution if it exceeded the 95th percentile of the null distribution.</p><p>We assess if the reconstructed EEG sources during encoding and maintenance are significantly different from the pre-stimulus baseline (fixation). We use the FieldTrip’s method ft_sourcestatistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>), wherein we apply a non-parametric permutation approach to quantify the spatial activation pattern during the encoding of the memory items and their active replay.</p><p>Due to high average performance of the participants (91%) the number of correct and incorrect trials is imbalanced. To balance the number of correct trials with the number of incorrect trials, we randomly selected 10% of the correct trials and recomputed the GC spectra and then the net information flow (ΔGranger). We repeated this n=200 times and presented the mean ΔGranger for each participant.</p><p>For comparisons between two groups, we used the non-parametric paired cluster-based permutation test. We created a null distribution by performing N=200 random permutations.</p><p>To test the directionality of the information flow in the group of the participants, we used the group cluster-based permutation t-test from the FieldTrip toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>) with multiple comparison correction using the false discovery rate approach. Statistical significance was established at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The participants provided written informed consent for the study, which was approved upfront by the institutional ethics review board (PB 2016-02055).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-78677-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>ECoG and LFP recording locations.</title><p>For each participant, we list the coordinates of the tip of the hippocampal electrode for LFP recording.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joel Berger (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The referees all found the work interesting but raise interpretational issues in their detailed comment that all need to be addressed. We have highlighted a number of these below:</p><p>1) The data need to be reported less selectively to give readers an idea of the consistency of the effects emphasised.</p><p>2) One referee raises the issue of possible volume conduction which can be addressed with re-referencing of electrodes.</p><p>3) Many claims are based on descriptive data as opposed to quantification of the effect claimed and there are statistical issues raised including correction for multiple comparisons.</p><p>4) The authors need to comment on a more systematic examination of effects in different frequency ranges including the γ range.</p><p>If these issues can be addressed the suggested model will be of broad interest, but an extensive revision will be required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have shown a unique set of recordings, wherein they have collected intracranial data from parietal cortex and hippocampus, as well as scalp EEG in a number of subjects. With this unique advantage, they have examined directionality of connectivity between various regions during a working memory task. Given the growing evidence for the role of hippocampus in working memory, understanding its connectivity to the rest of the brain provides a crucial insight into the network involved in such a fundamental process. Whilst the existing content is generally of a high standard, and the analyses seem sound, there are some areas of considerable brevity that would benefit from expansion. Below are my comments on the manuscript.</p><p>Discussion: This is surprisingly short Discussion section. I feel this should be expanded considerably, such as including some of the information that I have discussed below regarding potential considerations of the task (e.g bimodal nature), discussion of the PLV results in the context of previous non-directional findings, the differences observed between correct and incorrect trials, considering in more detail the other behavioral consequences of these results. These suggestions are not necessarily exhaustive but are all points I believe should be included.</p><p>Comments on Results section in general:</p><p>– All the results in this section seem to refer to a single electrode for each subject. It would be beneficial to know whether these electrodes were representative of activity from surrounding electrodes or not.

It would be useful to have more detailed summary information across subjects to understand how reliable/variable these effects are.</p><p>Data availability section: The bit on previously published datasets confused me a little. Is this published dataset included as part of this article? It isn't so clear in the manuscript whether these are previously published data. If they are, this should be made more apparent.</p><p>Line 29: Phrasing – I would add the words &quot;rather than sequentially&quot; here to help readers with interpretation of why this separates out encoding from maintenance</p><p>Line 64: This can actually extend as low as δ band (see Leszczynski et al., 2015, Cell Reports; Kumar et al., 2021, Neuropsychologia).</p><p>Line 88: Do the authors have behavioral data or prior knowledge of how long it takes (on average) to encode 4, 6 or 8 letters? That is, how much of the 'encoding' period is truly encoding, rather than an initial encoding followed by maintenance. Or in a similar manner, how much of maintenance is still residual encoding.</p><p>Line 90: Was there a particular reason as to why the encoding phase was bimodal? Do the authors think this may have influenced their results?</p><p>Line 94-95: Was this an instruction to the participants? If so, I would put this more explicitly, i.e. &quot;participants were instructed to rehearse…&quot;. Of course, one cannot know for certain whether individual subjects employed this strategy.</p><p>Figure 2f: Where is this change in Granger relative to? A particular baseline window.</p><p>Line 293: Were any electrodes here included in a seizure foci? Was anything done to ensure that seizure activity did not affect recordings (e.g. not recording within xxx hours of a seizure)?</p><p>Line 301: Was anything done to deal with artefacts on the ECoG/sEEG electrodes? I.e. were trials with unusually large amplitudes, potentially indicative of muscle artefact (a known contaminant) removed?</p><p>Line 325-326: I am confused by this. You say that the individual frequencies may differ between participants – do you mean in terms of the peak frequency, or were different bands used for each subject? If different bands, why?</p><p>All power spectral density plots: I assume these are relative to baseline. Are they statistically-thresholded in any way?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Dimakopoulos et al. use intracranial data in humans to ask whether information flow is primarily cortical to hippocampal or the reverse during the encoding and retrieval stages of a working memory task. They find a highly reliable pattern where information in the α/β range flows from auditory cortex to hippocampus during encoding and in the reverse direction during maintenance of items in WM. The authors show this pattern in a sub-selection of ECoG recordings and go on to show it is present in virtually all subjects at the EEG to intracranial hippocampus level. In addition, this directional pattern breaks down during incorrect trials. However, the current analysis suffers from possible contamination by volume conduction.</p><p>The study is unique in its data set and provides a valuable look into hippocampal cortical interactions during WM. However, there are multiple technical questions remaining. One of the limitations is that the study investigated primarily interactions in the α/β range when looking at interactions. In contrast, their power spectral results show increases in γ during encoding, and other studies have emphasized a role for γ in feedforward routing. Did the authors perform a granger causality analysis in γ?</p><p>1. The reported PLV values (e.g., in figure 2d) of 0.3 – 0.6 are quite high. This level of PLV is usually observed when there is some amount of volume conduction present. Could the authors repeat the PLV and GC analysis using a local bipolar re-referenced signal? For more information on why this is a problem please see Trongnetrpunya, Nandi, Ding, et al., Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience.</p><p>2. Did the authors find any detectable GC or PLV in the γ frequency range, particularly during the encoding epoch?</p><p>3. Across subjects, the authors report that the Sensory to Hippocampus information flow is dominant during sensory processing and the reverse during delay processing (Figure 5). In Figure 5b, it is impressive how the effect holds in each and every individual subject. My question is how were the data selected in figure 5b? Is that an average of all GC pairs linking all available hippocampus leads to / from all available EEG leads, or was there a data selection that occurred? What would the results look like if only the EEG leads are selected that overly to auditory/temporal cortex? Is the topography the same or different when performing the analysis on e.g., frontal / occipital / parietal EEG leads? In other words, how spatially specific is the effect?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Dimakopoulos and colleagues investigate connectivity and flow of information during encoding and maintenance of Working Memory. They use unique data, which combine human intracranial recordings from depth electrodes with ECOG and EEG. This data, combined with Granger causality analysis (GC), provides interesting results that signal from cortex (mostly from EEG electrodes located over temporal cortex) is flowing to hippocampus during encoding and this flow is reversed during maintenance. Authors interpret this as a sign of bottom-up and top-down processing. I believe that chosen methods for signal analysis are appropriate.</p><p>However, paper contains several statements that are unsupported by statistics and there is no clear information about why some decisions in the analysis process were made. This could give an impression that the analysis is built from arbitrarily chosen single case examples. I believe that because of below listed flaws results of the analysis do not support conclusions.</p><p>1) Authors do not use correction for multiple comparisons – this cast doubts on the strength of obtained results.</p><p>2) There is no criterion given for ECOG electrodes selected to the analysis.</p><p>For instance, authors state that for participant 1 for C2 electrode, increased γ power during encoding proves that this electrode was over auditory cortex but there is no systematic analysis of γ power. From the results we can observe that this electrode has the strongest GC with hippocampus what suggests that it was used because of this characteristic what looks like double dipping.</p><p>3) Why frequencies observed in PLV and GC are so different? For instance, in supplementary Figure 1 PLV shows significant differences in 18-30 Hz but GC is calculated for 8-18 Hz. Such large differences in frequencies suggest some inconsistencies in the analysis.</p><p>4) For analyses depicted in Figure 4 and 5 it is unknown how the highest GC is defined (is it a mean from all frequencies?) Furthermore, there is no systematic measurement or criterion that would support that indeed chosen electrodes have the highest GC.</p><p>5) All analysis conducted in the time domain (time to frequency and GC) does not contain any statistics supporting validity of the proposed conclusions.</p><p>6) There is no data that supports statement that patients used verbalization. Although material is verbal authors cannot rule out that subject uses different modalities to support information maintenance.</p><p>7) In figure 3i significance for encoding (blue) is marked where there are no differences between dark blue and light blue conditions. This suggests that the significance is computed not between conditions but versus null distribution. In general, in the paper, it is unclear if comparison using null distribution or between conditions is being calculated.</p><p>8) In Figure 2b – why EEG, and not ECOG, signal is being analyzed?</p><p>9) I appreciate that authors present single subject results in Figure 4 but I believe group level analysis should be also performed to support conclusions.</p><p>10) Does the quality/magnitude of GC estimation depends on the number of trials? If so</p><p>for Figure 5b authors show subsample number of trials in the correct condition to match the number of trials in the incorrect condition.</p><p>11) Authors should state how many sessions were used in each comparison.</p><p>12) In the statement:</p><p>&quot;The GC was lower than for ECoG, as expected for the lower signal amplitude of scalp EEG.&quot; I do not know what &quot;lower&quot; means – is it a magnitude or frequency of GC? If frequency, how does it relate to the scalp EEG amplitude?</p><p>13) Throughout the paper it seems that &quot;ΔGranger&quot; is used to describe a different thing.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the second round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting the paper entitled &quot;Information flows from hippocampus to cortex during replay of verbal working memory items&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor. The revision has also been re-evaluated by three referees. We apologise for the delay in this decision over the holiday period. We are sorry to say that we have decided that this submission will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We found the approach to working memory based on effective connectivity between sensory cortex and hippocampus during working memory maintenance and retrieval intriguing and novel. All of the referees appreciated the efforts that have been made to improve the manuscript. The principal reason for rejection is the statistical interpretation of the data raised by all three referees, who are concerned whether the analyses allow robust inference about effects in the population. Referee 1 highlights differences between subjects in the frequency bands of effective connectivity. The effects are not robust to re-referencing recommended by referee 2, who does not consider a common reference adequate for this work. Referee 3 is concerned about multiple comparisons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I appreciate the efforts the authors have taken to improve the manuscript. The additional information does aid interpretation of the study. I still have a couple of remaining core issues to be sorted.</p><p>1) In the abstract, it states that information flow from auditory cortex to hippocampus peaked in the range of 8-18 Hz. In the newly inserted (and very helpful) table it seems that the range is anywhere from 4 to 21 Hz. Unless I am missing something, it appears that the authors are still making conclusions based on only Participant 1 (who showed significance in the 8-18 Hz range). I feel that this confusion runs throughout the manuscript and should be corrected – that is, any points where generalizations are made from a single subject that are not truly consistent across subjects should be corrected and the variability should be highlighted/discussed.</p><p>2) Similarly, the frequency band of hippocampus &gt; auditory cortex is often not congruent with the AC &gt; hippocampus within subjects, so it is too simplistic to say this was reversed during maintenance. Moreover, this difference in frequencies within subjects should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have attempted to answer my concerns by performing a bipolar and Laplacian analysis to the data prior to the connectivity analysis. Unfortunately, this revealed that effects were not preserved after applying local re-referencing. I appreciate the authors' arguments that some effects have a large spatial structure that is removed by bipolar. However, the electrodes used by the authors are quite far apart and a priori I would think that a referencing across a large spatial structure should preserve true effects while removing spurious ones.</p><p>Unfortunately, given simulation work as in the article I referred to in my original review (Trongnetrpunya, Nandi, Ding, et al., Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience), the false positive rate is unacceptably high when Granger and related methods are applied to data sharing a common reference. The current results therefore may be incorrect and cannot be interpreted in their present form.</p><p>The authors also apparently have cherry picked their data in Figures 4 and 5 by first taking channels that show a change in Granger, and then analyzing those changes across participants. It is like forcing the data to behave as we would like, another example of a flawed approach taken by the present manuscript. Given these technical/methodological issues, I cannot recommend the manuscript for publication in the present state.</p><p>I do want to commend the authors for recording this dataset, and performing directed connectivity analysis, which is rare for these types of data. I would encourage the authors to think more deeply about how to assess directed functional connectivity robustly and reformulate their work with this in mind.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have revised their manuscript and attempted to address all of the comments raised by myself and the other reviewers.</p><p>I have few remaining issues.</p><p>If authors compute the difference against null distribution not between conditions (for example light blue and dark blue) in Figure 3d,i and in Figure 4 – How statement &quot;dark blue spectrum exceeds light blue spectrum, information flow from cortex to hippocampus&quot; is correct? It seems that, for each light colour result (hippocampus to cortex during encoding, cortex to hippocampus during maintenance) there should be a result of a statistical test and it seems none of these tests were performed. The caption of Figure 4 where authors use ΔGranger seems also incorrect as authors compute statistics from null distribution.</p><p>Unfortunately, I believe that issue with multiple comparisons was not addressed entirely. For instance, the analysis in the frequency domain does not use any correction for multiple comparisons. Because of that it is unknown if small differences observed in results are not effects of multiple comparisons.</p><p>Additionally for Figure 5 b and c analysis it seems that the comparison is not designed correctly. For figure 5b the data is picked using significant reversal of net GC (ΔGranger) – this is not done for Figure 5c analysis so it is hard to draw any conclusions from this contrast.</p><p>About the group statistics issue. Figure 5a although presents average results does not show any statistics thus it is unknown if any of those information flows is significant. Figure 4 can give me an intuition that the result is present, but I have no idea about how significant it is on the group level. I believe that paper would benefit from the group statistics.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Information flows from hippocampus to auditory cortex during replay of verbal working memory items&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and the original reviewers.</p><p>The work provides new insights into the communication between sensory cortex and hippocampus during working memory.</p><p>The revised work has been seen by all of the original referees who agree it is substantially improved. They have raised a number of further points about analysis and exposition we would like you to consider when preparing the final article for acceptance.</p><p>1. No details are provided for the scalp EEG system. How many electrodes? Was this an active system? Filtering at all? Many of these points are particularly relevant and important for interpreting the beamforming data. It says that the electrodes were aligned for each participant – how was electrode localization performed? Using what system – Polhemus?</p><p>2. Was all source reconstruction done with a template MRI? If so, wouldn't it have been appropriate to use each individual's MRI for better localisation, given that you surely had these available? You could then do the group averages, but at least the individual subject data would be more accurately localised.</p><p>3. The Granger causality analyses are reported for only three of the subjects between hippocampal LFP and ECoG data. Did the other 12 subjects not have any cortical electrodes then, even without parietal coverage, only hippocampal LFPs? This isn't at all clear from the descriptions in the manuscript and seems surprising that data would only be available from hippocampus, and no other temporal regions, even if parietal coverage was lacking.</p><p>4. It would be beneficial to include a display of all the contact locations for hippocampus, for transparency and interpretability purposes, along with (or perhaps instead) a supplement including all MNI coordinates of localised electrodes.</p><p>5. L110-110: It would be more consistent with other literature to describe this frequency range as &quot;high α/low β&quot;.</p><p>6. At a number of points, the authors state that during maintenance, rehearsal is performed as a melody. Where does this assumption come from? That is, nowhere is it clear that these letters are transformed into a melodic representation (i.e. related to a musical sequence). This seems overly speculative.</p><p>7. The beamforming shows the area specificity for the effects in auditory cortex. The volume conduction paragraph should take this into account, but should also mention that the PLV and Laplacian based referencing scheme eliminated the effects. There should be a discussion about the possible reasons as to why this was observed in the author's data analysis.</p><p>8. On a small technical note, raw Granger should not be multiplied by 100%. Please revert back to the raw Granger values, as this would make the work more comparable to other studies, and these numerical units are meaningful. It is OK to express GC percentage differences in the cortex to hippocampus vs. hippocampus to cortex directions during the task modulation, however, to emphasize the changing direction patterns.</p><p>9. Relative power plots are not showing any decreases in power relative to fixation. How were the data baselined? They vary from 0 to 1. What about power decreases from fixation?</p><p>10. Lines 200-206 when reporting the change in Granger using a permutation test, but no p-values are given.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I appreciate some of the additions that the authors have included.

The authors show this pattern in a sub-selection of EcoG recordings and go on to show it is present in virtually all subjects at the EEG to intracranial hippocampus level.

Did the authors perform a granger causality analysis in γ?</p></disp-quote><p>Please find our detailed response below to Point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The reported PLV values (e.g., in figure 2d) of 0.3 – 0.6 are quite high. This level of PLV is usually observed when there is some amount of volume conduction present. Could the authors repeat the PLV and GC analysis using a local bipolar re-referenced signal? For more information on why this is a problem please see Trongnetrpunya, Nandi, Ding, et al., Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for presenting PLV in Figure 2d with a color scale only in the range [0.3 0.6]. In the new Figure 2g (Line 598), we now show the full range of PLV &lt; 0.6. The PLV to parietal recording sites is &lt; 0.1, i.e. with high anisotropy across contacts. Similarly, GC is highly anisotropic both for eCoG (Figure 2) and for scalp EEG (Table 2). This anisotropy speaks against a significant amount of volume conduction present.</p><p>Following the Reviewer’s suggestion, we have repeated PLV and GC analysis with a Laplacian montage for the ECoG of Participant 1 and a bipolar montage for the ECoG of all three Participants with ECoG. There was neither PLV nor GC. However, Laplacian and bipolar montages focus on highly localized neuronal assemblies and provides somewhat complementary information to the referential montage (Nunez 1995). The activity of local assemblies is rather associated with higher frequencies and local processing. Inter-areal interactions tend to take place rather in lower frequencies (Solomon 2017, von Stein 2000), which require a referential montage to be appreciable in the signal.</p><p>There was a strong frequency dependence of PLV to ECoG (Participant 1, Figure 2g) and to scalp EEG (Figure 6 in (Boran 2019)). Likewise, GC to ECoG and to scalp EEG showed a strong frequency dependence (Figures 2, 3, 4). This speaks against volume conduction because the transfer of signal through tissue by volume conduction is independent of frequency in the range of the EEG studied here (Miceli 2017, Nunez 1995).</p><p>There was a strong task dependence of both PLV (Boran 2019) and GC (Figures 2, 3, 4).

Is that an average of all GC pairs linking all available hippocampus leads to / from all available EEG leads, or was there a data selection that occurred? What would the results look like if only the EEG leads are selected that overly to auditory/temporal cortex?

They use unique data, which combine human intracranial recordings from depth electrodes with ECOG and EEG. This data, combined with Granger causality analysis (GC), provides interesting results that signal from cortex (mostly from EEG electrodes located over temporal cortex) is flowing to hippocampus during encoding and this flow is reversed during maintenance. Authors interpret this as a sign of bottom-up and top-down processing. I believe that chosen methods for signal analysis are appropriate.</p><p>However, paper contains several statements that are unsupported by statistics and there is no clear information about why some decisions in the analysis process were made. This could give an impression that the analysis is built from arbitrarily chosen single case examples. I believe that because of below listed flaws results of the analysis do not support conclusions.</p><p>1) Authors do not use correction for multiple comparisons – this cast doubts on the strength of obtained results.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the Reviewer’s comment, we add data from more electrodes and test the spatial distribution of the results on the grid electrode.</p><p>We have now added further analyses and panels to Figure 2 and Figure 3 and created a new Table 2. In Figure 2, the new panels show that the grid contacts C2 and H3, which we mainly present, are surrounded by contacts with similar behavior (Figure 2 a, d, g, i, j). To provide a sound statistical basis, we have now tested the spatial distribution of PSD, PLV and GC on the grid contacts against a null distribution. The activation on grid contacts was transformed into a grid vector. The spatial collinearity of two grid vectors is captured by their scalar product. We tested the statistical significance of the spatial spread of contacts with high ΔGranger (8-14 Hz) during maintenance ([-2 0] s). We first reshaped the ΔGranger values on the grid into a vector over 200 iterations of random trial permutations. For each iteration we selected two subsets of trials and we calculated the scalar product between the two subsets.The true distribution of scalar products occurs only above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the null distribution and is thereby statistically significant (Figure 2 k).</p><p>For the scalp electrodes of all participants, the Table 2 shows that significant GC occurred specifically to central/temporal scalp EEG electrodes in 14/15 participants (p=0.005, two sided non-parametric permutation test).</p><p>We have now added this information to the Results (Line 186 – 197) and the Discussion (Line 327 – 334) sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is no criterion given for ECOG electrodes selected to the analysis.</p><p>For instance, authors state that for participant 1 for C2 electrode, increased γ power during encoding proves that this electrode was over auditory cortex but there is no systematic analysis of γ power.

Encoding elicited γ power increase at several temporal contacts (among them C2) and occipital contacts. We tested the statistical significance of the increase for each contact. Figure 2a shows the z-score of those contacts in red where the increase reached statistical significance of the increase (z-score &gt;1.96, permutation t-test). In a separate test (NOT double-dipping!), we identified the grid contacts with significant increase in PLV and GC in Figure 2 g, i, j. These turn out to be on temporal cortex as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why frequencies observed in PLV and GC are so different? For instance, in supplementary Figure 1 PLV shows significant differences in 18-30 Hz but GC is calculated for 8-18 Hz. Such large differences in frequencies suggest some inconsistencies in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>In a mechanistic view of communication theory, one assumes that a node displays high PSD, high PLV, high GC, and all of this in the same time window and in the same frequency band. Our data come close to this view but the frequency bands do not match. Since this mismatch follows directly from the data, we would rather call it an inconsistency between the available analysis methods and our underlying assumptions.</p><p>Following the Reviewer’s comment, we now highlight these considerations in the Discussion (Line 315 – 323).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For analyses depicted in Figure 4 and 5 it is unknown how the highest GC is defined (is it a mean from all frequencies?) Furthermore, there is no systematic measurement or criterion that would support that indeed chosen electrodes have the highest GC.</p></disp-quote><p>The highest GC is defined as the mean in the band of significant GC change. We present here the electrode pairs with the highest ΔGranger values. It turned out that in 14/15 participants, the highest GC occurred in temporal electrodes over auditory cortex or in participants where temporal sites were not recorded from, the highest GC occurred at the neighboring electrode sites C3 or C4 (Table 2, p=0.005, two sided non-parametric permutation test).</p><p>We have now prepared a Table 2 that lists all electrodes and GC values.

We compute significance against a null distribution as stated in the Methods: “To assess the significance of GC, we compared the true values to a null distribution. We recomputed GC after shuffling the trial number for a single channel in the pair, while keeping the trial number of the other channel constant. We repeated this n = 200 times to create a null distribution of GC. The null distribution was exploited to calculate the percentile threshold P = 0.05.” We mark the frequency range of significant GC with a blue bar for encoding (dark blue spectrum exceeds light blue spectrum, information flow from cortex to hippocampus) and with a red bar for maintenance (dark red spectrum exceeds light red spectrum, information flow from hippocampus to cortex).</p><p>We now mention the null distribution also in Results (Line 170 – 172, 175 – 176). The net information flow ΔGranger (GC<sub>hippcortex</sub> – GC<sub>cortexhipp</sub>) during encoding was significant in the 8-18 Hz range (blue bar in Figure 2 i, p&lt;0.05 permutation test against a null distribution).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 2b – why EEG, and not ECOG, signal is being analyzed?</p></disp-quote><p>We now highlight the difference in recording modality in Results (Line 133 – 135).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) I appreciate that authors present single subject results in Figure 4 but I believe group level analysis should be also performed to support conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5a shows a group level analysis of the single participant results of Figure 4.

It thus turned out that the GC estimation does not deteriorate when balancing the numbers of correct and incorrect trials.

All of the referees appreciated the efforts that have been made to improve the manuscript. The principal reason for rejection is the statistical interpretation of the data raised by all three referees, who are concerned whether the analyses allow robust inference about effects in the population. Referee 1 highlights differences between subjects in the frequency bands of effective connectivity. The effects are not robust to re-referencing recommended by referee 2, who does not consider a common reference adequate for this work. Referee 3 is concerned about multiple comparisons.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I appreciate the efforts the authors have taken to improve the manuscript. The additional information does aid interpretation of the study.

In the newly inserted (and very helpful) table it seems that the range is anywhere from 4 to 21 Hz. Unless I am missing something, it appears that the authors are still making conclusions based on only Participant 1 (who showed significance in the 8-18 Hz range). I feel that this confusion runs throughout the manuscript and should be corrected – that is, any points where generalizations are made from a single subject that are not truly consistent across subjects should be corrected and the variability should be highlighted/discussed.</p><p>2) Similarly, the frequency band of hippocampus &gt; auditory cortex is often not congruent with the AC &gt; hippocampus within subjects, so it is too simplistic to say this was reversed during maintenance. Moreover, this difference in frequencies within subjects should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now completely revised our data analysis. The results addressed by the reviewer (Figures 4 and 5 of the previous version) are now less relevant and no longer reported in the manuscript.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ comments, we have now improved the quality of our data. In particular, we have now</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>used separate references for hippocampal LFP and ECoG recordings,</p></list-item><list-item><p>determined the cortical sources of our EEG recordings by beamforming,</p></list-item><list-item><p>applied cluster-based permutation tests on the population of participants.</p></list-item></list><p>We have then improved our GC analysis by down sampling the data to the Nyquist frequency. While new GC analysis confirmed the reversal of the net information flow between encoding and maintenance, the significant differences now appeared in theta band in all analyses.</p><p>We have now described the results of our improved GC analysis in the Results sections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. We have created several new figures and panels. We now present the GC spectra for Participant 1 (Figure 2h), for Participants 2,3 (Figure 3 d,i) and for the beamforming sources of all participants in Figure 4a. Significant net information flow (ΔGranger) appeared in the theta frequency range for all pairs of signals that we analysed. We therefore selected the 4-8 Hz band to test the reversal of ΔGranger in all participants individually (Figure 4d) and showed that the reversal appears for correct trials only (Figure 4f).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have attempted to answer my concerns by performing a bipolar and Laplacian analysis to the data prior to the connectivity analysis. Unfortunately, this revealed that effects were not preserved after applying local re-referencing. I appreciate the authors' arguments that some effects have a large spatial structure that is removed by bipolar.

Given these technical/methodological issues, I cannot recommend the manuscript for publication in the present state.</p></disp-quote><p>We have certainly not cherry picked our data. Nevertheless, as stated above we have thoroughly re-analyzed our data following the reviewer’s suggestion. This extensive re- analysis corroborated the earlier findings with improved statistics.

It seems that, for each light colour result (hippocampus to cortex during encoding, cortex to hippocampus during maintenance) there should be a result of a statistical test and it seems none of these tests were performed. The caption of Figure 4 where authors use ΔGranger seems also incorrect as authors compute statistics from null distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the analysis exactly as the reviewer suggested. We are sorry if this was not clear. We do not compute statistics from a null distribution but from a null distribution of differences.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s comment, we have now clarified the description of statistics in the Methods section 4.10:</p><p>“To assess the significance of the difference of the Granger between different directions, we compared the difference of the true values to a null distribution of differences.</p><p>We recomputed GC after switching directions randomly across trials, while keeping the trial numbers for both channels constant. Then we computed the difference of GC for the two conditions. We repeated this n = 200 times to create a null distribution of differences. The null distribution was exploited to calculate the percentile threshold p = 0.05. In this way, we compare the difference of the dark and light spectra against a null distribution of differences”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately, I believe that issue with multiple comparisons was not addressed entirely.

We then analyzed the Granger causality (GC, Methods 4.9) between the cortical sources and the hippocampal local field potentials (LFP). The statistics was then performed with cluster based permutation tests of the effects in the subject population (Methods 4.10). This corrects for multiple comparisons (false-rate-discovery) (Maris and Oostenveld, 2007). We statistically compared the spectral GC in EEG sources between the two directions (hipp-&gt;cortex, cortex-&gt; hipp) at the group level. We first selected a task period (encoding or maintenance).

There were statistically significant differences among the cortical areas regarding net information flow both during encoding (p = 0.0009, Kruskal-Wallis test) and maintenance (p = 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). We confirmed that the net information flow in auditory cortex was significantly different from any other area (Dunn’s test, Bonferroni corrected).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally for Figure 5 b and c analysis it seems that the comparison is not designed correctly.

How many electrodes? Was this an active system? Filtering at all? Many of these points are particularly relevant and important for interpreting the beamforming data. It says that the electrodes were aligned for each participant – how was electrode localization performed? Using what system – Polhemus?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing us to this omission.</p><p>We have now described the scalp EEG recordings in more detail in the Methods.</p><p>Section 4.3</p><p>“For scalp EEG recording, cup electrodes (Ag/AgCl) were placed on the scalp and filled with electrolyte gel (Signagel, Parker Laboratories, parkerlabs.com) to obtain an impedance &lt; 5 kΩ.”</p><p>Section 4.4</p><p>“The scalp EEG electrodes were placed at the sites of the 10-20 system by experienced technicians and no further localization was performed.

If so, wouldn't it have been appropriate to use each individual's MRI for better localisation, given that you surely had these available? You could then do the group averages, but at least the individual subject data would be more accurately localised.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. We used precomputed head models based on a template MRI. We agree that subject-specific head models yield source localization that may be more accurate. However, there are several factors that affect the variability in spatial localization and the use of a template MRI is only one of them. In our study, the localization accuracy at the group level appeared sufficient to support our main finding: information flows from auditory cortex and hippocampus during encoding and reverses direction during replay of memory items. We envisage higher localization accuracy in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The granger causality analyses are reported for only three of the subjects between hippocampal LFP and ECoG data. Did the other 12 subjects not have any cortical electrodes then, even without parietal coverage, only hippocampal LFPs? This isn't at all clear from the descriptions in the manuscript and seems surprising that data would only be available from hippocampus, and no other temporal regions, even if parietal coverage was lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>Planning of the intracranial electrode placement is a clinical decision. It reflects where the epileptologists hypothesize the epileptic foci to be localized (Zijlmans et al., 2019). Since the presumed epileptic foci included the hippocampus in all patients, electrodes were placed in the hippocampus. Only in four patients, additional ECoG electrodes were placed because an epileptic focus in the cerebral cortex was considered. In three of these patients, the ECoG electrodes were placed on the left hemisphere and the data analysis had been presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3. In the fourth patient, the ECoG electrodes were placed on the right parietal cortex and had not been presented before. While the spectral power was comparable to that of Participants 1-3, there was no significant Granger information flow from or to the right cortical hemisphere. This adds to the evidence from the scalp EEG sources that the phonological loop recruits predominantly the left cortical hemisphere.</p><p>Following the Reviewer’s comment, we now renumbered the participants so the participant with right parietal electrodes gets number 4.

They capitalize on a unique dataset where human intracranial data have been collected from the hippocampus, in parallel with human electrocorticography and/or electroencephalography. The authors use a statistical method to infer functional directed connectivity. This reveals information flowing from cortex to hippocampus during encoding but the reverse direction during maintenance. This study is quite unique in its combination of methodology with data that can precisely track the anatomical sources of neural computations during a memory task.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>In particular, the nice use of beamforming show the area specificity for the effects in auditory cortex. The volume conduction paragraph should take this into account, but should also mention that the PLV and Laplacian based referencing scheme eliminated the effects.
