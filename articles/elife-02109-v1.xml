While sensory representations are known to undergo plasticity at the higher levels of sensory pathways following peripheral lesions or sensory experience, less is known about the functional plasticity of peripheral inputs induced by learning. We addressed this question in the adult mouse olfactory system by combining odor discrimination studies with functional imaging of sensory input activity in awake mice. Here we show that associative learning, but not passive odor exposure, potentiates the strength of sensory inputs up to several weeks after the end of training. We conclude that experience-dependent plasticity can occur in the periphery of adult mouse olfactory system, which should improve odor detection and contribute towards accurate and fast odor discriminations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02109.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02109.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02109.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The mammalian brain is not static, but instead retains a significant degree of plasticity throughout an animal’s life. It is this plasticity that enables adults to learn new things, adjust to new environments and, to some degree, regain functions they have lost as a result of brain damage.</p><p>However, information about the environment must first be detected and encoded by the senses. Odors, for example, activate specific receptors in the nose, and these in turn project to structures called glomeruli in a region of the brain known as the olfactory bulb. Each odor activates a unique combination of glomeruli, and the information contained within this ‘odor fingerprint’ is relayed via olfactory bulb neurons to the olfactory cortex.</p><p>Now, Abraham et al. have revealed that the earliest stages of odor processing also show plasticity in adult animals. Two groups of mice were exposed to the same two odors: however, the first group was trained to discriminate between the odors to obtain a reward, whereas the second group was passively exposed to them. When both groups of mice were subsequently re-exposed to the odors, the trained group activated more glomeruli, more strongly, than a control group that had never encountered the odors before. By contrast, the responses of mice in the passively exposed group did not differ from those of a control group.</p><p>Given that the response of glomeruli correlates with the ability of mice to discriminate between odors, these results suggest that trained animals would now be able to discriminate between the odors more easily than other mice. In other words, sensory plasticity ensures that stimuli that have been associatively learned with or without reward will be easier to detect should they be encountered again in the future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02109.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02109.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>sensory perception</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP0033_119169, PP00P3_139189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carleton</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51AU40_125759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carleton</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name><name><surname>Lagier</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2009-StG-243344-NEUROCHEMS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carleton</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Novartis Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carleton</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Carlos &amp; Elsie de Reuter Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carleton</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Ernst &amp; Lucie Schmidheiny Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carleton</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abraham</surname><given-names>Nixon M</given-names></name><name><surname>Carleton</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CR33I13_143723</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><name><surname>Carleton</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030E_135910</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Associative learning, but not passive odorant exposure, induces a novel long lasting functional plasticity in the periphery of mouse olfactory system, making previously encountered odors easier to detect in the future.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian brains remain plastic throughout their life span, enabling animals to adapt their behavior to novel conditions.

At the input level, both sensory deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cummings et al., 1997</xref>) and developmental reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerr and Belluscio, 2006</xref>) have been reported to induce structural plasticity in the glomerular layer. Despite these facts, little is known about learning-mediated functional plasticity of sensory inputs in the adult OB of awake mice.</p><p>Here, we investigate plasticity at the periphery induced by learning or passive exposure by combining olfactory behavior and functional imaging in awake mice. Olfactory training caused an enhanced sensitivity and potentiation of sensory inputs, which helped the animals to achieve fast and accurate odor discrimination. Most strikingly, this functional plasticity was induced specifically by the learning process but not by a passive exposure to the same odorants, and lasted up to several weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defining odor discrimination thresholds using a wide range of odorant dilutions</title><p>To investigate the potential functional plasticity at the level of sensory neurons induced by olfactory learning, mice were trained to discriminate two odorants (rewarded vs unrewarded) on a go/no-go operant conditioning paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abraham et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2010</xref>). As perception can vary with the odorant dilution, we used a wide spectrum of dilutions covering several orders of magnitude ranging from 10<sup>0</sup> to 10<sup>−10</sup> (percentile dilution in mineral oil) for two different odor pairs (cineol [Cin] vs eugenol [Eu] and isoamyl acetate [IAA] vs ethyl butyrate [EB]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Performance levels reached more than 80% of correct responses after 400 trials and remained high during the following sessions. This task allowed the mice to acquire the procedural aspects of the training. It also allowed us to test the discrimination abilities for this odor pair at low dilutions (i.e., high concentrations). We then tested the discrimination abilities for different dilutions of the same odor pair. The performance levels remained close to chance levels for 10<sup>−10</sup> and 10<sup>−5</sup> dilutions, which can be interpreted as a lack of perception/discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, no difference between the two dilutions, Fisher’s Least Significant Difference [LSD] test, p<italic>&gt;</italic>0.05). On average, mice started to discriminate from 10<sup>−3</sup> onwards (note that one mouse was able to discriminate at 10<sup>−5</sup> with an accuracy of ∼70%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), reaching ∼70% of correct responses for 10<sup>−3</sup> dilution and &gt;90% for 10<sup>−2</sup>, 10<sup>−1</sup> and 10<sup>0</sup> dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

An associative learning, but not a passive exposure to the same odorants, increases the odorant detection sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and induces a potentiation of the input strength at all odorant dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This potentiation was independent of the reward value and of the nature of the stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Most strikingly, this form of plasticity lasted up to 5 weeks after the training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which could implicate such form of plasticity in long lasting improvement of perception abilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Olfactory learning induces long-lasting potentiation of sensory inputs</title><p>The reported form of functional plasticity, induced by sensory experience, in the glomerular layer of the adult mouse olfactory system differs from previously reported plastic changes observed during the postnatal maturation of the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerr and Belluscio, 2006</xref>). During development, OSNs expressing different receptors can project to the same glomerulus. During the first 2 months of postnatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zou et al., 2004</xref>), a refinement of the projections occurs, leading to the known concept of a glomerulus receiving only afferents from sensory neurons expressing the same receptor. This form of structural plasticity is accelerated by sensory experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerr and Belluscio, 2006</xref>), but it is not known if this causes any change in sensory input strength. In our study, the observed plasticity is induced during adulthood outside this developmental window, when one glomerulus is homogeneously innervated by one type of sensory neurons, and is associated to the increase of input strength.</p><p>All forms of sensory experience are not equivalent in triggering plasticity of the sensory inputs. Indeed, we report that associative learning causes a form of plasticity whereas a passive repetitive exposure did not, as similarly observed in cortical areas of other sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Accolla and Carleton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosselet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lai et al., 2012</xref>). The passively exposed group of mice did not show any change in the input strength compared to the naïve ones. Differences between associative learning and passive exposure paradigms may be due to differences in the final concentration and presentation duration of the applied odorants. Though we cannot rule out this possibility, the lack of effect during passive exposure is consistent with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, it is contrasting with the previously reported enhancement of input sensitivity following long passive exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 1993</xref>). In our study the total exposure time was less than an hour for one class of chemical stimuli (including all dilutions) whereas the exposure time was much longer in the latter study (16 hr daily during 2–6 weeks). In addition, the change in sensitivity reported previously was only observed for a barely detectable odorant in a selected mouse strain and not for other odorants. Therefore this non-generalized change in sensitivity might have resulted from extremely long exposure time for special odorants.</p><p>Our associative learning paradigm potentiated the input strength for several odorants independently of their chemical class and reward value. Previous reports showed that training specifically affected the odorant representation of the rewarded stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faber et al., 1999</xref>) or the stimulus associated with a foot shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kass et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, we saw a similar potentiation for all odorants regardless of the reward value of the stimuli. What is the possible role of the reward value in causing the potentiation we observed? In the go/no-go discrimination-learning paradigm, one stimulus is coupled with a positive reward, whereas the second stimulus is neither punished nor rewarded. This task involves the decision-making process for both rewarded and non-rewarded odors, which involves the assessment of reward value. This may explain the learning-induced potentiation we observed for rewarded as well as non-rewarded odors. The enhancement of sensory input strength for both odorants could activate the inhibitory neurons of the olfactory bulb thereby helping the refinement and the discrimination between odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Possible mechanisms underlying the long-lasting plasticity and implications for behavior</title><p>IOS imaging is primarily monitoring neurotransmitter release from OSNs as evidenced by pharmacology experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurden et al., 2006</xref>). Although we cannot completely rule out a possible postsynaptic contribution to the signal, studies comparing IOS with presynaptic-specific imaging readouts provide additional evidence supporting the presynaptic origin of IOS signals in the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wachowiak and Cohen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, a similar potentiation of the odor-evoked glomeruli activity induced by fear learning has been recently reported in anesthetized animals while monitoring a genetically encoded reporter of activity expressed specifically in OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kass et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that the plasticity is associated with change in OSN activity.</p><p>Which mechanism could explain a long-term change of OSNs activity? Firstly, OSN sensitivity could be enhanced, leading to an increase of the odor evoked OSN firing rate causing more release of glutamate in the glomerulus. Secondly, olfactory training could modify OSN turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwob et al., 1992</xref>) leading to higher number of axons innervating the same glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2008</xref>). Thirdly, a local network mechanism could alter OSN release. Since activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aroniadou-Anderjaska et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGann et al., 2005</xref>) and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ennis et al., 2001</xref>) receptors on OSN terminals can decrease glutamate release, inhibition of GABA and/or dopamine release would lead to the observed increase of input strength. Finally, a direct increase in glutamate release mediated by neuromodulatory fibers may also account for the observed plasticity. Further experiments are needed to identify the exact mechanisms underlying the long lasting change in input strength induced by this olfactory learning.</p><p>As we performed imaging experiments in awake mice, we took respiration behavior into account while analyzing the IOS readout. Previous studies have shown how an animal can increase its breathing frequency when sampling an odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verhagen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wesson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shusterman et al., 2011</xref>). The learning process can lead to a modulation of the respiration behavior in trained animals as compared to untrained animals. Moreover, it has been shown that prolonged fast respiration (&gt;4 Hz) reduces odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verhagen et al., 2007</xref>). It is thus plausible that the modulation of the strength of IOS after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>) could arise from changes in breathing strategy. However, we did not observe significant changes in the breathing frequency of mice when monitored at the beginning and at the end of discrimination training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The frequency was also comparable to the one previously measured in naïve awake head-restrained animals (3.1 Hz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, IOS amplitude does not vary with the animal’s breathing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, the IOS potentiation we report here mostly reflects neural changes induced by the learning process rather than respiration modulations. Along this line, a similar potentiation of the odor-evoked glomeruli activity induced by fear learning has been recently reported in anesthetized animals where effects are presumably independent of respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kass et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether these data suggest that the potential role played by breathing behavior is minor as a source of modulation of sensory input strength in olfactory associative learning tasks.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02109.008</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Respiration behavior is not altered by olfactory discrimination learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Performance levels shown by mice at the beginning (black, 300 trials averaged) and at the end of a discrimination training task (red, 300 trials averaged) with Cineol and Eugenol (*paired <italic>t</italic> test, p&lt;0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 6 mice).

The improved representations mediated by the training can account for discrimination accuracy and reaction time stability across a wide range of odorant dilutions.

Odorants were diluted from 10<sup>0</sup> to 10<sup>−10</sup> percent volume in mineral oil and further diluted 1:20 by airflow. Odorants were made freshly for each task. The task habituation training, olfactory training and reaction/discrimination time measurements were conducted as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abraham et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2012</xref>). In brief, a trial is initiated by breaking a light beam at the sampling port opening. This opens one of eight odor valves and a diversion valve (DV) that allows all airflow to be diverted away from the animal for 500 ms. After the release of DV, the odor is applied to the animal for 2 s. Trials were counted as correct if the animals met the criteria we set for water delivery (licking at least once in three out of four 500 ms bins) upon presentation of S+ or if licking did not occur in more than one out of four 500 ms bins for S−. For correct S+ trials mice can receive a 2–4 µl water reward at the end of 2 s stimulus period. Conversely for the incorrect S+ and correct S− trials no reward is supplied. A trial cannot be initiated unless an inter-trial interval of at least 5 s has passed. This interval was sufficiently long so that animals typically retract quickly after the end of the trial. The minimal inter-stimulus interval was thus 5 s, which seemed to be sufficient as no habituation could be observed (performance was not correlated with the actual inter-trial interval chosen by the animal, which was around 10–20 s). No minimal sampling time was required to artificially enforce the animal to take a decision. Odors are presented in a pseudo-randomized scheme (no more than two successive presentations of the same odor). The trained group of mice was evenly distributed between the setups and the valence of odorants in a pair (S+ and S−) was switched between animals. All activated glomeruli included in our quantification had therefore an equal chance to be associated with a rewarded odor and a non-rewarded odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>Upon presentation of a S+ odor, the animal generally continuously breaks the beam, whereas upon presentation of an S− odor an animal familiar with the apparatus usually quickly retracts its head. Reaction times were calculated as follows: for every time point, beam breakings for S+ and S− odors were compared by bootstrapping, yielding significance value as a function of time after odor onset. The last crossing of the p=0.05 line determined the reaction time. In very few cases, this did not coincide with the visually identified reaction time (point of largest curvature in the log[p]-t plot) and was corrected after visual inspection.</p><p>Following the training on 10<sup>0</sup> Cin vs Eu (1200 trials, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), mice were trained on a pair of natural odorants (cloves vs camphor) for another experiment, which took 2 weeks.

The number of repetitions for each odorant/dilution was four. The glomerulus detection procedure was done on individual time frames by drawing regions of interest (ROI). The ROI analyzed for the ΔR/R measurement, were selected based on the glomerular map obtained for each mice at the lowest dilution of four odorants used. This map was then used as the reference across different dilutions of the same odorant to calculate the ΔR/R. The same procedure was adopted for each experimental group. We excluded every region that appeared only in a single frame or that looked like blood vessels. For the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, frequency of respiration was detected via a directional airflow sensor (AWM2100V; Honeywell, Germany).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Andreas Schaefer for kindly providing the software controlling olfactometers.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Abraham et al. studied whether and how odor exposures to various conditions alter odor-evoked activities in the olfactory bulb as measured by optical intrinsic signal imaging (ISI). The authors found that glomerular activations were increased by paring of odors with positive and negative reinforcements compared to those evoked in naïve animals. In contrast, animals that received passive exposure did not show such a change. Furthermore, the learning-induced increase in activity lasted up to 5 weeks after training. The authors' finding that plastic changes in odor-evoked activity depend on reinforcement is very intriguing. The results are quite interesting since as the authors point out most work has focused on plasticity in central rather than peripheral processing. The pronounced increase they find in sensitivity of sensory input is therefore unanticipated. The study is thorough on several fronts. Animals undergo long-term training covering a wide range of concentrations for two different odor pairs. Maps are also tested across a concentration range, are very clear with good signal to noise, and the data are nicely quantified.</p><p>At the same time, the reviewers expressed several major related concerns, explained below:</p><p>1) Imaging in awake animals to avoid anesthesia effects is a strength, but raises questions about the source of changes in ISI responses. The authors should better address the role of altered sniffing for the trained odors. Potentiation could reflect neural processing but could also result from changes in sensory sampling by the animal. In awake animals sniff patterns vary strongly with history and expectation in both trained and untrained animals. Calcium imaging has also shown that sniffing modulates sensory input.</p><p>The discussion states that 'to our knowledge, slow signals like IOS are not sensitive to ... change of respiration'. While no evidence shows sniffing affects signals, no evidence shows that it does not. The coupling between presynaptic activity and intrinsic signals is not well understood. Wesson et al. is cited to state that fast sniffing 'is not affecting the odor evoked glomeruli activities', other papers from the Wachowiak group (Carey et al.; Verhagen et al.) do show that fast sniffing changes the temporal and spatial characteristics of maps. Neural changes are quite plausible but since they are the central conclusion of the paper it will be important to either experimentally rule out a role of sniffing, or present a more balanced discussion of the potential role of behavioral changes.</p><p>2) The passive exposure experience is not clear. It appears that the passive exposure condition involves odor plumes sent into the home cage as compared to the training condition where animals are in a testing apparatus and poking their noses into a sniff port. Is this right? I doubt that the dilutions of odors reaching the nose in these two situations are equivalent. I suspect the odors become highly diluted in the home cage, although they are likely absorbed by the bedding and so may be longer lasting. Also, mice may not sniff similarly during exposures in the passive and training conditions. Finally, the authors refer to “rewarded” and “non-rewarded” odors in the passive condition – what does this mean (perhaps they are referring to the valences in the training task and no rewards are given in the passive exposure)? Mice that were trained had a learning task, whereas the passive exposure did not involve learning of any sort - olfactory or whatever. I don't understand why they didn't have animals perform the same basic sniff and licking task, but with random rewards for both odors, or perhaps train with different odors than those used in the imaging. This would have controlled for the behavior and rewards.</p><p>3) The authors use the terms “glomeruli inputs” or “peripheral inputs” but the signal source of ISI is ambiguous compared to other techniques available more recently. The authors discuss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurden et al. (2006)</xref> to support a presynaptic origin of ISI signals but this issue is not completely resolved. The authors should discuss about the difficulty of identifying the sources of intrinsic signals. The discussions on the mechanisms should, therefore, be more balanced with respect to signal sources.</p><p>4) The use of “discrimination time” is uncommon in literature except the authors' groups. Note that the time point at which reaction time distributions differed statistically between go vs. no-go trials does not necessarily mean that the animal discriminated with high accuracy at that time point (the accuracy can be still very low (e.g., 51%) even when the distributions of reaction times are statistically different with many trials). The authors should report the median (or mean) and the entire distribution of reaction times.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02109.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Imaging in awake animals to avoid anesthesia effects is a strength, but raises questions about the source of changes in ISI responses.

Finally, the authors refer to “rewarded” and “non-rewarded” odors in the passive condition – what does this mean (perhaps they are referring to the valences in the training task and no rewards are given in the passive exposure)? Mice that were trained had a learning task, whereas the passive exposure did not involve learning of any sort - olfactory or whatever. I don't understand why they didn't have animals perform the same basic sniff and licking task, but with random rewards for both odors, or perhaps train with different odors than those used in the imaging. This would have controlled for the behavior and rewards</italic>.</p><p>In our freely moving behavioral setup, the odor delivery gets triggered only when the mouse is poking its head in the sampling port. In other words, without an action from the animal, no odor is presented. During a passive exposure task in the olfactometer, animals do not get a reward and thus tend to lose their interest for the task. In this context, getting a repetitive passive exposure would require either a very long time (to reach enough trials) or to select mice that are very curious (i.e., mice that do not lose interest in sampling the odor).</p><p>Likewise, we noticed that in a pseudo-randomized odor-reward association, animals tend to lose interest in odor sampling. The number of trials necessary to complete the discrimination task (4800 trials) is very large. We feared that running the same number of trials for a pseudo-randomized association with freely moving animals would not be possible with a reasonable amount of mice.</p><p>We agree with reviewer #1 that in our passive exposure paradigm, the concentration and duration of the presented odorants are most likely differing from the ones used with the trained animals. However, the paradigm we chose seemed the most feasible while remaining relevant.</p><p>An odor-reward pseudo-random association could have been used as another control experiment. A complete new set of experiments would need to be carried out to test the difference between active (non-random association) and passive (random association) exposure. Performing those tasks in head-restrained animals would help control the odor exposition in both conditions and would not depend on the animals’ motivation. Answering fully this question would be the scope of another study.</p><p>The reference to “rewarded” and “unrewarded” odor in the passive exposure context is now clarified in the main text.</p><p><italic>3) The authors use the terms “glomeruli inputs” or “peripheral inputs” but the signal source of ISI is ambiguous compared to other techniques available more recently. The authors discuss</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21"><italic>Gurden et al. (2006)</italic></xref> <italic>to support a presynaptic origin of ISI signals but this issue is not completely resolved. The authors should discuss about the difficulty of identifying the sources of intrinsic signals. The discussions on the mechanisms should, therefore, be more balanced with respect to signal sources</italic>.</p><p>We do have experimental evidence (manuscript submitted) showing that odor-evoked IOS originate from presynaptic inputs (OSN) in the olfactory bulb. Extending on Gurden article, we show not only that IOS do not depend on neuronal post-synaptic activity, but we also show that astrocytes do not contribute to IOS. We thus confirm the exclusive pre-synaptic origin of odor evoked intrinsic signals in the OB.</p><p><italic>4) The use of “discrimination time” is uncommon in literature except the authors' groups. Note that the time point at which reaction time distributions differed statistically between go vs. no-go trials does not necessarily mean that the animal discriminated with high accuracy at that time point (the accuracy can be still very low (e.g., 51%) even when the distributions of reaction times are statistically different with many trials). The authors should report the median (or mean) and the entire distribution of reaction times</italic>.</p><p>In the Result and Discussion sections of the main text we referred to “reaction time” while in the Methods we used a couple of times the term “discrimination time”. In the Methods, we now use the term “reaction/discrimination time” while referring to the previously published studies. When the animals perform with high accuracies, the discrimination time involve the comparison of reaction time measurements for both rewarded and non-rewarded odor. In the Results section as we report the time measurements when the animals perform with different accuracies we now use the term “reaction times” for the sake of clarity. The median of the distributions of reaction times is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
