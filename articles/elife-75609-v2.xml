treatment of tobacco addiction. During abstinence, environmental contexts associated with nicotine use can induce craving and contribute to relapse. The insular cortex (IC) is thought to be a critical substrate of nicotine addiction and relapse. However, its specific role in context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking is not fully known. In this study, we report a novel rodent model of context-induced relapse to nicotine-seeking after punishment-imposed abstinence, which models self-imposed abstinence through increasing negative consequences of excessive drug use. Using the neuronal activity marker Fos we find that the anterior (aIC), but not the middle or posterior IC, shows increased activity during context-induced relapse. Combining Fos with retrograde labeling of aIC inputs, we show projections to aIC from contralateral aIC and basolateral amygdala exhibit increased activity during context-induced relapse. Next, we used fiber photometry in aIC and observed phasic increases in aIC activity around nicotine-seeking responses during self-administration, punishment, and the context-induced relapse tests. Next, we used chemogenetic inhibition in both male and female rats to determine whether activity in aIC is necessary for context-induced relapse. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of aIC decreased context-induced nicotine-seeking after either punishment- or extinction-imposed abstinence. These findings highlight the critical role nicotine-associated contexts play in promoting relapse, and they show that aIC activity is critical for this context-induced relapse following both punishment and extinction-imposed abstinence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>addiction</kwd><kwd>relapse</kwd><kwd>insula</kwd><kwd>chemogenetics</kwd><kwd>fluorophotometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>016.Vidi.188.022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marchant</surname><given-names>Nathan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fulbright Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herman</surname><given-names>Rae J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Signal Processing in Neurons (SPIN) grant W1206-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghareh</surname><given-names>Hussein</given-names></name><name><surname>Zernig</surname><given-names>Gerald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The anterior insula cortex is a critical neural substrate of context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tobacco use is one of the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. In both abstinent and nonabstinent individuals with a history of nicotine use, exposure to cues associated with nicotine use provokes craving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">O’Brien et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Waters et al., 2004</xref>), which is strongly related to relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franklin et al., 2007</xref>). Environmental contexts also play a crucial role in nicotine craving. An environmental context associated with nicotine use retains the ability to reinstate cue-induced nicotine craving after extinction in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouton and Bolles, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferguson and Shiffman, 2009</xref>). Preclinical models have been used to study the role of contexts in relapse using the extinction-based context-induced reinstatement (or ABA renewal) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crombag and Shaham, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diergaarde et al., 2008</xref>). One potential limitation of the extinction-based models is that extinction does not capture the motivation for abstinence in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Epstein and Preston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Epstein et al., 2006</xref>). We recently developed a variation of this model in which an alcohol-reinforced response is suppressed by response-contingent punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marchant et al., 2013</xref>). These studies built on prior models using punishment to model the negative consequences of drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Panlilio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pelloux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vanderschuren and Everitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wolffgramm and Heyne, 1995</xref>). We and others have demonstrated context-induced relapse of alcohol, food, and cocaine seeking after punishment-imposed abstinence in an alternative context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouton and Schepers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farrell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marchant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marchant and Kaganovsky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marchant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pelloux et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pelloux et al., 2018b</xref>). The extent to which this phenomenon translates to context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking has not yet been demonstrated.</p><p>The insular cortex (IC) has been considered a critical neural substrate of nicotine addiction since it was discovered that some human patients with stroke-induced damage to their insula had a higher probability of smoking cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Naqvi et al., 2007</xref>). Subsequent clinical studies found that nicotine dependence is positively correlated with cue-induced activation in the insula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brody et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang et al., 2012</xref>), and there is a negative association between nicotine dependence and insula structural integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Insula activity is related to the processing of drug cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yalachkov et al., 2012</xref>), and cue-induced activity in the anterior insula indicates relapse vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gilman et al., 2018</xref>). Both nicotine withdrawal and acute abstinence lead to changes in anterior insula activity, and can also weaken connectivity between the default mode network and salience network at the resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding and Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lerman et al., 2014</xref>). In light of these findings, we focus here on the role of the rodent anterior insula cortex (aIC) in context-induced relapse of punished nicotine-seeking.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate for the first time, in both male and female rats, context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking after punishment of nicotine taking in an alternative context. Using the neuronal marker of activity Fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cruz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herdegen and Leah, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morgan and Curran, 1991</xref>), we show that context-induced relapse of punished nicotine-seeking is associated with increased Fos expression in aIC but not middle or posterior IC. We also found that context-induced relapse was associated with increased Fos in projections to aIC from both contralateral aIC and ipsilateral basolateral amygdala (BLA). Next, we used calcium imaging with fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>) to record the activity of aIC neurons throughout nicotine self-administration, punishment, and context-induced relapse. We found that aIC activity was associated with both nicotine infusion and punishment, and also nicotine-seeking during the relapse test. To determine a causal role for activity in aIC and context-induced relapse, we used chemogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>) to inhibit activity in aIC, and found that this decreased context-induced relapse after punishment. Because of potential differences in the neural control of context-induced relapse after punishment or extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marchant et al., 2019</xref>), we next tested chemogenetic inhibition of aIC after extinction. We also found that this inhibition decreased context-induced reinstatement of nicotine-seeking. These data highlight the critical role that nicotine-associated contexts play in promoting relapse, and they show that activity in aIC is necessary for this, further highlighting a critical role of this structure in relapse to nicotine use.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exp. 1: context-induced relapse to nicotine-seeking after punishment-imposed abstinence is associated with increased Fos expression in aIC, and projections from BLA to aIC</title><p>In this experiment, we aimed to identify total activity in IC and BLA, and the inputs to aIC, that are associated with context-induced relapse after punishment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the experimental timeline.

Tukey post hoc analysis revealed a significant difference between rats tested in nicotine versus punishment context in aBLA (p = 0.001) but not pBLA (p = 0.1).

The permutation tests comparing the activity of each of these outcomes also revealed significant differences between them (p &lt; 0.01). The most relevant observation is that calcium activity after a reinforced active nose-poke was significantly higher than a nonreinforced active nose-poke (+0.46 to +1.97 s; +2.34 to +7.80 s). This reflected a biphasic excitatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> response indicating increased activity in aIC related to the nicotine-associated cue and nicotine infusion. Another potentially interesting observation is that there was a significant difference between nicotine-reinforced active and inactive nose-pokes prior to the response (−0.67 s to 0) suggesting a role for aIC in encoding response–outcome contingencies.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> shows these data separately for the FR1, FR2, and FR3 sessions. Bootstrapping analysis revealed a significant increase from baseline for nicotine infusions from the beginning of self-administration and remains throughout. Permutation tests show that the second phase of the biphasic response to nicotine infusions is significantly higher during the FR1 sessions (active vs. inactive: +2.5 to +4.0 s), the FR2 sessions (active vs. inactive: +2.41 to +3.4 s), and the FR3 sessions (reinforced active vs. nonreinforced active: +2.72 to +5.6 s). In the FR1 sessions, the first phase of the biphasic response to nicotine (0 to +2.5 s) was not significantly different between active and inactive nose-pokes. This was also the case in the FR2 sessions, where the first phase of the biphasic response to nicotine was not significantly different between nicotine-reinforced and nonreinforced active nose-pokes. Finally, in the FR3 sessions the first phase of the biphasic response to nicotine was significantly higher after nicotine infusion compared to both nonreinforced active and inactive nose-pokes. These data suggest that activity in aIC may be specifically related to outcome processing under uncertainty. Specifically, because as the rats learn the new contingencies in self-administration (from FR1 to FR3) aIC activity decreases to nonreinforced nose-pokes, but remains high for the motivationally salient outcome.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> shows the individual data for the self-administration phase using mean d<italic>f</italic>/<italic>f</italic> to represent the change in signal from before the nose-poke to after.

We also observed a significant increase after inactive nose-poke (+0.15 s to +1.78).

First, there was no significant difference between unpunished nicotine-reinforced active nose-pokes and nonreinforced active nose-pokes. This reflects a change from the nicotine self-administration phase, as there was no selective encoding of nicotine infusion compared to nonreinforced active nose-pokes. Second, punished active nose-pokes were significantly higher than both unpunished nicotine-reinforced and nonreinforced active nose-pokes (+0.33 to +10 s), reflecting the profound response of aIC to footshock punishment. As observed during nicotine self-administration training, calcium activity in aIC was significantly higher prior to the nose poke for active responses (nonreinforced, unpunished nicotine, punished nicotine) compared to inactive nose-pokes (−0.73 to 0 s), indicating that aIC activity selectively increases for active nose-pokes prior to the response.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows the photometry data from the first punishment session. There are two important differences in this analysis from the overall analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). First, aIC calcium activity to the nicotine infusion (difference from baseline) is no longer significantly increased. This is a substantial change from nicotine during self-administration, but interestingly the overall analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) indicates that some degree of activity to nicotine infusions is present in the later punishment sessions. Second is that the response to punishment is far greater in magnitude and duration than both the other responses, as well as during the later punishment sessions. These data further indicate a role for aIC in outcome processing by suppressing the response to a rewarding outcome (i.e., nicotine) when a punishment contingency is introduced. When all punish sessions are combined, activity toward the punished outcome decreases and towards the nicotine increases. This is also consistent with a role for aIC in the integration of information by weighing the value of outcomes.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref> shows the individual data for the punishment phase using mean d<italic>f</italic>/<italic>f</italic> to represent the change in signal from before the nose-poke to after.

In female rats, we found that this form of relapse is associated with increased Fos expression in aIC, but not mIC or pIC, as well as BLA. Using retrograde tracing from aIC, we also show that inputs from contralateral aIC and ipsilateral anterior BLA are also activated during context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking. Using fiber photometry in female rats, we found that nicotine infusions during self-administration elicited phasic increases in aIC activity. During punishment, phasic increases in aIC activity were significantly greater for the punishment outcome compared to nicotine infusion and nonreinforced responses. During the final tests, we found increased activity associated with each response type. Interestingly, we also found that aIC activity increased prior to active but not inactive nose-pokes across each phase of the experiment, indicating a potential role of aIC in anticipating outcomes prior to actions, and/or selectively promoting reinforced responses. Next, we used chemogenetics in both male and female rats to show that inhibition of aIC decreased context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking after both punishment-imposed abstinence and after extinction, in both sexes. This study demonstrates the importance of nicotine-associated contexts in promoting relapse. We show that the aIC activity is critical for this effect, regardless of the mode of abstinence, further highlighting the important role of aIC in relapse of nicotine use.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>Several issues must be considered in the interpretation of these findings. In this study, we used intravenous nicotine during self-administration. While human nicotine use is primarily through cigarette smoking, intravenous administration of nicotine is reinforcing in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MacLean et al., 2021</xref>), demonstrating that a comparable route of administration supports reinforcement in humans. In addition, smokeless tobacco is also addictive and is responsible for many adverse health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nethan et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that vapor administration of nicotine is effective in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lallai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Smith et al., 2020</xref>), and vapor exposure causes both physical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Montanari et al., 2020</xref>) and psychological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lallai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Flores et al., 2022</xref>). The extent to which the route of self-administration changes the neurobiological substrates of context-induced nicotine-seeking is unknown, thus it will be of interest in future studies to determine this. However, because our focus is on the neurobiological substrates by which contexts associated with nicotine or punishment control nicotine-seeking in this study, we argue that the route of administration is unlikely to change the contribution of the aIC to these behaviors.</p><p>In the chemogenetics experiments, we used CLZ instead of clozapine-<italic>N</italic>-oxide (CNO) because CNO is converted to CLZ in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>), and made comparisons to the GFP group who also received CLZ. Various studies have estimated the conversion ratio of CNO to CLZ in rodents to be between 7.5% and 13% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacLaren et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manvich et al., 2018</xref>), which leads to an estimate dose used here of 5–10 mg/kg CNO, a well-established CNO dose with minimal side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mahler and Aston-Jones, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). We found no effect of manipulations on inactive nose-pokes or response latency, suggesting the effect of aIC inactivation is selective nicotine-seeking. However, in the absence of a vehicle control test session it is still not possible to completely rule out nonspecific effects of CLZ on nicotine-seeking. Finally, it is unlikely that hM4Di expression in the absence of ligand binding will change the function of aIC given the low basal activity of this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Urban and Roth, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We used different promoters for viral-induced expression of calcium indicator (jGCamP7f: hSyn) and chemogenetic inhibition (hM4Di: mCaMKIIa). Therefore, the observations reported in the photometry experiment likely include activity from a population of neurons that were not manipulated in the chemogenetics experiments. It will be of interest in future studies to identify potential variation in the responses of aIC neuronal subpopulations to nicotine infusions and punishment. Finally, in this experiment we cannot determine whether the change in aIC activity in response to the various outcomes in this experiment were dependent on a preceding action (i.e., nose-poke), or whether noncontingent outcomes would yield the same result. It will be of interest to measure aIC activity during noncontingent shock delivery, nicotine infusions, and nicotine-associated cues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of aIC, BLA, and BLA inputs to aIC in context-induced relapse to nicotine-seeking</title><p>In preclinical studies, the role of aIC in drug-seeking and relapse is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arguello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cosme et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pushparaj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Venniro et al., 2017</xref>). Bilateral electrical stimulation of the insula, at the level of mIC in this study, has been shown to decrease nicotine self-administration and both cue- and priming-induced reinstatement after extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pushparaj et al., 2013</xref>). Inactivation of both aIC and mIC can decrease nicotine self-administration, and both drug- and cue-induced reinstatement of extinguished nicotine-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pushparaj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forget et al., 2010</xref>). Activity in aIC is also necessary for relapse to alcohol seeking, particularly relapse in the punishment context after a period of extended home-cage abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we demonstrated a role for aIC in context-induced relapse to nicotine-seeking after both punishment- and extinction-imposed abstinence, further demonstrating the critical role of the aIC in the control of drug seeking.</p><p>Our results also show increased activity in BLA during context-induced relapse after punishment-imposed abstinence. The role of BLA in cue- and stress-induced reinstatement of nicotine-seeking has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khaled et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sharp, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yu and Sharp, 2015</xref>), but to our knowledge this is the first time that BLA has been implicated in context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking. We also show increased activation in the aBLA → aIC pathway during context-induced relapse. Anterior and posterior BLA have different output projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reppucci and Petrovich, 2016</xref>). Inactivation of aBLA decreases reinstatement of extinguished cocaine seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kantak et al., 2002</xref>), and inhibition of pBLA has been shown to potentiate food and alcohol seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McLaughlin and Floresco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Millan et al., 2015</xref>), as well as impair the expression of punishment leading to increased responses on a punished response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel and McNally, 2015</xref>). In this study, we show that overall Fos is higher in both aBLA and pBLA during context-induced relapse, but only aBLA projections to aIC had significantly greater activation during relapse, providing further evidence for a functional distinction between anterior and posterior BLA. Projections from BLA to aIC are critical for the maintenance of rewarding contextual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gil-Lievana et al., 2020</xref>). It has been proposed that the more posterior IC regions contribute strongly to the function of the aIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mesulam and Mufson, 1982</xref>). However, we did not observe any increased activity in mIC → aIC or pIC → aIC neurons (either ipsi- or contralateral) in rats tested for context-induced relapse. Given that in this experiment, the nicotine-associated context promotes nicotine-seeking, we propose that the motivational significance of the nicotine-associated context is likely mediated through increased activity in aBLA → aIC neurons and not mIC or pIC neurons.</p><p>We also found increased Fos in contralateral aIC projections during context-induced relapse. Corticocortical pathways are primarily thought to result in feedforward inhibition through targeting of the PV interneurons in the contralateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastasiades et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carson, 2020</xref>). The contribution of contralateral corticocortical projections to the functions of the frontal cortex is poorly understood, and the importance of this pathway in the regulation of context-induced nicotine-seeking studied is likewise undetermined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of aIC in the regulation of nicotine taking, punishment, and seeking</title><p>Our results using fiber photometry revealed increased aIC neural activity after nose-pokes in all phases of the task. While this suggests that aIC activity may be generally important in encoding response–outcome contingencies, we observed important differences in the patterns of activity in the different phases. In self-administration, aIC activity was highest following nose-pokes that lead to nicotine infusions. During punishment, the response to nonreinforced active nose-pokes changed such that there was no longer a difference between nicotine reinforced nose-pokes and nonreinforced active nose-pokes. This may reflect increased uncertainty of the outcome, as active nose-pokes during this phase could lead to nicotine infusion or nicotine infusion plus shock. Alternatively, it may reflect a change in the motivational determinant of behavior from appetitive to aversive. Indeed, aIC activity in response to the punished nose-pokes was significantly higher than all other outcomes. Such a change in the response of aIC to (nonpunished) nicotine infusion in punishment may reflect a reevaluation of nicotine reward encoding within aIC because the punishment overcomes the motivation for nicotine and suppresses nicotine-seeking. The observed reduction in nicotine-seeking in punishment is an adaptive response, thus we propose that during operant behavior aIC activity may be involved in the adaptation of behavior in response to both rewarding (i.e., nicotine) and aversive outcomes (i.e., punishment). It will be of interest in future studies to determine whether maladaptive responses to punishment, such as the punishment-resistance phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marchant et al., 2018</xref>), are associated with differences in the response to either reward or punishment in aIC. Interestingly, previous studies in alcohol trained rats have identified a critical role for aIC in punished alcohol seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Seif et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The IC is known to support a general function of integrating interoceptive information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Paulus and Stewart, 2014</xref>), which can play an important role in addictive behaviors. Interoceptive information and external signals from environmental cues converge at the anterior insula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Craig, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Livneh et al., 2020</xref>). In human clinical studies, insula activity is related to both positive and negative emotional reactivity. For example nicotine-associated cue exposure increases aIC activity in nicotine addicted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gilman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Janes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janes et al., 2017</xref>), and aversive motivational states associated with short-term nicotine withdrawal are also linked to changes in resting state functional connectivity between the insula and associated brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fedota et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ghahremani et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore in nonaddicted humans, insula activity is associated with punishment in a risky decision-making task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Von Siebenthal et al., 2020</xref>). Positive and negative valence signals are integrated in the insula to guide motivated behavior through increased activity in the divergent outputs of insula to various brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Paulus and Stewart, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Livneh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gehrlach et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gehrlach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shi and Cassell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reynolds and Zahm, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim and Lee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nicolas et al., 2021</xref>). It will be of interest in future studies to determine whether the activity related to both positive (nicotine infusion) and negative (punished nicotine infusion) outcomes recorded at the population level in our study are selectively encoded through different output pathways of aIC.</p><p>We also found that aIC activity increased relative to baseline prior to an active nose-poke, but not inactive nose-pokes. This pattern of activity was consistent throughout the experiment. Other studies have shown that activity in aIC is necessary for the performance of goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parkes and Balleine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parkes et al., 2015</xref>), but it is not necessary for initial acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parkes et al., 2016</xref>). We propose that the differential activity in aIC prior to active versus inactive nose-poke responses may indicate that aIC contributes to the encoding of expectations in operant behavior. This may be consistent with a broader role of IC in the prediction of bodily states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Livneh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Livneh and Andermann, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The observation that aIC activity in the relapse tests did not specifically relate to the response type or outcome. While this may be potentially inconsistent with the finding that chemogenetic inhibition decreases context-induced relapse, we think that the use of contextual cues to induce reinstatement may explain this. Photometry analyses are better suited to detecting phasic, rather than background changes in activity, which may be why we did not identify a specific signal related to relapse in the aIC photometry data. Fos studies are better suited for this, and we did observe increased Fos in aIC during context-induced relapse. Our aim in this study was to keep the behavioral task consistent across experiments; it will be of interest in future studies to test whether cue-induced reinstatement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forget et al., 2010</xref>), or trial-based nicotine-seeking using discriminative stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cervo et al., 2013</xref>), may more clearly reveal real-time aIC activity patterns associated with reinstatement. However, while relatively small, the significant difference in aIC calcium activity prior to active nose-pokes compared to inactive nose-pokes may also be of relevance here. Given that chemogenetic inhibition of aIC decreased active nose-pokes during the relapse tests, this small change in aIC calcium activity prior to the response may be a critical component of the initiation of nicotine-seeking responses, including the increased seeking within context-induced relapse.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Similarities and differences in the neural control of relapse after punishment versus extinction</title><p>Distinct learning mechanisms are responsible for behavioral control after extinction or punishment. Both are mediated by new context-dependent associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouton and Schepers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouton, 2002</xref>). However, punishment learning involves the acquisition of an association between the response and a novel outcome (shock), while extinction involves the acquisition of an association between the response and no outcome. Here, we show that bilateral chemogenetic inhibition of aIC decreases context-induced relapse of both punished and extinguished nicotine-seeking. Previous studies investigating relapse of either alcohol or cocaine seeking have identified differences in the mechanisms of relapse after punishment or extinction. For example, while dopamine receptor activation in nucleus accumbens core is critical for context-induced relapse of punished alcohol seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marchant and Kaganovsky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marchant et al., 2014</xref>), no increase in Fos was observed in nucleus accumbens core after context-induced relapse of extinguished alcohol seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hamlin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marchant et al., 2009</xref>). Inactivation of BLA potentiates cocaine seeking after punishment, but decreases cocaine seeking after extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pelloux et al., 2018b</xref>). Meanwhile, inactivation of central amygdala had no effect on cocaine seeking after punishment, but decreased cocaine seeking after extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pelloux et al., 2018b</xref>). We propose that this finding demonstrates the importance of the aIC in context-induced relapse, regardless of the method used to impose abstinence. It has previously been demonstrated that inhibiting aIC decreases relapse of methamphetamine seeking after choice-based voluntary abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Venniro et al., 2017</xref>). As such the role of aIC in relapse is likely broader than just for context-induced relapse of nicotine-seeking. It will be of interest in future studies to determine whether this distinction holds true for other drugs of abuse, or indeed for other types of voluntary abstinence such as choice for social reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Venniro et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>We sought to investigate the neural substrates of context-induced relapse to nicotine-seeking after punishment-imposed abstinence.

Our findings further highlight the critical importance of the anterior IC as a target for nicotine addiction treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>We obtained 91 Wistar rats (29 males and 62 females), aged 10–12 weeks upon arrival, from Charles River Laboratories B.V.

CTb was not counted for the first six sections in the ipsilateral aIC, where the CTb injection was located, because the cell detection feature could not reliably discriminate between CTb-positive cell and the CTb injection. The total number of positive cells per region was divided by the area in mm<sup>2</sup>. To identify CTb + Fos cells, each region of interest was exported to ImageJ. The overlays representing the cells (CTb or Fos) were then filled, converted to a binary layer, and then multiplied using the ImageJ function ‘Image calculator’. The nuclei that remained as a result of this function were counted as double-labeled CTb + Fos neurons. CTb + Fos double labelling is reported as a percentage of total CTb neurons for that given region of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Ex vivo slice physiology</title><p>Coronal slices were prepared for electrophysiological recordings.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Taffe as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further analyses and precisions are needed for the photometry approach. Individual reviews provided by all referees suggest multiple lines of improvements. While we recognize that it may be difficult to address each issue, it is expected that the paper is substantially strengthened here by providing statistical analyses, possibly new angles to look at the data and by adding on the discussion of the approach and how it complements with the DREADD experiments.</p><p>2) Given that no vehicle-treated groups were included in the study to formally rule out any off-site effect of clozapine, further caution may be needed to interpret the DREADD experiments. See referee 3 in particular.</p><p>3) The rationale for focusing on the contralateral aIC and ipsilateral BLA inputs needs to be more clearly explained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In experiment 1 the authors focused their analysis specifically to contralateral aIC and ipsilateral BLA inputs. Why did the authors focused their analysis on these two specific inputs? Did the authors look at over inputs? In the same experiment, the quantification of CTb and fos staining has been performed in the anterior and posterior BLA. Are there any anatomical or functional justifications for this anteroposterior segregation?</p><p>2. The authors made a significant effort to characterize the coding properties of aIC neurons during nicotine self-administration, punishment, and context-induced relapse. However, several concerns are raised in the analysis of the calcium signal.</p><p>For each of the 3 phases of the task (Self-administration, punishment, relapse) the authors report a peri-event analysis of the calcium signal between pre and post nose-poke averaging the signal across the sessions. However, it cannot be ruled out that the calcium signal change between sessions (i.e: first and last self-administration session, first and second relapse test…) and within sessions (i.e: comparison between first and last nose-poke of self-administration session or relapse test). This deep analysis would strengthen the results and would bring a deeper understanding of the coding properties of aIC neurons between the different phases of the task. Finally, a correlational analysis between the calcium signal and the behavioral measures (i.e: Nose-pokes, nicotine intake…) would reinforce the conclusions.</p><p>3. In line with the previous comment, more details about the fibre photometry recording experiments would be helpful. Were the rats habituated to be tethered before to starting the procedure? State in the methods that the recording was performed every day of the task. Moreover, in the fibre photometry experiment the sessions of self-administration and punishment are reduced to 1h compared to the other experiments with 2-h/session. This difference suggests that the rats received less nicotine intake and context/cues exposure, it should be acknowledged. Did the authors compare the average nicotine intake between the experiments?</p><p>4. Concerning the representation of the calcium signal differences. To help the reader appreciate the variation of signal I would suggest representing the most relevant comparisons as a histogram of the average of the calcium transient (i.e calcium transient average before nose-poke for active NP Nic vs calcium transient after nose-poke for active NP Nic).</p><p>5. Although discussed in the paper one important limitation in the methodology and the interpretation of the results is the lack of consistency between the promoteor of the viral vector used. In the fibre photometry experiments, the authors used hSyn promoteor suggesting that they recorded the calcium signal from all neurons of the aIC (glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic interneurons) whereas in the chemogenetic experiments they used CaMKII promoteor allowing to specifically target the glutamatergic neurons. Fiber photometry recording using CaMKII promoteor would strengthen the results and the interpretation of the coding and causal properties of the aIC neurons.</p><p>6. The authors made an effort to include both male and female rats in their study. However, both sexes are not included in all the experiments making difficult to conclude about presence or lack of sex differences. It should be at least acknowledged.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an excellent paper and the authors should consider addressing the two points listed in the weaknesses section.</p><p>1. The authors should consider discussing the limitations of interpretation of the fibre photometry data, particularly in regards to alternative interpretations of the increase in activity in the active nose poke -&gt; punished condition and how this may be due to the multiple outcomes (nicotine infusion + punishment). It maybe useful to indicate on the graphs when the footshock and nicotine infusions took place.</p><p>2. The authors should consider testing if there is an effect on responding with chemogenetic inhibition of the anterior insular cortex in a procedure where responding is high (e.g. nicotine or food self-administration). Interpretation of the current data in Context B could be confounded by a floor effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75609.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further analyses and precisions are needed for the photometry approach.

See referee 3 in particular.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is potential for non-specific effects of clozapine in our experiments, and have updated the discussion to address this. To further attempt to address this, we perform additional statistical analysis on the inactive nose-pokes and found no effect of clozapine, despite the rate of inactive nose-pokes being relatively high (going some way to rule out floor effects).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The rationale for focusing on the contralateral aIC and ipsilateral BLA inputs needs to be more clearly explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explained this rationale in the revised manuscript. We choose to focus on the most prominent inputs to the aIC, the more caudal regions of IC and the BLA. Only ipsilateral BLA was counted because we found no projections to aIC from contralateral BLA, which is consistent with the literature. We have revised the manuscript to more carefully explain these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. In experiment 1 the authors focused their analysis specifically to contralateral aIC and ipsilateral BLA inputs. Why did the authors focused their analysis on these two specific inputs? Did the authors look at over inputs? In the same experiment, the quantification of CTb and fos staining has been performed in the anterior and posterior BLA. Are there any anatomical or functional justifications for this anteroposterior segregation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not focused on other inputs in this study. We report the anterior and posterior BLA because we counted 6 sections per rat in the AP axis (range approx. Bregma -1.92 to -3.12), and there are studies demonstrating differences in both anatomy and function in anterior versus posterior BLA. In the revised manuscript we describe some of these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors made a significant effort to characterize the coding properties of aIC neurons during nicotine self-administration, punishment, and context-induced relapse. However, several concerns are raised in the analysis of the calcium signal.</p><p>For each of the 3 phases of the task (Self-administration, punishment, relapse) the authors report a peri-event analysis of the calcium signal between pre and post nose-poke averaging the signal across the sessions. However, it cannot be ruled out that the calcium signal change between sessions (i.e: first and last self-administration session, first and second relapse test…) and within sessions (i.e: comparison between first and last nose-poke of self-administration session or relapse test). This deep analysis would strengthen the results and would bring a deeper understanding of the coding properties of aIC neurons between the different phases of the task. Finally, a correlational analysis between the calcium signal and the behavioral measures (i.e: Nose-pokes, nicotine intake…) would reinforce the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are many potential advantages to a more refined analysis. In the revised manuscript we report analysis of the different FR stages of self-admin (FR1, FR2, and FR3), as well as the first punishment session, and the first and second relapse test. Due to the variability of the data, and statistical limitations, we cannot go further than this, for example looking within sessions (e.g. first vs. last nose-poke), or the last punishment session because of the low number of recorded events.</p><p>We think these new analyses identify a number of interesting patterns. First in self-administration we show that the response to nicotine is present in the first sessions (FR1), and remains present throughout self-administration. Second, we show that the response to punishment dramatically overshadows that of nicotine initially, and this response to punishment declines as behaviour decreases (with the limitation of a smaller number of events in the last punishment session). Also in punishment we show that the response to nicotine infusions is no longer significant above baseline in the first session. Third we show that the selective increase in activity prior to a response (i.e. active versus inactive) is only present in the first test session.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In line with the previous comment, more details about the fibre photometry recording experiments would be helpful. Were the rats habituated to be tethered before to starting the procedure? State in the methods that the recording was performed every day of the task. Moreover, in the fibre photometry experiment the sessions of self-administration and punishment are reduced to 1h compared to the other experiments with 2-h/session. This difference suggests that the rats received less nicotine intake and context/cues exposure, it should be acknowledged. Did the authors compare the average nicotine intake between the experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, and have added information about this in the Methods in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Concerning the representation of the calcium signal differences. To help the reader appreciate the variation of signal I would suggest representing the most relevant comparisons as a histogram of the average of the calcium transient (i.e calcium transient average before nose-poke for active NP Nic vs calcium transient after nose-poke for active NP Nic).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Figure 2—figure supplement 2 showing the calcium transient calculated using mean df/f for the 2 second preceding the nose-poke and 5 seconds after. We do this for every data trace that we reported in the main figure (2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Although discussed in the paper one important limitation in the methodology and the interpretation of the results is the lack of consistency between the promoteor of the viral vector used. In the fibre photometry experiments, the authors used hSyn promoteor suggesting that they recorded the calcium signal from all neurons of the aIC (glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic interneurons) whereas in the chemogenetic experiments they used CaMKII promoteor allowing to specifically target the glutamatergic neurons. Fiber photometry recording using CaMKII promoteor would strengthen the results and the interpretation of the coding and causal properties of the aIC neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. In the revised discussion we raise this issue and discuss potential future directions related to these point</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors made an effort to include both male and female rats in their study. However, both sexes are not included in all the experiments making difficult to conclude about presence or lack of sex differences. It should be at least acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We have acknowledged this point in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an excellent paper and the authors should consider addressing the two points listed in the weaknesses section..</p><p>1. The authors should consider discussing the limitations of interpretation of the fibre photometry data, particularly in regards to alternative interpretations of the increase in activity in the active nose poke -&gt; punished condition and how this may be due to the multiple outcomes (nicotine infusion + punishment). It maybe useful to indicate on the graphs when the footshock and nicotine infusions took place.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have changed the figures to more clearly show the experimental design.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should consider testing if there is an effect on responding with chemogenetic inhibition of the anterior insular cortex in a procedure where responding is high (e.g. nicotine or food self-administration). Interpretation of the current data in Context B could be confounded by a floor effect.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this potential issue, we conducted additional analysis on the latency to the first active and inactive nosepoke (Figure 4—figure supplement 1; Figure 5—figure supplement 1) which shows that there was no difference between inhibited aIC and control. In the discussion we argue that this observation further illustrates the specificity of the effect of aIC inhibition of nicotine seeking.</p></body></sub-article></article>
