One aspect of PDAC is elevated ATP levels, pointing to the purinergic axis as a potential attractive therapeutic target. Mediated in part by highly druggable extracellular proteins, this axis plays essential roles in fibrosis, inflammation response, and immune function. Analyzing the main members of the PDAC extracellular purinome using publicly available databases discerned which members may impact patient survival. <italic>P2RY2</italic> presents as the purinergic gene with the strongest association with hypoxia, the highest cancer cell-specific expression, and the strongest impact on overall survival. Invasion assays using a 3D spheroid model revealed P2Y<sub>2</sub> to be critical in facilitating invasion driven by extracellular ATP. Using genetic modification and pharmacological strategies, we demonstrate mechanistically that this ATP-driven invasion requires direct protein-protein interactions between P2Y<sub>2</sub> and Î±V integrins. DNA-PAINT super-resolution fluorescence microscopy reveals that P2Y<sub>2</sub> regulates the amount and distribution of integrin Î±V in the plasma membrane. Moreover, receptor-integrin interactions were required for effective downstream signaling, leading to cancer cell invasion. This work elucidates a novel GPCR-integrin interaction in cancer invasion, highlighting its potential for therapeutic targeting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>purinergic signalling</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd><kwd>DNA-PAINT</kwd><kwd>3D modelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A27781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Edward P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A25137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Edward P</given-names></name><name><surname>Grose</surname><given-names>Richard P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC0227</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomas Bort</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/T008709/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joseph</surname><given-names>Megan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DHF\R1\191019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simoncelli</surname><given-names>Sabrina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGS\R2\202038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simoncelli</surname><given-names>Sabrina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N014308/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Nicolas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011704</institution-id><institution>Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tissue Bank Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kocher</surname><given-names>Hemant M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New role of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-Î±V integrin interactions in ATP-driven pancreatic cancer cell invasion provides a potential anti-metastatic target for pancreatic cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>PDAC, which accounts for 90% of diagnosed pancreatic cancer cases, has the lowest survival rate of all common solid malignancies. Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment, yet more than 80% of patients present with unresectable tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kocher, 2023</xref>). Consequently, most patients survive less than six months after diagnosis, resulting in a five year survival rate of less than 5% when accounting for all disease stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bengtsson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kocher, 2023</xref>). Despite continued efforts, this statistic has improved minimally in the past 50 years. Due to increasing incidence, late detection, and lack of effective therapies, pancreatic cancer is predicted to be the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths by 2040 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rahib et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Failure to significantly improve clinical management is mainly a result of chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neuzillet et al., 2017</xref>), thus it is of vital importance to find new therapeutics that can improve patient survival. PDAC is characterized by its desmoplastic stroma, with dense fibrosis leading to impaired vascularisation and high levels of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Maggio, 2016</xref>). Lack of oxygen leads to cellular stress and death, resulting in the release of purines such as ATP and adenosine into the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forrester and Williams, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pellegatti et al., 2008</xref>). Extracellular ATP concentration in PDAC is 200-fold more than in normal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that purinergic signaling could represent an effective therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.</p><p>The proteins underpinning purinergic signaling comprise several highly druggable membrane proteins involved in the regulation of extracellular purines, mainly ATP and adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burnstock and Novak, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boison and Yegutkin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Extracellular ATP is known to promote inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurashima et al., 2012</xref>), growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ko et al., 2012</xref>), and cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MartÃ­nez-RamÃ­rez et al., 2016</xref>). Contrastingly, adenosine is anti-inflammatory and promotes immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>). There are ongoing clinical trials in several cancers, including PDAC, for drugs targeting the ectonucleotidase CD73 (NCT03454451, NCT03454451) and adenosine receptor 2 A (NCT03454451) in combination with PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors and/or chemotherapy. However, a Phase II multi-cancer study evaluating an anti-CD73 and anti-PD-L1 combination was withdrawn due to minimal overall clinical activity (NCT04262388). This suggests that the oncogenic impact of purinergic signaling may act via pathways other than immunosuppression and highlights the need for the further mechanistic understanding of purinergic signaling in PDAC to exploit its full therapeutic potential.</p><p>Here, we combine bioinformatic, genetic, and drug-based approaches to identify a novel mechanism mediating ATP-driven invasion, uncovering a new therapeutic target in PDAC, a cancer of unmet clinical need. Beginning with an in-depth in silico analysis of the purinergic signaling transcriptome in PDAC, using publicly available patient and cell line databases, we build on bioinformatic data associating the purinergic receptor P2Y<sub>2</sub> with PDAC. After validating the expression of P2Y<sub>2</sub> in human PDAC, we focus on identifying the function of the receptor in cancer cells. In vitro data underline the importance of P2Y<sub>2</sub> as a strong invasive driver, using a 3D physio-mimetic model of invasion. Finally, using a super-resolution imaging technique, DNA-PAINT, we characterize the behavior of P2Y<sub>2</sub> in the membrane at the single molecule level, demonstrating the nanoscale distribution and interaction of this receptor with RGD-binding integrins in promoting pancreatic cancer invasion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The PDAC extracellular purinome associates with patient survival, hypoxia score and cell phenotype</title><p>The extracellular purinome encompasses 23 main surface proteins, including pannexin 1, P2X ion channels, ectonucleotidases, and the P2Y, and adenosine GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Virgilio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interrogating public databases, we determined which purinergic signaling genes significantly impact pancreatic cancer survival. First, we examined the pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) database from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n=177 patients), analyzing overall survival hazard ratios based on purinergic signaling gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of five purinergic genes correlated with decreased patient survival, with high <italic>P2RY2</italic> expression being associated with the highest hazard ratio (2.99, 95%, CI: 1.69â5.31, log-rank p=8.5 Ã 10<sup>â5</sup>). We then examined the mutational profile and mRNA expression level of purinergic genes in patients. Using cBioPortal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao, 2013</xref>), we generated OncoPrints of purinergic signaling genes from PAAD TCGA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), observing few genetic alterations in 0â3% of tumors and a heterogeneous percentage of tumors with high mRNA expression (z-score &gt;1) for each purinergic gene. PDAC molecular subtypes associated with purinergic signaling genes were varied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The qPAINT index histograms obtained from P2Y<sub>2</sub> and Î±V DNA-PAINT data sets were fitted with a multi-peak Gaussian function, identifying peaks located at multiples of a qPAINT index value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> 0.011 Hz and 0.009 for the P2Y<sub>2</sub> and Î±V docking-imager pairs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These values were thus used to quantify the exact number of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and Î±V proteins in all the clusters of single-molecule localization in the DNA-PAINT data sets. By combining qPAINT with spatial statistics, we recovered a good estimation of the ground truth position of all the proteins in the DNA-PAINT data and quantified protein clustering.</p><p>We have previously analyzed GPCR oligomerization quantitatively using DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy of P2Y<sub>2</sub> in AsPC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>), where we observed a decrease in P2Y<sub>2</sub> oligomerization upon AR-C treatment. Hence, we questioned whether the RGD motif in P2Y<sub>2</sub> affected receptor distribution and clustering. We imaged AsPC-1 P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>CRISPR</sup> cells transfected with P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> or P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> in the absence or presence of 100 ÂµM ATP for 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), observing a 42% decrease in the median density of P2Y<sub>2</sub> proteins at the membrane when P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> cells were treated with ATP, compared to control (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, although a slight decrease in the density of P2Y<sub>2</sub> proteins on P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> cells was observed following ATP treatment, this was not statistically significant (p=0.1570). The density of P2Y<sub>2</sub> proteins and protein clusters in both P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> and P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> controls were equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>; p&gt;0.9999), indicating similar expression of the receptor at the surface in both control conditions. Interestingly, the density of P2Y<sub>2</sub> clusters decreased significantly in both conditions when treated with ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; 43% decrease, p&lt;0.0001 for P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup>, and 48% decrease, p=0.0002 for P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup>). We repeated these studies with normal AsPC-1 cells (untransfected and with unaltered P2Y<sub>2</sub> expression) treated with ATP +/-cRGDfV, only observing a reduction of P2Y<sub>2</sub> at the membrane with ATP alone (68% decrease, p&lt;0.0001), while co-treatment with cRGDfV prevented this change (p&gt;0.9999; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). These findings highlight that the RGD motif is required for Î±V integrin to control P2Y<sub>2</sub> levels at the membrane.</p><p>Turning to Î±V integrins, we observed an increase in the density of Î±V molecules and Î±V clusters at the membrane when stimulating P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> with ATP (165 Î±V molecules/ROI, IQR = 162.75; 6.5 Î±V clusters/ROI, IQR = 8.75) compared to P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> without stimulation (58 Î±V molecules/ROI, IQR = 41; 2.5 Î±V clusters/ROI, IQR = 2; p=0.0003; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). This phenomenon was also observed with normal AsPC-1 cells, with significantly more Î±V molecules and clusters (p=0.0382 and p=0.0349) detected following ATP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C, D</xref>). In absence of stimulation, P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> transfected cells exhibited more Î±V molecules and clusters at the membrane (182 Î±V molecules/ROI, IQR = 262.75; 9 Î±V clusters/ROI IQR = 14) compared to P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> cells (p=0.0003, p=0.0024, respectively). However, treating P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> cells with ATP did not result in significant changes in Î±V molecules and clusters (p=0.7086; p=0.1846). When the number of clusters was normalized with the number of Î±V molecules, to obtain the percentage of Î±V in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), there was no significant difference between conditions (p&gt;0.9999), indicating that the increase in the number of Î±V clusters was due to an increase in the number of Î±V proteins at the membrane. Of note, the percentage of P2Y<sub>2</sub> clusters significantly decreased in P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> cells when treated with ATP compared to all other conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate an RGD motif-dependent function of activated P2Y<sub>2</sub> in localizing integrin Î±V to the membrane.</p><p>Nearest neighbor distance (NND) was used to analyze homo and heterotypic protein-protein interactions between P2Y<sub>2</sub> and Î±V. NND ranges were selected by using the approximate dimension of the antibodies (~14 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan, 2008</xref>), integrins (5â10 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lepzelter et al., 2012</xref>), and GPCRs (~3 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) and corroborating them with the NND histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>) to predict the NND range in nm indicating a protein-protein interaction. We detected a higher percentage of integrin Î±V proteins in &lt;50 nm proximity to P2Y<sub>2</sub> in P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> cells following ATP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>; 103% increase, p=0.0143). In contrast, P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> cells stimulated with ATP showed a 43% decrease (p=0.0101) in Î±V molecules in close proximity to P2Y<sub>2</sub> in comparison to unstimulated cells. Analyzing the percentage of Î±V proteins with NND in the 20â100 nm range, we saw a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). ATP-stimulated P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> and unstimulated P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> cells showed an increased percentage of Î±V proteins spaced at this range compared to untreated P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> cells (98% increase with p=0.0132 and 89% increase with p=0.0181). No significant changes were observed in NND of &lt;20 nm between Î±V proteins in any of the conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). In contrast, P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGD</sup> molecules were in significantly closer proximity to each other compared to P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> in control and stimulated conditions (p&lt;0.0001 and p=0.007) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). In summary, our SMLM studies demonstrate a reciprocal interaction between Î±V integrin and P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors, where P2Y<sub>2</sub> can alter integrin localization to the plasma membrane while Î±V integrins influence activated P2Y<sub>2</sub> membrane localization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The RGD motif in P2Y<sub>2</sub> is involved in integrin signaling</title><p>There is growing evidence of the importance of endosomal GPCR signaling and its potential relevance in disease and therapeutic opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calebiro and Godbole, 2018</xref>). As we identified the RGD motif in P2Y<sub>2</sub> having a possible role in receptor internalization, integrin dynamics, and invasion, we proceeded to look at integrin signaling through phosphorylation of FAK (p-FAK) and ERK (p-ERK) from 0 to 1 hr after treating with 100 ÂµM ATP. AsPC-1 cells displayed a significant increase of FAK and ERK phosphorylation after 15 min of ATP stimulation, which was abrogated by concomitant targeting of P2Y<sub>2</sub> with AR-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When impairing the RGD motif function in P2Y<sub>2</sub> with cRGDfV or by transfecting AsPC-1 P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>CRISPR</sup> cells with the P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup> mutant, p-FAK, and p-ERK levels decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).

Purinergic signaling includes many druggable targets that have been related to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Synnestvedt et al., 2002</xref>), immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fong et al., 2020</xref>), and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2015</xref>), but have been relatively underexplored in PDAC. In this study, we used publicly available databases to identify purinergic signaling genes that could be promising targets for PDAC, determining P2Y<sub>2</sub> as a driver of pancreatic cancer cell invasion. Extracellular ATP stimulated invasion in a 3D spheroid model of PDAC; an effect blocked by targeting P2Y<sub>2</sub> genetically and pharmacologically. Mechanistically, we identified that the RGD motif in the first extracellular loop of P2Y<sub>2</sub> is required for ATP-driven cancer invasion. Importantly, quantitative DNA-PAINT super-resolution fluorescence microscopy revealed the role of this RGD motif in orchestrating the number of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and Î±V integrin proteins at the plasma membrane, upon ATP stimulation.</p><p>Purinergic signaling has been associated classically with hypoxia and immune function in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Virgilio et al., 2018</xref>). One of the first reports of hypoxia-inducing ATP release in cells identified an increase of extracellular ATP in rat heart cells when kept in hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forrester and Williams, 1977</xref>). PDAC is a highly hypoxic cancer, with high levels of ATP reported in the tumor interstitial fluid of human and mouse PDAC tissues compared to healthy tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). This vast release of ATP results in immune-mediated inflammatory responses via immune cells expressing purinergic signaling receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiarella et al., 2021</xref>). Expression of most purinergic genes was associated predominantly with immune cells, immunogenic PDAC subtype, and low hypoxia scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). In contrast, expression of genes correlated with worse survival and hypoxia (<italic>PANX1</italic>, <italic>NT5E</italic>, <italic>ADORA2B,</italic> and <italic>P2RY2</italic>) was associated with tumor cells and the squamous PDAC subtype, correlating with hypoxia, inflammation, and worse prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>). The role of CD73 in PDAC has been examined in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2021</xref>) (NCT03454451, NCT03454451). In contrast, the adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> receptor has not been well studied. Adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> receptor requires larger agonist concentrations for activation compared to other receptors in the same family, such as adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruns et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xing et al., 2016</xref>), and receptor expression has been reported to increase when cells are subjected to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feoktistov et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, HIF-1Î± has been shown to upregulate A<sub>2B</sub> and P2Y<sub>2</sub> expression in liver cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kwon et al., 2019</xref>). From our analyses, P2Y<sub>2</sub> was associated with the worst patient overall survival, highest patient hypoxia scores, and strongest correlation with cancer cell expression compared to other purinergic genes. These observations were supported by published immunohistochemical staining of 264 human PDAC samples, showing that P2Y<sub>2</sub> localized predominantly in cancer cells in human PDAC and that P2Y<sub>2</sub> activation with ATP led to elevated HIF-1Î± expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we decided here to explore P2Y<sub>2</sub> in greater depth.</p><p>P2Y<sub>2</sub> has been associated with cancer cell growth and glycolysis in PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Combination treatment of subcutaneous xenografts of AsPC-1 or BxPC-3 cells with the P2Y<sub>2</sub> antagonist AR-C together with gemcitabine significantly decreased tumor weight and resulted in increased survival compared to placebo or gemcitabine monotherapy control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Surprisingly, GSEA results of two different cohorts suggested a possible additional function of P2Y<sub>2</sub> in invasion. Increased glycolysis and cytoskeletal rearrangements have been linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2020</xref>), and both events could occur downstream of P2Y<sub>2</sub> activation. P2Y<sub>2</sub> has been implicated in invasive phenotypes in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MartÃ­nez-RamÃ­rez et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, high P2Y<sub>2</sub> expression in patients was related to integrin signaling. The RGD motif in the first extracellular loop of P2Y<sub>2</sub> results in a direct interaction of P2Y<sub>2</sub> with RGD-binding integrins, particularly integrins Î±VÎ²3 and Î±VÎ²5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erb et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ibuka et al., 2015</xref>). This interaction can exert phenotypic effects â for example, the binding of P2Y<sub>2</sub> to integrins via its RGD motif is necessary for tubule formation in epithelial intestinal cell line 3D models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ibuka et al., 2015</xref>). We focus here on the importance of the RGD motif of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and its key for integrin interaction in a cancer context. We were able to abrogate ATP-driven invasion using either the P2Y<sub>2</sub> selective antagonist AR-C or by blocking P2Y<sub>2</sub>-integrin complexes using the selective Î±VÎ²3 cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide inhibitor cRGDfV. Likewise, spheres made using ASPC-1 P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>CRISPR</sup> or PANC-1 cells transfected with mutant P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup>, which decreases the affinity of P2Y<sub>2</sub> for integrins, did not invade in response to ATP stimulation. Altogether, these results (1) support P2Y<sub>2</sub> involvement in PDAC cell invasion, (2) show the RGD motif is essential for this function, and (3) identify the mechanism for this to be caused by P2Y<sub>2</sub>-integrin complexes. Despite efforts, there are currently no clinically efficacious P2Y<sub>2</sub> antagonists, with poor oral bioavailability and low selectivity being major issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neumann et al., 2022</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that P2Y<sub>2</sub> can also be targeted by blocking its interaction with RGD-binding integrins, due to its dependence on integrins for its pro-invasive function.</p><p>GPCR-integrin crosstalk is involved in many biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teoh et al., 2012</xref>). Only one study has directly examined the spatial distribution of integrins and GPCRs, however, this relied on IF analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erb et al., 2001</xref>), where only changes in the micron scale will be perceived, hence losing information on the nanoscale distances and individual protein interactions. Here, we present a method to image integrin and GPCR dynamics using quantitative DNA-PAINT super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schnitzbauer et al., 2017</xref>), allowing spatial and quantitative assessment of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and integrin Î±V interactions at the single protein level. Following ATP stimulation, the number of P2Y<sub>2</sub> proteins at the plasma membrane decreased significantly after 1 hr, implying receptor internalization, in line with previous work showing P2Y<sub>2</sub> at the cell surface was reduced significantly after 1 hr of UTP stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tulapurkar et al., 2005</xref>). Of note, cytoskeletal rearrangements, which we have also observed upon ATP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), were required for P2Y<sub>2</sub> clathrin-mediated internalization, and authors noted that P2Y<sub>2</sub> was most likely in a complex with integrins and extracellular matrix-binding proteins. Cells expressing RGE mutant P2Y<sub>2</sub> or treated with cRGDfV, did not show significant changes in P2Y<sub>2</sub> levels at the membrane upon ATP treatment, thus implicating the RGD motif in P2Y<sub>2</sub> in agonist-dependent receptor internalization, though we have focused on motility phenotype in this work.</p><p>P2Y<sub>2</sub> affecting cell surface redistribution of Î±V integrin has been reported, with Î±V integrin clusters observed after 5 min stimulation with UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chorna et al., 2007</xref>). We observed an increased number of Î±V integrin molecules and clusters 1 hr after ATP stimulation, although this increase in clusters was mainly due to the increase in the total number of Î±V integrins at the membrane. The distance between Î±V integrin and P2Y<sub>2</sub> molecules decreased (NND &lt;50 nm) with ATP stimulation, indicating possible interaction. In contrast, with mutant P2Y<sub>2</sub><sup>RGE</sup>, no significant ATP-dependent changes in the number of P2Y<sub>2</sub> or Î±V integrin proteins at the membrane were observed. The same phenomenon was observed when treating normal AsPC-1 cells (untransfected and with no alteration to P2Y<sub>2</sub>) with cRGDfV and ATP. We speculate that by reducing the ability of integrins to bind to the RGD of P2Y<sub>2</sub>, through receptor internalization, RGE mutation or through cRGDfV treatment, there is less RGD-triggered integrin endocytosis, hence less integrin recycling and an increase of integrins at the cell surface. Western blot results supported our postulated role of the RGD motif in P2Y<sub>2</sub> regulating downstream integrin signaling through FAK and ERK, leading to cancer cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).

To avoid suboptimal clustering results; ROIs were selected such that they do not intersect with cell boundaries and the regions were the same for P2Y<sub>2</sub> and Î±V images. Single-molecule localizations within each ROIs were grouped into clusters using the DBSCAN modality from PALMsiever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pengo et al., 2015</xref>) in MATLAB (Version 2021a)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pengo et al., 2015</xref>). This clustering algorithm determines clusters based on two parameters. The first parameter is the minimum number of points (âminPtsâ) within a given circle. For minPts, we chose a parameter in accordance with the binding frequency of the imager strand and acquisition frame number; in our case this was set to 10 localizations for all the experiments. The second parameter is the radius (epsilon or âepsâ) of the circle of the cluster of single molecule localizations. This is determined by the localization precision of the super-resolved images and, according to the nearest neighbor based analysis was ca. to 10 nm for all the images.</p><p>For qPAINT analysis, we used a custom-written MATLAB (Version 2021a) code: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Simoncelli-lab/qPAINT_pipeline">https://github.com/Simoncelli-lab/qPAINT_pipeline</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joseph and Simoncelli, 2023</xref>).

pancreatic adenocarcinoma? Because these tumors have such a strong propensity for invasion and metastasis, identifying actionable targets is of high importance. Using a combination of in silico and in vitro modeling, they identify a role for purinergic G-protein coupled receptor P2Y<sub>2</sub> as a critical node in mediating PDAC invasion, and they find that blocking the crosstalk between P2Y<sub>2</sub> and Î±V integrins via a peptide inhibitor blocks PDAC invasion, which may have clinical utility. Thus their study provides insights into both the basic biology of PDAC but also identifies a new target.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86971.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02yrq0923</institution-id><institution>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86971.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

A link is found between P2Y2-integrin interaction and cancer invasion, highlighting this as a novel therapeutic target. The mechanism is interesting and general well explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the novelty of the therapeutic target presented in this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>As P2Y2 is highly expressed by other cell types found with tumours, including vascular endothelium and leukocytes, the authors should reflect on this as a confounding factor in the analysis of adrenocarcinoma gene expression analysis. I appreciate the RNAscope work may resolve this issue to some extent.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that P2Y2 is known to be expressed in other cell types. RNAscope did not show convincing staining in PDAC normal adjacent tissue (was similar to negative staining), perhaps due to the challenging nature of pancreatic tissue with respect to RNA degradation. We have resolved this issue by including single cell RNA-seq of normal human pancreas for P2Y2 from Protein Atlas (Sup. Figure 2B), which shows expression in several cell types, mainly endocrine cells, and macrophages. We now mention this in line 142 : âP2Y2 is known to be expressed at low levels in normal tissues but interestingly RNAscope did not detect this. This data suggest (1) the lower limits of the technique compounded by the challenge of RNA degradation in pancreatic tissue and (2) supports that in tumour tissue where it was detected there was indeed overexpression of P2Y2, in line with the bioinformatic data. Interrogating single cell P2Y2 RNA expression in normal PDAC from proteinatlas.org (Karlsson et al., 2021), expression was found at low levels in several cells types, for example in endocrine cells and macrophages (Sup.

However, these concentrations are supramaximal for P2Y2 activation, at which ATP has an approximate EC50 of 100nM. Coupled with the fact that many cell types, including cancer cells, constitutively secrete ATP, there is an opportunity to explore the effects of lower ATP concentrations in some assays, or provide some concentration-response relationship to give more confidence of P2Y2-dependent effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and we agree that 100 Î¼m can be a high concentration, albeit one that is frequently used throughout the literature. We have now included a concentration-response relationship (Sup. Figure 2D) showing that ATP causes cytoskeletal changes that are P2Y2 dependent most prominently at 100 uM, the concentration that, as the reviewer has also corroborated, is similar to the concentration of ATP found in tumours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the authors describe the use of cancer cells where P2Y2 has been knocked out using CRISPR. Does this KO have an effect on cancer invasion? The effect of ARC should be absent in these cells and give confidence the effects of ARC are P2Y2-dependent, as some off-target effects of this antagonist have been reported. To explore the influence of constitutive P2Y2 activity, the authors should explore the effects of ARC alone in some assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that including more AR-C only experiments would be informative, so we have included a 3D sphere invasion assay with our CRISPR cell line treated with and without AR-C that shows no effect in invasion (<italic>p</italic> = 0.4413) (Sup.

Though ATP/UTP are applied at supramaximal concentrations for P2Y2 activation, the influence of ATP in the cell culture microenvironment without exogenous application is not explored. One would predict that scavenging extracellular ATP with apyrase would negatively impact invasiveness and the proximity of integrin and P2Y2 without ATP/UTP application if constitutively secreted ATP is involved. Pharmacological manipulation of ectonucleotidase activity is an alternative. Experimental route to explore this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the title of our article to âPurinergic GPCR-integrin interactions drive pancreatic cancer cell invasionâ. Our 3D sphere experiments with the CRISPR cell line show a reduction in invasion without exogenous application of ATP, which we also see to a lesser extent in our siRNA P2Y2 cell line. We have tested our sphere model with apyrase but unfortunately, the buffer used for apyrase to work is not compatible with our gel composition. Pharmacological manipulation would be a very good alternative if the cells used expressed high levels of CD39 or PANX1, which unfortunately they donât. We hypothesise that most basal extracellular ATP in our 3D spheres comes from hypoxic areas that cause cell death, just as is postulated for tumours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Immunoprecipitation experiments of native proteins would be more convincing data that P2Y2 and integrin physically interaction, as opposed to being in close proximity.

The possibility of this close proximity being by chance is accounted for in the computational nearest neighbour distance calculation by calculating points randomly distributed. This random distribution calculation also helps in overcoming artifacts of interaction due to overexpression, as the random distributed points are the same number of points as the proteins detected in each condition for each region of interest. Importantly, we also performed DNA-PAINT in using untransfected AsPC-1 thus endogenous levels (no receptor overexpression or alteration) and saw similar results (Sup. Figure 4A-D), thus we are confident of the interactions reported.</p><p>Finally, we alter the RGD motif, which underpins the physical interaction, and see significant changes that match observations in previous publications using the P2Y2 agonist UTP, mentioned in the discussion: Line 398 âFollowing ATP stimulation, the number of P2Y2 proteins at the plasma membrane decreased significantly after one hour, implying receptor internalisation, in line with previous work showing P2Y2 at the cell surface was reduced significantly after one hour of UTP stimulation (Tulapurkar et al., 2005).â and Line 408: âP2Y2 affecting cell surface redistribution of Î±V integrin has been reported, with Î±V integrin clusters observed after 5 min stimulation with UTP (Chorna <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007)â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is currently not clear what the mechanistic relationship between P2Y2 activity, P2Y2-integrin proximity and RGD motif is.

We trust that the new data provided (as discussed above) have resolved the concerns of the reviewer as we now have provided an explanation for the concentrations used. We do rely on overexpressed receptors for a small portion of our experiments, however, all experiments with overexpressed receptors were then tested in cells with endogenous expression of P2Y2 and used pharmacological means to show the same behaviour. We have now clarified this. We have also included in the discussion a sentence about the mouse experiment performed by Hui et al. with regards to reduced tumour growth when targeting P2Y2: Line 365: âCombination treatment of subcutaneous xenografts of AsPC-1 or BxPC-3 cells with the P2Y2 antagonist AR-C together with gemcitabine significantly decreased tumour weight and resulted in increased survival compared to placebo or gemcitabine monotherapy control (Hu et al., 2019).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Considering the fact that most PDAC are characterized by a high level of extracellular purines content, authors decided to study the expression of the 23 genes coding for membrane proteins involved in the binding or transport of purines in available PDAC transcriptomic cohorts. This approach led to the identification of P2Y2, a GPCR, as the best predictor for the worst survival of patients. Using in vitro models, they show that P2Y2 expression is associated with increased invasion capacity of pancreatic cancer cells and that this pro-invasive effect is dependent on the interaction of P2Y2 with Î±V integrin via the RGD motif.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>It is not clear to me why authors decided at one point to perform a GSEA comparing low and high mRNA expression of P2Y2 and why they decided to focus on the potential interaction of P2Y2 with integrin Î±V. As a GPCR, activation of P2Y2 leads to the activation of several downstream signaling pathways that may directly impact the adhesion, migration, and invasion properties of cells. Moreover, despite the presence of the RGD motif in P2Y2, it is not excluded that it may bind (maybe more efficiently) to other &quot;cell adhesion&quot; molecules.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise if the link between the GSEA figure and focusing on the potential integrin interaction was not clear. We have now performed GSEA using the panther gene set library, which includes a âIntegrin signalling pathwayâ gene set. This was the top ranked gene set in both cohorts and we have substituted the GSEA figure for this instead (Figure 2D). We trust that the narrative of the manuscript and our rationale to pursue the importance of integrin interaction is now clear.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and believe that P2Y2 may bind to other molecules important in cell adhesion. We studied integrin interactions due to the clear relationship of P2Y2 and integrins in patient data, which was not as evident with other binding partners. Furthermore, this relationship is unexplored in cancer and offers novel therapeutic strategies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, if Î±V can regulate P2Y2 signaling, what about the regulation of Î±V signaling pathways by P2Y2? Î±V integrin has to bind to a Î² subunit and, depending on the identity of the Î² subunit, may have distinct regulations and so different impact on cell invasion. How P2Y2 can interfere with these Î±/Î² ratios?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and have now included western blots showing the impact of P2Y2 treatment on integrin signalling through FAK and ERK (Figure 5). We agree that the Î² subunit may have distinct regulation and outputs, but this is outwith the scope of our current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While it has been shown in other studies, in this work, there is no real proof of the interaction between P2Y2 and Î±V. Only in Figure 4I, where the authors look at the NND &lt;20nm between both proteins, we can see that only 1 to 2 % of Î±V is in close proximity with P2Y2, which seems very low.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point as it has made us realise that our chosen NND of &lt;20 nm, in an attempt of being cautious, consistant, and only select true physical interaction was too strict for some conditions. We have adjusted this to the maximum NND required for the proteins to physically touch based on individual protein and antibody dimensions (Sup. Figure 5A). The resulting changes are &lt;50 nm for P2Y2-Î±V, &lt;20 nm for Î±V-Î±V and &lt;40 nm for P2Y2-P2Y2, giving more realistic percentages for each condition. We then verified this range using the NND histograms now included in the manuscript, which additionally provide information about the distribution of the NNDs in each protein-protein dynamic (Sup. Figure 5B). One important point is that integrins are part of a large number of protein complexes and interact with many proteins, hence only a small percentage will be interacting with P2Y2.</p><p>Surprisingly, in the absence of ATP, P2Y2 RGE mutant, which should no more interact with Î±V, show a 2 to 3 fold more vicinity to Î±V compared to WT P2Y2. How can the authors explain this?</p><p>We agree that this is a surprising, but robust discovery. By altering the RGD motif, there may be less RGD-triggered integrin endocytosis, leading to increased integrins at the surface. We have included this hypothesis in the discussion in Line 417. The RGE mutation has less affinity to integrins, meaning it still retains some ability to bind to integrins. Hence by chance, a higher number of integrins will result in a higher number of interactions with the RGE. We are planning to interrogate the internalisation dynamics in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For DNA-PAINT experiments, the authors only focus on membrane proteins whose amounts are balanced by internalization, recycling and export from internal compartment. As claimed, but not demonstrated by the authors, interaction of P2Y2 and Î±V may interfere with all these steps, thereby increasing or decreasing the cell surface expression of both proteins. Hence, it would be useful to (1) control proteins levels by western blot, especially for the overexpressed P2Y2, to be sure that they are the same, (2) block internalization and/or export to decipher the important steps.</p><p>In fact, all these main questions are raised by the authors in the end of the discussion but so far, they only show that the RGD motif has an impact on the biological role of P2Y2 (cell invasion) and on the membrane dynamic of Î±V and itself.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions:</p><p>1) In the course of our attempts to perform co-IP for P2Y2 and Î±V we could confirm that P2Y2 expression levels were equivalent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), but the problems with anti-Î±V antibodies prevented completion of the experiment.

The authors than take an effort in functional characterization of P2Y2 and demonstrate that downregulation/deletion of P2Y2 leads to abrogation of ATP activated invasion in hanging drop spheroid model system in a very reasonable and scientifically good way.

In this part, the authors rely a lot on correlation of hypoxia and define high hypoxia scores and low hypoxia scores from previously published datasets. Although hypoxia surely plays an important biological condition in the PDAC, I am not sure I get the connection between purinome pathway and hypoxia. Few sentences give a broad introduction about hypoxia-purinome connection in the discussion part of the manuscript, but I think the readership would benefit from more specific statements (which drug, which hypoxic target, which system-mouse/human/cells, what was the exact discovery) and connect those specific statements to the work that has been done here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the study can benefit from more information about the hypoxia-purinergic signalling link.

One of the first reports of hypoxia inducing ATP release in cells identified an increase of extracellular ATP in rat heart cells when kept in hypoxic conditions (Forrester and Williams, 1977).

Surprisingly, there is relatively little knowledge about hypoxia in PDAC and I would not suggest using it in this context as a predictor. Reports do suggest that hypoxia forces the emerging of resistant phenotypes but if the authors want to use hypoxic signatures, they have to fortify better (with literature) why do they choose hypoxia and what is the hypothesis that connects hypoxia to purinome, what makes this connection worth investigating.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising the question of PDAC and worse prognosis with hypoxia.

We have changed âtumour coreâ to tumour cell compartment and have cited data that demonstrate hypo-vascularisation found in the juxta-tumoural stroma, due to PDAC cells inhibiting angiogenesis (PMID: 27288147). This paper supports our hypothesis of distribution of oxygen being reduced in the tumour area. Hence why we hypothesise that purinergic genes would be preferentially expressed in the tumour area: Line 112 âWe hypothesised that genes related to high hypoxia scores would be expressed preferentially in the tumour cell compartment, as PDAC cells inhibit angiogenesis, causing hypo-vascularisation in the juxta-tumoural stroma (Di Maggio et al., 2016).â</p><p>We would like to clarify that we do not believe that only the tumour core suffers from hypoxia, we hypothesise that there is more hypoxia in the tumour cell areas. Although there are no reports of only the tumour core suffering from hypoxia, there is evidence of the tumour epithelial region of the cancer having a greater range of hypoxia (1-39%) compared to the stromal (1-13%) (PMID: 26325106). Moreover, all our analyses point to most purinergic genes differentially expressed in patients with high hypoxic scores being also related to cancer cells and the tumour region.

To demonstrated the mRNA is really found in tumor and not in normal adjacent tissue or stroma, I would strongly suggest to increase the number of samples here. The authors should perhaps try to co-localize ISH signals with IF/IHC for some other cancer cell marker, e.g. PanCK or GATA6/KRT81 in human samples to differentiate basal-like from classical samples; if possible, I would even suggest to perform immunohistochemistry instead of RNA scope and confirm the presence of the receptor.

There have been recent controversies with reference to EMT and cancer metastasis (PMID:31666716) but more importantly we see changes in cell morphology 1 hour after ATP treatment, indicating it is not/not just EMT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How was 100ÂµM/5ÂµM chosen as a working concentration?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included figures showing different concentrations of ATP (Sup. Figure 2D) and AR-C (Sup. Figure 2E) to illustrate how the concentrations were selected based on the greatest change in morphology for ATP and the full recovery of original cell morphology for AR-C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>AsPC-1 is also known as the cell line that gladly migrates and invades, usually used in metastatic modeling of PDAC. Would be interesting to see if another cell line that is not that migrative (HPAF II) presents the same effectâ¦</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point, although we havenât performed experiments with low migrative cells, later on the work, invasion assays with the epithelial cell line BxPC-3, which has a very different migrative nature, presented the same effect (Sup. Figure 3G, F). We also perform invasion assays with PANC-1 cells, which also recapitulate an invasive phenotype when transfected with P2Y2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is treatment with ATP inducing expression of P2RY2 maybe? What is happening with Intergrin expression upon ATP treatment? Since the hypothesis is that extracellular ATP is driving the invasion, I would certainly suggest to investigate if ATP treatment induces expression of P2RY2 in a time and dose dependent manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now changed the title to âPurinergic GPCR-integrin interactions drive pancreatic cancer cell invasionâ, hence shifting from a focus on extracellular ATP and focusing on the effects of the RGD motif in invasion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3:</p><p>The authors made very good efforts here to provide functional evidence that P2Y2 is really involved and essential for ATP induced invasion in PDAC cells. They performed an 3D hanging drop spheroid model for invasion in co-culture with stellate cells and show that ATP treatment leads to invasive behavior that is than blocked by addition of P2Y2 antagonist or RGD blocking peptides. Although stellate cells are a nice add-on, keeping in mind the very complex tissue micro-environment of the PDAC, I don't rate the presence of stellate cells here as essential. Are the results the same when experiments are performed without stellate cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point, as it has allowed us to clarify that the stellate cells are crucial for this assay to work as they are essential for the formation of the cancer spheres due to their matrix deposition. We have included the hanging drop with and without stellate cells to illustrate this point (Sup. Figure 3A)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EMT markers increase upon ATP stimulation, do not increase under siRNA downregulation of P2Y2?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we thank the reviewer for the comment, but we are not focusing on EMT, given the rapidity of the phenotype we observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors downregulate the P2Y2 using the siRNA/CRISPR-Cas9 approach and confirm that the P2Y2 is really involved in the invasive spread also using the specific RGD block. Experiments in the figure 3 are fairly done and provide functional evidence for the hypothesis. I would suggest that for clarity reasons on every panel (A, B,Câ¦) is written which cell line is used (mostly Aspc1) and for the siRNA experiment I would suggest writing directly on the figure the time points (48h-72h post transfection) and shortly explain in the text why was mRNA evaluated as the measure of siRNA efficacy and not the protein? Probably the antibody problem, though western-blot applicable antibodies are available.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging that the experiments in figure 3 provide functional evidence for our hypothesis. We agree with the reviewer and for clarity have included the cell line in each panel and the time point post transfection. We now include a Western blot showing protein levels in the siRNA P2Y2 treatment (Sup. Figure 3I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, for providing higher impact, I would encourage the experiments to be performed (at least in part) in a PDAC cell line with epithelial morphology (eg. HPAF II or any other that expresses the P2Y2 to a reasonable level).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that performing this experiment with an epithelial morphology cell line provides higher impact, hence why we performed the experiment in BxPC-3 cell lines, perhaps missed in Sup. Figure 3G and H. We now highlight that they are epithelial-like in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: By using the DNA-PAINT method, the authors demonstrated that integrin av and P2Y2 physically interact in the cell membrane over the RGD domain and these interactions are essential for ATP induced P2Y2 mediated invasion in Aspc1 cells. The performed work seems plausible, however, I leave the technical evaluation of this experiment to experts in the field.</p><p>General suggestion:</p><p>I believe the work would benefit from a clinical/patient perspective if the authors show by immunohistochemistry in PDAC tissue samples that P2Y2 is localized at the invasive front/or metastasis. Is there a surrogate marker that can be used to label ATP rich regions in the tumor, are those regions at the invasive front? Are the P2Y2 positive cells those cells at the invasive front?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion but immunostaining has already been performed on a large cohort of 264 PDAC patients (PMID: 30420446) and expression was consistent throughout the tumour cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
