We develop a coarse-grained model of capsid proteins and NAs with which we investigate assembly dynamics and thermodynamics. In contrast to recent theoretical models, we find that capsids spontaneously ‘overcharge’; that is, the negative charge of the NA exceeds the positive charge on capsid. When applied to specific viruses, the optimal NA lengths closely correspond to the natural genome lengths. Calculations based on linear polyelectrolytes rather than base-paired NAs underpredict the optimal length, demonstrating the importance of NA structure to capsid assembly. These results suggest that electrostatics, excluded volume, and NA tertiary structure are sufficient to predict assembly thermodynamics and that the ability of viruses to selectively encapsidate their genomic NAs can be explained, at least in part, on a thermodynamic basis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00632.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00632.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00632.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses are infectious agents made up of proteins and a genome made of DNA or RNA. Upon infecting a host cell, viruses hijack the cell’s gene expression machinery and force it to produce copies of the viral genome and proteins, which then assemble into new viruses that can eventually infect other host cells. Because assembly is an essential step in the viral life cycle, understanding how this process occurs could significantly advance the fight against viral diseases.</p><p>In many viral families, a protein shell called a capsid forms around the viral genome during the assembly process. However, capsids can also assemble around nucleic acids in solution, indicating that a host cell is not required for their formation. Since capsid proteins are positively charged, and nucleic acids are negatively charged, electrostatic interactions between the two are thought to have an important role in capsid assembly. However, it is unclear how structural features of the viral genome affect assembly, and why the negative charge on viral genomes is actually far greater than the positive charge on capsids. These questions are difficult to address experimentally because most of the intermediates that form during virus assembly are too short-lived to be imaged.</p><p>Here, Perlmutter et al. have used state of the art computational methods and advances in graphical processing units (GPUs) to produce the most realistic model of capsid assembly to date. They showed that the stability of the complex formed between the nucleic acid and the capsid depends on the length of the viral genome. Yield was highest for genomes within a certain range of lengths, and capsids that assembled around longer or shorter genomes tended to be malformed.</p><p>Perlmutter et al. also explored how structural features of the virus—including base-pairing between viral nucleic acids, and the size and charge of the capsid—determine the optimal length of the viral genome. When they included structural data from real viruses in their simulations and predicted the optimal lengths for the viral genome, the results were very similar to those seen in existing viruses. This indicates that the structure of the viral genome has been optimized to promote packaging into capsids. Understanding this relationship between structure and packaging will make it easier to develop antiviral agents that thwart or misdirect virus assembly, and could aid the redesign of viruses for use in gene therapy and drug delivery.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00632.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00632.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>virus capsid</kwd><kwd>self assembly</kwd><kwd>RNA Packaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI080791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hagan</surname><given-names>Michael F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation XSEDE (Keeneland, Longhorn, and Condor)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TG-MCB090163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hagan</surname><given-names>Michael F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computer simulations reveal that viral nucleic acids have an ideal structure for being packaged into outer protein shells called capsids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For many viruses the spontaneous assembly of a protein shell, or capsid, around the viral nucleic acid (NA) is an essential step in the viral lifecycle. Identifying the factors which enable capsids to efficiently and selectively assemble around the viral genome could identify targets for new antiviral drugs that block or derail the formation of infectious virions. Conversely, understanding how assembly depends on the NA and protein structure would guide efforts to reengineer capsid proteins and human NAs for gene therapy applications. From a fundamental perspective, high-order complexes that assemble from protein and/or NAs abound in biology. Learning how the properties of viral components determine their co-assembly can shed light on assembly mechanisms of a broad array of structures and the associated selective pressures on their components. In this article, we use GPU computing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeBard et al., 2012</xref>) and a simplified, but quantitatively testable, model to elucidate the effects of electrostatics, capsid geometry, and NA tertiary structure on assembly.</p><p>Assembly around NAs is predominately driven by electrostatic interactions between NA phosphate groups and basic amino acids, often located in flexible tails known as arginine rich motifs (ARMs) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneemann, 2006</xref>). There is a correlation between the net charge of these protein motifs and the genome length for many ssRNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belyi and Muthukumar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2008</xref>), with a ‘charge ratio’ of negative charge on NAs to positive charge on proteins typically of order 2:1 (i.e., viruses are ‘overcharged’). Electrophoresis measurements confirm that viral particles are negatively charged (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Serwer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Serwer and Griess, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Porterfield et al., 2010</xref>]), though these measurements include contributions from the capsid exteriors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bozic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zlotnick et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that viral genome lengths are thermodynamically optimal for assembly, meaning that their lengths minimize the free energy of the assembled nucleocapsids. However, while estimates of optimal lengths have varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">van der Schoot and Bruinsma, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelescu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belyi and Muthukumar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siber and Podgornik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ting et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siber et al., 2012</xref>), recent theoretical models based on linear polyelectrolytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siber and Podgornik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ting et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ni et al., 2012</xref>) have consistently predicted that optimal NA lengths correspond to ‘undercharging’ (fewer NA charges than positive capsid charges). These results lead to the conclusion that capsid assembly around genomic (overcharged) NAs requires an external driving force such as a Donnan potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ting et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, viruses preferentially assemble around genomic length RNAs even in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comas-Garcia et al., 2012</xref>), in the absence of such a driving force.</p><p>The effect of NA structural features other than charge remains unclear. In some cases, genomic NAs are preferentially packaged over others with equivalent charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borodavka et al., 2012</xref>) due to virus-specific packaging sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bunka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borodavka et al., 2012</xref>). However, experiments on other viruses have demonstrated a striking lack of virus-specific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Porterfield et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comas-Garcia et al., 2012</xref>). For example, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) proteins preferentially encapsidate BMV RNA over the genomic CCMV RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comas-Garcia et al., 2012</xref>). Since the two NAs are of similar length, the authors propose that other structural features, such as NA tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoffe et al., 2008</xref>), may drive this preferential encapsidation. However, the relationship between NA structure and assembly has not been explored.</p><p>To clarify this relationship, we use a computational model to investigate capsid assembly dynamics and thermodynamics as functions of NA and capsid charge, solution ionic strength, capsid geometry, and NA size (resulting from tertiary structure).

We find that overcharging occurs spontaneously, requiring no external driving force. When base-pairing is accounted for, predicted optimal NA lengths are consistent with the genome size for a number of viruses, suggesting that electrostatics and NA tertiary structure are important factors in the formation and stability of viral particles. Our predictions can be tested quantitatively in in vitro packaging experiments (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Porterfield et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cadena-Nava et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Comas-Garcia et al., 2012</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Model</title><p>Our coarse-grained capsid model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is motivated by the recent observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kler et al., 2012</xref>) that purified simian virus 40 (SV40) capsid proteins assemble around ssRNA molecules in vitro to form capsids comprising 12 homopentamer subunits. We model the capsid as a dodecahedron, composed of 12 pentagonal subunits (each of which represents a rapidly forming and stable pentameric intermediate, which then more slowly assembles into the complete capsid, as is the case for SV40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2002</xref>]).

Projecting the density of packaged polymer segments onto angular coordinates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) reveals that the polymer is not homogenously distributed throughout the capsid surface, but instead has enriched density at the vertices and edges relative to the subunit faces. This result is consistent with experimental observations that nucleic acids form dodecahedral cages in viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Speir and Johnson, 2012</xref>), and our model may describe scaling of the optimal charge ratio with volume for these capsids.

This effect can be explained by the fact that nucleotide–nucleotide interactions which drive NA structure formation effectively cancel some NA charge–charge repulsions and result in NA structures that are compact in comparison to linear polymers with the same lengths. Thus encapsulated NAs incur smaller excluded–volume interactions, electrostatic repulsions, and conformational entropy penalties during assembly.</p><p>However, the connection between the size of a molecule in solution and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>eq</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is surprisingly subtle. As described in the section ‘Base-paired polymer’, we have quantified base-pairing patterns by their maximum ladder distance (MLD), which counts the maximum number of base-pairs along any non-repeating path across the NA and thus describes the extent of the molecule in the secondary structure graph space.

These interconnecting (bridging) segments are the primary origin of overcharging. Earlier approaches which assumed spherical symmetry could not capture these bridging segments and thus did not predict overcharging. The significance of bridging segments to overcharging is clearly revealed by the dependence of optimal length on capsid size under constant ARM length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref>).

Secondly, our results delineate how the genome length which is most favorable for assembly depends on virus-specific quantities such as capsid charge, capsid volume, and genomic tertiary structure. While the correlation between predicted optimal lengths and viral genome sizes suggests that our results have biological relevance, the physical foundations of our model can be tested via controlled in vitro experiments. As noted above, several existing experimental observations agree with our results. A positive correlation between protein charge and amounts of packaged RNA has been demonstrated through experiments in which the charge on capsid protein ARMs was altered by mutagenesis (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaplan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Venter et al., 2009</xref>]).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While both reviewers agree that the study is of very high interest, there is a need to provide further clarification and justification for the treatment of electrostatic screening in the model and its consequences on the robustness of the overall conclusions. The manuscript is clearly and cleanly written, logical, beautifully carried out, and of significance for the understanding of viral assembly and function. The authors first show dynamical assembly of capsids around NAs occurs optimally for parameters that thermodynamically optimize assembly. This allows for more controlled thermodynamic simulations that disentangle the role of charge, excluded volume, and tertiary structure have in the assembly process. Significantly, the authors find that assembled capsids spontaneously overcharge in the absence of eternal fields or influences. In all, one finds no flaws with the manuscript, either stylistically or in terms of the science. The study adds significantly to the field of virus biophysics. However, because the simulations are based on a simplified model of viral capsid assembly, there could be serious concerns about all the approximations that are made. Some clarification by the authors would be welcome to further strengthen the study.</p><p>1) Part of the appeal of the study is the simplicity of the underlying model, which confers great clarity to the analysis and the description of the results. The nicest and most impressive results are probably summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. However, upon more scrutiny, one does also start to worry about the significance of the approximations that are being made, and how much confidence one has in the robustness of the conclusions. For example, it would be nice to convey visually how the viruses differ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The match between computations and length of genome is nice, but it is not clear what is the underlying basis for the agreement. Is the size of the base-paired length packed merely reflecting the accessible volume inside the capsid? The model is simple enough that one should be able to summarize what are the principal differences between the different viruses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (size of full capsid, charge of the arms, etc.).</p><p>2) Much is made of the observation that the viruses are overcharged, that isi.e., the ratio between the negative (nucleic acid) over the positive (protein arms) charges is larger than 1. Essentially, this means that the assembled capsid with its packed nucleic acid chain is overall negative. The text is emphatic: “our simulations show that ‘overcharged’ capsids are favored thermodynamically and kinetically, even in the absence of cellular factors or other external effects.” But while one does not dispute the outcome of the simulations, it is disappointing that no simple argument is provided nor sketched to explain <italic>why</italic> this is so (a back-of-the-envelope type of explanation). This would add much clarification on the underlying reasons for this outcome of the model. More importantly, it isn't clear that the charge ratio predicted by the model is correct or even reasonable. For instance, what about the likely presence of magnesium ions, which would presumably cancel out the charge of the excess of negative charges? The ionic screening model used here is Debye-Huckel and the model does not incorporate the possible effect of divalent binding. Furthermore, is it experimentally known that these capsids are negatively charged? This ought to be detectable through electrophoretic mobility measurements (zeta potential). A figure supplement provides a comparison of a calculation with explicit ions presented as a validation of the Debye-Huckel approximation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>). Not much detail is offered about this test; presumably this is for a 1:1 electrolyte in a primitive model representation of ionic solution (continuum dielectric solvent and hard-sphere ions), but no ion radii are given so it is hard to see how realistic this model is. And again, what about these divalent ions binding to the DNA?</p><p>3) Additional cause for concern about the treatment of ionic screening arise from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, which shows the residual excess chemical potential for adding one segment to the nucleic acid chain when it is in bulk solution (red line) or when it is in a capsid (blue line). What is noteworthy here is that the residual excess chemical potential is positive for both cases. Normally, insertion of one charged particle in a continuum solvent with an electrolyte is a negative number because the interaction of the charged particle with the surroundings, which comprises solvent and mobile counterions, is favorable. This excess free energy to add one chain segment in solution would probably be negative, even within the context of Debye-Huckel. We believe that the numbers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> are positive because this interaction between the segment of the salt solution is not included in the present model. The latter probably only treats the Debye-Huckel screening of the interactions of the charged segment with other segments (which is positive and unfavorable) but the self-energy is neglected. Please confirm.</p><p>If this is so, the problem is that the favorable self-energy is probably much reduced once the segment is inserted inside the capsid because there is much less room to have counterions in the densely packed capsid. To take an analogy, this is a bit like an implicit solvent that changes the bare Coulomb's law q1*q1/r12 to q1*q2/(eps*r12), but which ignores the Born self-energy of the charges. Ignoring the self-term amounts to assume that it cancels out. This is okay if the environment is assumed to remain roughly the same. Is there enough free space left inside the capsid for the implicit solvent to account for the same Debye-Huckel treatment as in the bulk solution? What is the total volume of the interior of the capsid? What is the total fraction of volume occupied by the nucleic acid? How much free space is left for ionic solution (needed to justify the Debye-Huckel screening treatment)? Please clarify this issue and explain why the implicit treatment of counterions is sufficiently accurate here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00632.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Part of the appeal of the study is the simplicity of the underlying model, which confers great clarity to the analysis and the description of the results.

Please see the response to point 3 below for additional details.</p><p><italic>The model is simple enough that one should be able to summarize what are the principal differences between the different viruses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (size of full capsid, charge of the arms, etc.)</italic>.</p><p>The differences between the capsid structures were summarized in a supplementary file. To better draw attention to this table, we have moved it to the main text (now <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We have also added additional information (“Genome Length, Model Optimal Length, and Occupied Volume Fraction”).</p><p><italic>2) Much is made of the observation that the viruses are overcharged, i.e., the ratio between the negative (nucleic acid) over the positive (protein arms) charges is larger than 1. Essentially, this means that the assembled capsid with its packed nucleic acid chain is overall negative.

This would add much clarification on the underlying reasons for this outcome of the model</italic>.</p><p>The simulations show that overcharging is a consequence of two factors – the electrostatic screening and geometry. Namely, it is geometrically not possible for every charge on the encapsulated NA to approach within a Debye length of an opposite charge on the capsid. It is primarily the presence of these charges not able to interact with capsid charges that lead to overcharging. Earlier models were not able to capture this because the locations of charges were smeared by the assumption of spherical symmetry. Based on the reviewers’ question, we have modified the beginning of the Discussion to more clearly explain the origins of overcharging. We also present a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) to clarify this observation: if one accounts only for the NA charges that directly interact with capsid charges the system appears slightly undercharged (as predicted by the earlier continuum models with an assumption of spherical symmetry). The overcharging arises due to the presence of NA, which forms a path from capsid charge to capsid charge.</p><p><italic>More importantly, it isn’t clear that the charge ratio predicted by the model is correct or even reasonable. For instance, what about the likely presence of magnesium ions, which would presumably cancel out the charge of the excess of negative charges? The ionic screening model used here is Debye-Huckel and the model does not incorporate the possible effect of divalent binding.

The first set contains divalent cations as part of the salt solution. The second set of simulations includes divalent cations that are irreversibly bound to the NA (to represent specifically bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions). These simulations indicate only a small effect due to divalent cations at physiological concentrations.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, is it experimentally known that these capsids are negatively charged? This ought to be detectable through electrophoretic mobility measurements (zeta potential)</italic>.</p><p>The genome lengths of viruses assembled in vivo are known to high precision, as are the structures for the capsids we have considered. Based on these results it is incontrovertible that the genome length exceeds the positive capsid ARM charge. Given the complexity of the cellular environment, it could be argued that other multivalent cationic biomolecules might be present in these capsids. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments mentioned in the text (e.g., Self-assembly of viral capsid protein and RNA molecules of different sizes: Requirement for a specific high protein/RNA mass ratio, J. Virol., 86(6):3318–3326, 2012; RNA encapsidation by SV40-derived nanoparticles follows a rapid two-state mechanism. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 134(21):8823–8830, 2012) have clearly shown that capsids spontaneously assemble into overcharged states under conditions in which the ionic composition is carefully controlled. Most notably, Cadena-Nava et al (J. Virol., 86(6):3318–3326, 2012) performed competition experiments, which showed that CCMV capsid proteins preferentially assemble around genomic length RNA rather than shorter fragments.</p><p>Zeta potential measurements do in fact show that capsids are negatively charged. However, these measurements do not evaluate overcharging of the capsid interior; rather, they are sensitive to the charge on the capsid exterior, which is separated by at least 5 nm from the interior. The capsid exterior is negatively charged because of acidic residues found there. (Since these negative charges on the capsid exterior are separated by at least 5 nm from the capsid interior, they have negligible effect on the thermodynamics of genome encapsulation. Therefore, we did not include them in our model.)</p><p><italic>A figure supplement provides a comparison of a calculation with explicit ions presented as a validation of the Debye-Huckel approximation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>).

Furthermore, to fully understand the effect of excluded volume on our results, we have performed additional explicit ion simulations at various ion radii. The predicted dependence of optimal length on the ion radius is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>. These simulations show that the optimal length predicted by the Debye-Huckel model is within 10% of that predicted by the primitive model with an ion radius of 0.125 nm (roughly the radius for Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions in the CHARMM force field) at physiological salt concentration. We appreciate the reviewers for inspiring us to consider this further, and we have re-performed all the necessary explicit ion simulations using this realistic ion size, rather than the larger size (0.25 nm) we had used originally.</p><p><italic>3) Additional cause for concern about the treatment of ionic screening arise from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, which shows the residual excess chemical potential for adding one segment to the nucleic acid chain when it is in bulk solution (red line) or when it is in a capsid (blue line). What is noteworthy here is that the residual excess chemical potential is positive for both cases. Normally, insertion of one charged particle in a continuum solvent with an electrolyte is a negative number because the interaction of the charged particle with the surroundings, which comprises solvent and mobile counterions, is favorable. This excess free energy to add one chain segment in solution would probably be negative, even within the context of Debye-Huckel. We believe that the numbers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> are positive because this interaction between the segment of the salt solution is not included in the present model. The latter probably only treats the Debye-Huckel screening of the interactions of the charged segment with other segments (which is positive and unfavorable) but the self-energy is neglected. Please confirm</italic>.</p><p><italic>If this is so, the problem is that the favorable self-energy is probably much reduced once the segment is inserted inside the capsid because there is much less room to have counterions in the densely packed capsid. To take an analogy, this is a bit like an implicit solvent that changes the bare Coulomb’s law q1*q1/r12 to q1*q2/(eps*r12), but which ignores the Born self-energy of the charges. Ignoring the self-term amounts to assume that it cancels out. This is okay if the environment is assumed to remain roughly the same. Is there enough free space left inside the capsid for the implicit solvent to account for the same Debye-Huckel treatment as in the bulk solution? What is the total volume of the interior of the capsid? What is the total fraction of volume occupied by the nucleic acid? How much free space is left for ionic solution (needed to justify the Debye-Huckel screening treatment)? Please clarify this issue and explain why the implicit treatment of counterions is sufficiently accurate here</italic>.</p><p>The excess chemical potential calculations were indeed performed using the Debye-Huckel model. We chose this model for these calculations because we had already found that simulations with the Debye-Huckel agree reasonably with those using the primitive model (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The purpose of the chemical potential computations was to confirm the results of the calculations in which optimal length was estimated by rendering part of the capsid permeable to the encapsulated polymer. (While the thermodynamic justification for these latter calculations is straightforward, it is a somewhat novel approach to calculating the optimal length and thus worth testing by independent calculations.) We now clearly state that the excess chemical potential simulations were performed using the Debye-Huckel model in the Methods section “Equilibrium encapsidation”.</p><p>There is a significant amount of free space for counterions within capsids (both within our model and in actual capsids with single-stranded genomes). The most densely packed systems that we simulated are the T=1 biological capsids, which contain relatively long ARMs within a small capsid volume. For these models the fraction of <italic>free volume</italic> within the capsid is between 0.7–0.8. For the T=3 biological capsid models and for the simple capsid with ARM charge = +5, the free volume fraction is &gt;0.9. These numbers indeed explain why the Debye- Huckel treatment is a reasonable starting point for modeling this system. We were remiss in not providing this justification for our model in the original manuscript; we now provide it in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and in the text of the Methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
