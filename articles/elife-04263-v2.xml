synaptogenesis but its potential roles in intervening processes have not been addressed. We show that post-transcriptional mechanisms restrict miR-128 accumulation to post-mitotic neurons during mouse corticogenesis and in adult stem cell niches. Whereas premature miR-128 expression in progenitors for upper layer neurons leads to impaired neuronal migration and inappropriate branching, sponge-mediated inhibition results in overmigration. Within the upper layers, premature miR-128 expression reduces the complexity of dendritic arborization, associated with altered electrophysiological properties. We show that <italic>Phf6</italic>, a gene mutated in the cognitive disorder Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, is an important regulatory target for miR-128. Restoring PHF6 expression counteracts the deleterious effect of miR-128 on neuronal migration, outgrowth and intrinsic physiological properties. Our results place miR-128 upstream of PHF6 in a pathway vital for cortical lamination as well as for the development of neuronal morphology and intrinsic excitability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04263.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04263.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04263.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The unique capabilities of the mammalian brain depend on the patterns formed by spatial arrangements and connections between millions (sometimes billions) of electrically active cells called neurons, and on the connections between these neurons. During the development of the cortex, the largest part of the brain, neurons are born in stem cell areas that lie deep inside the brain, and these newly made neurons then migrate outwards to their final positions close to the surface of the adult brain.</p><p>Franzoni et al. have examined how two molecules, a small RNA called miR-128 and a protein called PHF6, control when and how neurons migrate through the cortex and then grow to form connections with other neurons as they mature. Mutations that disrupt PHF6 can cause intellectual disabilities, and one possible reason for this is that PHF6 is needed to ensure that the neurons migrate to the correction location.</p><p>Franzoni et al. now show that miR-128 can reduce the production of PHF6 and is therefore responsible for controlling when and where PHF6 is active. Studying miR-128 in detail, they show that although an inactive precursor form of miR-128 is present in stem cells and migrating neurons, the active form of miR-128 is only found in neurons that have already reached their final position in the cortex.</p><p>Franzoni et al. used genetic methods to override the switch that controls when miR-128 becomes active. When the amount of miR-128 was artificially reduced, the neurons migrated too far. Artificially increasing the amount of miR-128 had the opposite effect: both the movement of the neurons and, later, their growth were defective. PHF6 was the key to these effects: if PHF6 levels were kept close to normal, miR-128 could no longer interfere with the movement and growth of the neurons.</p><p>Further work will be required to better understand how miR-128 is turned off and on, and how PHF6 acts to control neuronal movement and growth.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04263.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04263.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome</kwd><kwd>cortical development</kwd><kwd>developmental timing</kwd><kwd>post-translational gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate School 1123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franzoni</surname><given-names>Eleonora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Research Program 665</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franzoni</surname><given-names>Eleonora</given-names></name><name><surname>Rehfeld</surname><given-names>Frederick</given-names></name><name><surname>Fuchs</surname><given-names>Heiko R</given-names></name><name><surname>Wulczyn</surname><given-names>F Gregory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Excellence Initiative 257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vida</surname><given-names>Imre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The regulation of <italic>Phf6</italic> by miR-128 is a developmental timing mechanism that influences cortical lamination, neuronal morphology and intrinsic excitability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coordinating functions for microRNAs (miRNAs) are rapidly being discovered for each of the steps required for the anatomic and functional construction of the mammalian neocortex, from stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis to neuronal outgrowth and synaptogenesis. miRNAs are short, approximately 22 nucleotide RNA molecules that primarily act as antisense regulators of gene expression. The generation of the active form of miRNAs from their initial nuclear transcripts occurs for the majority of miRNAs via two RNase-mediated processing events (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krol et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siomi and Siomi, 2010</xref>). While still in the nucleus, the primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) is cleaved by the concerted action of the DROSHA ribonuclease and the RNA binding protein DGCR8. DROSHA cleavage releases precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) with a size range between approximately 60 and 80 nucleotides that are characterized by a stem-loop secondary structure. After nuclear export, the pre-miRNA is cleaved again to generate the active, ∼22 nucleotide mature miRNA by a second protein complex containing the DICER ribonuclease. Developmental regulation of miRNA expression is known to occur at each step in this biogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krol et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siomi and Siomi, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The global reduction in miRNA levels upon conditional deletion of <italic>Dicer</italic> or <italic>Dgcr8</italic> in neuronal progenitors is associated with early defects in proliferation and migration followed by effects on neuronal morphology including dendritic arborization, spine length, and axonal outgrowth (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McNeill and Van Vactor, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). How individual miRNAs contribute to these phenotypes is rapidly being assessed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rehfeld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siegel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cochella and Hobert, 2012</xref>). Two of the best-studied miRNAs with developmental roles are miR-9 and miR-124. miR-9 acts alone or together with let-7 and miR-125 to control the timing of cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shibata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coolen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">La Torre et al., 2013</xref>). Studies on miR-124 exemplify how a single miRNA can influence neuronal specification and function at multiple levels by regulating splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>), transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Visvanathan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>), and epigenetic modifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Like miR-124, the brain-enriched miR-128 is highly abundant and upregulated during embryonic mouse brain development. In another parallel to miR-124, miR-128 was first proposed to act as a developmental regulator of mRNA utilization. By inhibiting the expression of two proteins active in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), miR-128 was shown to promote neurogenesis in a cell culture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruno et al., 2011</xref>). Additional functions for miR-128 were then reported in behavior and memory. In a study on the acquisition and suppression of fear-evoked memory, increased expression of miR-128 correlated with, and was required for, the extinction of a learned fear response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). It is presently not known if regulation of NMD mediates the effects on learning, as additional regulatory targets for miR-128 were identified in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The mouse genome contains two miR-128 genes, termed miR-128-1 and miR-128-2, which are positioned within introns of two homologous genes (respectively, <italic>R3hdm1</italic> and <italic>Arpp21</italic>, also referred to as <italic>R3hdm3</italic>, <italic>Rcs</italic> or <italic>Tarpp</italic>). The sequence and secondary structures of the precursor miRNAs produced from the two copies of miR-128 differ, but they produce identical ∼21 nt miRNAs after Dicer processing. This arrangement is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates. Recently, the phenotypes of deletion mutants for the mouse miR-128 genes were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). The two gene copies were shown to be unequal, with miR-128-2 responsible for approximately 80% of the miR-128 level in the adult forebrain. Deletion of miR-128-2 resulted in hyperactive motor behavior and severe epileptic seizures. Selective ablation of miR-128-2 in post-mitotic neurons in the forebrain was sufficient to cause hyperactivity and seizures that could be rescued by ectopic expression of miR-128 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). The phenotype of miR-128 deletion with respect to cortical development has not been determined.</p><p>To better understand the role of miR-128 in brain development, we have examined the spatial and temporal coordinates of miR-128 expression during mouse corticogenesis and in adult stem cell niches. We present evidence that post-transcriptional regulation restricts the accumulation of miR-128 to post-migratory neurons in the embryonic cortical plate and adult stem cell zones. Premature expression of miR-128 led to deficits in the radial migration and dendritic outgrowth of upper layer cortical neurons that were associated with an increase in intrinsic excitability. In contrast, inhibition of miR-128 during migration led to a shift in final neuronal positioning toward the upper boundary of the cortical plate. We identify the X-linked syndromic intellectual disability gene <italic>Phf6</italic> as a significant regulatory target for miR-128. Co-expression of PHF6 suppressed both the morphological and the physiological aspects of the miR-128 gain-of-function phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential regulation of miR-128 biogenesis in development</title><p>As a foundation for the functional analysis of miR-128, we began by characterizing expression of the two miR-128 genes, miR-128-1 and miR-128-2 in the mouse brain. In agreement with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smirnova et al., 2005</xref>), Northern blots of RNA taken from the mouse cortex at several developmental stages show that the mature, 21 nt miR-128 RNA is upregulated between embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and E18.5 and remains high postnatally and in adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this experiment, we used a high-sensitivity LNA probe complementary to the mature miRNA that should also allow detection of both miR-128 precursor RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We detected a single precursor signal present at a low level that, in contrast to the mature form, remained constant at all time points tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We next employed precursor-specific probes directed against the divergent sequences of their respective loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The specificity and efficacy of the two probes was confirmed using RNA from cells transfected with expression constructs for the two isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using the pre-miR-128-2 specific probe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we detected a strong band of the expected size that was present at nearly constant levels throughout embryonic and postnatal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of the miR-128-1 precursor was below the limit of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that miR-128-2 is more highly expressed than miR-128-1 in the embryonic cortex, consistent with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the dynamic expression of miR-128 in cortical development is achieved at least in part by post-transcriptional regulation of pre-miR-128-2 processing.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04263.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>pre-miR-128-2 expression precedes miR-128.</title><p>Northern blots of RNA from embryonic and adult mouse brains.

To allow a more quantitative comparison, the average signal intensity for each probe within the combined ventricular and subventricular zones (VZ/SVZ), intermediate zone (IZ), and cortical plate (CP) was determined and expressed relative to the staining intensity of the cortical plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). At E14.5 mature miR-128 was detected at low levels and preferentially accumulated in the cortical plate compared to the underlying subcortical zones. Staining intensity was approximately twofold (VZ/SVZ) to fourfold (IZ) lower than the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panels and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, gray bars). The miR-128-2 precursor probe, in contrast, displayed an inverse pattern with almost threefold higher relative staining in the neurogenic VZ and SVZ compared to the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, center panels and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, dark bars). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>), miR-124 was readily detected in the cortical plate but not the VZ or SVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panels).

The staining for mature miR-128 remained highly specific for post-mitotic neurons in the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panels) compared to the widespread presence of pre-miR-128-2 from the VZ to the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, middle panels). Like miR-128, miR-124 displayed uniform, high-level expression in the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panels). Unlike miR-128, however, overall levels in the IZ were intermediate compared to the lack of staining in the VZ/SVZ. Individual highly stained miR-124<sup>+</sup> cells scattered within the SVZ and IZ may represent migrating neurons, as discussed below.</p><p>For the quantification at E16.5, the average staining intensities of the upper and lower cortical plate for the three probes were also compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), to highlight the higher degree of deeper layer compared to upper layer staining we consistently observe using the probe for miR-128 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, gray bars). Comparing miR-128 with pre-miR-128-2, the difference in relative staining intensities in the VZ/SVZ and in the IZ was highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, dark bars). Similarly, a significant difference in the relative staining of miR-124 compared with miR-128 was observed in the IZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, white bars).</p><p>A similar difference in pattern between miR-128 and pre-miR-128-2 was also apparent at E18.5: despite uniform expression of pre-miR-128-2 throughout the cortex from the ventricles to the marginal zone, accumulation of miR-128 was restricted to the cortical plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the adult, the majority of cortical projection neurons co-express the precursor and mature forms, although pre-miR-128-2<sup>+</sup>/miR-128<sup>−</sup> cells can be found scattered in the marginal zone and the subcortical white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To better characterize the subcortical cells that express pre-miR-128-2 in the absence of miR-128 during development, we repeated the hybridizations at E16.5 using fluorescent detection to allow antibody co-staining.

We were interested in confirming this result in an additional developmental setting and therefore examined whether miR-128 is expressed in the migrating neuroblasts of the adult rostral migratory stream (RMS). To visualize migrating neuroblasts, we performed co-staining with Doublecortin (Dcx). The probe specific for pre-miR-128-2 strongly stained the Dcx<sup>+</sup>-neuroblasts in the RMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

In contrast, miR-128 was absent in immature neurons (Dcx<sup>+</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup>) and only present in mature granule cells (Dcx<sup>−</sup>/NeuN<sup>+</sup>) (data not shown).</p><p>In summary, we found that the miR-128-1 isoform is unlikely to contribute significantly to developmental expression of miR-128, based on the lack of signal in Northern blots or in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Comparing the regulation of pre-miR-128-2 and miR-128 in embryonic corticogenesis suggests that accumulation of miR-128 occurs after the completion of neurogenesis and at the end of radial migration as cortical neurons reach their final position in the cortex and begin their functional and morphological maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Similar evidence for post-transcriptional exclusion of miR-128 from migrating neurons was obtained in the adult RMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). These results prompted us to test the effects of premature miR-128 expression in embryonic progenitors as they differentiate and migrate to the cortical plate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Premature miR-128 expression leads to defective cortical lamination in vivo</title><p>To gain insight into the biological role of miR-128, we performed in vivo gain-of-function experiments using in utero electroporation at E15.5 to deliver ectopic miR-128 from a plasmid-based expression construct. This allowed us to introduce miR-128 into proliferating and migrating cells that normally do not express the mature miRNA. We used the plasmid vector Intron-RED, which allows precursor miRNA sequences to be expressed from a synthetic intron engineered in dsRed, generating the expression constructs pre-miR-128-1-RED and pre-miR-128-2-RED for the two miR-128 precursors (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). Comparing the activity of the two constructs in Northern blot and sensor assays revealed that the pre-miR-128-1-RED construct displayed reduced activity compared to pre-miR-128-2-RED (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). The defect in pre-miR-128-1 processing therefore appears to be intrinsic to the precursor and/or flanking sequences and allows the use of the pre-miR-128-1-RED construct as a negative control. To verify that forced miR-128 expression from pre-miR-128-2-RED can overcome the inhibitory mechanism that acts on endogenous pre-miR-128-2, we stained for mature miR-128 in electroporated brains at E18.5. We could confirm that cells expressing dsRed from the pre-miR-128-2-RED expression vector, but not the control Intron-RED vector, were the sole miR-128<sup>+</sup> cells in the IZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We tested the effect of premature miR-128 expression at P7, when migration into the cortex is completed. We found that the distribution of control (Intron-RED) and pre-miR-128-1 expressing neurons was indistinguishable, with the majority of cells positioned within layers II and III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In comparison, the majority of pre-miR-128-2 expressing neurons migrated successfully into the cortical plate but their final position was shifted toward the deep layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Quantification of the effect on migration confirmed the shift in neuronal position to deeper layers in response to premature expression of miR-128-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Because migrating neurons change morphology quickly, we analyzed control and pre-miR-128-2 electroporations performed in the same litter to avoid differences due to small variations in mating, electroporation, or sacrifice time. In controls, the majority of the electroporated neurons were already at their correct position in layer II/III, and those still migrating presented long, radially oriented leading processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Neurons expressing pre-miR-128-2, on the other hand, were consistently more branched and also had more filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lower row). The morphology of the neurons was quantified using the number of branches and the number of filopodia per neuron as criteria (see Materials and methods for details). Consistent with their overall morphology, ectopic expression of miR-128 in migrating neurons led to an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the number of filopodia and a commensurate increase in branch number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that the effects of miR-128 on migration are related to a failure in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics believed to be responsible for radial movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper, 2013</xref>).

This result indicates that the reduction in dendritic complexity associated with premature miR-128 expression persists after P15 and is therefore more likely due to interference with, as opposed to a delay in, dendritic outgrowth.</p><p>In addition to morphological changes, whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed differences in the intrinsic physiological properties of layer II/III pyramidal cells in response to miR-128 gain-of-function. After electroporation of pre-miR-128-2-RED, the affected neurons had a significantly more depolarized resting membrane potential (V<sub>M</sub>) than cells electroporated with the Intron-RED control (V<sub>M</sub> = −64.6 ± 1.3 mV vs −73.0 ± 1.4 mV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, neurons prematurely expressing miR-128 showed a steeper current–voltage relationship across a range of hyper- and depolarizing current pulses compared to control cells, an effect that can be primarily accounted for by their higher input resistance (203 ± 18 MΩ for pre-miR-128-2-RED vs 161 ± 18 MΩ for Intron-RED, 26% change, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). Because we found no difference in the membrane time constant between pre-miR-128-2 expressing cells and control cells (data not shown), the increased input resistance is most likely a consequence of the observed reduction in dendritic complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, in combination with the depolarized membrane potential it may also indicate a reduction in basal membrane conductance mediated by potassium leak channels. In either case, in their sum, these changes should lead to an increase in excitability. Indeed, we observed a reduction in the current required to trigger action potential discharge (rheobase) in pre-miR-128-2 expressing cells compared to control cells (79.3 ± 1.0 pA vs 124.5 ± 12.8 pA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Furthermore, pre-miR-128-2 expressing cells fired trains of action potentials (APs) at substantially higher frequencies (42 ± 4 Hz) in response to large depolarizing current pulses (250 pA, 500 ms), a 63% increase compared to control cells (26 ± 1 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Interestingly, in response to large hyperpolarizing pulses the miR-128 gain-of-function neurons responded with an approximately twofold larger voltage sag than control neurons (5.6 ± 0.5 mV vs 2.6 ± 0.2 mV, measured for −250 pA current pulses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). This suggests that during hyperpolarization an increase in HCN-mediated <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> currents may partially compensate the higher input resistance seen in the miR-128 gain-of-function neurons.</p><p>Using cells obtained from co-electroporations of pre-miR-128-2-RED and PHF6-GFP, we found that the effects of premature miR-128 expression on the electrophysiological properties of layer II/III neurons are for the most part mediated by PHF6. Neurons co-expressing PHF6 and pre-miR-128-2 had a V<sub>M</sub> of −70.5 ± 1.4 mV and an input resistance of 180 ± 16 MΩ, both comparable to that of control Intron-RED cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,E</xref>). The current–voltage relationship, rheobase and the maximum AP discharge were also partially rescued by PHF6 co-expression (35 ± 2 Hz at 250 pA, 500 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,F,G</xref>). The increase in the hyperpolarization-induced voltage sag was also partially reversed by PHF6 (4.3 ± 0.8 mV), although it remained higher than in control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p><p>In summary, miR-128 misexpression during corticogenesis results in substantive changes in both the morphological and physiological properties of upper layer neurons. With the exception of the voltage sag and rheobase, which were partially compensated, the observed reductions in dendritic complexity and changes in intrinsic excitability were restored to control levels by co-transfection with PHF6.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By carefully analyzing the expression pattern of miR-128 during cortical development, we present evidence that miR-128 might be part of a regulatory switch required for the transition from migration to outgrowth, thereby promoting functional neuronal maturation. Based on the disparate temporal control of pre-miR-128-2 and miR-128, post-transcriptional mechanisms appear to contribute to the timing of miR-128 activity. Post-transcriptional regulation of miRNA biogenesis is believed to facilitate dynamic control over miRNA activity that may be required for cells to rapidly change their gene expression in response to developmental or environmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krol et al., 2010</xref>). Another possible advantage of post-transcriptional control is that it would allow the timing of miR-128 expression to be partly uncoupled from the regulation of <italic>Arpp21</italic> transcription, the host mRNA for miR-128-2. One example of this in the nervous system is the ability of miR-26 to suppress its host gene <italic>Ctdsp2</italic> and allow differentiation of neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dill et al., 2012</xref>). There is evidence for a similar feedback relationship between miR-128 and <italic>Arpp21</italic> in the adult brain during the suppression of fear-evoked memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). However, mice deficient in <italic>Arpp21</italic> are viable and without a known defect in cortical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rakhilin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The disparity we observe between pre-miR-128-2 expression and miR-128 accumulation suggests that a delay in cytoplasmic DICER processing of the precursor contributes to the temporal control of miR-128. For several miRNAs, DICER cleavage is known to be inhibited by precursor-specific RNA binding proteins such as LIN28 in the case of let-7 and miR-9 or DHX36 for miR-134 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rybak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bicker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nowak et al., 2014</xref>). A different mechanism, sequestration by the circular RNA sponge CDR1, is thought to control miR-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanism or mechanisms responsible for post-transcriptional control of miR-128 remain to be determined, however, it appears to help restrict miR-128 accumulation to the cortical plate after neurogenesis and radial migration have occurred. These observations prompted us to test the effects of premature miR-128 expression on radial migration.</p><p>Neuronal migration is a complex process necessary for correct cortical lamination and the formation of functional neuronal networks. Previously, three brain-enriched miRNAs (miR-9, miR-132, and miR-137) have been implicated in the regulation of neuronal migration (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evsyukova et al. 2013</xref>). miR-9 and miR-132 cooperate as positive regulators of migration by preventing the expression of the transcription factor FOXP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clovis et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, in utero electroporation of miR-137 leads to increased migration of progenitors into the cortical plate due to the ability of miR-137 to stimulate neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, we show that miR-128 is a negative regulator of migration and that the onset of miR-128 activity coincides with the termination of upper neuron migration. Manipulating the timing of miR-128 expression interferes with migration and cortical lamination, at least in part through regulation of the transcriptional repressor PHF6.</p><p>Like miR-128, the <italic>Phf6</italic> gene is restricted to vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lower et al., 2002</xref>). Based on cross-species comparisons of predicted miR-128 binding sites available at the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org/">TargetScan</ext-link> website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedman et al., 2008</xref>), targeting of the <italic>Phf6</italic> mRNA by miR-128 appears to be enhanced in mammals (3 sites), opossum (3 sites), and platypus (2 sites) compared to chicken or frog (no conserved sites). Within the nervous system, mutations in PHF6 have been detected in the developmental disorders Börjeson-Forssmann-Lehmann (BFLS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.omim.org/entry/301900">OMIM 301900</ext-link>) and Coffin–Siris (CSS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://omim.org/entry/135900">OMIM 135900</ext-link>) syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lower et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tsurusaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wieczorek et al., 2013</xref>). BFLS is an X-linked recessive intellectual disability disorder associated with epilepsy and other developmental abnormalities. The phenotypic spectrum of CSS phenotypes overlaps BFLS and includes variable intellectual disability and developmental delay. CSS was recently shown to be associated with mutations in several components of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes in addition to PHF6, strongly suggesting a role for PHF6 in epigenetic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Santen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tsurusaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wieczorek et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, biochemical evidence has linked PHF6 to several chromatin modifying complexes, including the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex (NuRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Todd and Picketts, 2012</xref>) and the Polymerase associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Paf1C has several known functions including histone modification, transcription initiation, and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaehning, 2010</xref>).</p><p>PHF6 and Paf1C have been implicated in the control of neuronal migration in the mouse. Knockdown of PHF6 during embryonic corticogenesis resulted in impaired upper layer neuron migration characterized by excessive branching of the leading process. Knockdown of PAF1 led to quantitatively similar effects on migration, suggesting that PHF6 acts in the context of Paf1C to facilitate migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The reciprocal expression patterns we observe comparing miR-128 and PHF6 during cortical development and neuronal growth in vitro suggest that miR-128 is a significant regulator of PHF6. We also show that the effect of miR-128 on the morphology and final distribution of migrating upper layer progenitors is similar to that reported after PHF6 knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, co-expression of PHF6 and miR-128 alleviated this phenotype, indicating that miR-128 is a physiological regulator of PHF6 during corticogenesis. The regulation of SWI/SNF-complex subunit composition by miR-124 provides a precedent for temporal control of epigenetic modifiers by miRNAs during neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ronan, et al., 2013</xref>). By regulating PHF6, miR-128 may play a similar role for Paf1C or the NuRD complex later in neuronal differentiation. Because premature miR-128 expression inhibited and miR-128 inhibition exaggerated radial migration, the miR-128/PHF6 circuit may play a role in how migrating neurons interpret their position, whether in response to an internal clock, external cues, or cell–cell interactions.</p><p>Our results suggest that regulation of PHF6 by miR-128 is important for two interdependent aspects of upper layer neuron maturation in the cortical plate. We show for the first time that miR-128 and PHF6 cooperate in the regulation of dendritic arborization of upper layer neurons. Electrophysiological recordings also show that the balance between miR-128 and PHF6 influences cell autonomous excitability. PHF6 knockdown has previously been shown to increase the excitability of heterotopic neurons that were retained in the white matter due to impaired migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Although this finding offers a potential explanation for the cognitive deficits and seizure activity observed in BFLS and CSS, the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. Comparing the intrinsic properties of neurons expressing either ectopic miR-128 alone or miR-128 together with PHF6, we found that much, but not all, of the difference in intrinsic electrophysiological properties may be directly related to the effects on structural complexity. Layer II/III neurons expressing miR-128 prematurely had reduced complexity of their dendritic arbor, with the most apparent differences observed in their proximal dendrites. This reduction in dendritic complexity was rectified by co-expression of PHF6 and miR-128. Electrophysiological recordings further showed that the input resistance of recorded neurons was increased following miR-128 expression, as would be expected from a reduction in dendritic complexity. Interestingly, premature miR-128 expression also led to a more depolarized resting membrane potential than control cells. This is unlikely to be a direct effect of the morphological changes, and may reflect a reduction in hyperpolarizing leak currents. The net effect of the physiological changes induced by miR-128 was an increase in excitability, reflected by a reduced rheobase and increased firing frequency in response to depolarizing currents. In addition, exogenous PHF6 dampened the effects of miR-128 for all parameters tested. Thus, neuronal excitability is highly sensitive to the precise timing of miR-128 expression and subsequent repression of PHF6 during network formation in vivo. The lack of complete rescue of some parameters by PHF6, however, indicates that additional regulatory targets of miR-128 may contribute to some of the physiological effects we see in post-migratory neurons.</p><p>It is interesting to compare our gain-of-function results in cortical neurons to the phenotype observed upon targeted deletion of miR-128 in dopamine responsive neurons of the striatum (D1 neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tan et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of miR-128 resulted in heightened excitability that was attributed to the upregulation of ion channels and signal transduction pathways that occurred in the absence of miR-128. In contrast to D1 neurons, there were no significant differences in either the amplitude or the frequency of postsynaptic IPSCs or EPSCs in the cortical neurons we analyzed. Therefore, the regulatory impact of miR-128 may depend on the region and the developmental time point under investigation.</p><p>We identify a regulatory interaction between miR-128 and PHF6 that is critical for the proper migration and dendritic outgrowth of upper layer neurons in the developing mouse cortex. These results may have significant relevance for the understanding of cognitive deficits and seizure susceptibility in human patients with mutations in PHF6 and highlight the importance of correct temporal regulation of miR-128 for the establishment of the cortical architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>FMR1 mice were obtained from Charles River (Cologne, Germany), C57Bl/6 mice from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web-fem.charite.de/">Forschungseinrichtungen für Experimentelle Medizin</ext-link>, Berlin.

Voltage signals were digitized at 10 kHz (NI-DAQ, National Instruments, Newbury, UK), acquired with WinWCP software (J Dempster, Strathclyde University) and analysed offline using Stimfit (C Schmidt-Hieber; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stimfit.org/">www.stimfit.org</ext-link>).</p><p>The intrinsic physiology of neurons was characterized in current-clamp mode, with a family of hyperpolarizing to depolarizing current pulses (−250 to 250 pA, 50 pA steps, 500 ms duration); determining the current–voltage relationship, I<sub>h</sub> mediated voltage sag and action potential (AP) discharge frequency. Small hyperpolarizing current pulses (−10 pA, 500 ms duration) were applied to assess the input resistance (RI) of the recorded neurons. Membrane potential (VM) was calculated as the 50 ms baseline prior to the small hyperpolarizing step.</p><p>Following intrinsic characterization, outside-out patches were formed and biocytin was allowed to fill the cell for an additional 15 min. Slices were immersion fixed in 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) overnight at 4°C. Slices were copiously rinsed in PB and the filled cells visualized with Avidin-conjugated Alexa-Fluor-647 (Invitrogen/Life Technologies; 1:1000), in PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.05% NaN<sub>3</sub>, overnight at 4°C. Slices were subsequently rinsed in PB and mounted on glass slides, with a 300 μm agar spacer to prevent compression of the slices after cover-slipping. The slices were imaged using Leica SL confocal (1024 × 1024 resolution) using ×20 objective and 200 Hz speed. The step between stacks was 1 µm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Neuronal reconstruction and morphometric analysis</title><p>For analysis at P0 60 µm slices were prepared from single litters of electroporated animals and processed for immunostaining with dsRed and eGFP antibodies plus DRAQ5 nuclear stain. Images were taken using a Leica SL confocal microscope, for reconstruction a 40× objective and Z-stack step of 1 µm was used. Nuclear staining was used to identify the deep layers of the cortical plate, individual neurons were reconstructed with the Fiji plugin Simple Neurite tracer. Quantification was essentially as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guerrier et al. (2009)</xref>. For analysis at P21 electroporated animals were sacrificed, perfused, and 100-µm slices were prepared. Electroporated neurons were visualized by staining with dsRed antibody. Z-stack images were taken with an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Olympus IX81) with a 1 µm stack and reconstructed as above. For P15 neurons, after recording outside-out patches were formed and cells were filled with biocytin for 15 min. After overnight fixation by immersion in 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) at 4°C, the filled cells visualized with Avidin-conjugated Alexa-Fluor-647 (Invitrogen/Life Technologies; 1:1000), in PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.05% NaN<sub>3</sub>, overnight at 4°C. After rinsing in PB and mounting on glass slides with a 300 μm agar spacer the slices were imaged using a 20× objective and a Leica SL confocal microscope at 200 Hz. The step between stacks was 1 µm at a resolution of 1024 × 1024. Neurons were reconstructed using the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin. Sholl analysis was performed on 3-D reconstructions using the Sholl analysis plugin for Fiji. The radius of the first concentric sphere was set at 7.5 µm and the increase between radii was 5 µm.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and the Reviewing editor agreed that your results are significant and interesting. The identification of a new function for miR128 in neuronal migration, dendritic branching and neuronal excitability as well as the characterization of <italic>Phf6</italic> as a potential target of miR128 in this context provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cortical circuit development. However, the reviewers also raised a number of major weaknesses in the paper that need to be addressed with new experiments in order to improve the main conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The study does not provide compelling evidence that <italic>Phf6</italic> is a target of miR-128 in the developing cortex. miR-128 is shown to suppress <italic>Phf6</italic> expression in HEK-293 cells, and <italic>Phf6</italic> rescues miR-128 ectopic/overexpression phenotypes in cortical neurons. However, whether miR-128 normally regulates <italic>Phf6</italic> expression in the developing cortex is not addressed (and whether and how <italic>Phf6</italic> is expressed is not examined). Therefore the functional study of a putative miR-128-<italic>Phf6</italic> pathway in cortical development does not stand on solid ground.</p><p>2) The functional analysis of miR-128 is only based on gain of function/overexpression experiments. The authors need to provide loss-of-function evidence downregulating mir-128 to demonstrate that it is required for the migration and dendritic branching phenotypes described. The phenotypes resulting from electroporation of miR-128 are analysed at two stages: i) in cortical plate neurons where mature miR-128 is normally expressed, and where exogenous miR-128 is therefore overexpressed; ii) in migrating IZ neurons where mature miR-128 is normally not expressed and where exogenous miR-128 is therefore expressed ectopically. This is assuming that electroporation of pre-miR-128-2 results in production of mature miR128, which seems logical since it has a biological effect, although this is not shown. There is also no explanation of why exogenous pre-miR-128-2 has an activity in migrating neurons and is therefore presumably processed into the mature form, while endogenous pre-miR-128-2, which is also expressed in these cells, is not.</p><p>3) The authors’ arguments regarding the layer specificity of miR128-2 expression in the developing neocortex, especially in the absence of a careful quantitation of the levels of fluorescent signal is far from convincing. The authors should measure miR124 and miR128-2 expression levels in the VZ, SVZ and IZ and normalized their expression levels to those of the cortical plate, in order to test if miR124 and miR128-2 would still be significantly different in VS, SVZ and IZ.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04263.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>For the sake of argument I will address the main points in reverse order.</p><p><italic>3) The authors’ arguments regarding the layer specificity of miR128-2 expression in the developing neocortex, especially in the absence of a careful quantitation of the levels of fluorescent signal is far from convincing. The authors should measure miR124 and miR128-2 expression levels in the VZ, SVZ and IZ and normalized their expression levels to those of the cortical plate, in order to test if miR124 and miR128-2 would still be significantly different in VS, SVZ and IZ</italic>.</p><p>To meet this request we now compare colorimetric staining for pre-miR-128-2, miR-128 and miR-124 at E14.5 and E16.5 in greater detail (representative images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Using this expanded dataset we have performed the quantifications as requested and the results fully support our original interpretation.</p><p>In our view, the critical point for our manuscript is the discrepancy between pre-miR-128-2 and miR-128 expression patterns in the VZ, SVZ and IZ documented in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, 2C</xref> and S3. These images are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, where they can be directly compared to miR-124. Quantification of the new dataset at E14.5 shows that average pre-miR-128-2 staining intensity is <italic>higher</italic> in the VZ/SVZ and in the IZ relative to the CP (approximately 3:1 and 1.5:1, respectively). The opposite is true for miR-128, staining intensity relative to the CP is <italic>reduced</italic> in the VZ/SVZ and IZ, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A similar pattern is seen at E16.5: staining intensity for pre-miR-128-2 in the VZ/SVZ and IZ is slightly reduced compared to the CP (approximately 08:1). In contrast, for miR-128 staining intensity in the VZ/SVZ and IZ strongly reduced compared to the CP (approximately 01:1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We have also replaced the original images comparing pre-miR-128-2 and miR-128 at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) with improved sections to demonstrate that the disparity in precursor and mature miRNA staining is maintained at the end of embryonic cortical neurogenesis.</p><p>In addition, we consistently observe miR-124 positive cells in the IZ during corticogenesis. In our view this is interesting in its own right but is not a condition for our hypothesis to be correct. Therefore we did not document this effect in detail in the original submission. At the reviewers’ request we now include miR-124 in the new analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-2E</xref>). The bright field images show, in contrast to miR-128, individual miR-124 positive cells scattered in the IZ at E14.5 and E16.5. Quantification of these images confirm that the relative staining intensity for miR-124 in the IZ is higher than the VZ/SVZ at E14.5 and E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and 2E</xref>), consistent with the original data. This is in clear contrast to miR-128, for which staining intensity in the subcortical zones is more uniform. These results suggest that the mechanism involved in delaying miR-128 biogenesis is not shared by miR-124, the paradigm miRNA in the regulation of neurogenesis.</p><p>Within the cortical plate itself, it is our impression that upper layer neurons express miR-128 at lower relative levels than either pre-miR-128 or miR-124. This visual impression is reflected in the quantitative analysis but is not statistically significant.</p><p>We hope this new dataset and the improved presentation satisfies the reviewers’ concerns.</p><p><italic>2) The functional analysis of miR-128 is only based on gain of function/overexpression experiments. The authors need to provide loss-of-function evidence downregulating miR-128 to demonstrate that it is required for the migration and dendritic branching phenotypes described</italic>.</p><p>In my view it is not necessarily self-evident that inhibiting miR-128 during migration or outgrowth, as requested, should be expected to yield an easily predicted phenotype. Introducing miR-128 prematurely into miR-128<sup>-</sup> progenitors, as we do in our experiments is analogous to a knockdown experiment, in our case of miR-128 targets that are normally inhibited at a later stage but serve a function in migrating neurons. The reverse experiments may not be informative (in the case of a knockdown overexpressing the gene of interest, in our case inhibiting the miRNA).</p><p>That said, we have performed the suggested experiments and can comply with the reviewers’ request by showing that “sponge”-mediated inhibition of miR-128 leads to a significant overmigration of upper layer neurons in vivo under the same experimental conditions we used to show that premature miR-128 impairs migration. This new data is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and 3G</xref>. We believe this “mirror image” phenotype substantially satisfies the reviewers’ request and should lead to interesting mechanistic insights in the future.</p><p>We also performed Sholl analysis of “sponge”-knockdown cells at P15. As the reviewers can see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>, the small increase in dendritic complexity we observe is suggestive but not statistically significant. There are several possible explanations for this lack of phenotype. First, postnatal expression of miR-128 during outgrowth is very high compared to the situation in migrating cells at the onset of miR-128 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore migration may be more sensitive to the sponge than outgrowth, due to the high but limited number of sponge binding sites expressed in each cell (see Broderick and Zamore, 2014 for a discussion of the limitations of competition strategies). Alternatively, since the outgrowth phenotype was substantially mediated by <italic>Phf6</italic> (as seen in the rescue experiments), it is possible that inappropriate <italic>Phf6</italic> overexpression due to the sponge does not cause an obvious morphological defect.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Reconstructed neurons obtained by biocytin filling of cells electroporated with an eGFP control (dark green), or an anti-miR-128 sponge (light green) construct are shown in A and B.

Error bars represent SEM.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04263-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>All in all, we believe the new results obtained in the migration assay greatly strengthen the case for miR-128 in the control of migration. We hope we have satisfied the reviewers’ concerns.</p><p><italic>The phenotypes resulting from electroporation of miR-128 are analysed at two stages: i) in cortical plate neurons where mature miR-128 is normally expressed, and where exogenous miR-128 is therefore overexpressed; ii) in migrating IZ neurons where mature miR-128 is normally not expressed and where exogenous miR-128 is therefore expressed ectopically. This is assuming that electroporation of pre-miR-128-2 results in production of mature miR128, which seems logical since it has a biological effect, although this is not shown. There is also no explanation of why exogenous pre-miR-128-2 has an activity in migrating neurons and is therefore presumably processed into the mature form, while endogenous pre-miR-128-2, which is also expressed in these cells, is not</italic>.</p><p>We point out that we do not know whether the outgrowth phenotype is triggered by premature miR-128 before or after the neurons reach the cortical plate. Either way, the reviewers are correct that we are tacitly assuming that the inhibitory mechanism that blocks processing of endogenous pre-miR-128-2 is titrated out/overloaded when we introduce miR-128 expression constructs into progenitors. We believe this assumption is reasonable: as a precedent, it is well known that ectopic expression of the let-7 precursor in pluripotent cells results in biogenesis of mature let-7 despite the presence of the inhibitory Lin28 protein (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rybak et al., 2008</xref>). However, we now provide direct experimental support: we have performed in situ hybridization for miR-128 in the cone of pre-miR-128-2-RED electroporations and can clearly show that dsRed-positive cells in the intermediate zone stand out as miR-128-positive among the otherwise negative cells of the IZ. Similarly positioned cells in control electroporations performed in parallel do not express miR-128. This data is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>. We agree that this demonstration should significantly strengthen the paper and thank the reviewers for pointing out this omission.</p><p><italic>1) The study does not provide compelling evidence that Phf6 is a target of miR-128 in the developing cortex. miR-128 is shown to suppress Phf6 expression in HEK-293 cells, and Phf6 rescues miR-128 ectopic/overexpression phenotypes in cortical neurons. However, whether miR-128 normally regulates Phf6 expression in the developing cortex is not addressed (and whether and how Phf6 is expressed is not examined). Therefore the functional study of a putative miR-128-Phf6 pathway in cortical development does not stand on solid ground</italic>.</p><p>We have addressed this legitimate concern in two ways. First, we were somewhat remiss in citing published expression studies on <italic>Phf6</italic> that have documented <italic>Phf6</italic> expression in the ventricular, subventricular and intermediate zones in the relevant periods of corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voss et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, the previously published knockdown experiments showing that in utero electroporation of shRNAs directed against <italic>Phf6</italic> impairs the migration of cortical neurons would not make sense if this were not the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). To further document <italic>Phf6</italic> expression patterns, we are providing new in situ data for <italic>Phf6</italic> using both a highly specific LNA-based probe for mRNA detection and a newly available antibody (now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, A-D</xref>). The specificity of the antibody is confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The results at the mRNA and protein level confirm the previously published results, and show prominent staining for <italic>Phf6</italic> in the VZ/SVZ and in the IZ in the relevant period of corticogenesis (E14.5 and E16.5). These experiments allow a direct comparison to miR-128 at the relevant time points. The pattern of miR-128 expression is reciprocal (differential expression of miR-128 in each cortical zone is described in more detail and quantified in the new version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This new in situ data is consistent with, and supported by, the temporal profile of <italic>Phf6</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, qRT-PCR) and mature miR-128 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Northern blot) in brain development and during neuronal maturation in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K and 5L</xref>, qRT-PCR). The expression patterns documented in the revised version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are therefore in complete accord with our hypothesis and with previous work on the role of <italic>Phf6</italic> in corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>): <italic>Phf6</italic> is expressed in the relevant layers during generation and migration of upper layer neurons. miR-128 is excluded from the VZ/SVZ and IZ, with accumulation restricted to the cortical plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We believe we have convincingly shown that the temporal dynamics of <italic>Phf6</italic> and miR-128 regulation match their proposed roles in neuronal migration and outgrowth. The results also document the presence of <italic>Phf6</italic> in the cell populations we target in our ectopic miR-128 electroporations, supporting our view that premature miR-128 expression could potentially interfere with the known requirement for <italic>Phf6</italic> during migration as reported by Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The second part of the comment questions if we have done enough to show that <italic>Phf6</italic> is indeed a regulatory target of miR-128. We point out that a direct demonstration of <italic>Phf6</italic> regulation by miR-128 in the developing cortex is technically quite difficult. Generally speaking, in the highly analogous case of shRNA knockdowns it is not usually required to show that the shRNA construct reduces the target protein expression in vivo after in utero electroporation. It should suffice to demonstrate the efficacy and specificity of the shRNA in cell culture and that the biological effect is rescued in vivo by an shRNA-insensitive expression construct. What we have shown is analogous: we show that a <italic>Phf6</italic> construct lacking the miR-128 recognition sequences in the 3’UTR rescues the migration, outgrowth and electrophysiological phenotypes we see with ectopic miR-128. We show that the three conserved miR-128 binding sites in the <italic>Phf6</italic> 3’UTR (now described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>) are recognized in a reporter assay (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This is not unexpected, we point out that <italic>Phf6</italic> is the sixth highest ranked predicted target for miR-128 in the PicTar database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/cgi-bin/PicTar_vertebrate.cgi">PicTar</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krek et al., 2005</xref>). We also show that introduction of miR-128 into the miR-128-negative HEK-293 cell line reduces the level of endogenous <italic>Phf6</italic> at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and 5H</xref>). We now show the results of the same experiment in HeLa cells, in which ectopic miR-128 but not non-targeting control miRNAs clearly reduce <italic>Phf6</italic> protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>For the benefit of the reviewers, we would like to expand on this data at some length, presenting unpublished work from our lab.</p><p>The first indication that <italic>Phf6</italic> is a miR-128 target came from the miRNA prediction algorithms TargetScan, PicTar and DianaMicroT. All three identify three potential binding sites that are present in the 3’UTR of human and mouse <italic>Phf6</italic> mRNAs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). DianaMicroT recognizes one additional, lower affinity binding site. In TargetScan two of the sites are designated “poorly conserved”. This is because, interestingly, they are not present in chicken or Xenopus mRNAs. However, the three sites are conserved in all mammalian mRNAs.</p><p>These observations strongly suggest that <italic>Phf6</italic> is an evolutionarily conserved target in mammals for miR-128, with the presence of multiple binding sites further suggesting a relatively strong regulatory effect.</p><p>We have previously performed an unbiased screen for miR-128 response genes in the P19 embryocarcinoma cell line (our unpublished data). 160 transcripts were found to be downregulated (cutoff 0.5-fold). As an indication of the specificity of targeting, analysis of this list for miRNA target enrichment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/">Web-Gestalt</ext-link>) reveals that targets for miR-128 and miR-27 are the only miRNAs showing significant enrichment, as expected (P = 2.3e-08 or 3.2e-08, Bonferonni correction, respectively). The seed regions of miR-128 and miR-27 are highly similar and the two miRNAs are expected to target overlapping sets of mRNAs. This indicates that at least some of the mRNAs identified in this experiment are likely to be direct targets. In addition to <italic>Phf6</italic>, two of the best characterized miR-128 target mRNAs in the nervous system, <italic>Casc3/Mln51</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruno et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Szrd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tan et al. 2013</xref>) were also detected in this screen. In the microarray experiment <italic>Phf6</italic> was downregulated 0.441-fold, very similar to the degree of inhibition we detect at the mRNA and protein level in HEK-293 cells as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and 5G</xref>, compared to 0.284-fold for <italic>Szrd1</italic> with 4 predicted binding sites and 0.478-fold for <italic>Casc3</italic> with two predicted sites. These results have been confirmed by RT-PCR and in the case of <italic>Szrd1</italic> a reporter assay using the cloned 3’UTR (our unpublished observations).</p><p>Finally, after submission of our manuscript, a study was published providing evidence for targeting of <italic>Phf6</italic> by miR-128 in T cells, one of the few tissues outside the nervous system displaying high levels of miR-128 expression (Mets et al., 2014).</p><p>Taken together, we believe the evidence for regulation of <italic>Phf6</italic> by miR-128 is strong. However, we have made every effort to directly prove that <italic>Phf6</italic> is downregulated in vivo under our experimental conditions. For this purpose we employed FACS to isolate control Intron-RED and pre-miR-128-2-RED cells at E18.5 shortly after electroporation at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>). Unfortunately, yields of cells were low (≈200,000/litter), leading to experimental variability in the downstream processing required to produce cDNA for qRT-PCR analysis. We observe a trend of reduced expression of <italic>Phf6</italic> in miR-128-2 electroporated cells compared to control. However, the difference in 4 independent samples derived from cells pooled from independent electroporations did not reach statistical significance. For comparison, we chose the mRNA for <italic>Szrd1/C1orf144</italic> as positive control, which as discussed above is an experimentally confirmed miR-128 target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tan et al., 2013</xref>) and the top-ranked predicted mRNA target for miR-128 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org/cgi-bin/targetscan/vert_61/targetscan.cgi?species=Human%26gid=%26mir_sc=miR-128%2F128ab%26mir_c=%26mir_nc=%26mirg=">Targetscan</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/cgi-bin/PicTar_vertebrate.cgi">PicTar</ext-link>). The trend we observed was comparable to <italic>Phf6</italic> but also not statistically significant.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>qRT-PCR performed on FAC-sorted cells obtained after electroporation at E15.5 with an Intron-RED control plasmid (black bars) or the miR-128-2 expression plasmid pre-miR-128-1-RED (gray bars). dsRed positive cells were collected, RNA isolated and qRT-PCR performed using <italic>Oaz1</italic> as reference mRNA. <italic>PHf6</italic>, Szrd1 were readily detected, quantification is shown. <italic>Szrd1</italic> as a known target of miR-128 is the positive control, <italic>β</italic>-actin the negative control. Although a clear trend is observed, the reduction of <italic>PHf6</italic> mRNA in response to ectopic miR-128 is not statistically significant (unpaired t-test).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04263-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We point out that, unlike siRNAs, for miRNAs qRT-PCR is likely to underestimate the degree of repression at the protein level. We believe that the technical difficulty of the experiment and the attendant variability makes it difficult to achieve significance given the relatively modest effect we are trying to capture: under ideal conditions an approximately 50% reduction in the reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and in protein levels in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We hope the reviewers agree that this experiment is susceptible to a Type II error. We would also like to say that we consider FACS analysis a fairly heroic effort and hope that it does not become the gold standard, as it requires considerable animal experimentation and the availability of an excellent FACS facility.</p><p>We have considered alternative approaches: we see no way to perform quantitative western blots on the limited number of cells obtained by FACS. Based on our experience with other miRNAs, we do not believe staining of miR-128 positive or deficient cells for <italic>Phf6</italic> would be quantitatively rigorous, particularly since all available <italic>Phf6</italic> antibodies require amplification using the TSA system.</p><p>In summary, <italic>Phf6</italic> is a predicted and validated regulatory target for miR-128 as shown in multiple assays. The largely reciprocal expression patterns of <italic>Phf6</italic> and miR-128 are consistent with a role for miR-128 in the regulation of <italic>Phf6</italic> during radial migration of cortical neurons. We show for the first time that excess miR-128 during development perturbs migration, outgrowth and intrinsic activity of upper layer cortical neurons. We show that exogenous <italic>Phf6</italic> can rescue these phenotypes. These results are consistent with previous reports on <italic>Phf6</italic> activity in migration and extend the influence of <italic>Phf6</italic> to outgrowth and concomitant measures of activity. We hope that the evidence for this regulatory interaction is now on much more solid ground.</p></body></sub-article></article>
