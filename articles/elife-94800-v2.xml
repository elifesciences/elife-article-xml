We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch, which we denote <italic>co</italic>iled-<italic>co</italic>il <italic>nu</italic>clease <italic>t</italic>andems (CoCoNuTs) for their salient features: the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. The CoCoNuTs alone show extraordinary variety, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes. All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, such as OB-folds resembling the SmpB protein that binds bacterial transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), YTH-like domains that might recognize methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp70 chaperone homologs, along with RNases, such as HEPN domains, all suggesting that the CoCoNuTs target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs might additionally target DNA, via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III, are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons. In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly, RNA fragments with cyclic termini, that bind associated CARF (<italic>C</italic>RISPR-<italic>A</italic>ssociated <italic>R</italic>ossmann <italic>F</italic>old) domains. We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs, together with the ancillary restriction factors, employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first, but then, if it fails, an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All organisms, from animals to bacteria, are subject to genetic parasites, such as viruses and transposons. Genetic parasites are pieces of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) that can use a cell’s machinery to copy themselves at the expense of their hosts. This often leads to the host’s demise, so organisms evolved many types of defense mechanisms. One of the most ancient and common forms of defense against viruses and transposons is the targeted restriction of nucleic acids, that is, deployment of host enzymes that can destroy or restrict nucleic acids containing specific sequence motifs or modifications.</p><p>In bacteria, many of the restriction enzymes targeting parasitic genetic elements are formed by fusions of proteins from the so-called McrBC systems with a protein domain called EVE. EVE and other functionally similar domains are a part of proteins that recognize and bind modified bases in nucleic acids. Enzymes can use the ability of these specificity domains to bind modified bases to detect non-host nucleic acids.</p><p>Bell et al. conducted a comprehensive computational search for McrBC systems and discovered a large and highly diverse branch of this family with unusual characteristic structural and functional domains. These features include regions that form long alpha-helices (coils) that coil with other alpha-helices (known as coiled-coils), as well as several distinct enzymatic domains that break down nucleic acids (known as nucleases). They call these systems CoCoNuTs (<italic>co</italic>iled-<italic>co</italic>iled <italic>nu</italic>clease <italic>t</italic>andems).</p><p>All CoCoNuTs contain domains, including EVE-like ones, which are predicted to interact with components of the RNA-based systems responsible for producing proteins in the cell (translation), suggesting that the CoCoNuTs have an important impact on protein abundance and RNA metabolism.</p><p>Bell et al.’s findings will be of interest to scientists working on prokaryotic immunity and virulence. Furthermore, similarities between CoCoNuTs and components of eukaryotic RNA-degrading systems suggest evolutionary connections between this diverse family of bacterial predicted RNA restriction systems and RNA regulatory pathways of eukaryotes.</p><p>Further deciphering the mechanisms of CoCoNuTs could shed light on how certain pathways of RNA metabolism and regulation evolved, and how they may contribute to advances in biotechnology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Type IV restriction-modification systems</kwd><kwd>GTPase</kwd><kwd>nucleases</kwd><kwd>coiled-coil domains</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd><kwd>programmed cell death</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koonin</surname><given-names>Eugene V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bacterial Type IV restriction-modification systems display remarkable, previously unnoticed diversity of complex gene and domain architectures, and are predicted to couple antiphage immunity with the abortive infection form of defense.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All organisms are subject to an incessant barrage of genetic parasites, such as viruses and transposons.

The asparagine (N) residue is strictly required for GTP binding and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Pieper et al., 1999</xref>). As this residue is analogous to sensor-1 in ATP-hydrolyzing members of the AAA+family, it can be predicted to position a catalytic water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphate of an NTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colicelli, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourne et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Niu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Pieper et al., 1999</xref>). A recent structural analysis has shown that the aspartate interacts with a conserved arginine/lysine residue in McrC which, via a hydrogen-bonding network, resituates the NxxD motif in relation to its interface with the Walker B motif such that, together, they optimally position a catalytic water to stimulate hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Niu et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, the truncation of this motif might be expected to modulate the rate of hydrolysis and potentially compel functional association with only a subset of McrC homologs containing compensatory mutations. The NxD branch is characterized by many McrC homologs with unusual features, such as predicted RNA-binding domains, that might not be compatible with conventional McrB GTPases from the NxxD clade, which often occur in the same genomes (see below).</p><p>Many of these NxD GTPases are contextually associated with DNA methyltransferases, like the NxxD GTPases, but are distinguished by additional complexity in the domains fused to the McrC homologs and the frequent presence of two-component regulatory system genes in the same operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, yellow). We also detected a small number of GTPases with an insertion in the signature motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, cyan), expanding it to NxxxD, which are methyltransferase-associated as well. This association is likely to be ancestral as it is found in all three branches of the McrB GTPase tree with different signature motif variations.</p><p>The most notable feature of the NxD branch of GTPases is a large clade characterized by fusion to long coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, teal; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), a derived and distinctly different architecture from the small, modular DNA-binding specificity domains typically found in canonical McrB homologs. The McrC homologs associated with these coiled-coil McrB-like GTPase fusions also often lack the PD-(D/E)xK endonuclease entirely or contain a region AlphaFold2 (AF2) predicted to adopt the PD-(D/E)xK endonuclease fold, but with inactivating replacements of catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>).

The Type II, Type III-A, and Type III-B CoCoNuT CnuH helicases contain an OB-fold domain that, in Type II and Type III-A, is flanked by helices predicted to form a stalk-like helical extension of the N-terminal RecA-like domain, a structural feature characteristic of the entire UPF1/DNA2-like helicase family within SF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chakrabarti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kalathiya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The proteins of this family are ribosome-dependent toxins that cleave either mRNA or tRNA in the ribosomal A-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>). This domain was identified by structural similarity search with the AF2 models, but no sequence conservation with characterized members of this family was detected, leaving it uncertain whether the RTL domain is an active nuclease. However, considerable divergence in sequence is not unusual in this toxin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guglielmini and Van Melderen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goeders et al., 2013</xref>). In Type III-B CoCoNuTs, a wHTH domain resembling the archaeal ssDNA-binding protein Sul7s is fused to the CnuH N-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We searched for additional homologs of CnuH (see ‘Methods’). Our observations of the contextual associations, both of the CoCoNuTs and their relatives, showed that helicases of this large family are typically encoded in operons with downstream genes coding for an elongated wHTH domain fused at its C-terminus to a variety of effectors, generally, nucleases, which we denote CnuE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 and</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the CoCoNuTs, except for Types III-B and III-C, these CnuE effectors are HEPN ribonucleases, with one HEPN domain in Type II and two in Type III-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In Type III-B, the effector is a Vsr (<italic>v</italic>ery-<italic>s</italic>hort-patch <italic>r</italic>epair)-like PD-(D/E)xK family endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Tsutakawa et al., 1999</xref>) fused directly to the helicase, with no wHTH domain present, whereas in Type III-C, a distorted version of the elongated wHTH domain is fused to two phospholipase D (PLD) family endonuclease domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All these nucleases can degrade RNA, and some, such as HEPN, have been found to cleave RNA exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pillon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ipsaro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mendez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Laganeckas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Songailiene et al., 2020</xref>). We also detected coiled-coils in the region between the wHTH and effector domains in Type II, Type III-A, and Type III-C CoCoNuT CnuE homologs. Multimer structural modeling with AF2 suggests that the wHTH domain in CnuE might interact with the coiled-coil-containing helical insertion of CnuH, perhaps mediated by the coiled-coils in each protein, to couple the ATP-driven helicase activity to the various nuclease effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). The accuracy of this model notwithstanding, the fusion of the Vsr-like effector to CnuH in Type III-B CoCoNuTs and the similarity of this system to the other CoCoNuT types strongly suggests that the CnuE effector proteins in these systems form complexes with their respective CnuH helicases. An additional factor in potential complexing by these proteins is the presence of coiled-coils in the associated CnuB/McrB and CnuC/McrC homologs, which may interact with the coiled-coils in CnuH and CnuE. Type III-B CoCoNuTs also code for a separate coiled-coil protein, which we denote CnuA, as it resembles the CnuA protein encoded in Type I-B CoCoNuTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it is distinguished from Type I-B CnuA in containing no recognizable domains other than the coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This also could potentially interact with other coiled-coil proteins in the system.</p><p>Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuTs, the most widespread varieties apart from Type I, also include conserved genes coding for a ‘TerY-P’ triad. TerY-P consists of a TerY-like von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain, a protein phosphatase 2C-like enzyme, and a serine/threonine kinase (STK) fused at the C-terminus to a zinc ribbon (ZnR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). TerY-P triads are involved in tellurite resistance, associated with various predicted DNA restriction and processing systems, and are hypothesized to function as a metal-sensing phosphorylation-dependent signaling switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anantharaman et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, TerY-P-like modules, in which the kinase is fused at the C-terminus to an OB-fold rather than a zinc ribbon, have been recently shown to function as stand-alone antiphage defense systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). The OB-fold fusion suggests that this kinase interacts with an oligonucleotide and raises the possibility that the zinc ribbon, which occupies the same position in the CoCoNuTs, is also nucleic acid-binding. Almost all CoCoNuT systems containing <italic>cnuHE</italic> operons also encompass TerY-P, with a few exceptions among Terrabacterial Type II systems and Myxococcal Type III-A systems, implying an important contribution to their function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). However, the complete absence of the TerY-P module in Type III-B and Type III-C systems suggests that when different nucleases and other putative effectors fused to the helicase are present, TerY-P is dispensable for the CoCoNuT activity. Therefore, we do not consider them to be core components of these systems.</p><p>Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuTs have similar domain compositions, but a more detailed comparison reveals substantial differences. The CnuE proteins in Type II contain one HEPN domain with the typical RxxxxH RNase motif conserved in most cases, whereas those in Type III-A contain two HEPN domains, one with the RxxxxH motif, and the other, closest to the C-terminus, with a shortened RxH motif. Furthermore, Type III-A CnuB/McrB GTPase homologs often contain C-terminal HTH-domain fusions absent in Type II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>). Finally, striking divergence has occurred between the Type II and III-A CnuC/McrC homologs. Type II CnuCs resemble Type I-A CnuCs, which contain N-terminal immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich domains, PD-(D/E)xK nucleases, zinc ribbon domains, and insertions into DUF2357 containing coiled-coils and a CSD-like OBD. However, in Type II CnuCs, this domain architecture underwent reductive evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In particular, the beta-sandwich domain and coiled-coils are shorter, the CSD was lost, the nuclease domain was inactivated, and, in many cases, the number of Zn-binding CPxC motifs was reduced from three to two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Most Type III-A CnuCs contain a CSD and coiled-coils, and thus, resemble Type I-A, but the positioning of these domains, which in Type I-A are inserted into the DUF2357 helix bundle, is not conserved in Type III-A, where these domains are located outside DUF2357 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>).</p><p>Hsp70-like ATPase NBD/SBD domains and HEAT-like repeats are fused to the CnuC/McrC N-terminal DUF2357 domain in Type III-A CoCoNuT, but their homologs in Types III-B and III-C are encoded by a separate gene. We denote these proteins CnuD and CnuCD, the latter for the CnuC-CnuD fusions in Type III-A. The separation of these domains in Types III-B and III-C implies that fusion is not required for their functional interaction with the CnuBC/McrBC systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 and</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Therefore, it appears likely that the CoCoNuT CnuD homologs bind ATP/ADP but hydrolyze ATP with extremely low efficiency, at best. Such properties in an Hsp70-like domain are better compatible with RNA binding than unfolded protein binding or remodeling, suggesting that these CnuD homologs may target the respective systems to viral/aberrant RNA. Many Hsp70 homologs have been reported to associate with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Mayer, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Willmund et al., 2013</xref>), which could also be true for the CoCoNuT Cnu(C)Ds.</p><p>Consistent with this prediction, Type II and III-A CoCoNuTs likely target RNA rather than DNA, given that the respective operons encode HEPN RNases, typically the only recognizable nuclease in these systems. All CnuC/McrC homologs in Type II or III CoCoNuT systems lack the PD-(D/E)xK catalytic motif that is required for nuclease activity, although for Type II and Types III-B and III-C, but not Type III-A, structural modeling indicates that the inactivated nuclease domain was retained, likely for a nucleic acid-binding role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

These associated WXG100 proteins implicate the ATPases in defensive protein secretion, but as they lack transmembrane domains present in their EssC homologs, a different mechanism appears likely. The presence of coiled-coils at the N-termini of these proteins suggests that they might interact with the coiled-coils in the core CoCoNuT factors and/or with the associated coiled-coil-nuclease fusion. The FtsK superfamily ATPases form hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bobrovskyy et al., 2022</xref>), so should such an interaction occur, they are likely compatible with the CnuB/McrB GTPase hexamer. A prior study that tangentially examined these operons in the context of the TerY-P triad pointed out that this WXG100/FtsK-like ATPase operon is likely a mobile element that can be found as a stand-alone secretion system in other genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anantharaman et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the second of these Type III-A CoCoNuT extensions with two VWA domains, a SpoVK family of AAA+ATPases homologous to p97/CDC48 is encoded adjacent to a protein containing a C-terminal bacteriocin-like glycine zipper motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). CDC48 is involved in eukaryotic protein quality control, particularly the degradation of proteins synthesized from non-stop mRNA, where it is required to release nascent polypeptides from stalled ribosomes to enable proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Verma et al., 2013</xref>). CDC48 contains two tandem ATPase domains, both of which are active; the CoCoNuT-associated homologs also contain tandem ATPases, but the Walker A/B motifs required to bind and hydrolyze ATP are conserved only in the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wolf and Stolz, 2012</xref>). As members of the AAA+ superfamily, these ATPases assemble into hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wolf and Stolz, 2012</xref>), similarly to the McrB family GTPases. At their C-termini, these ATPases are fused to domains of unknown function, namely, a leucine-rich repeat element and a beta-barrel domain structurally similar to biotin carrier proteins, suggesting that these proteins might be biotinylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi-Rhee and Cronan, 2003</xref>). The conserved association of the CDC48-like ATPases with these Type III-A CoCoNuTs, which encode the potentially tmRNA-binding SPB domain, seems to provide support for the scenario of tmRNA interaction. Structural analysis of the bacteriocin-like protein encoded in these loci indicates that it adopts an inactivated PD-(D/E)xK-type restriction endonuclease fold, potentially nucleic acid-binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

AF2 structural modeling suggests these enzymes are homologs of the ESX-3 Type VII secretion system factor EccE3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Poweleit et al., 2019</xref>), albeit containing a unique beta-strand insertion of variable length. This EccE3-like domain is fused to an ATPase domain similar to the Type IV secretion system protein VirB4, which is involved in bacterial conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wallden et al., 2010</xref>). These systems also encode a small helical domain of unknown function in operonic association with the ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These genes might be involved in the mobilization of the locus via conjugation or instead play a similar role in secretion as predicted for the EssC-like ATPases. However, WXG100 homologs, like those that strongly imply a secretion-related function for the EssC-like ATPases, are not encoded near these VirB4-like ATPases. Lastly, we observed that, unlike the EssC-like ATPases and the SpoVK-like proteins, these enzymes are not always encoded between VWA genes at the 5′ end of the operons, but in some cases, migrated to the 3′ end; in these cases, however, duplicated VWA domains are present at the 5′ end, a potential vestige of an extension that was recently lost or relocated.</p><p>Overall, these elaborations of Type III-A CoCoNuT systems resemble the TerY-P triads in that they could be stand-alone defensive cassettes that augment the effectiveness of the core CoCoNuT systems. It is unclear, however, why these types of factors are flanked by TerY-like VWA domains, as opposed to restriction systems such as Type I RM, GmrSD, and Druantia Type III, which are commonly associated with Type III-A CoCoNuTs as well, but are never so tightly integrated into the operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Loenen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Weigele and Raleigh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doron et al., 2018</xref>).

One of the two outcomes can result from this cascade: infection is either eradicated quickly by restriction of the virus DNA, which inhibits cOA signaling via the depletion of viral RNA, along with the activity of RING nucleases, thus averting PCD, or else, the continued presence of viral RNA stimulates cOA signaling until PCD or dormancy occurs, limiting the spread of viruses to neighboring cells in the bacterial population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Makarova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Koonin and Aravind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Koonin and Krupovic, 2019</xref>).</p><p>If CoCoNuTs associated with RtcR homologs can induce PCD, a conceptually similar but mechanistically distinct phenomenon might occur. Although many of these CoCoNuTs only contain an appended gene encoding a CARF domain-containing protein at the 5′ end of the predicted operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), there are also numerous cases where several types of DNA restriction systems are encoded between the CARF gene and the CoCoNuT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In these cases, nearly all genes are in an apparent operonic organization that can extend upward of 40 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although internal RtcR-independent promoters likely exist in these large loci, the consistent directionality and close spacing of the genes in these superoperons suggests coordination of expression. The complex organization of the CARF-CoCoNuT genomic regions, and by implication, the corresponding defense mechanisms, might accomplish the same effect as Type III CRISPR-Cas, contriving a no-win situation for the target virus. Under this scenario, the virus is either destroyed by the activity of the DNA restriction systems, which would inhibit signal production (likely RNA fragments with cyclic phosphate ends rather than cOA) and drive down CoCoNuT transcription, thereby preventing PCD, or as the virus replicates, signaling and CoCoNuT transcription would continue until the infection is aborted by PCD or dormancy caused by the degradation of host mRNA by the HEPN RNase(s) of the CoCoNuT. Another noteworthy observation consistent with PCD induction is the frequent presence of BrnT-like RelE family RNase toxins encoded in the same direction and immediately upstream of RtcR-associated CoCoNuTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A comparison of these sequences with BrnT shows notable conservation in the RNA-binding regions, but not all residues required for toxicity of BrnT are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Heaton et al., 2012</xref>). However, as described above in reference to the RelE-like RTL domain in CnuH, nucleases of this family can vary considerably in sequence while remaining active toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guglielmini and Van Melderen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goeders et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In many species of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, where CoCoNuTs are almost always associated with RtcR and various ancillary factors, Type I RM systems often contain an additional gene that encodes a transmembrane helix and a long coiled-coil fused to an RmuC-like nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These proteins were recently described as ShdA, the core component of the <italic>Pseudomonas-</italic>specific defense system Shield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Macdonald et al., 2022</xref>). These can potentially interact with coiled-coils in the CoCoNuTs, perhaps, guiding them to the DNA from which RNA targeted by the CoCoNuTs is being transcribed, or vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>A notable difference between the generally similar, dual DNA and RNA-targeting mechanism of many Type III CRISPR-Cas systems and the proposed mechanism of the CoCoNuTs is that viral RNA recognition by the Cas10-Csm complex, rather than binding of a second messenger to a CARF domain, activates both DNA cleavage activity by the HD domain and production of cOA that triggers non-specific RNA cleavage. In contrast, in the CARF-containing CoCoNuTs, both the DNA and RNA restriction factors appear to be arranged such that binding of a 2′,3′ cyclic phosphate RNA fragment by the CARF domain would initiate the expression of the entire gene cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">McMahon et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of the CoCoNuTs, signals of infection could promote transcription, first of the DNA restriction systems, and then, the CoCoNuT itself, a predicted RNA restriction system. In these complex configurations of the CoCoNuT genome neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), the gene order is likely to be important, with Type I RM almost always directly following CARF genes and CoCoNuTs typically coming last, although Druantia Type III sometimes follows the CoCoNuT. As translation in bacteria is co-transcriptional, the products of genes transcribed first would accumulate before those of the genes transcribed last, so that the full, potentially suicidal impact of the CoCoNuT predicted RNA nucleolytic engine would only be felt after the associated DNA restriction systems had ample time to act – and possibly, fail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Irastortza-olaziregi and Amster-choder, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In recent years, systematic searches for defense systems in prokaryotes, primarily by analysis of defense islands, revealed enormous, previously unsuspected diversity of such systems that function through a remarkable variety of molecular mechanisms. In this work, we uncovered the hidden diversity and striking hierarchical complexity of a distinct class of defense mechanisms, the Type IV (McrBC) restriction systems. We then zeroed in on a single major but previously overlooked branch of the McrBC systems, which we denoted CoCoNuTs for their salient features, namely, the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. Astounding complexity was discovered at this level as well, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes of CoCoNuTs that differ by their domain compositions and genomic associations. All CoCoNuTs contain domains capable of interacting with translation system components, such as the SmpB-like OB-fold, Hsp70 homologs, or YTH domains, along with RNases, such as HEPN, suggesting that at least one of the activities of these systems targets RNA. Most of the CoCoNuTs are potentially endowed with DNA-targeting activity as well, either by factors integral to the system, such as the McrC-like nuclease, or more loosely associated, such as Type I RM and Druantia Type III systems that are encoded in the same predicted superoperons with many CoCoNuTs. Numerous CoCoNuTs are associated with proteins containing CARF domains, suggesting that cyclic (oligo)nucleotides regulate the CoCoNuT activity. Given the presence of the RtcR-like CARF domains, it appears likely that the specific second messengers involved are RNA fragments with cyclic phosphate termini. We hypothesize that the CoCoNuTs, in conjunction with ancillary restriction factors, implement an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, whereby an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first, but then, if it fails, an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comprehensive identification and phylogenetic and genomic neighborhood analysis of McrB and McrC proteins</title><p>The comprehensive search for McrB and McrC proteins was seeded with publicly available multiple sequence alignments COG1401 (McrB GTPase domain), AAA_5 (the branch of AAA+ATPases containing the McrB GTPase), COG4268 (McrC), PF10117 (McrBC), COG1700 (McrC PD-(D/E)xK nuclease domain), PF04411 (McrC PD-(D/E)xK nuclease domain), and PF09823 (McrC N-terminal DUF2357). Additional alignments and individual queries were derived from data from our previous work on the EVE domain family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell et al., 2020</xref>). All alignments were clustered, and each sub-alignment or individual query sequence was used to produce a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM). These PSSMs were used as PSI-BLAST queries against the non-redundant (nr) NCBI database (<italic>E</italic>-value ≤ 10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>). Although a branch of McrB GTPase homologs has been described in animals, these are highly divergent in function, and no associated McrC homologs have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Iyer et al., 2004a</xref>). Therefore, we excluded eukaryotic sequences from our analysis to focus on the composition and contextual connections of prokaryotic McrBC systems.</p><p>Genome neighborhoods for the hits were generated by downloading their gene sequence, coordinates, and directional information from GenBank, as well as for 10 genes on each side of the hit. Domains in these genes were identified using PSI-BLAST against alignments of domains in the NCBI Conserved Domain Database (CDD) and Pfam (<italic>E</italic>-value 0.001). Some genes were additionally analyzed with HHpred for validation of the BLAST hits or if no hits were obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gabler et al., 2020</xref>). Then, these neighborhoods were filtered for the presence of a COG1401 hit (McrB GTPase domain), or hits to both an McrB ‘alias’ (MoxR, AAA_5, COG4127, DUF4357, Smc, WEMBL, Myosin_tail_1, DUF3578, EVE, Mrr_N, pfam01878) and an McrC “alias” (McrBC, McrC, PF09823, DUF2357, COG1700, PDDEXK_7, RE_LlaJI). These aliases were determined from a preliminary manual investigation of the data using HHpred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>). Several of the McrB aliases are not specific to McrB, and instead are domains commonly fused to McrB GTPase homologs, or are larger families, such as AAA_5, that contain McrB homologs. We found that many bona fide McrB homologs, validated by HHpred, produced hits not to COG1401 but rather to these other domains, so we made an effort to retain them.</p><p>The McrB candidates identified by this filtering process were clustered to a similarity threshold of 0.5 with MMseqs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hauser et al., 2016</xref>), after which the sequences in each cluster were aligned with MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edgar, 2004</xref>). Next, profile-to-profile similarity scores between all clusters were calculated with HHsearch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Söding, 2005</xref>). Clusters with high similarity, defined as a pairwise score to self-score ratio &gt; 0.1, were aligned to each other with HHalign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Söding et al., 2006</xref>). This procedure was performed for a total of three iterations. The alignments of each cluster resulting from this protocol, which included some false-positive clusters consisting of other members of the AAA_5 family, were analyzed with HHpred to remove the false positives, after which the GTPase domain sequences were extracted manually using HHpred, and the alignments were used as queries for a second round of PSI-BLAST against the nr NCBI database as described above. At this stage, the abundance of the CoCoNuT and CoCoPALM see above types of McrB GTPases had become apparent; therefore, results of targeted searches for these subtypes were included in the pool of hits from the second round of PSI-BLAST.</p><p>Genome neighborhoods were generated for these hits and filtered for aliases as described above. Further filtering of the data, which did not pass this initial filter, involved relaxing the criteria to include neighborhoods with only one hit to an McrB or McrC alias, but with a gene adjacent to the hit (within 90 nucleotides), oriented in the same direction as the hit, and encoding a protein of sufficient size (&gt;200 aa for McrB, &gt;150 aa for McrC) to be the undetected McrB or McrC component. Afterward, we filtered the remaining data to retain genome islands with no McrBC aliases but with PSI-BLAST hits in operonic association with genes of sufficient size, as described above, to be the other McrBC component. These data, which contained many false positives but captured many rare variants, were then clustered and analyzed as described above to remove false positives. Next, an automated procedure was developed to excise the GTPase domain sequences using the manual alignments generated during the first phase of the search as a reference. These GTPase sequences were further analyzed by clustering and HHpred to remove false positives.</p><p>Definitive validation by pairing McrB homologs with their respective McrC homologs was also used to corroborate their identification. Occasionally, the McrB and McrC homologs were separated by intervening genes, or the operon order was reversed, and consideration of those possibilities allowed the validation of many additional systems. The pairing process was complicated by, and drew our attention to, the frequent occurrence of multiple copies of McrBC systems in the same islands that may function cooperatively. Lastly, the rigorously validated set of McrBC pairs, supplemented only with orphans manually annotated as McrBC components using HHpred, were used for our phylogenetics. The final alignments of GTPase and DUF2357 domains were produced using the iterative alignment procedure described above for 10 iterations. Approximately maximum-likelihood trees were built with the FastTree program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Price et al., 2010</xref>) from representative sequences following clustering to a 0.9 similarity threshold with MMseqs2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Protein domain detection and annotation</title><p>Protein domains in McrBC homologs and proteins encoded by neighboring genes were initially identified using the method described above, the first pass using PSI-BLAST against alignments of domains in the NCBI CDD and Pfam (<italic>E</italic>-value 0.001). In many cases where no domains could be confidently detected with this method, or for validation of the hits from the first pass, HHpred was used for more sensitive analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>). The CoCoNuT system components were subjected to additional scrutiny using the coiled-coil detection and visualization tool Waggawagga, which employs several algorithms for coiled-coil prediction, including Marcoil, Multicoil2, Ncoils, and Paircoil2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Simm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delorenzi and Speed, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Trigg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lupas et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">McDonnell et al., 2006</xref>). These predictions varied in their strength, with the long coiled-coils detected in CnuA and CnuB homologs having the highest likelihood (usually the maximum P-score of 100 with Marcoil and Multicoil2) and being recognized by the most of the applied tools (BLAST, HHpred, and multiple algorithms used by Waggawagga). The shorter coiled-coils in CnuC, CnuD, and CnuH homologs were less strongly, but nevertheless confidently predicted, usually being detected by HHpred and by at least one but typically, more than one, coiled-coil prediction tool. The analysis was performed on both representative individual sequences and consensus sequences. The potential coiled-coils in CnuE homologs were often only found by Ncoils and were near the limit of detection, but these regions were also reported as coiled-coils in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anantharaman et al., 2012</xref>). Given the context of extensive, high-probability coiled-coils in other components of the CoCoNuT systems with which they might interact, we chose to report these CnuE regions as coiled-coils, despite the comparative weakness of these predictions. In the AF2 multimer model of CnuHE, one of these potential coiled-coils is positioned near the coiled-coils detected in CnuH, suggesting they may facilitate interaction between these two factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of CoCoNuT CnuH helicases</title><p>A comprehensive search and phylogenetic analysis of this family was beyond the scope of this work, but to determine the relationships between the CoCoNuTs and the rest of the UPF1-like helicases, we used the following procedure. We retrieved the best 2000 hits in each of two searches with UPF1 and CoCoNuT helicases as queries against both a database containing predicted proteins from 24,757 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes downloaded from the NCBI GenBank in November 2021 and a database containing 72 representative eukaryotic genomes that were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank in June 2020. Next, we combined all proteins from the four searches, made a nonredundant set, and annotated them using CDD profiles, as described above. Then, we aligned them with MUSCLE v5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edgar, 2022</xref>), constructed an approximately maximum-likelihood tree with FastTree, and mapped the annotations onto the tree.

Some of the single chain AF2 predictions shown in this work are not compatible, for example, with homohexameric complex formation due to incompatible orientation of domains. The recent advances in protein structure prediction, in particular AlphaFold2 (AF2) multimer, now allow us to confidently probe potential protein-protein interactions and protein complex formation. This predictive power could be exploited here to produce a better glimpse of these multimeric protein systems. It can also provide a more sound explanation for some of the observed differences amongst different McrBC types.</p></disp-quote><p>Hexameric CnuB complexes with CnuC stimulatory monomers for Type I-A, I-B, I-C, II, and III-A CoCoNuT systems have been modeled with AF2 and included in Supplementary Data File S1, albeit without the domains fused to the GTPase N-terminus (with the exception of Type I-B, which lacks the long coiled-coil domain fused to the GTPase and was modeled with its entire sequence). Attempts to model the other full-length CnuB hexamers did not lead to convincing results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p><p>The detailed recommendations by the two reviewers will help the authors to further strengthen the manuscript, but two points seem particularly worth considering: 1. The methods are barely sketched in the manuscript, but it could be useful to detail them more closely. Particularly regarding the coiled-coil segments, which are currently just statists, useful mainly for the name of the family, more detail on their prediction, structural properties, and purpose would be very helpful. 2. Due to its encyclopedic nature, the wealth of material presented in the paper makes it hard to penetrate in one go. Any effort to make it more accessible would be very welcome. Reviewer 1 in particular has made a number of suggestions regarding the figures, which would make them provide more support for the findings described in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>A description of the techniques used to identify coiled-coil segments has been added to the Methods. Our predictions ranged from near certainty in the coiled-coils detected in CnuB homologs, to shorter helices at the limit of detection in other factors. We chose to report all probable coiled-coils, as the extensive coiled-coils fused to CnuB, which are often the only domain present other than the GTPase, imply involvement in mediating complex formation by interacting with coiled-coils in other factors, particularly the other CoCoNuT factors. The suggestions made by Reviewer 1 were thoughtful and we made an effort to incorporate them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I do not have any major issues with the manuscript.

It will be difficult to utilize outside of the NCBI software environment, but for full disclosure, we have included a zipped repository with the scripts and custom-code dependencies, although there are external dependencies as well such as FastTree and BLAST. In brief, it involves PSI-BLAST detection of regions with the most significant homology to one of a set of provided alignments (seals-2-master/bin/wrappers/cog_psicognitor). In this case, the reference alignments of McrB-like GTPases and DUF2357 were generated manually using HHpred to analyze alignments of clustered PSI-BLAST results. This step provided an output of coordinates defining domain footprints in each query sequence, which were then combined and/or extended using scripts based on manual analysis of many examples with HHpred (footprint_finders/get_GTPase_frags.py and footprint_finders/get_DUF2357_frags.py), then these coordinates were used to excise such regions from the query amino acid sequence with a final script (seals-2-master/bin/misc/fa2frag).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Page 4, line 77 - 'PUA superfamily domains' could be more appropriate to use instead of &quot;EVE superfamily&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>While this statement could perhaps be applied to PUA superfamily domains, our previous work we refer to, which strongly supports the assertion, was restricted to the EVE-like domains and we prefer to retain the original language.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Page 5. lines 128-130 - AF2 multimer prediction model could provide a more sound explanation for these differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Our AF2 multimer predictions added in this revision indeed show that the NxD motif McrB-like CoCoNuT GTPases interact with their respective McrC-like partners such that an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich domain, fused to the N-termini of the McrC homologs and similar to Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1, has the potential to physically interact with the GTPase variants. However, we did not probe this in greater detail, as it is beyond the scope of this already highly complex article, but we plan to study it in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Page 8, line 252 - The surface charge distribution of CnuH OB fold domain looks very different from SmpB (pdb3iyr).

Experimental validation will ultimately be necessary to resolve these kinds of questions, but for now, it may be safe to say that the presence of this domain, especially in conjunction with the neighboring RelE-like RTL domain and UPF1-like helicase domain, signals a likely interaction with the A-site of the ribosome, and perhaps restriction of aberrant/viral mRNA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
