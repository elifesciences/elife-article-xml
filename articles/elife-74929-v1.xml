But occasionally these actions cannot be withheld and are released at inappropriate times, impulsively. Striatal activity has been shown to participate in the timing of action sequence initiation and it has been linked to impulsivity. Using a self-initiated task, we trained adult male rats to withhold a rewarded action sequence until a waiting time interval has elapsed. By analyzing neuronal activity we show that the striatal response preceding the initiation of the learned sequence is strongly modulated by the time subjects wait before eliciting the sequence. Interestingly, the modulation is steeper in adolescent rats, which show a strong prevalence of impulsive responses compared to adults. We hypothesize this anticipatory striatal activity reflects the animals’ subjective reward expectation, based on the elapsed waiting time, while the steeper waiting modulation in adolescence reflects age-related differences in temporal discounting, internal urgency states, or explore–exploit balance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dorsal striatum</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>action sequence</kwd><kwd>waiting time</kwd><kwd>impulsivity</kwd><kwd>adolescence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003074</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2016-0396</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Belluscio</surname><given-names>Mariano Andrés</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003074</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2017-0520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murer</surname><given-names>Mario Gustavo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003074</institution-id><institution>Agencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2017-2465</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez</surname><given-names>Maria Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007351</institution-id><institution>Secretaria de Ciencia y Tecnica, Universidad de Buenos Aires</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UBACYT (2018-2020 305BA)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murer</surname><given-names>Mario Gustavo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In adolescent rats, whose actions are more impulsive, neuronal striatal activity that precedes self-initiated action sequences has a steeper modulation by waiting time compared to the modulation found in adults.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The striatum is involved in the acquisition and execution of action sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graybiel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hikosaka et al., 1999</xref>).

Sometimes, well-learned action sequences need to be initiated at precise times to obtain the desired outcome. However, these actions may be difficult to withhold when triggering cues are present, and also difficult to stop once they have been initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalley and Robbins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillan et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graybiel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knowlton and Patterson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robbins and Costa, 2017</xref>).

An influential theory in the field postulates a dual control system for behavior, where dorsolateral striatal (DLS) circuits support habitual stimulus–response control whereas dorsomedial striatal (DMS) circuits mediate cognitive-based deliberative control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daw et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graybiel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</xref>)⁠.

In contrast, the DMS encodes reward expectancy, reward prediction errors, and trial outcomes even after extensive training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kubota et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rueda-Orozco and Robbe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Samejima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thorn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vandaele et al., 2019</xref>)⁠.

A bias toward exploration and risk-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addicott et al., 2017</xref>)⁠, low tolerance for delayed rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalley and Robbins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Monterosso and Ainslie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wittmann and Paulus, 2008</xref>) and elevated internal urgency states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carland et al., 2019</xref>)⁠, may all contribute to impulsivity traits. However, how neuronal activity in the dorsal striatum informs about enhanced premature responding in conditions of high impulsivity, remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we studied striatal activity during a self-paced task where rats have to withhold a rewarded action sequence until a waiting interval has elapsed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zold and Hussain Shuler, 2015</xref>)⁠. Prematurely initiated sequences were penalized by re-initiating the waiting interval. Despite the negative effect this timer re-initialization may have, the animals showed premature responding even after extensive training. Moreover, they often failed to interrupt the execution of the action sequence although there was sensory evidence of its untimely initiation. Thus, the task allowed comparing striatal activity during behaviorally indistinguishable prematurely and timely executed learned action sequences. We found a peak of striatal activity preceding trial initiation that was modulated by the time waited before responding. In addition, this modulation grew at a faster rate in adolescent rats. This likely reflects a steeper growing increase in reward expectancy during waiting that could underlie their more impulsive behavior compared to adult rats.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rats learn to make timely action sequences to obtain a water reward</title><p>Water-deprived rats were trained to obtain water from a lick tube located within a nose-poke by emitting a sequence of eight licks following a visual cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>; task modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zold and Hussain Shuler, 2015</xref>)⁠.

Because in the present task the learned action sequence is often prematurely released, we asked if the observed anticipatory activity could specifically predict its release, and if, additionally, encodes its timing. When all port entry responsive neurons were considered (i.e., port entry only plus port entry/port exit neurons), the average firing rate modulation anticipating trial initiation was higher for timely than for premature trials irrespective of the upcoming action including the 8-lick sequence or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 330)</sub> = 30.84, p = 7.01 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, significant main effect of trial initiation timing, no effect of action sequence-structure <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 330)</sub> = 0.089, p = 0.765, no interaction, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 330)</sub> = 9.64 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, p = 0.992, two-way RM ANOVA). On average, this activity began 1 s before and peaked 0.5 s before the animal crossed the infrared beam located at port entry, both in premature and timely trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Since this anticipatory activity closely preceded approaching movements toward the nose-poke, we analyzed accelerometer recordings of head movements available from two adult rats. The accelerometer recordings did not show differences in movement initiation time between premature and timely 8-lick trials (0.357 ± 0.027 and 0.382 ± 0.023 s before port entry– mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) – for premature and timely trials, respectively, <italic>t</italic><sub>(8)</sub> = 0.636, p = 0.543, Paired <italic>t</italic>-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the 8-lick sequences emitted during premature and timely trials lasted the same and had the same latency and inter-lick interval regularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>), suggesting similar action vigor during premature and timely 8-lick trials. Thus, although head acceleration data may not include differences in movements of other body parts, our data support that in this task, the firing rate modulation preceding trial initiation discriminates between premature and timely trials and does not predict the speed, regularity, structure, value, or vigor of the subsequently released action sequence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Prematurely initiated trials are preceded by low striatal anticipatory activity.</title><p>Data come from five adult animals performing the standard 2.5-s waiting time task except for (<bold>H–J</bold>), where they correspond to three rats trained in the 2.5- to 5-s cutoff task.

Similar results were obtained in rats trained with a longer waiting interval. Because of the longer waiting time, behaviour becomes less organized during the first seconds after port exit in the 5s task, however, the modulation of activity is still observed in the bins that are close to port entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, there was no modulation of this neuronal activity by time waited in the following trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), nor of port exit-related activity by the previous waiting time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The steep slope of the curve at the criterion waiting time suggested that the neuronal activity does not linearly report elapsed time but is rather related to changes in reward anticipation as waiting progressed. To explore this possibility, we analyzed striatal activity of rats trained with a modified version of the task requiring initiating trials not before 2.5 s and no later than 5 s after exiting the port in the previous trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Waiting less than 2.5 s (premature trials) or more than 5 s (late trials) was penalized by resetting the waiting timer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We reasoned that if this activity provides a reward anticipation signal for the upcoming action, it should decrease after 5 s of waiting in the modified version of the task, considering that trials with &gt;5-s waiting time are not rewarded. As in the standard version of the task, the animals learned to wait the less possible time between trials, and also noticed the effect of the cutoff time on reward probability, as evidenced by a reduced number of late trials with training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, <italic>q</italic><sub>(20)</sub> = 10.64, p = 1.10 × 10<sup>−9</sup> versus timely trials, Tukey post hoc test after significant one-way RM ANOVA [<italic>F</italic><sub>(1.70, 34.05)</sub> = 33.07, p = 1.81 × 10<sup>−6</sup>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In the present task, there are two types of non-rewarded, yet correctly performed trials: (1) the premature 8-lick trials, which seem to be necessary to maintain an internal representation of the criterion waiting time, but should be minimized to improve the reward rate; and (2) the 50% of timely unrewarded trials that still need to be maintained to sustain the reward rate. Importantly, the animal cannot predict if a timely trial will be rewarded or not but they should be able to predict that no reward will be received after initiating a premature trial as the absence of the light cue unequivocally indicates that no reward will be delivered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To determine if the negative outcome associated with premature 8-lick trials is reported by striatal neurons, and particularly, if this report differs from the report of an unrewarded outcome during timely trials, we looked for outcome-related activity modulations at the time of the eight lick during timely rewarded, timely unrewarded and premature trials with 8-lick sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–G</xref>). Overall, ~15% of the neurons recorded in adult rats (125 out of 867) showed responses at the time of the 8-lick that differed between these trial types. We found neurons that responded preferentially to: (1) reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, ‘reward-responsive neurons’), (2) to non-rewarded conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, ‘no reward-responsive’), and (3) to the absence of reward during premature 8-lick trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, ‘expected no reward-responsive’). More specifically, 5% of all recorded neurons (<italic>n</italic> = 49) showed a higher activity modulation when a reward was obtained than in either no-reward conditions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> top: reward-responsive neurons, Rewarded versus Unrewarded trials, <italic>q</italic><sub>(48)</sub> = 11.18, p = 5.77 × 10<sup>–15</sup>, Rewarded versus Premature trials, <italic>q</italic><sub>(48)</sub> = 12.52, p = 9.82 × 10<sup>–17</sup>, Unrewarded versus Premature trials, <italic>q</italic><sub>(48)</sub> = 4.89, p = 1.18 × 10<sup>–5</sup>, Tukey test after significant one-way RM ANOVA (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1.27, 61.14)</sub> = 66.01, p = 2.69 × 10<sup>–11</sup>). This difference is observed just before lick rates began to diverge by trial type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Five percent of the striatal neurons showed activation at the time of the no-reward outcome in timely unrewarded trials and were unresponsive to reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, these neurons showed a marked activation at the time of the eighth lick during premature 8-lick trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> middle: no reward-responsive neurons, Rewarded versus Unrewarded trials, <italic>q</italic><sub>(45)</sub> = 12.61, p = 2.23 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, Rewarded versus Premature trials <italic>q</italic><sub>(45)</sub> = 9.77, p = 1.08 × 10<sup>–12</sup>, Unrewarded versus Premature trials <italic>q</italic><sub>(45)</sub> = 3.85, p = 3.69 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, Tukey test after significant one-way RM ANOVA (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1.28, 57.7)</sub> = 57.11, p = 3.75 × 10<sup>–10</sup>)). Strikingly, there were 33 neurons (4% of all recorded neurons) that showed a twofold higher activation at the time of the eighth lick in premature trials than in timely unrewarded trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> bottom: Rewarded versus Unrewarded trials <italic>q</italic><sub>(30)</sub> = 5.51, p = 5.39 × 10<sup>–6</sup>, Rewarded versus Premature trials <italic>q</italic><sub>(30)</sub> = 12.07, p = 4.81 × 10<sup>–13</sup>, Unrewarded versus Premature trials <italic>q</italic><sub>(30)</sub> = 10.72, p = 8.86 × 10<sup>–12</sup>, Tukey test after significant one-way RM ANOVA (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1.71, 51.39)</sub> = 51.34, p = 2.99 × 10<sup>–9</sup>)). This difference cannot be explained by differences in lick rates because licking decreased at similar rates after the eighth lick in both types of non-rewarded trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, bottom). Importantly, the no-reward outcome is certain in premature trials as indicated by the absence of the light cue. Further data analysis showed that, indeed, the three populations of outcome-responsive neurons (reward-responsive, no reward-responsive, and ‘expected no-reward’-responsive) distinguished between those trials when the timing was right but there was no reward from those where the animal entered the nose-poke prematurely, which are never rewarded. However, those neurons showing a higher activation during premature trials discriminated better between the two no-reward conditions (Rewarded vs. Unrewarded trials <italic>q</italic><sub>(45)</sub> = 0.39, p = 0.694; Rewarded vs. Premature trials <italic>q</italic><sub>(30)</sub> = 5.01, p = 2.23 × 10<sup>–5</sup>; Unrewarded vs. Premature trials <italic>q</italic><sub>(30)</sub> = 5.43, p = 6.89 × 10<sup>–6</sup>; mixed-effects analysis after significant one-way RM ANOVA (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1.62, 99.89)</sub> = 11.80, p = 8.65 × 10<sup>–4</sup>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Overall, the data support that activity at the time of expected trial outcome reflects differences in reward prediction between premature and timely trials.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Activity at port exit reports whether the animal has performed the learned action sequence or not</title><p>Although striatal activity predominated at the boundaries of the learned behavioral response, the activity preceding response initiation was not invariably connected to the execution of the learned action sequence. However, when all port exit neurons were considered (i.e., port exit only plus port entry/port exit neurons), a higher activity was observed for 8-lick trials than for trials with an incomplete licking sequence, independently of whether the trials were timely initiated or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>; <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 101)</sub> = 36.28, p = 2.79 × 10<sup>–8</sup> for lick sequence structure, no effect of trial timing <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 101)</sub> = 1.86, p = 0.176, interaction <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 101)</sub> = 4.07, p = 0.046, two-way RM ANOVA). Moreover, there was no difference between trial types in the accelerometer data at the time animals exited the port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

In order to better understand how adolescent animals behave in this self-initiated task where an internal representation of time should be kept to withhold a prepotent response, we recorded striatal activity from five 35- to 46-day-old rats and trained them in the 2.5-s waiting interval task.

To substantiate the dynamics of the age-related differential modulation of anticipatory activity, we adjusted a logistic function to the binned neuronal activity data of each age group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>). Despite the relatively low number of 8-lick premature trials, which forced us to use relatively long bins for the shortest waiting times, the equation fitted the data convincingly (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.904 and 0.945 for adolescent and adult rats, respectively). Importantly, the adolescent rats curve showed a significantly steeper increase than the adult rats curve (p2 coefficient of the logistic function, profile likelihood estimation of the 95% confidence interval: adolescent rats = 1.080 (95% CI: 0.533–2.160) and adult rats = 0.4525 (95% CI: 0.273–0.747); <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 16)</sub> = 4.86, p = 0.042). Interestingly, the difference between the curves was more evident during the first seconds that follow the criterion wait time than for shorter waiting times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>, inset). To understand the behavioral correlate of the observed neuronal activity differences, the same logistic function previously used to fit the neuronal data was adjusted to the cumulative frequency distribution of 8-lick trial initiation times of each age group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.9307 and 0.8874, for adolescent and adult rats, respectively). As expected, the curve of the adolescent group showed a significantly steeper growth rate (p2 coefficient of the logistic function, profile likelihood estimation of 95% confidence interval: adolescent rats = 0.703 (95% CI: 0.683–0.724) and adult rats = 0.392 (95% CI: 0.380–0.406), <italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 9960)</sub>=658.8, p = 9.60 × 10<sup>–14</sup>). Similar behavioral results were obtained in an independent sample of 6 adolescent and 6 adult rats without electrode implants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Remarkably, in addition to a relative excess of premature 8-lick trials, the adolescent rats showed relatively more timely trials than adult rats at short times after the criterion wait time was surpassed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>), suggesting that adult rats are more tolerant to reward delay. Indeed, for a waiting time of 5.1 s, adult rats had accumulated 50% of 8-lick trials, while adolescent rats had already accumulated 70% of the trials. Finally, we adjusted the logistic function to the data of each rat separately. We then computed a correlation between the p2 parameters obtained for the waiting modulation of neuronal activity and trial initiation times, and found a significant correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O</xref>, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.833, p = 2 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 10).</p><p>In sum, the data show that the waiting modulation of reward anticipation grows at a faster rate in adolescent rats, paralleling a higher rate of accumulation of initiated trials across time in this age group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present task, water-deprived rats learn to withhold a prepotent response to a water port to avoid a negative contingency, the re-initiation of the waiting interval, which delays the opportunity to get the next reward. The task resembles differential reinforcement of low rates of responding protocols (DRL) that are used to assess response inhibition and timing factors associated with impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Monterosso and Ainslie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neill, 1976</xref>)⁠. Factors that increase premature responding in humans, such as psychostimulant drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evenden, 1998</xref>)⁠, psychostimulant withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peterson et al., 2003</xref>)⁠, D2-type receptor agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engeln et al., 2016</xref>)⁠, maternal separation and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lovic et al., 2011</xref>)⁠, sleep restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kamphuis et al., 2017</xref>),⁠ and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrzejewski et al., 2011</xref>)⁠ also increase premature responding in rodents trained with DRL procedures. Furthermore, these procedures have been used in educational and clinically meaningful contexts to reduce impulsive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonner and Borrero, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lennox et al., 1987</xref>)⁠. Unlike classical DRL procedures, the present task requires responding with an action sequence that becomes highly automatized with training and could not always be stopped despite sensory feedback telling that it will not be rewarded. Interestingly, although premature responding showed an overall decrease with training, the premature releases of the learned action sequence were selectively preserved, suggesting that these responses are necessary to learn the duration of the waiting interval and to adapt to its changes. As long as the waiting interval remains predictable, investigation of the waiting interval through premature responding should be minimized to improve reward rate. Importantly, adolescent rats learn the task but make more premature responses per reward obtained. In addition, they initiate their timely trials closer to the criterion wait time than the adult rats, supporting that they are less patient. Overall, the adolescent rats seem to take a higher risk of releasing the learned action sequence prematurely, which makes them more impulsive than adult rats in the present task.</p><p>Recent studies link premature responding in anticipation of reinforcement to a higher tendency to automatize behavior and form habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Everitt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Voon et al., 2015</xref>)⁠⁠. Striatal activity marking the boundaries of automatized action chains has been perceived as a sign of ‘packaged behavioral sequences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graybiel, 2008</xref>)⁠ that would be difficult to stop after their release regardless of whether their initiation was more or less goal directed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geddes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robbins and Costa, 2017</xref>)⁠. While this ‘bracketing activity’ prevails in the DLS, according to some studies, the representation of task events contributing to goal-directed behavior persists in the DMS even after extensive training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kubota et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thorn et al., 2010</xref>)⁠. These parallel representations may allow switching between automatic and deliberation-based task-solving strategies when outcomes change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daw et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</xref>)⁠ or interventions that modify neural activity impair behavioral control by one of the circuits involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith and Graybiel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yin et al., 2004</xref>)⁠. The remarkably similar behavior observed in 8-lick prematurely released and timely unrewarded trials led us to expect that a stronger boundary activity, and/or a less precise coding of task events, could explain the higher rates of premature responding observed in adolescent rats. Indeed, a recent study suggested that the stronger the activity at the action initiation, the lower the deliberation at the turn-choice site in a T-maze task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith and Graybiel, 2013</xref>)⁠. Here, the strength of anticipatory activity increased with the time waited before response release and was higher in the more impulsive adolescent rats. However, it did not predict that the rewarded 8-lick sequence would be included in the behavioral response. On the other hand, a similar activity followed all responses containing the learned 8-lick sequence regardless of trial outcome and despite the markedly different lick rates observed between rewarded and unrewarded responses after outcome disclosure. A recent study showed that hierarchical control during action sequence execution may allow the selective removal of intermediate sequence elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geddes et al., 2018</xref>)⁠, which could be a mechanism through which licks could be deleted from behavioral responses preceded by similar wait time-based reward expectations in the present task. Moreover, since our recordings were mainly obtained from the medial and central dorsal striatal regions, we cannot rule out that a different anticipatory activity specific for the learned sequence emerges in the DLS in our task as previously reported for other tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jog et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martiros et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thorn et al., 2010</xref>)⁠. Importantly, the activity of many striatal neurons seemed to continuously follow the expression of the lick sequence as has also been reported previously by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rueda-Orozco and Robbe, 2015</xref>)⁠ and a recent study showed a continuous modulation of striatal neuronal activity across the initiation, execution, and termination of cue-guided locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sales-Carbonell et al., 2018</xref>)⁠. Overall, our data show that the concentration of striatal activity at the beginning and end of a learned task is widely expressed in the dorsal striatum even after skilled performance is reached, as reported in a recent study with a different task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vandaele et al., 2019</xref>)⁠, and suggest that, this activity is more flexible regarding the properties of the behavioral response it bounds, and carries information about its pertinent timing.</p><p>We speculated that the more impulsive behavior of adolescent rats observed in the present task could relate to changes in wait time-based modulation of reward anticipation and/or outcome evaluation signals. Striatal signals at the time of expected outcome not only discriminated between rewarded and unrewarded correct trials as observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atallah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nonomura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shin et al., 2018</xref>)⁠, but also premature from timely responses. A specific outcome evaluation signal after premature 8-lick trials may serve to inhibit premature responding and minimize the exploration of the waiting interval. To compute such outcome signal, the animal has to retain information regarding the time waited before responding (or regarding visual feedback on proper trial initiation timing) while monitoring the execution of the lick sequence. Such kind of integration could be implemented by retaining information of early task events along the sequential activation of striatal ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Her et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nonomura et al., 2018</xref>)⁠. However, although the effect of waiting time on task-related striatal activity extended until the time of the visual cue, it was absent in ensembles with lick-related activity. Thus, the sustained lick-related signal may serve to estimate outcome timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zold and Hussain Shuler, 2015</xref>)⁠, but information about trial initiation timing or the visual cue should arrive at outcome-sensitive ensembles through other mechanisms likely involving inputs from prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asaad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hamid et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wassum et al., 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, we found no differences in outcome evaluation signals that could explain the more impulsive behavior of adolescent rats. On the other hand, although premature responding has classically been linked to poor behavioral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bari and Robbins, 2013</xref>)⁠, alternative views equates it to preferring a smaller more immediate reward over a larger delayed one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalley and Robbins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Monterosso and Ainslie, 1999</xref>)⁠, and to deficient gathering or evaluation of evidence while waiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalley and Robbins, 2017</xref>)⁠. Interestingly, influential models propose that time estimates derived from accumulation of pacemaker counts can be compared to a memorized time interval to decide whether a target time has been reached or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buhusi and Meck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibbon, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Namboodiri and Hussain Shuler, 2016</xref>)⁠. Previous studies showed that dorsal striatum ensembles can provide time estimations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakhurin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gouvêa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>) and we also found sequential and tonic ensemble activation during the waiting period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that could serve to track time while waiting in the present task. By comparing the time accumulated while waiting against the memorized waiting interval, the animal could anticipate how likely is the upcoming action to be rewarded. How fast reward expectancy steps up when time waited approaches the reference time interval would depend on several factors, including temporal discounting effects on reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Monterosso and Ainslie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Namboodiri and Hussain Shuler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wittmann and Paulus, 2008</xref>)⁠. In this sense, the anticipatory signal we observe could be interpreted as a reading of the temporal discount function at the time chosen to release the learned action sequence. A recent theory proposes that animals time their decisions by estimating if they can improve the reward rate experienced in the recent past; according to it, the longer the time window over which reinforcement history is estimated, the higher the tolerance to delays of future rewards (i.e., the less steep the temporal discount effect) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Namboodiri et al., 2014</xref>)⁠. Adults should be able to integrate information about past reinforcement history over longer time windows that adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Namboodiri et al., 2014</xref>)⁠, which is consistent with the finding that temporal discount rate decreases throughout childhood and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Green et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheres et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steinberg et al., 2009</xref>)⁠. Alternative theories propose that waiting impulsivity relates to perceiving durations longer than they are, which would be associated to perceiving a higher cost of time and with a steeper temporal discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wittmann and Paulus, 2008</xref>)⁠. Moreover, time perception depends on several cognitive processes that are modified by adolescence including working memory, attention, and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baumann and Odum, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wittmann and Paulus, 2008</xref>)⁠. It has been also been proposed that impulsivity relates to changes in an internal urgency signal that influences the timing of decisions and may be primary responsible for the build-up of neural activity observed in the striatum and cortex that often precedes action initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carland et al., 2019</xref>)⁠.</p><p>Interestingly, in the present task, adolescent rats achieve a similar reward rate to adult rats and, indeed, they do not show the negative effect of premature trials on reward rate that is observed in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, although they achieve this reward rate at the expense of a higher energy cost (more premature trials per reward obtained), by prematurely executing the learned action sequence, adolescents would likely get more precise information regarding the duration of the waiting interval, which, in turn, would refresh more frequently their cognitive map of the task. This view is consistent with the idea that impulsivity is advantageous when it helps to adapt to uncertain environments and that increased exploratory behavior in adolescence allows gaining knowledge that would be useful to guide decisions in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addicott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spear, 2000</xref>)⁠. In this context, the steepness of the wait time-based reward anticipation signal could be under the influence of a gain factor that, according to reinforcement learning models, reflects the degree of preference for the highest value option and regulates explore–exploit tradeoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addicott et al., 2017</xref>)⁠. Further studies are needed to disclose which factors influence the wait time-based reward anticipation signal we observe in the present task and which among them are responsible for the differences observed between adult and adolescent rats. Moreover, since the experiments have been conducted in male rats and impulsivity has sexually dimorphic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weafer and de Wit, 2014</xref>)⁠, studies are needed to understand how female animals behave in the present task and whether female and male animals encode wait time-based reward anticipation differently.</p><p>In summary, detailed analysis of behavior in a waiting task that promotes premature responding with an automatized action sequence shows a more impulsive behavior in adolescent rats. Unlike other tasks previously used to study neural correlates of waiting impulsivity (e.g., the 5-choice serial reaction time task), the present task is learned rapidly, which makes it suitable for studying premature responding during rodent adolescence. Moreover, by requiring self-paced responding with a stereotyped action sequence, and making uncertain reward obtention during timely trials, the task generates conditions that ‘clamp’ behavior. This allowed identifying a modulation of anticipatory striatal activity by time waited before responding, which grows with a steeper slope in adolescent rats, likely reflecting age-related changes in temporal discounting, internal urgency states or explore–exploit balance. Translational studies are necessary to understand if similarly designed tasks capture the relationship between impulsivity and automaticity in behavior that has been related to vulnerability to drug addiction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were adult male Long-Evans rats (adolescents: 28- to 46-day-old at the beginning of the experiments, weight ~120 g; adults: 70–128 days old at the beginning of the experiments, weight ~390 g), kept under a 12-hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 A.M.) at a constant temperature range of 21–23°C.

Body temperature was maintained using a heating pad. Through a small craniotomy performed in the corresponding area the tetrodes were then lowered to a depth of 3.5 mm. The micromanipulator was fixed in place with dental cement. Two stainless steel screws (0–80× 1/8″ Philips Pan head) were inserted above the cerebellum to be used as ground and reference. Three additional steel screws were inserted to anchor the whole implant to the skull. The craniotomy was covered with a sterile 50–50 mixture of mineral oil and paraffin. Toward the end of the surgical procedure, animals were treated with antibiotics (i.m., enrofloxacin 10 mg/kg) and a veterinary ointment (antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and anesthetic) was applied on the skin in contact with the external side of the implant to prevent microbial infections. Subjects were kept under careful observation until awakening. The first recording session followed 7 days of post-surgical recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral training</title><p>Rats were placed in a dark behavioral operant chamber that contained a nose-poke where they could seek a water reward by licking through a slot onto a lick tube (Med associates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After a minimum of 2.5 s (criterion waiting time), rats could initiate a trial by entering the nose-poke, 200 ms after which they received a 100 ms visual cue through two green leds placed on the sides of the nose-poke. The animal was then required to lick eight times to gain a water reward (~20 μl of water) in 50% of the trials in a pseudo-random manner. Licks were detected through an infrared beam located at the sides of the lick tube. Trials ended when the animal removed its head from the nose-poke. Sessions ended when the subject completed 300 trials or when the session reached 120 min. Premature trials are those in which the criterion waiting time was violated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Once the animal reached 80% of timely trials with a complete 8-lick sequence for two consecutive days, sessions were considered ‘late sessions’. ‘Early’ sessions were considered from the first day of training and the number of early sessions was determined to match those classified as ‘late’ for each animal, for comparison purposes. The remaining sessions between ‘early’ and ‘late’ were classified as ‘intermediate’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Variants of the rewarded task</title><p>We performed two additional versions of the task: one in which the criterion waiting time was duplicated (5-s waiting time task) and another in which the animals had to enter the nose-poke within a waiting interval of 2.5–5 s (2.5- to 5-s waiting time task). For the 5-s waiting time task, subjects were trained just like in the 2.5-s task, being the minimum waiting interval of 5 s. After reaching a stable performance with the 5-s waiting interval, two of the animals were switched to the 2.5-s protocol (data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>For the 2.5- to 5-s waiting time task, rats were trained with a ‘shaping protocol’. Briefly, they were trained for three consecutive sessions with a 2.5-s task and afterwards we incorporated an upper limit to the waiting interval: any trial started with a waiting interval longer than the upper limit was not rewarded. The upper limits for shaping were 15 s (one session), 10 s (two sessions), and 5 s (one to three sessions). One day after the end of shaping, tetrodes were chronically implanted with the surgical procedure described above. Trials in the 2.5- to 5-s waiting time task were classified as premature (if animals entered the nose-poke before the lower limit of 2.5 waiting), timely (if they entered the nose-poke between 2.5 and 5 s of waiting) and late (when they entered the nose-poke after 5 s of waiting). Premature and late trials were not rewarded and timely trials were rewarded with a probability of 0.5 (and reported to the animal with the visual cue).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Accelerometer recordings</title><p>Accelerometer data were obtained from two adult and two adolescent rats.

This acceleration signal was segmented into 10-sample windows without overlapping for the adolescent data and into 10-sample windows with 80% overlapping for the adult data (in both cases the time resolution was of 80 ms). The standard deviation for all data points in each window was calculated. Windows with SD &lt;3.5 were considered as a no-movement window. We limited the analysis to movement initiation times detected up to 1.2 s before port entry. In addition, only trials with a waiting time below 5 s were considered in order to include trials where animals are clearly engaged in the task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology</title><p>Animals were given a lethal dose of ketamine–xilazine and transcardially perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing heparin (500 U/l) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.

All data are presented as normalized firing rate except for PETH of single neurons reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Only for display purposes, PETHs were smoothed using a 5-points moving window. A neuron was classified as responsive to a given task event if its average firing rate during the time window of interest (−640 to −80 ms before port entry, −240 to +320 ms around port exit, −200 to +200 ms around a lick) was above 1 SD of its mean firing rate. A 2 SD threshold and a time window between +160 to +400 ms relative to port entry was used to define visual cue responding cells. A neuron was considered to be active during the execution of the lick sequence (inside port cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) if its average firing rate between 400 and 1520 ms after port entry was above 1 SD of its mean firing rate during the 40-s time window centered at port entry. Neurons whose activity during the whole waiting time period, irrespective of its duration, was above 1 SD of their mean firing rate during the 40-s time window, were considered tonically active during the waiting period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To be classified as outcome responding a neuron should met the following criteria: (1) their average firing rate between +160 to +560 ms after the eighth lick should be above 0.5 SD of their average firing rate between −640 to −160 ms prior to the eighth lick; (2) their average firing rate between +160 and +560 ms after the eighth lick should be above 2 SD of their mean activity during the 40-s time window. We further divided these neurons into three groups: (1) reward-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), (2) no-reward-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>); (3) expected no-reward-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), if their activity in either no rewarded condition differed from activity in rewarded trials by &gt;1.5 SD between +160 and +560 ms after the eighth lick.</p><p>To analyze the activity of port entry-responsive neurons at different waiting times (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref>), PETHs were constructed using a similar number of trials for each waiting time interval, which required using waiting intervals of different duration because trial initiations were more frequent at waiting times close to the criterion wait time. Trials with waiting time shorter than 450 ms were not included in the analysis. The intervals used were (beginning, end; in ms): [451,1915; 1916,2499; 2500,3131; 3132,3803; 3804,4999; 5000,6084; 6085,8421; 8422,12621; 12622,22013; 22014,1710755].

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Naoshige Uchida (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In general, there were concerns that while a technically impressive effort was undertaken, the data in adult subjects did not offer a significantly novel advance to the field. The adolescent data offers such potential, but was too premature with reviewers expressing concerns about technical issues and sample size.

All panels from Figure 7 and Figure 7- supplements 1-3 now include the data from 5 adolescent animals instead of 3. The number of neurons analyzed in the adolescent group passed from 552 to 876. The inclusion of these new data allowed us to perform new statistical comparisons. We adjusted a logistic function to accumulated trial initiation timing data (Figure 7N) and found that the rate of accumulation is higher in adolescent rats. Importantly, this is observed not only in the part of the curve corresponding to premature responding but also during timely responding, indicating that adolescent rats' premature responding is a manifestation of a more general behavioral trait that makes them self-initiate trials faster than adults (Figure 7N). The noisy trace of curves showing the amplitude modulation of anticipatory activity as a function of waiting time was partly due to the relatively low number of premature trials that demanded using relatively long time bins. With more data available we have been able to replot these curves using a smaller bin size for the short waiting times (Figure 7M). We have adjusted a logistic function to these data and observed a higher rate of increase of this activity modulation in adolescent rats, paralleling the behavioral data. Moreover, we report a significant correlation between the behavioral and neurophysiological data (a steeper rate of trial initiation times curve correlates with a steeper wait modulation of anticipatory activity, Figure 7O).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The firing rate plot shown in Figure 4D should be replotted by aligning trials by movement initiation (presumably available from accelometer or video recording). Is it possible that the activity rise similarly between trials types but the activity is cut off depending on when the animal enters the port at different latency from the movement initiation? In any case, the port entry is a little indirect measure of &quot;trial initiation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we have not systematically obtained video recordings of the sessions and only have accelerometer recordings of a few of the animals that provided the neuronal data, which precludes replotting the data as suggested. Accelerometer recordings are available from two adult and two adolescent rats. Latency from movement initiation to port entry does not differ between premature and timely trials at both ages. This is now reported in the results section. These results appear to be at odds with the idea that decreased neuronal activity in premature trials is the result of a cut-off of the response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding the recording locations: if more than the DMS is recorded, the authors should revise the manuscript to reflect that and revise the citations with respect to interpreting the results as DMS-related.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our recordings are spread along the medial and central regions of the dorsal striatum. Although we are not sure that there is a consensus regarding the limits of the DMS and DLS, we believe that none of our recordings are clearly located within the DLS. Following your suggestion, we have modified the text and refer to the location of our recordings as “dorsal striatum”. We believe that, as there is a lot of work on the roles of the DLS and DMS in reward learning, it is still important to refer to this work in the Introduction section and to discuss our findings in its context, particularly, since we find that most task-related activity is concentrated at the beginning and end of the task as shown in several studies focused in the DLS. Nevertheless, we removed the supplementary figures comparing our more medial and lateral recordings to avoid a misinterpretation of recording locations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Regarding the Ns of subjects: larger numbers of animals are needed in order to compare behavior across groups and ages.</p></disp-quote><p>Two adolescent animals provided new behavioral and electrophysiological data, and one additional adolescent rat with implanted electrodes provided behavioral data but no useful neuronal recordings. New behavioral data from non-implanted 6 adult and 6 adolescent rats confirming the results obtained with the implanted animals are presented in Figure 7 – supplement 3. The number of animals used in each experiment and contributing to each figure is now reported in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors should use clearer and shorter sentences; they should define each phrase more clearly (i.e., be redundant in explaining what phrases like &quot;timely&quot; mean). There could be a table showing exactly which groups exist, exactly which task epochs are analyzed, and how each of the shorthand terms used throughout the manuscript relate to these groups and the analysis epochs.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript was thoroughly revised and Table 1 summarizes the requested information. In addition, we included information in each figure legend to clarify from which animal groups and tasks the data come.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors should make it clearer for each Results section exactly which of the groups (listed in the public review) are included in analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the previous point, we now include Table 1 summarizing which group is used in each analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) I understand rats learn to execute sequences of &lt;8licks or 8 licks, although diagrams are presented, no examples of the individual trials with 8 licks, neither distributions of bouts of these licks are presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Rats learn to execute a lick sequence to obtain the reward. The experiments do not allow us to establish if they know what the exact number of licks needed is; when the skill is acquired, licking becomes highly stereotyped and the rats might as well be learning a time after which continuous licking leads to reward. A representative raster plot showing lick sequences in a session in a trained adult rat is presented in Figure 1I and Figure 7 – Supplement 1H shows an example of the licks of an adolescent rat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Relevant to the statement: &quot;in this task, the firing rate modulation preceding trial initiation discriminates between premature and timely trials and does not predict the speed, regularity, structure, value or vigor of the subsequently released action sequence&quot;… It is not clear if the latency to first lick (plot 2D) and the inter-lick interval (2E) is only from the 8Lick sequences or not. If that is not the case, it is important to compare only the ones with 8Licks.</p></disp-quote><p>The data are from 8 lick sequences, this is now indicated in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Related to the implications of the previous statement, there seems to be a tendency for longer latency to first lick in timely vs premature trials in Figure 2D (timely-trials-Late vs premature-trials-late)? Again here it is important to compare the 8licks sequences only.</p></disp-quote><p>Only 8-lick sequences are compared and the two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of the training stage without significant effects of trial type and a non-significant interaction. The average ± SEM latencies to the first lick (of the eighth lick sequence) were 0.717 s ± 0.063 for timely trials late and 0.805 s ± 0.086 for premature trials late.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) I could not find in the main text whether the individual points in Figure 2 (e.g. 2B-E) are individual animals. Please specify that.</p></disp-quote><p>Every individual point corresponds to the mean of a session, the data correspond to 5 adult animals (2-5 sessions per animal and timing condition). Whether the data correspond to animals or sessions is now clarified in all figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Although very elegant the argument presented in Figure 4C and 6C, I wonder if the head acceleration may lose differences in movements outside the head in the two kinds of trials. If that is the case please acknowledge it.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge in the main text, Results section, that the accelerometer does not allow us to determine if the movements of other body parts differ between trial types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Also in 4C, small separations between timely vs premature signals are seen before 0. Is there a way to know if animals in timely vs premature trials approached the entry port in the same way? This request is pertinent in order to rule out motor contribution to the differences in Figure 4A-B.</p></disp-quote><p>Although it is not possible to completely rule out small movement differences between premature and timely trials, no evident behavioral differences can be detected by trained observers or by analyzing video recordings taken during some sessions. The available accelerometer recordings also suggest that a similar motor pattern is displayed in premature and timely trials (Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) When saying: &quot;Similar results were obtained in rats trained with a longer waiting interval (Supplementary Figure 5)&quot;, &quot;is hard to see the similarity in the premature range, while in the 2.5 seconds task there is a positive relationship in the 5 seconds task it is not.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that a positive relationship is observed for the two bins preceding trial initiation, which are about 2.75s and 1s before port entry. The bin that seems to not fit is centered 4s before port entry (1s after exiting the port in the previous trial). Because of the longer waiting time behavior becomes less organized during the first seconds after port exit in the 5s task, however, the modulation of activity is still observed in the bins that are close to port entry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) The data showing that the waiting modulation of reward anticipation grows at a faster rate in adolescent rats is clear, however, it is not clear how it could be related to the data showing that the adolescent rats were more impulsive.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the data do not provide a causal link with behavior. After adding two new adolescent rats we have been able to study in more detail the relationship between the waiting modulation of neuronal activity and the accumulation of trial initiations (depicted in figures 7M and 7N respectively) by adjusting logistic functions to the data. There is a striking parallel between the growth rate of both curves, and the curves of adolescent rats are significantly steeper than those of adult rats. Moreover, there is a significant correlation between the coefficients that mark the rate of growth of the behavioral and neurophysiological data (Figure 7O).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) Related to the sentence: &quot;the strength of anticipatory activity increased with the time waited before response release and was higher in the more impulsive adolescent rats&quot;….One may expect to see a difference in the range of the premature time however the differences were observed in the range &gt;2.5 seconds. Please explain how to reconcile this finding with the fact that the adolescent rats were more impulsive.</p></disp-quote><p>Please, note that the more impulsive behavior of adolescent rats (and the faster growth of the wait modulation of anticipatory activity) is observed along waiting times that exceed the 2.5s criterion wait time; we added a phrase in the Results section and in the Discussion section to emphasize this point. Regarding the premature trials, we have used smaller bins to better discriminate what happens at short waiting times and included an inset in Figure 7M that allows us to better appreciate these intervals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Please ensure your manuscript complies with the eLife policies for statistical reporting: https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full &quot;Report exact p-values wherever possible alongside the summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals.
