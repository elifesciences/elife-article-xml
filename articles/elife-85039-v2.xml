Here, we show that RXRα ligands activate Nurr1-RXRα through a mechanism that involves ligand-binding domain (LBD) heterodimer protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibition, a paradigm distinct from classical pharmacological mechanisms of ligand-dependent nuclear receptor modulation. NMR spectroscopy, PPI, and cellular transcription assays show that Nurr1-RXRα transcriptional activation by RXRα ligands is not correlated with classical RXRα agonism but instead correlated with weakening Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimer affinity and heterodimer dissociation. Our data inform a model by which pharmacologically distinct RXRα ligands (RXRα homodimer agonists and Nurr1-RXRα heterodimer selective agonists that function as RXRα homodimer antagonists) operate as allosteric PPI inhibitors that release a transcriptionally active Nurr1 monomer from a repressive Nurr1-RXRα heterodimeric complex.

Nurr1 is critical in the development of dopaminergic neurons that are critical for control of movement that degenerates in Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decressac et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zetterström et al., 1997</xref>). Recent studies show that Nurr1 is an important factor in the regulation of neuroinflammation and accumulation of amyloid beta that occurs in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moon et al., 2019</xref>). These and other studies implicate small molecule activation of Nurr1 as a potential therapeutic strategy in aging-associated neurodegenerative and dementia disorders characterized by a loss of neuron function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moutinho et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although NRs are considered to be ligand-dependent transcription factors, targeting Nurr1 activity with small molecule compounds has remained challenging. Nurr1 contains the conserved NR domain architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weikum et al., 2018</xref>) including an N-terminal activation function-1 (AF-1) domain, a central DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). The classical model of ligand-induced NR transcriptional activation occurs via ligand binding to an orthosteric pocket located in the internal core of the LBD, which stabilizes the activation function-2 (AF-2 surface) in an active conformation resulting in high affinity coactivation interaction to the NR and recruitment of coactivator complexes resulting in chromatin remodeling and increased gene expression. However, crystal structures have revealed properties of Nurr1 LBD that suggest it may function in an atypical ligand-independent manner. The structures show no classical orthosteric ligand-binding pocket volume as well as a reversed ‘charge clamp’ AF-2 surface that prevents the LBD from interacting with typical NR transcriptional coregulator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). However, solution-state structural studies indicate the Nurr1 LBD is dynamic and can likely expand to bind endogenous ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vera et al., 2019</xref>). Although endogenous and synthetic ligands have been reported to bind and/or regulate Nurr1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruning et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Vera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rajan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Willems and Merk, 2022</xref>), some reported Nurr1 ligands function independent of binding to its LBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Munoz-Tello et al., 2020</xref>). These and other observations have directed efforts to discover small molecule modulators of Nurr1 activity through other mechanisms.</p><p>An alternative way to modulate Nurr1 transcription activity is through ligands that target its NR heterodimer-binding partner, retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα; NR2B1). Heterodimerizaton with RXRα represses Nurr1 transcription on monomeric DNA response elements called NBREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarnisalo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forman et al., 1995</xref>) that are present in the promoter regions of genes that regulate dopaminergic signaling including tyrosine hydroxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iwawaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). The observation that classical pharmacological RXRα agonists enhance Nurr1-RXRα transcription on NBREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarnisalo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perlmann and Jansson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wallen-Mackenzie et al., 2003</xref>) inspired the discovery of RXRα-binding ligands that display biased activation of Nurr1-RXRα heterodimers over other NR-RXRα heterodimers or RXRα homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scheepstra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spathis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sundén et al., 2016</xref>). However, it remains poorly understood how classical RXRα ligands (pharmacological agonists and antagonists) and Nurr1-RXRα selective agonists impact the structure and function of Nurr1-RXRα.</p><p>Here, we tested a set of RXRα ligands in structure-function assays to determine their mechanism of action in regulating Nurr1-RXRα transcriptional activity. Unexpectedly, our studies show that ligand activation of Nurr1-RXRα transcription is not associated with classical pharmacological RXRα agonism, which is defined by a ligand-induced increase in coactivator binding to the RXRα LBD resulting in transcriptional activation. Instead, our data support a model whereby Nurr1-RXRα activating ligands weaken Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimer affinity via an allosteric protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibition mechanism and release a transcriptionally active Nurr1 monomer from the repressive Nurr1-RXRα heterodimer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RXRα LBD is sufficient for repression of Nurr1 transcription</title><p>To confirm the published observation that RXRα represses Nurr1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarnisalo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forman et al., 1995</xref>), we performed a transcriptional reporter assay where SK-N-BE(2) neuronal cells were transfected with a full-length Nurr1 expression plasmid, with or without full-length or domain-truncation RXRα expression plasmids, along with a 3xNBRE-luciferase plasmid containing three copies of the monomeric NBRE DNA-binding response element sequence upstream of luciferase gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Cotransfected RXRα expression plasmid repressed Nurr1 transcription, and RXRα truncation constructs show that the RXRα LBD is both necessary and sufficient for repression of Nurr1 transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). A slight decrease in Nurr1 transcription is observed with the ΔLBD construct though the effect is not statistically significant. These findings implicate an LBD-driven PPI mechanism with a negligible or minor role for the RXRα DBD, which is consistent with published studies that showed full-length RXRα does not bind to monomeric NBRE sequences via the RXRα DBD, but does interact with Nurr1 that is bound to NBRE DNA sequences via a PPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sacchetti et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, RXR ligands can activate transcription of a Gal4 DBD-Nurr1 LBD fusion protein, but not a Gal4 DBD-Nurr1 LBD mutant (Nurr1<sup>dim</sup>) that cannot heterodimerize with RXRα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarnisalo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wallen-Mackenzie et al., 2003</xref>), which further implicates the RXRα LBD in repression of Nurr1 LBD-mediated transcription.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Contribution of retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) domains on repressing Nurr1 transcription.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) General scheme of the cellular transcriptional reporter assay.

In contrast, a strong correlation is observed between RXRα LBD TR-FRET data and full-length RXRα transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>) where ligands that increase PGC-1α coactivator peptide interaction to the RXRα LBD activate transcription of full-length RXRα in cells, similar to what we observed for PPARγ agonists with graded agonist transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The two selective Nurr1-RXRα activating compounds, BRF110 and HX600, function as a pharmacological antagonist and weak/partial graded agonist in the RXRα homodimer TR-FRET and transcriptional reporter assay, respectively. These findings suggest that the mechanism by which the RXRα ligand set influences Nurr1-RXRα transcription may occur independent of coregulator recruitment to the RXRα LBD and RXRα-mediated transcription—indicating that ligand-dependent RXRα homodimer modulation and Nurr1-RXRα heterodimer modulation may function through distinct mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Nurr1-RXRα activation is correlated with weakening LBD heterodimer affinity</title><p>Although ligand binding to NRs typically influences coregulator interaction to the AF-2 surface in the LBD, studies have reported that ligand binding can also weaken or strengthen NR LBD homodimerization and heterodimerization and confer selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kilu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Powell and Xu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rehó et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tamrazi et al., 2002</xref>). To determine how the RXRα ligand set influences Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimerization affinity, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies where we titrated Nurr1 LBD into apo/ligand-free or ligand-bound RXRα LBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and fitted the data to a homodimer competition model that incorporates apo-RXRα LBD homodimerization affinity (see Materials and methods) and dissociation of RXRα LBD homodimers to obtain Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimerization affinity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). One limitation of this ITC data analysis is the assumption that the RXRα LBD homodimer affinity is the same for apo RXRα LBD and the various ligand-bound states. Determining ligand-bound RXRα LBD homodimer K<sub>D</sub> values using ITC via the dimer dissociation dilution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McPhail and Cooper, 1997</xref>) would likely be confounded by ligand dissociation. It is also possible that RXRα ligands could change RXRα LBD homodimer affinity, or potentially change the RXRα LBD dimer equilibrium toward a tetrameric form where the Nurr1 LBD ITC titration could include a component that dissociates a ligand-bound RXRα LBD homotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gampe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2011a</xref>).

Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimer dissociation, we analyzed the thermodynamic parameters from the fitted ITC data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The change in binding enthalpy (ΔH) upon heterodimerization generally shows an endothermic (positive) profile for all conditions, whereas the change in entropy (TΔS) component shows a favorable (positive) profile for all conditions. Correlation analysis reveals a more significant correlation between the Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimerization binding affinity and the ΔH binding component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) compared to the ΔS binding component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).

Addition of compounds that activate Nurr1-RXRα transcription and weaken Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimer affinity result in the appearance of two Thr411 NMR peaks with chemical shift values corresponding to the heterodimer and Nurr1 monomer populations. In contrast, compounds that display little to no effect on Nurr1-RXRα transcription and do not significantly alter Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimer affinity show either a single NMR peak corresponding to the heterodimer population or a lower Nurr1 monomer population on average.

Simulated 1D spectra of the <sup>1</sup>H<sub>N</sub> dimension of the Thr411 NMR peaks were calculated using a binding model that accounts for an RXRα LBD homodimer component that dissociates into monomers that are capable of binding Nurr1 LBD (see Materials and methods for details). The simulations show that weakening Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimerization affinity, for example upon binding an RXRα ligand, shifts the equilibrium from the Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimeric (<italic>hd</italic>) population to Nurr1 LBD monomer (<italic>m</italic>) population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), consistent with our experimentally collected 2D NMR data.</p><p>We calculated the relative population of monomeric Nurr1 LBD dissociated from the Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimer by measuring the peak intensity of the monomeric (<italic>m</italic>) and heterodimer (<italic>hd</italic>) 2D NMR peaks for Thr411 from two replicate measurements using different batches of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). One limitation of this NMR analysis is that the monomeric and heterodimeric NMR peak intensities may over- or underestimate the relative population sizes given that NMR peak lineshapes of the individual monomeric and heterodimer states (molecular sizes effects), and the rate of chemical exchange between these states, can also affect peak lineshapes as well as binding kinetics and affinity. Despite this limitation, a significant correlation is observed between NMR-observed Nurr1 LBD monomeric populations and Nurr1-RXRα transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>) and ITC-determined Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimerization affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), indicating a role for dissociation of monomeric Nurr1 LBD from Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimer in the mechanism of action of the RXRα ligand set. Notably, one of the replicate NMR measurements shows a more significant correlation to Nurr1-RXRα transcription, which may have at least two origins: errors in concentration between two different batches of protein used in the replicate measurements, and two ligands were not included in one of the replicate measurements—excluding these ligands from the analysis of replicate #2 measurements improves the correlation with r<sub>p</sub> = 0.77 (p=0.0021) and r<sub>s</sub> = 0.75 (p=0.0042).</p><p>To corroborate our ligand-dependent heterodimer dissociation findings, we performed size exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments to determine how the compounds influence the oligomeric state of the Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The Nurr1-RXRα selective agonist, BRF110, shows the largest effect in dissociating a Nurr1 LBD monomer species in the SEC and NMR studies and is overall the most efficacious compound in activating Nurr1-RXRα transcription. The other Nurr1-RXRα selective compound, HX600, and the classical RXRα agonists dissociate a Nurr1 LBD monomer species although to a lower degree compared to BRF110. Most pharmacological RXRα antagonists we studied do not dissociate a Nurr1 LBD monomer species except for UVI3003, which displays a unique SEC profile that includes a monomeric Nurr1 LBD species and at least two species with a larger hydrodynamic radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). One higher order species is consistent with the SEC profile of an RXRα LBD homodimer or Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimer, and another with a larger hydrodynamic radius that is more compact than RXRα homotetramer, suggesting it may be a UVI3003-bound RXRα LBD dimer population. Notably, our structure-function profiling data indicate UVI3003 functions similar to the Nurr1-RXRα selective ligands (BRF110 and HX600) in that it activates Nurr1-RXRα transcription while antagonizing RXRα homodimers.</p><p>The SEC data provide insight into the potential allosteric mechanism(s) by which compounds in the RXRα ligand set influence Nurr1-RXRα heterodimerzation and transcription via effects on RXRα LBD. In the absence of ligand, RXRα exists as a mixture of homodimers and homotetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kersten et al., 1995a</xref>), which can be stabilized as dimers upon agonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kersten et al., 1995b</xref>) or tetramers upon antagonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2011b</xref>). In our SEC data, the most efficacious compounds not only free a Nurr1 LBD monomeric population, but also increase a higher order species with an elution volume consistent with a RXRα LBD homotetramer population. SDS-PAGE analysis confirms this observation and reveals that the higher order species observed when BRF110 is added to Nurr1-RXRα LBD heterodimers contains RXRα LBD only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, these compounds change the appearance of species in the SEC data with elution properties similar to Nurr1-RXRα heterodimer and RXRα homodimers, suggesting that they may change the homodimer/heterodimer complex conformation and/or species equilibrium. Thus, the allosteric mechanism may involve ligand-induced stabilization of RXRα oligomeric species that inhibit or are less favorable for Nurr1 heterodimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PCA reveals data features associated with Nurr1-RXRα agonism</title><p>Finally, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) using all the experimental data collected as input to determine the data features most associated with transcriptional activation of the 3xNBRE-luciferase reporter by Nurr1-RXRα in an unbiased manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Two of the ligands, danthron and rhein, were not included in the analysis because we did not have RXRα LBD TR-FRET and RXRα homodimer transcriptional reporter data (vide infra).

Several features are notable in the plot of the PCA scores and loadings, the latter of which represent correlation between the experimental data and PCs. The ligands cluster in groups consistent with their known pharmacological phenotypes. The loadings show that Nurr1-RXRα transcription, ITC-determined Nurr1-RXRα heterodimer affinity, and NMR-determined Nurr1 monomeric populations are clustered together and clustered along with the Nurr1-RXRα selective ligands, meaning these features of the data are positively correlated with ligand-dependent Nurr1-RXRα heterodimer dissociation. In contrast, RXRα LBD TR-FRET coactivator interaction and RXRα LBD homodimer transcription is positively correlated with classical RXRα agonists, whereas RXRα antagonists are found opposite to this loading trajectory. Furthermore, the loading projections show that the features of classical RXRα agonism and selective Nurr1-RXRα agonism are uncorrelated since the loadings trajectories associated with these features, and their associated ligand clusters, form a perpendicular (~90°) angle.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Principal component analysis (PCA) of experimental data reveals Nurr1-retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) agonism and classical RXRα agonism are uncorrelated.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 2D biplot containing the loadings and PC scores of the first two PCs.

Nurr1-RXRα heterodimer activation via RXRα-binding ligands has emerged as a promising modality to develop neuroprotective therapeutic agents or adjuvants to other therapies. Several RXRα ligands that increase Nurr1-RXRα activation have progressed to clinical trials of PD and AD including bexarotene and IRX4204 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McFarland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).

Our studies demonstrate that Nurr1-RXRα activation occurs through an LBD PPI inhibition heterodimer dissociation mechanism that is distinct from the classical pharmacological properties of NRs ligands. This activation mechanism explains why pharmacological RXRα agonists (e.g. bexarotene and IRX4204) and Nurr1-RXRα selective compounds that function as pharmacological RXRα antagonists (e.g. BRF110 and HX600) both activate Nurr1-RXRα transcription. Although the LBD heterodimer dissociation mechanism is atypical, several studies have reported that pharmacological NR ligands can influence dimer formation in addition to their classical pharmacological properties in regulating coregulator protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kilu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Powell and Xu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rehó et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tamrazi et al., 2002</xref>).

nuclear receptor that may be a significant target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Nurr1 functions as a monomer, but may also heterodimerize with RXRα which represses Nurr1 transcriptional activation. The authors provide compelling evidence for Nurr1 activation through ligand-induced dissociation of an inactive Nurr1-RXRα heterodimer. These data will be important for biochemists and cell biologists working on regulatory / activation mechanisms of nuclear hormone receptors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85039.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Dötsch</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04cvxnb49</institution-id><institution>Goethe University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Fanning</surname><given-names>Sean W</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04b6x2g63</institution-id><institution>Loyola University Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.08.515219">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.08.515219v4">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sean W Fanning (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The RXRɑ antagonist HX531 has little to no effect on Nurr1-RXRɑ reporter activity like the other RXRɑ antagonists Rhein and Danthron (Figure 3b) but appears to selectively induce a &gt;5-fold enhancement in the apparent affinity of LBD heterodimerization (Figure 5b) that seems inconsistent with the proposed model. The authors address a potential caveat with their analysis of the ITC data on lines 68-77 of page 4 but don't comment on any specific ligands or data. As a result, the correlation analyses presented in Figure 5c-d, although largely compelling, may be oversimplified. This is also true in Figure 6, where the correlation between reporter activity and Nurr1 monomerization assessed by NMR (Figure 6c) is much weaker than that with the ITC data (Figure 6e). Can the authors comment on the overall rigor and suitability of this simple correlative approach to justify these apparent discrepancies?</p><p>2) Related: In the correlation studies the authors include danthron and rhein as compounds in the Nurr1/RXR assay but not in the RXR PPI and RXR CTF assay. It is not clear if they are included in the correlation graphs in Figure 4 either; however, if they are excluded there should be a reason indicated. How do these compounds behave in the other assays?</p><p>3) Can the authors clarify how many independent times ITC data were collected for each ligand? The legend for Figure 5 states n = 1, but the methods state that at least two independent experiments were done. If so, the KD values in Figures 5 and 6 should reflect all of the data unless this is justified explicitly.</p><p>4) Related: Asterisks are used to indicate significance but the p-values assigned to them are not discussed in the figure legends nor in the methods. Also, in Figure 5b, error bars are not shown for the Kd values, and significance isn't shown between treatments. Adding in this statistical analysis would help judge whether dimerization differences are meaningful between ligands.</p><p>5) Since ITC is being used, information on changes to the heats, Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy should be available. Some discussion on whether changes to the observed binding affinities are ethically or entropically driven would be of interest to the biothermodynamics community.</p><p>6) Is there a way to estimate the error of measuring Nurr1 monomer populations by NMR in Figure 6a, b, c, and e? This could also be useful in making correlations in Figure 6.</p><p>7) Response at 1 μM was shown but no dose-response studies were performed to show differences in potency. These could be potentially correlated with the later studies to see if there's a relationship between transcriptional activities and dimerization affinity. Are such dose-response curves available?</p><p>8) Binding studies were only done for RXRalpha and the coregulator peptide. It would have been interesting to learn if the coregulator peptide binds the RXR-Nurr1 heterodimer. Comments?</p><p>9) HX531 appears to significantly enhance heterodimerization, is there any speculation as to why this is?</p><p>10) Should state in the cell culture section whether STR profiling was done to confirm cell line identity during the study, similar to mycoplasma testing.</p><p>11) In Figure 1, one of the key constructs (the δ LBD) shows high variability in its activity. Although it is not statistically different than the FL-Nurr1 control the variability that ranges from the FL-Nurr1 control to the FL-Nurr1/Fl-RARa group. Clearly, the LBD is playing a role, but my concern is that it might not be quite so clean. Is it possible that there is a contribution from the RXR DBD in this assay?</p><p>12) On page 4 line 43 the authors state,&quot;…the two selective Nurr1-RXRa activating compounds BRF110 and HX600 function as pharmacological RXRa antagonists in these assays – a clear example that pharmacological RXRa modulation of Nurr-1/RXRa modulation is distinct&quot;.

In our original submission, we used a linear correlation analysis by plotting two sets of experimentally determined data, fitting the data via linear regression, and reporting R<sup>2</sup> values as a description of correlation. However, since linear fits are not appropriate in cases where both variables are experimentally measured, in this revised manuscript we instead performed Pearson (r<sub>p</sub>) and Spearman (r<sub>s</sub>) correlation analyses and report the associated p-values that report on whether the correlation coefficients (r<sub>p</sub> or r<sub>s</sub>) are statistically significant (see grey boxes above plots). Furthermore, the new PCA analysis we added also enhances the rigor of this analysis by analyzing all of the experimental data together in an unbiased manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related: In the correlation studies the authors include danthron and rhein as compounds in the Nurr1/RXR assay but not in the RXR PPI and RXR CTF assay.

We ran the RXRα/3xDR1-luciferase cellular transcriptional reporter assay (Figure 4d) at the same time as the TR-FRET assay, and therefore we did not include danthron and rhein since no comparison to the TR-FRET data could be made.

It would have been interesting to learn if the coregulator peptide binds the RXR-Nurr1 heterodimer. Comments?</p></disp-quote><p>The Nurr1 LBD contains a reversed “charge clamp” in its AF-2 surface—a proper charge clamp is important for binding LXXLL-containing motifs present within transcriptional coactivator proteins—and as such Nurr1 does not interact with canonical nuclear receptor coregulator proteins. We updated the first paragraph of the Results section titled “<italic>Nurr1-RXRα activation is not correlated with pharmacological RXRα agonism</italic>” and included three references to introduce this concept.</p><p>If were to perform the TR-FRET coactivator peptide interaction assay to determine how RXRα ligands influence coactivator peptide interaction with Nurr1-RXRα, we anticipate the results would be confounded by several different mechanisms including ligand-dependent Nurr1-RXRα dissociation; ligand-dependent changes in coactivator peptide interaction with RXRα; and ligand-dependent changes in RXRα oligomerization as our size exclusion chromatography (SEC) data indicate ligands differentially affect the hydrodynamic solution properties of RXRα LBD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) HX531 appears to significantly enhance heterodimerization, is there any speculation as to why this is?</p></disp-quote><p>Our size exclusion chromatography (SEC) data (Figure 6—figure supplement 2) shows that HX531 decreases the hydrodynamic radius of the RXRα LBD (shifts the SEC peak to the right compared to apo-RXRα LBD), which could indicate HX531 changes the RXRα LBD monomer-dimer equilibrium towards a monomeric state (or more generally towards a homodimer conformation that is more compact). Because Nurr1 heterodimerization with RXRα competes for RXRα LBD homodimerization, ligands that favor a monomeric RXRα LBD state would result in higher affinity heterodimerization with Nurr1 LBD. This is an interesting point that we plan to investigate in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Should state in the cell culture section whether STR profiling was done to confirm cell line identity during the study, similar to mycoplasma testing.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated the methods cell culture section to state that cells were authenticated by ATCC and cultured at low passage number (less than 10 passages).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Figure 1, one of the key constructs (the δ LBD) shows high variability in its activity.
