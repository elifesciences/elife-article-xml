normally potentiates intracellular signaling by growth factors, antigen receptors, and some cytokines, yet is frequently mutated in human cancer. Here, we examine the role of SHP2 in the responses of breast cancer cells to EGF by monitoring phosphoproteome dynamics when SHP2 is allosterically inhibited by SHP099. The dynamics of phosphotyrosine abundance at more than 400 tyrosine residues reveal six distinct response signatures following SHP099 treatment and washout. Remarkably, in addition to newly identified substrate sites on proteins such as occludin, ARHGAP35, and PLCÎ³2, another class of sites shows reduced phosphotyrosine abundance upon SHP2 inhibition. Sites of decreased phospho-abundance are enriched on proteins with two nearby phosphotyrosine residues, which can be directly protected from dephosphorylation by the paired SH2 domains of SHP2 itself. These findings highlight the distinct roles of the scaffolding and catalytic activities of SHP2 in effecting a transmembrane signaling response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>PTPN11</kwd><kwd>epidermal growth factor receptor</kwd><kwd>phosphatase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vemulapalli</surname><given-names>Vidyasiri</given-names></name><name><surname>Gabriel</surname><given-names>Khal-Hentz</given-names></name><name><surname>LaRochelle</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name><name><surname>Stegmaier</surname><given-names>Kimberley</given-names></name><name><surname>Blacklow</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 CA220340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blacklow</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-HL127365</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chylek</surname><given-names>Lily A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sorger</surname><given-names>Peter K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF16CC0020906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfeiffer</surname><given-names>Anamarija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-CA225088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chylek</surname><given-names>Lily A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Monitoring SHP2 phosphoproteome dynamics identifies new substrate sites and sites protected from dephosphorylation by its SH2 domains, highlighting distinct scaffolding and catalytic activities in effecting a transmembrane signaling response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SHP2 is a non-receptor tyrosine phosphatase that is essential for mammalian development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saxton et al., 1997</xref>). In humans, germline mutations of <italic>PTPN11</italic> cause the developmental disorders Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tartaglia and Gelb, 2005</xref>). Somatic <italic>PTPN11</italic> activating mutations are also found frequently in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and, to a lesser extent, in solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentires-Alj et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that SHP2 acts as a positive effector of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Easton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tang et al., 1995</xref>). SHP2 facilitates the full induction of Ras-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) proteins following stimulation of cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or other receptor tyrosine kinase ligands. SHP2 also serves as a positive regulator of numerous other signaling systems, including cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu and Qu, 2008</xref>), programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yokosuka et al., 2012</xref>), and immune checkpoint pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavrieli et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The SHP2 protein consists of two SH2 domains (N-SH2, C-SH2), followed by a phosphatase (PTP) domain, with a natively disordered C-terminal tail that contains tyrosine residues known to become phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keegan and Cooper, 1996</xref>). X-ray structures of the SHP2 protein core, encompassing the two SH2 domains and the PTP domain, show that the wild-type protein normally adopts an autoinhibited conformation in which the N-SH2 domain occludes the active site of the PTP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hof et al., 1998</xref>). Activation of the enzyme requires disengagement of the N-SH2 domain from the PTP domain and subsequent recruitment of SHP2 to phosphotyrosine docking sites on substrate proteins. Recruitment can rely on the N-SH2 domain, C-SH2 domain, or both domains. Most oncogenic mutations of SHP2 lie at the interface between the N-SH2 and PTP domains, thereby increasing the propensity of the enzyme to adopt an open, active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LaRochelle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LaRochelle et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies in a range of cell types have identified phosphotyrosine (pY) residues on adaptor proteins (e.g. GAB1 and GAB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaud et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cunnick et al., 2001</xref>]) or on RTKs themselves (e.g. PDGFÎ²R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">RÃ¶nnstrand et al., 1999</xref>]) thought to recruit SHP2 to sites of active signaling following RTK activation (such sites include multiprotein complexes formed on RTK intracellular tails and IRS-1 adapters). Genetic and mutational studies have implicated specific pY residues on RTKs as putative SHP2 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agazie and Hayman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bunda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klinghoffer and Kazlauskas, 1995</xref>).</p><p>The availability of a potent and highly selective allosteric inhibitor of SHP2 now allows us to capture the whole proteome dynamics of the SHP2 dependence of the EGF response. Thus, we use here the allosteric inhibitor SHP099 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia Fortanet et al., 2016</xref>) to study the role of SHP2 on phosphoprotein dynamics at the whole proteome level following EGF stimulation of a breast cancer cell line carrying an EGFR amplification. Global analysis of time-resolved changes in pY abundance at over 400 tyrosine residues reveals several distinguishable response signatures following SHP099 exposure and washout. Putative substrate sites fall into two classes, with increased pYÂ abundance at early and/or late timepoints, respectively. Proteins in this category include previously unidentified substrate sites on proteins such as occludin, ARHGAP35, and PLCÎ³. Yet another class, which contains the largest number of dynamic pY sites, exhibits decreased pY abundance. These latter sites are enriched on proteins with two nearby pY residues, some of which are directly protected from dephosphorylation by the SH2 domains of SHP2. These data emphasize the two distinct and interrelated biochemical activities of SHP2 â dephosphorylation and phosphosite protection â and identify specific sites relevant to the activity of SHP099 and similar molecules such as TNO155 as therapeutic lead compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LaMarche et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic regulation of the EGF-responsive phosphoproteome by SHP2</title><p>We investigated the role of SHP2 in the responsiveness to EGF by using the EGFR-amplified cell line MDA-MB-468, derived from a patient with triple-negative breast cancer. To identify timepoints for in-depth proteomic analysis, we monitored the influence of SHP2 on the response to EGF stimulation using ERK1/2 phosphorylation as a readout. Cell extracts were prepared at a series of timepoints from three treatment conditions: (1) following pretreatment with dimethyl sulfoxideÂ (DMSO) and then stimulation with 10 nM EGF, (2) following pretreatment with the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 for 2 hr and then stimulation with EGF, and (3) following pretreatment with SHP099 and then stimulation with EGF for 10 min, after which drug was washed out and medium containing EGF replenished. Because the response of the EGF receptor to EGF stimulation occurs in the 1â2 min time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jadwin et al., 2016</xref>), we focused attention on the 5â30 min time window to ensure theÂ observation of SHP2-dependent events downstream of EGF receptor stimulation. Immunoblot analysis revealed the expected effect of EGF stimulation: a dramatic increase in phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) levels followed by a decline toward basal levels by 30 min. The induction of p-ERK1/2 was greatly attenuated by pretreatment of cells with 10 Î¼M SHP099. SHP099 washout in the continued presence of EGF (condition 3) revealed p-ERK1/2 induction with a kinetic profile similar to that of EGF stimulation in the absence of drug (condition 1), showing that SHP099 inhibition of SHP2 is rapidly reversible in MDA-MB-468 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phosphoproteomic studies in MDA-MB-468 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Western blot showing the phosphoERK1/2 abundance after EGF stimulation alone, EGF stimulation in the presence of SHP099, and EGF stimulation in the presence of SHP099, followed by drug washout 10 min after EGF stimulation.

Principal component analysis revealed a high degree of consistency between matched samples from the two biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), which yielded relative quantification for several hundred pY-containing peptides, with good concordance between biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>).

These were classified on the basis of both direction of change (increase or decrease) and timing. EGF dependencies were established based on responses to EGF addition in the absence of drug and were classified into five categories: fast, medium, or slow increases, neutral (no significant change), or decrease. The dependence of each phosphosite on SHP2 activity was established by assessing how phosphorylation levels were altered when SHP2 was inhibited: negative (more phosphorylation with inhibition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>, top two rows), positive (less phosphorylation with inhibition; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>, bottom two rows), or neutral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>, middle row). Positive and negative dependencies were further subdivided based on whether the change was present before EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>, first and fourth rows) or only after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>, second and fifth rows).</p><p>As anticipated, SHP2 inhibition resulted in increased abundance of pY marks at a number of sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>, top two rows), the expected effect of blocking a tyrosine phosphatase. Remarkably, however, we found an even larger family of pY sites that showed a decreased abundance when SHP2 is inhibited even at early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>, bottom two rows), indicating that SHP2 inhibition had direct and/or indirect activities other than direct dephosphorylation of substrates. Additionally, SHP2 exhibited EGFR-independent regulation of a number of pY sites: a subset of sites was regulated (either positively or negatively) by SHP2 prior to EGF addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>, first and fourth rows), showing that SHP2 had a role in shaping the basal signaling state of these cells. Motif analysis of phosphosites associated with different classes of SHP2 responsiveness did not reveal enrichment for specific motifs (residues flanking the modified tyrosine residue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). Remarkably, sites from different regulatory classes could even occur together in the same protein (see below), highlighting the importance of considering specific sites of phosphorylation when evaluating the impact of a phosphatase on a protein substrate.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering was performed to identify groups of pY sites with similar kinetics in DMSO, SHP099, and washout conditions. Among the six kinetic profiles that emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we highlight three clusters of sites implicated in EGFR signaling and that display distinct responses to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The first class of responses, which includes the regulatory subunits of PI3K, occludin, Syntaxin 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the adapter proteins CRK and GRB2, and ARHGAP35 (also known as p190RhoGAP), among other proteins, shows quantitatively increased tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of SHP099 that rapidly disappears upon drug washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as predicted for a SHP2 substrate. The second class of sites accumulates pY marks slowly under SHP099 inhibition (at 30 min after EGF treatment), and not when SHP099 is omitted or washed out. This pattern, observed for pYÂ sitesÂ on CBL E3 ligase, RAB10, hnRNPs, PLCÎ³ proteins, and CAPRIN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), also matches the response predicted for a SHP2 substrate, but with a time delay, suggesting that the action of SHP2 on these proteins might require an intervening event, such as relocalization (e.g. after endocytosis of active EGFR signaling complexes), or alternatively, that the effect is indirect. The large number of potential substrates identified in this work suggests that SHP2 may catalyze dephosphorylation of many different proteins on different time scales.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Quantitative phosphoproteomics reveals distinct dynamic responses to SHP2 inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap showing three classes of dynamic response in which inhibition of SHP2 modulates the effect of EGF stimulation on pY abundance.

Examples of sites that fall into this category include Y1100 of ARHGEF5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), Y659 of GAB1, Y643 of GAB2, as well as Y546 and Y584 of SHP2 itself.</p><p>Functional classification of EGF-responsive pY sites (by GSEA and Reactome) differentially regulated by SHP099 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>) reveals enrichment of six major cellular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). As expected, proteins implicated in MAPK and PI3K signaling, including EGFR and SHP2 itself, contain numerous EGF-responsive phosphosites differentially regulated by SHP099 treatment. The largest functional group includes proteins implicated in adhesion and migration, including tight junction proteins, catenins, Rho-GEF, and Rho-GAP proteins. These findings, along with data on the abundance of cytoskeletal proteins differentially affected by SHP099 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D</xref>), are consistent with earlier results, suggesting that SHP2 promotes migration in MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating EGF-induced lamellipodia persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hartman et al., 2013</xref>). Proteins implicated in transcription comprise another functional class with a number of differentially regulated phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). Two additional functional categories enriched in the analysis comprise endocytosis and mRNA processing, neither of which have previously been linked to SHP2 activity. Most of the sites in these two categories display a substrate-like response with SHP099 treatment. In addition, SHP099 also affected phosphorylation of CBL and CBLB, E3 ligases that ubiquitinate EGFR and facilitate its recruitment to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis. Together, these results highlight the diversity of influence of SHP2, both in the function of proteins that it affects and inÂ the manner in which it affects their phosphorylation patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of new substrates of SHP2</title><p>Among proteins that show a substrate-like pattern, only one of the phosphosites observed has previously been reported to be dephosphorylated by SHP2 (GRB2 pY209; ARHGAP35 has also been reported to be a substrate, but its pY site has not been reported) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bregeon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chardin et al., 1993</xref>).

Of these twenty proteins screened (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), three that were reliably immunoprecipiated at endogenous abundance showed phosphosite enrichment after EGF stimulation in the presence of SHP099 as judged by Western blot with an anti-pYÂ antibody. These three proteins are occludin, PLCÎ³2, and ARHGAGP35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâC</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of pY-modified proteins with an anti-pY antibody in EGF-stimulated cells treated with SHP099 likewise showed that PLCÎ³2, occludin, and GRB2 accumulate pY in the presence of SHP099, as judged by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Because it was not possible to immunoprecipitate ARHGAP35 with either the anti-pY antibody or an antibody that specifically reognizes the pY1105 phosphosite, we immunoblotted anti-ARHGAP35 immunoprecipitates with the anti-pY1105 antibody to confirm that accumulation of this specific mark occurs when SHP2 is inhibited by SHP099 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). In addition, enzyme assays using purified SHP2 and the pY-containing peptides that contain the SHP099-enriched phsophosites identified in the proteomic studies confirm that SHP2 can robustly remove the phosphate mark from pY209 of GRB2, pY443 of occludin, pY1105 of ARHGAP35, and pY818 of PLCÎ³2, whereas neither a control peptide containing pY708 from CSF-1R nor a Class III peptide from TMEM134 that shows a protection-type pattern are robust SHP2 substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

These cell lines were stimulated with EGF and probed for phospho-GAB1 and phospho-GAB2. As expected, SHP099 treatment significantly reduced the abundance of pY659 on GAB1, as well as that of pY643 on GAB2. GAB1 pY627, which has been reported to bind to the N-SH2 domain of SHP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cunnick et al., 2001</xref>), also showed reduced phosphorylation. Consistent with the results from U2OS cells, the SH2 fragment, but not the PTP fragment was active in increasing pY abundance at these positions of GAB1 and GAB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Indeed, the SH2 fragment stabilizes these GAB1 and GAB2 phospho marks even in the absence of EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), consistent with a dominant protective function that is independent of the catalytic activity of the enzyme. In addition, the SHP099-resistant variant of SHP2 (T253M/Q257L) rescues protection of the GAB1 and GAB2 pY sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), and point mutation of the key arginine residue of each SH2 domain (R32M of the N-SH2 domain or R138M of the C-SH2 domain) suppresses phosphosite protection of these sites, as does the R32M/R138M double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Together, these findings show that the catalytic activity of SHP2 is not required for the protection of the pY659 and pY643 marks on GAB1 and GAB2, respectively, and argue that the presence of tandem SH2 domains in SHP2 is needed to bind and protect pYs on GAB1 and GAB2 from phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effects of SHP099-resistance and pY binding-site mutations on pY abundance at protected sites on GAB1 and GAB2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating wild-type and SHP099-resistant forms of SHP2.

MPZL1 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) that, when doubly phosphorylated at Y241 and Y263, can bind the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao and Zhao, 2000</xref>). Our phosphoproteomic data show that basal pY abundance at these sites is greatly reduced by SHP099 treatment and that the dependence of pY modifications on SHP2 at these two sites occurs independent of EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Using immunoblot assays, we found that the tandem SH2 domains alone are also sufficient to protect the phosphate groups on Y241 and Y263 of MPZL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). It is also notable that the two pY sites on the SHP2 C-terminal tail exhibit a protection-type pattern in the presence of SHP099. Because the allosteric inhibitor locks SHP2 in the closed conformation, we speculate that the inhibitor interferes with membrane recruitment of SHP2 by preventing the SH2 domains from binding to pY residues deposited at membrane proximal sites by activated kinases and that removal of inhibitor permits membrane recruitment to sites of EGFR activation, phosphorylation of the SHP2 C-terminal tail, and subsequent GRB2 recruitment.</p><p>Multiple studies have reported that GAB1, GAB2, and MPZL1 can be phosphorylated by Src family kinases (SFKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kusano et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, MDA-MB-468 cells treated with an SFK inhibitor (saracatinib/AZD0530) showed greatly reduced modification of GAB1-Y659 and GAB2-Y643 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that SFK activity is required to phosphorylate the SHP2 binding sites on GAB1 and GAB2. SHP099, however, had no detectable effect on the abundance of pY at Y416 of the activation loop of SFKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), or on the abundance of pY at Y527, which maintains SFKs in their autoinhibitory conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roskoski, 2005</xref>). Although it is possible that SFK activity in the GAB complex is not reflected by assessment of bulk SFK activity in the whole-ell lysate, when combined with the phosphosite protection results from the studies with various forms of SHP2 above, these data suggest that SHP2 acts to increase the half-life of pYÂ modifications at sites on GAB1 and GAB2 that are phosphorylated by SFKs and then bound by SHP2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SHP2 is required for membrane localization of GAB1</title><p>To determine whether activation of SHP2 is required for recruitment of GAB1 to EGFR at the plasma membrane, we used a proximity ligation assay (PLA).

Under serum-starved (basal) conditions, the PLA signal was minimal and unaffected by SHP2 inhibition with SHP099. In contrast, within 2 min of EGF addition, cells treated with DMSO alone displayed a strong PLA signal indicative of GAB1 and EGFR co-localization, whereas SHP099 treatment reduced the number of binding events by 85% (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

We identified over 400 pY sites that exhibit increases or decreases in phosphorylation in response to SHP099 addition and washout. The dynamics of these changes in pY abundance reveal six distinct response signatures that provide a number of insights into how cancer cells depend on SHP2 in RTK signaling. Three of the six patterns identified by hierarchical clustering correspond to EGFR-dependent pYÂ abundance changes that are also modulated by SHP2. These patterns include an early SHP2 substrate-like pattern (early responders that increase in abundance upon SHP2 inhibition), a late SHP2 substrate-like pattern (late responders also increased upon SH2 inhibition), and a pattern in which pY levels are unexpectedly decreased when SHP2 is inhibited (protected sites).</p><p>Among proteins that exhibit a substrate-like pattern, occludin, ARHGAP35, and PLCÎ³2 were also confirmed to have specific pYs that are SHP2 substrate sites, opening up new avenues for future study of the downstream effects of SHP2 on cell migration and adhesion. A number of other early responder sites lie on proteins that transmit information from activated RTKs to Ras/MAPK and PI3K signaling cascades. For example, the pY209 mark on the adaptor protein Grb2, which inhibits Sos binding and downstream Ras activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chardin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2001</xref>), rapidly accumulates upon SHP2 inhibition, suggesting that one important role of SHP2 in these cells is to remove an inhibitory mark and promote Grb2-dependent proteinâprotein interactions that drive immediate early signaling. Similarly, the adapter Crk also has two early responder pY sites at positions 108 and 136 that accumulate upon SHP2 inhibition; their removal by SHP2 may promote the ability of Crk to propagate the EGFR signal. Likewise, the PI3K regulatory subunits PI3KR1 and PI3KR2 accumulate pY marks in their inter-SH2 (iSH2) domains at analogous positions between residues 452â470 that may suppress effector function when SHP2 is inhibited, and PI3KR3 also has a pY residue in its iSH2 domain that also shows a substrate-like response at later timepoints. Not surprisingly, SHP2 inhibition also affects the pY abundance on numerous proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration, as well as on cytoskeletal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Our data also reveal many proteins with SHP2-dependent changes in pY abundance that function in cellular processes previously unlinked to SHP2. These proteins include effectors of distal signaling responses such as phospholipase C enzymes (PLCÎ³1 and PLCÎ³2). Also noteworthy are the late-response, substrate-like patterns that predominate among proteins implicated in mRNA processing and endocytosis factors (hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPA3, EPN1/2, RAB10, FNBP1L, ITSN2, STX4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). Dissecting the role of SHP2 in these events should be a fertile area of future investigation.</p><p>Strikingly, the most frequent change in pY pattern following SHP2 inhibition is not substrate-like, but rather one in which pY levels fall. Others have also recently reported that binding of SHP2 can prevent dephosphorylation of certain pY sites in the response to stimulation of other RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batth et al., 2018</xref>). This pattern of response is seen at pY residues on proteins recruited to the EGFR signaling hub, such as GAB1, GAB2, as well as on EGFR and SHP2 itself. To better understand this mode of pY regulation, we studied SHP2-dependent protection of pY sites on GAB1 and GAB2, adapters that induce SHP2 binding and activation upon tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaud et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crouin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cunnick et al., 2001</xref>). Binding and mutagenesis studies clearly demonstrate that the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2 shield pY binding sites on GAB1 and GAB2 from dephosphorylation. Also intriguing is the SHP2-mediated protection of nearby pairs of pY residues on several proteins, including MPZL1-pY241/pY263, a fibronectin-activated adhesion protein that can assemble into complexes containing SHP2 and Grb2 in a pY-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beigbeder et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, decreased phosphoabundace is observed on multiple proteins harboring nearby tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>), all of which may experience protection of their pYÂ marks by the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2. The protection of pY sites by SHP2 highlights the scaffolding role of SHP2 in stimulating pY engagement by SH2 domains at sites of RTK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). SHP2 scaffolding activity is particularly relevant to Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes, both of which result from missense SHP2 mutations. Though distinct, the two syndromes have overlapping clinical features. Mutations found in Noonan syndrome destabilize the autoinhibited form of the enzyme without substantially affecting the intrinsic catalytic activity of the phosphatase domain, leading to increased basal phosphatase activity, elevated scaffolding activity, and downstream induction of ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niihori et al., 2005</xref>). LEOPARD syndrome mutations also destabilize the autoinhibited conformation of the enzyme, enhancing scaffolding activity, but in addition cripple the catalytic activity of the phosphatase domain. The increased preference for the open conformation in both Noonan and LEOPARD syndrome mutations promotes the protective âarmâ of SHP2 signaling, whereas only Noonan syndrome mutations retain the catalytic activity needed to drive the substrate-dependent features of signaling. The work reported here shows how central the scaffolding function is at the EGFR signaling hub and in the engagement of pY sites on GAB1 and GAB2 at the site of activation, with the phosphatase-dependent events, through adapter proteins like Grb2 and key signaling nodes like PI3K, required for full propagation of a growth factor induced signal to downstream effectors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model highlighting coordinated scaffolding and catalytic activities of SHP2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic model showing pY mark protection by stable engagement of a partner protein (e.g. GAB1) with the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2.

that contains two SH2 domains and is involved in Noonan's Syndrome and cancer. By creative use of knockouts, mutants, and a chemical inhibitor that locks SHP2 in a state where its SH2 domains are unavailable, the authors provide evidence for two classes of phosphoproteins, those that are SHP2 substrates and those that appear to be protected from other PTPs by the SHP2 SH2 domains. The results help explain how SHP2 has both positive and negative effects on signaling.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Time resolved phosphoproteomics reveals scaffolding and catalysis-responsive patterns of SHP2-dependent signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce J Mayer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the importance of the Shp2 tyrosine phosphatase in shaping the response of cells to EGF stimulation. The profile of EGF-induced phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-containing peptide sites was measured with and without SHP099, a Shp2 allosteric inhibitor. As expected, the abundance of a number of phosphopeptides was increased by inhibitor treatment, consistent with being Shp2 substrates. In contrast, the phosphorylation of a number of peptides, such as those on Gab1/2, was decreased upon Shp2 inhibition. The authors go on to present evidence that this is likely due to phosphosite protection by the Shp2 SH2 domains.</p><p>This is a technically outstanding piece of work that makes extensive use of quantitative mass spectrometry. The concepts of SH2 protection and of Shp2 scaffold function are not novel, and conclusions regarding potential new Shp2 substrates are over-interpreted, but the results will be of general interest to the field due to the importance of Shp2 in stimulating RTK-mediated MAPK and PI3K pathways. The implication of Shp2 in important and cancer-relevant signaling pathways increases potential impact. That said, the value of this study is more in developingig new testable hypotheses rather than in providing new insights into the actual signaling mechanisms. The review consensus is that paper would be acceptable with only minor experimental work and rewriting, but would be much more interesting with deeper investigation of the proposed new substrates or the scaffolding functions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Figure 4F: While we commend the authors for showing that Shp2 can dephosphorylate occludin, ARHGAP35 and PLCg2 peptides, additional work would be needed to conclusively demonstrate that these are indeed natural substrates. Does Shp2 interact with any of these proteins in cells and in cell-free systems? Does the enzymatic dead mutation affect the interaction? In the phosphatase enzymatic assay, it is nice to include CSF-1R substrate as a negative control. How about a type III peptide? Would the enzymatic dead mutant of SHP2 have any impact on phosphate release? What were the 20 candidate proteins initially screened? Were any of these 20 candidates established Shp2 substrates? Overall, the conclusions relating to potential Shp2 substrates are over interpreted. Adding more experimental information would be desirable, but, failing that, the authors should temper their conclusions.</p><p>2. As interesting as the SH2 phosphosite protection may be, the actual role of this phenomenon in Shp2 signaling is not really clarified. In other words, is protection merely a consequence of Shp2 recruitment, or does it have functional consequences beyond bringing the catalytic activity of Shp2 to membrane signaling complexes? The authors discuss potential scaffolding functions, but it is not clear what they mean-do they propose other signaling proteins are bound to other domains/sites of Shp2 that are critical for downstream signaling? The Shp2 mutants and knockout cell lines used here would be ideal to test a few simple ideas. For example, to what extent can the EK/CE (open/dead) mutant rescue EGF-dependent downstream signaling compared to the EK (open/active) mutant? Similarly, does the Shp2 SH2-only construct have any biological activity when compared to EK/CE? The impact of the manuscript would be much greater if some insight into the role of SH2 protection in Shp2 signaling were gained.</p><p>3. Regarding potential scaffold function: phosphorylation of Shp2 itself is increased when the Shp2 inhibitor is removed, falling into the same category as GAB Y659. Given the potential role of Shp2 phosphorylation in recruiting Grb2, the authors should discuss the possible scaffolding role of the Shp2 pY sites and their interpretation of why phosphorylation of those sites increases when Shp2 inhibitor is removed.</p><p>4. The EGF stimulation time course included only 5- 10- and 30-min time points. This misses a whole class of interesting/important phosphorylation events that occur very rapidly after EGF stimulation. While MAPK may take ~5 minutes to be fully activated, many pTyr sites are maximally phosphorylated within one or two minutes of EGF treatment, and in particular Shp2 SH2 binding sites have been reported to peak within a minute or two and then return close to baseline by 5 minutes (e.g. Jadwin et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2016;5:e11835). It is not realistic to expect the authors to repeat the MS experiments with earlier timepoints, but it would be relatively trivial to provide overall anti-pTyr blots for the timepoints used for MS (to gauge the extent of overall pTyr changes with and without EGF, Shp2 inhibitor in these cells), and more importantly to provide more detailed timecourses for selected &quot;SH2 protected&quot; substrates such as GAB1 or EGFR with and without Shp2 inhibition. In addition, for the MAPK analysis, the time course should be extended to 2-4 hrs to include the decay period. The experiments should be quantitated (pERK/ERK).</p><p>5. The interpretation that MPZL and the GAB sites were being reduced in their level of phosphorylation as a result of SH2 domain protection is misleading and in its present form still open to the possibility raised by the authors that this is a Src-mediated phenomenon. There was no change in overall Src activity assayed using the pY416 antibody in total cell lysates but relevant changes in Src activity may be restricted to the precise protein complex in which it is modulated. One would need to determine the status of Src activation not in a whole cell lysate but rather the status of Src pY416 in the GAB complex. This is a well-established behavior of the SFKs, in general. Similar experiments should be performed with PZR in complex with Src as similar mechanisms are likely operative where Src can phosphorylate PZR, which has been shown, thereby creating binding sites for SH2 domains of Shp2. Deletion of the SH2 domains of Shp2, which binds Src, would fail to recruit Src to PZR resulting in reduced phosphorylation. These possibilities are all arguable and not in of themselves as presented &quot;air-tight&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64251.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

For 13 proteins, antibody sensitivity was insufficient to determine whether they are SHP2 substrates. For four proteins, Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates did not show increased pY abundance upon SHP099 treatment. The three proteins that did show increased pY abundance in response to SHP099 were occludin, ARHGAP35, and PLCÎ³2. The text has been modified on page 9 to include this information.</p><p>The conclusion that occludin, ARHGAP35, and PLCÎ³2 are substrates for SHP2 include both immunoprecipitation data showing that they have an increased amount of pY in the presence of SHP099 and in vitro confirmation that a pY-containing peptide spanning the site identified by MS is active as a substrate for the purified enzyme (Figure 3F). In contrast and as expected, a purified catalytically inactive mutant form of the enzyme (C459A), does not dephosphorylate these substrate phosphopeptides (wt and mutant data are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Dephosphorylation activity of wild-type or C459A SHP2, activated with 6 Î¼M bisphosphorylated IRS-1 peptide [SLNY(p)IDLDLVKdPEG8-LSTY(p)ASINFQK], towards synthetic phosphopeptide substrates (OCLN_pY443, PLCG2_pY818, GRB2_pY209, ARHGAP35_1105, TMEM134_pY57, CSF-1R_pY708).</title><p>The C459A mutant is inactive in the dephosphorylation assay, as expected.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64251-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We did test whether SHP2 can be co-immunoprecipitated with occludin, ARHGAP35, or PLCÎ³2 in MDA-MB-468 cells, but did not see changes in bulk immunoprecipitation of any of these proteins with SHP2 after EGF stimulation. We note, however, that bulk recovery of a protein by co-IP is not a prerequisite for a bona-fide protein substrate.</p><p>Lastly, we are not certain what the reviewer meant by the term âType IIIâ peptide, but we interpreted the meaning as equivalent to what we defined in the manuscript as âClass IIIâ peptides. The ability of SHP2 to dephosphorylate pY57 of TMEM134, a âClass IIIâ peptide, is greatly reduced by comparison to the putative substrate peptides. These data are now included in the results reported in Figure 3F, and the text on pages 9-10 has been modified to include these new data. Lastly, as recommended, we have softened the concluding sentence of the paragraph to state that our results âsuggest,â rather than âsupport the conclusion,â that ARHGAP35, PLCÎ³2, and occludin are newly identified substrates for SHP2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

While it is beyond the scope of the current work to investigate the functional implications of this phenomenon in detail, there is some evidence that the scaffolding/protective activity of the SH2 domains has a functional effect from the results of experiments performed with the SH2 domain-only SHP2 fragment (Figure 5D). The data show accumulation of protected pY marks on both GAB and GAB2 even in the absence of EGF stimulation, consistent with a dominant effect of the tandem SH2 domain fragment that is independent of the catalytic domain of the enzyme. This observation is now noted on Page 11 of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Regarding potential scaffold function: phosphorylation of Shp2 itself is increased when the Shp2 inhibitor is removed, falling into the same category as GAB Y659.

Thus, the inhibitor interferes with membrane recruitment of SHP2 because its SH2 domains are not available to bind to pY residues deposited at membrane proximal sites by activated kinases. It is thus reasonable to postulate that removal of inhibitor permits membrane recruitment to sites of EGFR activation, phosphorylation of the SHP2 C-terminal tail, and subsequent GRB2 recruitment. We have added text discussing this issue to the manuscript on pages 12-13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The EGF stimulation time course included only 5- 10- and 30-min time points. This misses a whole class of interesting/important phosphorylation events that occur very rapidly after EGF stimulation. While MAPK may take ~5 minutes to be fully activated, many pTyr sites are maximally phosphorylated within one or two minutes of EGF treatment, and in particular Shp2 SH2 binding sites have been reported to peak within a minute or two and then return close to baseline by 5 minutes (e.g. Jadwin et al., eLife 2016;5:e11835). It is not realistic to expect the authors to repeat the MS experiments with earlier timepoints, but it would be relatively trivial to provide overall anti-pTyr blots for the timepoints used for MS (to gauge the extent of overall pTyr changes with and without EGF, Shp2 inhibitor in these cells), and more importantly to provide more detailed timecourses for selected &quot;SH2 protected&quot; substrates such as GAB1 or EGFR with and without Shp2 inhibition. In addition, for the MAPK analysis, the time course should be extended to 2-4 hrs to include the decay period. The experiments should be quantitated (pERK/ERK).</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewer (see both Jadwin et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2016;5:e11835 and Reddy et al., PNAS 2016;113:3114), we do appreciate that the kinetics of EGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation rapidly builds to a peak within a minute or two. Because the arrival of pY binding proteins at the membrane, such as GRB2 (and presumably other pY binders like SHP2; Jadwin et al., 2016), is delayed relative to the deposition of the pY mark, reaching a peak after ~5-10 min, we therefore chose 5, 10, and 30 minute timepoints for the mass spec measurements to maximize readout of the role of SHP2 downstream of EGF stimulation. This point is now noted on page 5 of the manuscript.</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we now include quantification of the data in Figure 1A (right panel). We also provide more extended timecourse data that includes earlier timepoints (2 min EGF) and additional timepoints through 4 hours in the absence and presence of SHP099 for ERK1/2 (T202/Y204 of ERK1, T185/Y187 of ERK2), GAB1 (pY627 and pY659), GAB2 (pY614 and pY643), and phospho-tyrosine (P-Tyr-1000, CST). The ERK1/2 and pTyr-1000 data are reported in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A, and the GAB1 and GAB2 are presented in Figure 4C (replacing the prior figure panel, which did not show timecourse data), along with changes in the text on page 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The interpretation that MPZL and the GAB sites were being reduced in their level of phosphorylation as a result of SH2 domain protection is misleading and in its present form still open to the possibility raised by the authors that this is a Src-mediated phenomenon. There was no change in overall Src activity assayed using the pY416 antibody in total cell lysates but relevant changes in Src activity may be restricted to the precise protein complex in which it is modulated. One would need to determine the status of Src activation not in a whole cell lysate but rather the status of Src pY416 in the GAB complex. This is a well-established behavior of the SFKs, in general. Similar experiments should be performed with PZR in complex with Src as similar mechanisms are likely operative where Src can phosphorylate PZR, which has been shown, thereby creating binding sites for SH2 domains of Shp2. Deletion of the SH2 domains of Shp2, which binds Src, would fail to recruit Src to PZR resulting in reduced phosphorylation. These possibilities are all arguable and not in of themselves as presented &quot;air-tight&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Point appreciated. It is certainly possible that the SFK activity in the GAB complex is not reflected by assessment of bulk SFK activity in the whole cell lysate. We have now noted this caveat in the manuscript on page 13, and tempered our conclusions as recommended by the reviewers. Further studies investigating the effect of SHP2 inhibition on SFK would lie beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
