In the placodes of the forming tubes of the salivary glands in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, we previously identified spatially defined cell behaviors of cell wedging, tilting, and cell intercalation that are key to the initial stages of tube formation. Here, we address what the requirements are that ensure the continuous formation of a narrow symmetrical tube from an initially asymmetrical primordium whilst overall tissue geometry is constantly changing. We are using live-imaging and quantitative methods to compare wild-type placodes and mutants that either show disrupted cell behaviors or an initial symmetrical placode organization, with both resulting in severe impairment of the invagination. We find that early transcriptional patterning of key morphogenetic transcription factors drives the selective activation of downstream morphogenetic modules, such as GPCR signaling that activates apical-medial actomyosin activity to drive cell wedging at the future asymmetrically placed invagination point. Over time, transcription of key factors expands across the rest of the placode and cells switch their behavior from predominantly intercalating to predominantly apically constricting as their position approaches the invagination pit. Misplacement or enlargement of the initial invagination pit leads to early problems in cell behaviors that eventually result in a defective organ shape. Our work illustrates that the dynamic patterning of the expression of transcription factors and downstream morphogenetic effectors ensures positionally fixed areas of cell behavior with regards to the invagination point. This patterning in combination with the asymmetric geometrical setup ensures functional organ formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organogenesis</kwd><kwd>tubulogenesis</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>morphometrics</kwd><kwd>apical constriction</kwd><kwd>intercalation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105178780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez-Corrales</surname><given-names>Yara E</given-names></name><name><surname>Röper</surname><given-names>Katja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>207553/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanchard</surname><given-names>Guy B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During the morphogenesis of the tubes of the salivary glands in the fly embryo, a correct regionalization of the flat epithelial primordium by upstream transcription factors is key to drive coordinated changes in cell behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complex three-dimensional organs arise from simple tissue primordia, and in many cases, these primordia are flat polarised epithelial sheets. Early in development the expression of the first patterning genes broadly sets up embryonic regions. This is followed by the activation of gene regulatory networks that specify the fate of tissue primordia in defined locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilmour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sidor and Röper, 2016</xref>). The patterning and fate determination gene products do not directly affect morphogenetic changes, but rather instruct the expression of downstream morphogenetic effectors that drive a tissue primordium down a path of defined physical changes. In many well-studied cases of tissue morphogenesis, such as mesoderm invagination or germband extension in the fly, many morphogenetic effectors are induced evenly across the tissue primordium. Regional differences in the physical changes or ‘behaviors’ of cells observed in these primordia can arise due to physical effects and feedback or interference either from cells within the primordium or from surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chanet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collinet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lye et al., 2015</xref>). A further layer of control and complexity is added as the primordia themselves can also be patterned to guide the differential behavior and changes of groups of cells within a primordium. Such pre-patterning of morphogenetic events within a single tissue primordium is much less understood.</p><p>We use the formation of a narrow-lumen tube in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo as a model system to identify key requirements for successful organ formation. The symmetrical tubes of the embryonic salivary glands form from a flat, nearly circular epithelial primordium, the salivary gland placode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We recently uncovered a patterning of key cell behaviors that drive the initiation and earliest stages of the tube budding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gillard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the point of invagination from the circular placode primordium is not in the center of the placode, but in an asymmetric, eccentric position in the dorsal-posterior corner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using quantitative morphometric methods, we showed that the early apical constriction and associated cell wedging at the position of the invagination pit initiates the tissue bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). Isotropic constriction driven by apical-medial actomyosin is concentrated near the forming invagination pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’ and A’’</xref>), but at a distance to the pit a second cell behavior dominates cell intercalation. Driven by a polarised junctional accumulation of actomyosin, cell intercalation events such as T1 exchanges and rosette formation and resolution help to elongate the tissue radially toward the invagination pit and contract it circumferentially, via circumferential neighbor gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Patterned apical constriction remains fixed around the pit over time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The tubes of the salivary glands form from a flat epithelial placode with a circular geometry. Cells invaginate through an asymmetrically positioned invagination pit at the dorsal-posterior corner, embryonic axes of anterior-posterior (AP) and dorso-ventral (DV) are indicated. In the placode at early stages cell behaviors are highly patterned, with cells near the pit predominantly constricting isotropically and cells far from the pit predominantly intercalating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). (<bold>A’</bold>) Apical constriction within the apical domain of an epithelial cell, a 2D change, equates to a behavior of cell wedging within the 3D context of a whole cell, as shown in a cross-sectional view. (<bold>A’’</bold>) Patterned cell behaviors are driven by distinct pools of apical actomyosin. Three pools of actomyosin can be distinguished in the placode: apical-medial actomyosin in cells near the invagination pit (dark orange), leading to isotropic apical constriction; polarised junctional actomyosin, driving the initiation of directed cell intercalation events in cells further away from the pit (light orange); a circumferential actomyosin cable at the boundary of the placode.

We specify the ‘near to the pit’ region as the region located between the invagination point and up to 33% of the distance between the invagination point and the far edge of the placode (with this region usually being within 13.7±3 µm of the pit), and with the rest of the cells defined as ‘far from the pit.’ The cell outlines in the time-lapse movie are labeled using Armadillo-YFP.

An indication that the asymmetry of the salivary gland placode is important for wild-type tube formation is given by the reports that in certain mutant situations where a more central invagination appears to form, the overall morphogenesis is disrupted and the invaginated structure that forms is sack-like and irregular. This is true for embryos lacking the transcription factor Hkb that is expressed early in the placode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Myat and Andrew, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Myat and Andrew, 2002</xref>), and could therefore potentially implicate Hkb in establishing early placode patterning.</p><p>Second, how is this asymmetry of the placode established prior to morphogenesis commencing and then maintained throughout the process? Previous studies have shown that several proteins known to be expressed in the placode can be detected at the mRNA level initially in the dorsal posterior region of the placode. These include the transcription factor Forkhead (Fkh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</xref>), the dynein-associated protein Klar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Myat and Andrew, 2002</xref>), as well as the kinase Btk29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandrasekaran and Beckendorf, 2005</xref>). Defined expression of these and other factors at the dorsal-posterior corner could set up the initiation of cell shape changes in this region. In agreement with this, we previously found that <italic>fkh<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants specifically fail to apically constrict in the dorsal-posterior corner, though they do show intercalation behavior, and these mutants do not invaginate a tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). Following on from the early regionalized behaviors that drive the initial tissue bending and tube invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>), it is thus far unclear what mechanisms continue to drive the sustained invagination until all secretory cells have internalized. This could be due to continued transcriptional patterning and activation of downstream effectors, and/or could be due to mechanical signaling and feedback.</p><p>Here, we investigate how the asymmetry is set up and maintained during salivary gland tube formation, in particular beyond the initial stages. We found that apical constriction is always strongest near the invagination pit at any moment in time. As more and more coronae of cells approach the region near the pit, they switch behavior from predominantly intercalating to predominantly apically constricting/wedging. This continued switch to apical constriction leads to a smooth continued invagination process akin to a ‘standing wave’ of apical constriction, through which the placodal cells flow. The continued near-pit constriction is driven by apical-medial myosin, whose peak intensity and peak pulsatile strength is tracked in a fixed position close to the pit over time. Using live-imaging of endogenous fluorescently tagged versions of Hkb and Fkh, we show that their expression levels pre-pattern where initial constriction is occurring. Both are upstream of a dynamic patterning of the GPCR ligand Fog, that in turn activates apical-medial myosin. Loss of the correct pre-patterning, such as in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants or when Fog is overexpressed, leads to loss of the symmetrical final organ shape with a narrow lumen and instead gives rise to expanded and sack-like glands with widened lumena.</p><p>Our work establishes that after the tissue is patterned at the posterior corner, cells follow dynamic rules of behavior as they approach the pit. Symmetrical tube morphogenesis thus relies on a regionalization and patterning of the primordium long before cells show distinctive behaviors. Establishing general mechanisms that modulate the orderly and repetitive behavior of cells to form correctly shaped simple model organs such as the salivary glands will assist the understanding of the morphogenesis of other more complex tubular organs in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patterned apical constriction remains fixed around the pit over time</title><p>The initial morphogenetic change that occurs during the budding of the tube of the salivary glands in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos is the apical constriction of cells at the point of the future site of invagination, the pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and A’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Girdler and Röper, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Myat and Andrew, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Myat and Andrew, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). We recently provided the first quantitative morphometric analysis of the very early stages of this process, and revealed that, first, isotropic apical constriction near the future pit commences long before changes at the tissue level are apparent, and that, second, the apical constriction is indicative of a 3D cell behavior of wedging of cells at the pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’</xref>). Importantly, we uncovered a strong regionalization of cell behaviors during the early stages of tube budding: cells near the invagination point predominantly showed apical constriction behavior while cells at a distance from the pit predominantly showed intercalation behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). What is unclear is how the early tube initiation via isotropic apical constriction of cells, combined with directional intercalation of the cells still positioned away from the forming pit, evolves over time. The process of tube formation is characterized by the continuous invagination of cells and the formation of a symmetrical narrow-lumen tube from an asymmetric placode primordium. We can imagine two scenarios: in one, cell behavior is fixed at early stages of budding, that is, apical cell constriction is restricted to the pit and only apparent during early stages. In a second scenario, cell behavior depends on a cell’s position relative to the invagination pit and thus cell behaviors change as cells move toward the invagination point.</p><p>To distinguish between these scenarios, we segmented and tracked placodal cells from time-lapse movies covering a –40 min to +70 min time interval of the invagination process, with t=0 min defined as the first occurrence of tissue bending (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for time intervals of analyzed movies and cell numbers analyzed) and performed quantitative analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). At the latest time point covered, the majority of secretory cells had completely internalized and formed the internal tube. As calculated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>), we employ a radial coordinate system centered at the invagination point at t=0 min. We specify the ‘near to the pit’ region as the region located between the invagination point and up to 33% of the distance between the invagination point and the far edge of the placode (with this region usually being within 13.7±3 µm of the pit), and with the rest of the cells defined as ‘far from the pit.’</p><p>Cells positioned near the pit at t=0 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, pink) constricted their apices isotropically and rapidly and were internalized by about t=+ 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> and dashed curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Cells positioned far from the pit at t=0 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, gray) and moving into a position closer to the invagination point began constricting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref> and solid curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>), suggesting that cells changed their behavior depending on where they were positioned in the placode with respect to the invagination point. Cells near the pit displayed isotropic constriction and thus a negative cumulative apical area change from the start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, pink highlighted), whereas cells initially positioned far from the pit did not change their apical area over the first ~20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, gray highlighted), but then began to display isotropic apical constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, blue highlighted). The cell behaviors and changes of cell behaviors were very apparent when we analyzed individual cells: cells located in the near pit region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, yellow and green cells) constricted progressively, whereas cells located in the region far from the pit at t=0 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, blue and magenta cells) retained their apical area initially and only began constricting from t&gt;+20 min onwards. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>), cells far from the pit initially showed predominantly a cell intercalation behavior that constricts the tissue primordium circumferentially whilst expanding it radially, thereby moving cells closer to the invagination pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). As they approached the invagination pit, these cells also started to apically constrict (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> solid line, highlighted in blue and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>These data strongly suggest that an initially pre-patterned behavior, isotropic constriction at the pit and intercalation further away, is dynamically adjusted during tube budding from a flat epithelial sheet, so that cells within a similar distance to the invagination pit display the same behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sustained apical constriction near the pit is driven by sustained apical-medial myosin</title><p>Early apical constriction at the pit is driven by a highly dynamic apical-medial actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). We next sought to determine whether the apical-medial actomyosin dynamics would differ among regions in the placode. We analyzed apical-medial actomyosin levels in cells across the placode, and firstly illustrate our findings in two snapshots: cells near the future invagination point at t=0 min showed strong accumulation of apical-medial myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, A’’ and C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>), whereas cells far from the pit and close to the anterior placode boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and A’</xref>) showed mainly junctional myosin II accumulation. At t=30 min, the cells now located right next to the invagination pit continued to display strong apical-medial myosin accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and B’’</xref>), but in addition cells that were initially ‘far from the pit,’ but were now in a closer proximity to the pit though still near the anterior boundary, now also started to display apical-medial actomyosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and B’</xref>). Thus, being moved into a position near the invagination pit appeared to determine levels of apical-medial myosin accumulation. Looking placode-wide over the whole time period analyzed, the peak of the apical-medial myosin fluorescence intensity tracked in a near-fixed position to the edge of the pit over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, white dotted line). The location of the highest medial myosin intensity was also where cells showed the shortest cycle lengths of medial myosin II fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, white dotted line). Interestingly, cells near the pit at t=0 min showed an overall shorter myosin II cycle length (the time period elapsed between two peaks of highest myosin II intensity during the oscillation, see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) compared to cells located far from the pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As longer cycle length correlates with unproductive myosin cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2014</xref>), this was in line with cells further away from the pit showing less apical constriction. Furthermore, the strength of myosin oscillations can be expressed as the product of the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2014</xref>). This myosin strength across the placode at t=0 min was much higher in cells near the invagination point when plotted against the distance to the pit, with a gradual decrease in myosin strength toward the placode boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, cells originally far from the pit at t=0 min increased their myosin strength over time (and concomitantly decreased their cycle length; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) whilst moving into a position closer to the pit, so that by t=55 min their myosin strength had increased to levels previously shown by cells near the pit at t=0 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sustained apical constriction near the pit is driven by apical-medial myosin.</title><p>(<bold>A-B’’</bold>) Still images of a time-lapse movie of embryos expressing SqhGFP to label myosin II at t = 0 min (<bold>A-A’’</bold>) and t = 30 min (<bold>B-B’’</bold>).

Whereas in wild-type embryos, at t ~ +40 min, most secretory cells of the salivary gland placode have already invaginated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A’’’, B’’’ and C’’’</xref>), in the <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants no invagination had occurred yet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D’’’, E’’’ and F’’’</xref>). Eventually, these embryos invaginated a dilated tube through an enlarged pit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We analyzed the spatial distribution of apical area changes over time in wild-type and <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> placodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). In the wild-type, the area of strongest apical area constriction was always located in a position near the pit, similar to the distribution of medial myosin intensity and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant placodes cells began to constrict in an aberrant central position from about t=+20–30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Thus, <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants show a delayed central invagination pit compared to the eccentric pit observed in wild-type placodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(I)1’</xref>). For our further quantitative analyses, we now took this change to a central pit position in the mutants into account. We plotted cumulative apical area change for cells in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant placodes, split into cells near the (now central) pit and cells far from the pit (at the placode periphery). This analysis showed that cells in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant placodes located near the central pit started to constrict at a much slower rate than cells in wild-type placodes, and only from about t=+20 min on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, wild-type data reproduced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In fact, the rate of the constriction of the central cells in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants was very similar to that of the cells located at a distance to the pit in the wild-type (compare blue dashed and magenta solid curves), suggesting that the central cells in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants continue to behave identical to the wild-type cells occupying the same position. Cells far from the central pit in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants showed a slight apical area expansion up to t=+20 min followed by a slight constriction, but did not invaginate over the time interval shown in the plots. In agreement with the delayed central constriction of cells in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant placodes, we found no accumulation of apical-medial actomyosin at the eccentric position where a pit forms in the wild-type (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and K</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We therefore performed a strain (deformation) rate analysis of placodes in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants in comparison to wild-type embryos to assess this quantitatively. The strain rate analysis is based on the assumption that any change in tissue shape can be accounted for by changes in cell shape and cell intercalations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). In many tissues, cell division or cell death and delamination also contribute to strain rates, but these are absent in the salivary gland placode during invagination and can thus be neglected. The origin of the radial coordinate system used for this analysis was specified at t=0 min and positioned at the center of of the placode in the <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant embryos (where the central constriction eventually occurred) and in wild-type embryos at the dorsal-posterior corner of the placode (where the wild-type pit will form). In wild-type placodes, cells that were located near the eccentric invagination pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; with the ‘near’ position defined at t=0 min; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) constricted isotropically, with near equal change in strain at the tissue and cell shape level, and very little intercalation strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A’ and A’’</xref>, solid curves). These cells in wild-type placodes could only be tracked up to t=20 min as at this point they had all invaginated into the embryo to form the initial part of the tube. In contrast, in the <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants, cells near the forming central pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; defined to be in a ‘near’ position at t=0 min) showed a much reduced tissue and cell shape strain rate, with near identical radial and circumferential contributions, and constriction only commenced at about half the rate of the wild-type placodes from t=+20 min onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A’ and A’’</xref>, dashed curves; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In wild-type placodes, cells far from the eccentric pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; defined to be ‘far’ at t=0 min), showed cell intercalations leading to circumferential convergence and radial extension of the tissue over the first approximately 20 min after invagination commenced, as we also reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’ and B’’</xref>, solid curves; tissue and intercalation strain rate showing expansion radially and contraction circumferentially; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we then observed a clear switch in cell behavior of these cells to a second phase after t=+20 min. Once these cells were located closer to the pit position, they now also displayed apical contraction (beyond t=+20 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’ and B’’</xref>, solid green curves). In the <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants, for cells at the placode periphery and hence far from the central constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the tissue expanded slightly in both radial and circumferential direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’ and B’’</xref>, dashed gray curves), with cell shapes narrowing radially (dashed green curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’</xref>) and extending circumferentially (dashed green curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’’</xref>). We could observe a similar rate of intercalation in these cells as in cells far from the pit in wild-type placodes, with some radial elongation and circumferential contraction (dashed orange curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’ and B’’</xref>). As the tissue strain rate in the <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants showed no overall signature of directional changes with only a slight expansion both radially and circumferentially, we were curious to understand better what these tissue-scale signatures could represent at the individual cell level.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><italic>hkb<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutants show aberrant cell behaviors during invagination.</title><p>(<bold>A–B’’</bold>) Regional breakdown of time-resolved cumulative strain rates, with regions defined at t=0 min based on eccentric pit for the wild-type and a central pit for <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants.

We compared two types of intercalation events, those leading to circumferential neighbor gains that in wild-type placodes explain the observed intercalation strain rates, and those leading to radial neighbor gains, and thus potentially opposing the changes seen at the tissue and intercalation strain rate level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In wild-type placodes, circumferential neighbor gains outweigh radial ones by a large margin throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, dashed curves), leading to a steady increase in cumulative productive neighbor gains for cells across the placode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, yellow curves). In contrast, in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant embryos circumferential and radial neighbor gains across the placode were overall much reduced in number and occurred with equal frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, solid curves). Furthermore, cells near the delayed central pit in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants showed no productive neighbor gains (defined as the difference between circumferential and radial neighbor gains, corrected for the proportion of interfaces that could successfully be tracked; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, purple dashed curve), whereas cells at the periphery away from the central pit showed productive neighbor gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, solid purple curve). Active neighbor gains in the placode and other morphogenetic events are initiated and driven by junctional actomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tetley et al., 2016</xref>), prompting us to analyze junctional myosin polarisation in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant embryos. We previously reported on the unipolar and bipolar enrichment of junctional myosin in the wild-type at early stages of placode morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>) and expand it here to the whole process of secretory cell invagination in comparison to <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Whereas in control placodes junctional myosin is clearly enriched in circumferential junctions by both measures, up to the point of most secretory cells having internalized by t=+40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>; dashed green curve vs. dashed purple curve), in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant placodes myosin unipolarity and bipolarity are strongly reduced, even though some bipolarity remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>, solid curves). Thus, the major driver of active intercalations appeared to be strongly diminished in the mutants, posing the question of what could drive the observed intercalations here. We also analyzed cell elongation in cells far from the pit, with cells in wild-type placodes being initially elongated circumferentially at t&lt;+20 min, while early intercalation events are initiated by circumferential junctional myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, gray curve; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). These cells then became increasingly elongated radially as they moved into a position nearer to the pit and were being actively funneled toward the pit. In <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant embryos, cells far from the pit at the periphery of the placode very quickly became circumferentially elongated and remained so throughout the time period analyzed. This aberrant circumferential elongation together with the mild bipolarity of junctional myosin polarisation that we observed prompted us to analyze individual events of cell intercalation in time-lapse movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–L</xref>). In cells far from the central pit in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants, we could observe groups of cells clearly undergoing intercalations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>) with individual cells making circumferential neighbor gains and elongating (cells 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), whilst the overall shape of the local group of cells undergoing the intercalation event was not changing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). Thus, although cells far from the aberrant central pit in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants still intercalated and gained circumferential neighbors, this behavior lacked several key signatures of wild-type intercalations, and overall in the <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants intercalations did not lead to convergence and extension of the tissue toward the misplaced pit.</p><p>These analyses show that in the absence of Hkb, the initial radial patterning of cell behaviors across the placode is highly aberrant.

In order to be able to analyze Hkb protein levels dynamically and in comparison to cell shapes, we generated a Venus-tagged version of Hkb using CRISPR/Cas9 to tag the endogenous protein. Using this in vivo reporter, we detected Venus-Hkb at high levels concentrated in the dorsal-posterior region of the just forming placode, in the area where the invagination pit will form, already at t=–30 min prior to the first tissue bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, A’, D and M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,B''</xref> ), and even as early as t=–63 min prior to invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Using an in vivo genomic GFP-Fkh reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spokony and White, 2013</xref>), we followed Fkh protein levels and patterning over the same time period whilst also assessing apical cell shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–L</xref>). Already at t=–60 min prior to tissue bending, Fkh-GFP was visible in the cells near the future invagination pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, G’, J and N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–C''</xref>), from where it spread anteriorly and ventrally across the whole placode (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5—video 2</xref>). At t=0 min, Fkh-GFP was already detected in all cells of the placode, though with levels still highest near the pit and decreasing toward the anterior edge of the placode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H, H’, K and N</xref>). At t=+30 min and beyond, levels of Fkh-GFP were more uniform across the placode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I, I', L, N</xref>).</p><p>Thus, both Hkb and Fkh transcription factors showed a clear temporally and spatially graded pattern of expression within the early placode that developed dynamically. Changes were especially pronounced at the dorsal-posterior corner, with highest levels here already an hour before tissue bending commenced. Combined Hkb and Fkh action could thereby define the future position of the invagination pit. We therefore compared Venus-Hkb as well as Fkh-GFP fluorescence intensity levels from time-lapse movies that in parallel allowed us to determine the corresponding apical area of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O–P’</xref>). Venus-Hkb intensity levels peaked in cells located at the site of the forming eccentric invagination pit at about t ~ –30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>), with an appearance of smaller apical areas in this position following on about 30–40 min later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O’</xref>). Similarly, Fkh-GFP intensity began to peak at about the same time, t ~ –30 min, and then tracked at high level at a fixed distance to the pit over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P</xref>). Again also here, the increased reduction in apical area appeared with a delay of about 30–40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P’</xref>). Such a delay would be consistent with the estimated time required for the transcription of the <italic>fog</italic> locus, followed by translation, protein folding, secretion, binding to the receptor, and signaling leading to myosin phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shamir et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Thus, Hkb and Fkh dynamic expression at the future eccentric pit could prefigure the start of apical constriction at this site. The continuous high levels of Fkh tracking at a fixed distance to the pit suggest that Fkh is key to the continuous apical constriction of cells moving into a near pit position. These dynamic changes might trigger the graded and patterned expression of targets of both transcription factors, leading to the observed patterned cell behaviors we uncovered, as well as the switch between intercalation and constriction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Asymmetric Fog expression is controlled by Hkb and Fkh and is upstream of early differential behaviors in the placode</title><p>With the transcription factors Fkh and Hkb both displaying intriguing protein expression patterns across the early placode pre-morphogenesis, targets of both factors are likely to play key roles in instructing cell behaviors such as wedging and cell intercalation.

Cells at the posterior corner, where the invagination pit would have formed in wild-type placodes, lacked high Fog protein levels, whereas only cells in the center of the placode now showed high levels of Fog protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M–O</xref>). When quantitatively analyzing many <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant embryos in comparison to wild-type, the peak intensity of Fog protein was clearly shifted to a central, much more symmetrical, position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P</xref>). In contrast, although we could detect some Fog protein in <italic>fkh<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> embryos at late stage 11, it was no longer enriched at the position where the invagination pit forms in the wild-type.

The pattern remained identical to wild-type placodes throughout stage 11 and beyond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> G,G’, J, J’). Hence the natural expansion of Fkh protein expression to the cells in the center of the placode that is also observed in the <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant placodes might be the cause of the delayed constriction of the cells in this region, whereas the earlier initial constriction at the site of the eccentric pit was absent in the mutant because it requires both Fkh and Hkb.

An enlarged pit, a combination of the two previous scenarios and resembling aspects of the enlarged pit and invagination seen in <italic>UAS-Fog x fkhGal4</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M and M’</xref>), would lead to the invagination of a large number of cells initially, followed by similarly large numbers in each corona (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M’</xref> and gray curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>).

We previously identified cell behaviors that become established across the placode and drive the initial tissue bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A number of mechanisms appear at play that in combination ensure that a symmetrical and narrow-lumen tube is formed from an initially flat epithelial primordium. A temporal and spatial component is provided by the dynamically changing pattern of the transcription factors Hkb and Fkh. These are expressed initially with the highest protein level at the point where the invagination pit will form, before expression expands further across the placode over time. This ensures that the cells in the dorsal-posterior corner are the first to experience high levels of activity of these transcription factors, and we show that one of the important targets, the GPCR-ligand Fog, is found at high levels in these cells in a Hkb- and Fkh-dependent manner with a slight temporal delay. A further spatial component is provided by the fact that, as cells continuously internalize to form the tube on the inside of the embryo, new coronas of cells are brought into a ‘near the pit’ position and adjust their behavior accordingly. This position-specific behavior of apical constriction is most likely triggered by the previous temporal expansion of Fkh and also Hkb expression to these cells, thereby priming them for their next step in the path to tube formation. Interestingly, though, the pattern of Fkh and Hkb expression from t=0 min onwards, though generally expanding across the placode, is not identical. This could suggest that downstream targets begin to diverge at later stages. The <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutant analysis in particular suggests that the central cells in the placode that manage to constrict in the absence of Hkb might only require Fkh activity to initiate Fog expression and function. These cells therefore undergo their normal apical constriction once Fkh expression has reached the central position. As they now are the first cells to constrict and invaginate, the <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants show a central and delayed constriction and invagination.</p><p>Our work strongly suggests that the combined early patterning of Hkb and Fkh expression defines the early invagination pit and its eccentric position. How though is Hkb and Fkh expression initially limited to this point? Both are expressed in the placode downstream of the homeotic factor Sex Combs Reduced (Scr; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Myat and Andrew, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Panzer et al., 1992</xref>). They are also not the only factors expressed near exclusively at this corner first. At the transcription factor level in particular one of the parasegmentally repeated stripes of Wingless (Wg) expression overlays the posterior part of the placode, its expression domain defined by previous parasegmental patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark, 2017</xref>). And at the time point when Hkb and Fkh expression at the future pit location commences, the Wg expression within the placode region is also confined to this corner only, rather than extending all the way to the ventral midline (data not shown). Future studies will show whether a combination of Scr and Wg transcription factor activity could activate early pit-defining expression of factors such as Fkh and Hkb. In addition to transcription factors, some potential downstream effectors also appear to be expressed near the future pit location first, these include Btk29/Tec29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandrasekaran and Beckendorf, 2005</xref>), Crumbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Myat and Andrew, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Röper, 2012</xref>), 18-Wheeler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolesnikov and Beckendorf, 2007</xref>), and Klarsicht (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Myat and Andrew, 2002</xref>). Cell-based genomics approaches such as single-cell RNAseq or ATAC-seq should in the future allow to precisely determine the genetic program that underlies the regionalization of the placode.</p><p>Activation of actomyosin contractility through GPCR signaling driven by the autocrine secretion of the ligand Fog is a module repeatedly used during tissue bending and invagination events in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis. What differs are the upstream activating transcription factors: during mesoderm invagination Fog expression on the ventral side is controlled by Twist and Snail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morize et al., 1998</xref>), whereas its expression during posterior midgut invagination is controlled by Tailless and Hkb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weigel et al., 1990</xref>). The effect of Hkb on Fog expression is likely direct, as the Fog locus contains predicted Hkb-binding sites (using oPOSSUM, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opossum.cisreg.ca/oPOSSUM3/">http://opossum.cisreg.ca/oPOSSUM3/</ext-link>). The identity of the GPCR that could mediate the Fog signal in the salivary gland placode is unclear thus far. Published and database (Flybase) in situs for the GPCRs previously reported to be involved in mesoderm invagination and germband extension, Mist and Smog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manning et al., 2013</xref>), do not show an enriched expression in the placode. But with around 200 <italic>Drosophila</italic> GPCRs in existence, half of them orphan receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanlon and Andrew, 2015</xref>), the placode might well express yet another one, and we will focus on candidates previously identified in screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maybeck and Röper, 2009</xref>) and genomics approaches (our unpublished data) in the future.</p><p>The question of how cell behavior is modulated over time after the initial transcriptional patterning that defines primordium identity is key to understand general mechanisms that allow continuous organ formation. Different solutions seem to have been adopted in different tissues. Recent work analyzing mesoderm invagination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has shown that the key morphogenetic effectors T48 and Fog show a gradient of expression due to differential timing of transcriptional activation, leading to different spatial accumulations of the transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al., 2017</xref>) and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heer et al., 2017</xref>). Flattening the gradient experimentally (by expansion of the ventral domain) leads to a widened and perturbed invagination process. By contrast, the invagination of the posterior midgut or endoderm primordium in the fly embryo does not require sustained transcription, but instead a wave of apical constriction that is initiated by Fog expression in a subset of cells, appears to be propagated via mechanical feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailles et al., 2019</xref>). The salivary gland placode seems to follow a model of a temporal expansion or wave of transcriptional activity translating into positionally fixed behaviors. Nonetheless, our quantitative analysis of 3D cell behaviors strongly indicated that mechanical feedback does also play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). Which combination of mechanisms is ultimately at work to sustain a morphogenetic process could depend on a number of factors including the developmental stage, the speed of the process (consider ~15 min for mesoderm invagination versus ~30 min for endoderm invagination versus ~1.5 hr for secretory cell invagination in the salivary gland placode), as well as the influence of other nearby concomitant morphogenetic events.</p><p>The eccentric pit setup of the placode we suggest is key to wild-type tube formation with a narrow lumen, and we show that our simple geometrical considerations are in good agreement with the actual in vivo data of number of cells per corona invaginating. Whether the eccentricity only allows to control cell numbers of invaginating coronae, or whether such setup could also have further beneficial effects on for instance mechanical aspects of the tissue will be something we will actively explore both in vivo and in silico in the future. Curiously and maybe tellingly, the asymmetry of the placodal setup is retained in another tube formation process, the invagination of the posterior spiracles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sidor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simões et al., 2006</xref>). The posterior spiracle placode, like the salivary gland placode, is a flat epithelium with an eccentric invagination point. In this case, an initial tube is already present due to the previous invagination of the most posterior tracheal placode. Whether the asymmetrical setup is thus a conserved feature of further tube budding processes during development will be an exciting question to address. 3D mathematical modelling of tube morphogenesis assuming an eccentric versus centrally positioned invagination point will help to dissect the topological advantages of being asymmetric.</p><p>In summary, we have quantitatively unraveled a dynamic spatio-temporal patterning of transcription factors and switches in cell behaviors leading to positionally fixed behaviors during the morphogenesis of simple tubular organ. We foresee that such mechanisms will be important for establishing general mechanisms and morphogenetic modules at work during the morphogenesis of more complex tubular organs and potentially also for engineered tissues in a dish.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Quasi-2D image layers were then extracted from image volumes at specified depths from the surface blanket. This step permitted to account for the curvature of the embryos in these quasi-2D projections. We took maximum intensity projections of a small number of near-surface image layers typically at 0–4 μm from membrane channels, for cell-apical analyses, apicomedial myosin and anti-Fog fluorescence channels and projections of image layers typically from 5 to 16 μm encompassing nuclear fluorescence for Venus-HKB and Fkh-GFP analyses.

We specify the ‘near to the pit’ region as the region located between the invagination point and up to 33% of the distance between the invagination point and the far edge of the placode (with this region usually being within 13.7±3 µm of the pit), and with the rest of the cells defined as ‘far from the pit.’</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Morphogenetic strain rate analysis</title><p>Detailed spatial patterns of the rates of deformation across the placode and over time quantify the net outcome of active stresses, viscoelastic material properties, and frictions both from within and outside the placode. We quantified strain (deformation) rates over small spatio-temporal domains composed of a focal cell and one corona of immediate neighbors over a ~3-min interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard et al., 2009</xref>) and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchard, 2017</xref>. On such 2D domains, strain rates are captured elliptically, as the strain rate in the orientation of greatest absolute strain rate, with a second strain rate perpendicular to this.</p><p>For the early morphogenesis of the salivary gland placode, in which there is no cell division or gain/loss of cells from the epithelium, three types of strain rates can be calculated. First, total tissue strain rates are calculated for all local domains using the relative movements of cell centroids, extracted from automated cell tracking. This captures the net effect of cell shape changes and cell rearrangements within the tissue, but these can also be separated out. Second, domain cell shape strain rates are calculated by approximating each cell with its best-fit ellipse and then finding the best mapping of a cell’s elliptical shape to its shape in the subsequent time point, and averaging over the cells of the domain. Third, intercalation strain rates that capture the continuous process of cells in a domain sliding past each other in a particular orientation, are calculated as the difference between the total tissue strain rates and the cell shape strain rates of cells. Strain rates were calculated using custom software written in L3Harris Geospatial IDL (code provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard et al., 2009</xref> or by email from G.B.B.).</p><p>The three types of elliptical strain rates were projected onto our radial coordinate system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>) using the eccentric pit location in wild-type (dorsal-posterior corner) or the center of the misplaced invagination point in <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mutants. The radial coordinate system permitted us to analyze radial and circumferential contributions. Strain rates in units of proportional size change per minute can easily be averaged across space or accumulated over time. We present instantaneous strain rates over time for spatial subsets of cells in the placode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and cumulative strain ratios for the same regions over time. These plots were made from exported data as done previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>. To test for differences in instantaneous strain rates of wt and <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> time-lapse movies we used a mixed-effects model implemented in R (lmer4 package as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>) with a significance threshold of p&lt;0.05. The phenotype (wt or <italic>hkb<sup>−/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup>) was considered a fixed effect while the variation between embryos from the same phenotype was considered a random effect.</p><p>Cell shape elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) was calculated by fitting an ellipse into each cell. The two axes of each ellipse were projected into radial coordinates and the ratio of them was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Neighbor exchange analysis</title><p>We used changes in neighbor connectivity in our tracked cell data to identify neighbor exchange events (T1 processes). Neighbor exchange events were defined by the identity of the pair of cells that lost connectivity in <italic>t</italic> and the pair that gained connectivity at <italic>t</italic>+1. The orientation of gain we defined as the orientation of the centroid-centroid line of the gaining pair at <italic>t</italic>+1. We further classified gains as either radially or circumferentially oriented, depending on which the gain axis was most closely aligned to locally. We did not distinguish between solitary T1s and T1s involved in rosette-like structures.</p><p>From visual inspection, we knew that some T1s were subsequently reversed, so we characterized not only the total number of gains in each orientation but also the net gain in the circumferential axis, by subtracting the number of radial gains. Furthermore, when comparing embryos and genotypes, we controlled for differences in numbers of tracked cells by expressing the net circumferential gain per time step as a proportion of half of the total number of tracked cell-cell interfaces in that time step. We accumulated numbers of gains, net gains, and proportional rate of gain over time for WT and <italic>hkb</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to determine significance at p&lt;0.05 for data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Automated medial myosin II quantification and oscillatory behavior and polarity</title><p>We extracted a quasi-2D layer image from the myosin II channel at a depth typically from 0 to 3 μm that maximized the capture of apical-medial myosin. We background-subtracted the myosin images and quantified the average intensity of apical-medial myosin as the fluorescence inside the segmented cell, excluding the fluorescence along cell-cell interfaces encompassing the cell edge pixels plus two pixels in a perpendicular direction on either side (considered junctional myosin).</p><p>The analysis of apical-medial fluorescence fluctuations was performed as described before in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchard et al., 2010</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2014</xref>. Briefly, the apical-medial fluorescence values in the time series were detrended by subtracting a boxcar average with a window of 6 min (larger than the maximum expected fluctuation cycle length). All peaks and troughs were then identified in the fluorescence signal. Peaks or troughs that were associated with very small amplitude cycles were skipped. The remaining peaks and troughs were used to calculate the amplitude and the cycle length (peak to peak) and the amplitude (average peak to trough) of fluctuations.</p><p>The analysis of junctional myosin polarity was performed as described before in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tetley et al., 2016</xref>. Briefly, the average junctional fluorescence intensity is considered a periodic signal around the cell and decomposed into individual components (modes) using Fourier analysis. The strength of myosin bipolarity corresponds to the amplitude of the second mode while the strength of unipolarity corresponds to the amplitude of the first mode. Similarly, the phase of modes 1 and 2 (uni-/bipolarity) represents the orientation of cell polarity. The uni- and bipolarity amplitudes are expressed as a proportion of the mean cell perimeter fluorescence. Cells at the border of the placode that are part of the supra-cellular actomyosin cable at the boundary were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Hkb, Fkh, and Fog fluorescence intensity quantifications</title><p>Average fluorescence was calculated after background subtraction as the mean fluorescence inside a segmented cell excluding the cell edge pixels and two pixels in a perpendicular direction on either side.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Adam C Martin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that the pattern of Hkb expression regulates radial cell behaviors is based on analyzing a loss-of-function mutant in hkb, rather than altering its expression pattern. However, complete loss of a transcription factor is likely to affect many cellular processes, not just actomyosin. An experiment that alters the pattern of gene expression in the domain (other than loss of the whole factor) is needed to support the authors claims. If existing Gal4-UAS tools permit, the authors should attempt to alter the expression pattern of Hkb or Fkh and determine the effect on actomyosin and cell behavior. If existing tools do not allow for a meaningful change in the expression pattern, the authors should alter their conclusions.</p><p>2) The conclusion that &quot;changes to invagination pit size or position... perturb final organ shape.&quot;, is based on Fog overexpression driven by Fkh-Gal4. Since Fkh is what the authors propose to drive Fog expression in the proper pattern, it is important to show how endogenous Fog expression compares to Fog driven by Fkh-Gal4. Moreover, Fog overexpression is expected to overactivate contractility at center of the invagination in addition to changing its pattern. The authors should attempt to distinguish between effects of excessive contractility in central cells and expansion of the domain size.</p><p>3) To unambiguously demonstrate that cells far from the pit move toward the pit and then change behavior to apical constriction, a cell tracking analysis should accompany Figure 1, so that the reader can clearly identify that the same cells have moved and changed shape over time.</p><p>4) In general, the manuscript is quite densely written and one can easily get lost in the descriptions.

To unambiguously demonstrate that cells far from the pit move toward the pit and then change behavior to apical constriction, a cell tracking analysis should accompany Figure 1, so that the reader can clearly identify that the same cells have moved and changed shape over time.</p><p>2. A more detailed discussion of the timing of events should accompany the authors overall model that dynamic patterns of Fkh and Hkb expression regulate the pattern of Fog/myosin dynamics. Specifically, it appears that Fog expression, myosin localization, and apical constriction correlate both in space and time across the placode, whereas Fkh and Hkb expression patterns are offset by ~30-60 min. Considering the time it takes for transcription, translation, and secretion of Fog, the authors should discuss whether the timing of events are consistent with their model.</p><p>Other points</p><p>1. How are 'near the pit' and 'far from the pit' cells selected and defined? This should be explained in the main text or legend.</p><p>2. Figure 1C. y-axis. Please define pp/min.</p><p>3. Figure 2E. I'm a little confused how the medial myosin cycle is defined. Looking at the data from figure 2D, it looks like medial myosin peaks only once (green boxes) over the time course. Or is this because data in Figure 2D are averaged across all cells in the radial stripe, so the cycles are obscured? Also, if cells far from the pit lack medial myosin, what is being quantified for cells far from the pit in 2E and F (and also 2G and H?)?</p><p>4. Figure 4 was overall very hard to follow. I suggest moving A' and B' panels to the left so it is clear that A panels refer to cells near the pit and B panels away from the pit. Also, I think circumferential vs radial behaviors need to be clearly defined in the text, labeled on the figure (I appreciate the schematics, but I wasn't sure which was radial and which was circumferential until panel C), and discussed separately in the text. For panels K and L, a comparison to WT intercalation is needed to appreciate the defect in Hkb-/-.</p><p>5. Figure 4F and G. Please describe what is the y-axis for myosin polarity (pp/min? what is being measured here?).</p><p>6. Figure 6. Several image panels (but not all) show paired gland placodes in more zoomed out images compared to previous figures. To be consistent with prior figures, I suggest cropping the images to show individual placodes in panels D-I and M-O.</p><p>7. Figure 7. Fkh-Gal4 is used to overexpress Fog in an aberrant pattern. But since Fkh is what the authors propose to drive Fog expression in the proper pattern, it is important to show how endogenous Fog expression compares to Fog driven by Fkh-Gal4.</p><p>8. Figure 7. Please show paired panels for WT and UAS-Fog x Fkh-Gal4 with the same markers for D-H. For example, Crumbs is shown for the WT but membranes are shown for Fog overexpression. Also stages 12 and 13 are shown for Fog overexpression but not for WT.</p><p>9. Figure 7P compares experimental observations to the in silico model. Why are there only two coronae measured for the UAS-Fog condition, and 6-7 coronae for WT and Hkb-/-?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. L 208. &quot;hkb-/- mutants show a delayed symmetrical apical constriction&quot;. This part in particular should be reformulated to make it easier to digest. Maybe separating the apical constriction part from the intercalation part could make it easier. The title is not taking into account the whole analysis of cell intercalation.</p><p>2. L257-293. A short summary of the main observations described in this paragraph is missing at the end. This description for example &quot;in the hkb-/- mutants cells specified at t = 0 min to be near the coordinates of the later position of central apical constriction&quot; (L 272) is quite complicated and it took me a while to understand. The analysis of cell shape, tissue strain, and individual cell intercalation behavior is a little complex to follow.</p><p>3. L440. &quot;Hence the expansion of Fkh protein to the center of the placode in the hkb-/- mutants might be the cause of the delayed constriction of cells here, whereas the earlier initial constriction at the site of the eccentric pit was absent in the mutant because it requires both Fkh and Hkb.&quot; I do not follow the idea here. I cannot see any change in the expression pattern of Fkh at any stage (as mentioned in the text), so how this can unchanged pattern could explain the delay observed in Hbk mutant?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors state in the abstract that &quot;early transcriptional patterning of key morphogenetic transcription factors drives the selective activation of downstream morphogenetic modules, such as... that activates actomyosin activity&quot;. To support their claim the authors analyze transcription factor mutants, such as hkb-/-, which disrupts the pattern. However, complete loss of a transcription factor is likely to affect many cellular processes (i.e. not just actomyosin). There is no experiment that alters the pattern of gene expression in the domain (other than loss of the whole factor). The authors should discuss the limitations of this experiment a bit more or if they have a way to alter the expression pattern, include that data.</p><p>2. The conclusion that &quot;changes to invagination pit size or position... perturb final organ shape.&quot;: To test this, the authors overexpress Fog, which is expected to overactivate contractility at center of the invagination in addition to changing its pattern. The authors did not distinguish between or characterize possible effects of excessive contractility in central cells and expansion of the domain size. For example, how much is contractility being elevated in pit cells.</p><p>3. Figure 6: Fog concentration clearly is anti-correlated with apical constriction, but it is not clear if this is cause or effect. For an apically secreted protein it is possible that apical constriction concentrates apical vesicles that contain this protein, leading to greater intensity. Authors should determine if the accumulation pattern precedes apical constriction.</p><p>4. The authors use the terms &quot;near pit&quot; and &quot;far from pit&quot; consistently throughout the paper. However, the authors do not clearly define how these positions were determined. For example, in Figure 5 the line seems to be at 13.7uM, but Figure 6 has it at slightly less than 13.7uM. The line should be defined in the text and made consistent in the figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72369.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion that the pattern of Hkb expression regulates radial cell behaviors is based on analyzing a loss-of-function mutant in hkb, rather than altering its expression pattern.

As we show, both Hkb and Fkh expressed first at the position where the future invagination point will form, and both are required for the early constriction at this position. In fkh<sup>-/-</sup> no invagination occurs (Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018), and in hkb<sup>-/-</sup> a central invagination forms as shown here. We do not claim at all that it is Huckebein alone that drives the radial patterning of behaviours, only that is plays an important part in the patterning, and its loss leads to an interesting phenotype that helped us dissect how behaviours are governed.</p><p>So although we agree that overexpression of Hkb could lead to interesting effects, this is by no means guaranteed as it is not the only factor affecting patterning and invagination.</p><p>Furthermore, such overexpression experiments are unfortunately limited by the available tools. Firstly, using the UAS/Gal4 ectopic expression system, the only drivers spatially intersecting the placode in parasegment 2 of the embryo are wg-Gal4, leading to a stripe/patch of expression that unfortunately mostly covers the region where the invagination pit will form, and is thus not of use for ectopic Hkb/Fkh expression as these are already highly expressed in this region from early on. The other driver is en-Gal4 that leads to expression in a stripe at the anterior margin of the placode. In our experience, this driver in the placode only induces higher expression levels once the invagination has started, so the domain of endogenous Fkh and Hkb expression and function will already have expanded. This leaves overexpression in the whole placode using fkhGal4.</p><p>With regards to Hkb overexpression, we have attempted this, but the available UAS-Hkb transgenic fly line we obtained does not seem to actually drive increased Hkb expression, so the genetic background might have changed or the transgene lost. We received this stock from different sources, but with no luck.</p><p>By contrast, overexpressoin of Fkh using fkhGal4 x UAS-Fkh leads to highly aberrantly-shaped glands at late stages with an enlarged lumen, and too many apically-constricted cells earlier on, this is now shown in Supplemental Figure 6_2. As we detail in the manuscript, the central placodal cells only require Fkh to drive apical constriction (and therefore in the hkb<sup>-/-</sup> these cells will constrict once Fkh is expressed here), and so early homogeneous expression of Fkh leads to a larger area of apical constriction similar to what we observed when Fog is overexpressed, again confirming that the ordered internalisation of cells in defined coronae allows the formation of the narrow symmetrical tube of the final organ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusion that &quot;changes to invagination pit size or position... perturb final organ shape.&quot;, is based on Fog overexpression driven by Fkh-Gal4. Since Fkh is what the authors propose to drive Fog expression in the proper pattern, it is important to show how endogenous Fog expression compares to Fog driven by Fkh-Gal4. Moreover, Fog overexpression is expected to overactivate contractility at center of the invagination in addition to changing its pattern. The authors should attempt to distinguish between effects of excessive contractility in central cells and expansion of the domain size.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and are happy to provide clarification.</p><p>The conclusion cited above is based on both the overexpression of Fog across the whole placode as well as the hkb<sup>-/-</sup> mutant phenotype, so not only on an overexpression experiment. However, we agree that identifying whether Fog is actually ectopically or at higher level expressed in fkhGal4 x UAS-Fog embryos is important.</p><p>The overexpression using the fkhGal4 driver requires a further explanation: fkhGal4 is using a 1kb promoter fragment of the fkh locus to drive overexpression. This fragment has previously been shown to be responsible for salivary gland specific expression of Fkh (Zhou, Bagri and Beckendorf, 2001, Dev.Biol., doi:10.1006/dbio.2001.0367), but represents only 10% of the so far identified regulatory regions of the fkh locus. Thus, expression driven by fkhGal4, though mostly specific to the salivary gland placode, does not mimic endogenous Fkh expression in pattern or timing. To illustrate this, we include a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> to show srcGFP expression driven by fkhGal4 in comparison to antibody labeling for endogenous Fkh protein (with the one caveat that GFP folding an maturation most likely underestimates timing of expression of other factors using fkhGal4). fkhGal4 driven GFP expression starts off at mid stage 10 in a few central cells (A-B’’) but very quickly most placodal cells show very high levels of expression (C-D’’’); note that this is already at late stage 10, prior to any commencement of tissue bending (as can be seen in cross sections in C’’’ and D’’’).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of endogenous Fkh protein and expression of transgenes via fkhGal4.</title><p>A-B’’ At mid stage 10, endogenous Fkh protein, revealed using an antibody against Fkh (red), is already spreading across the placode from the initial expression at the forming pit position (asterisks in all panels mark the position of the future pit). At this stage, a srcGFP transgene (green) expressed under fkhGal4 control can be clearly identified to begin to be expressed in central cells of the placode at varying levels. C-D’’’ At late stage 10, when endogenous Fkh protein (red) is seen in all secretory placodal cells but constriction near the forming invagination point is only just beginning and there is no tissue bending yet (see cross section panels in C’’’ and D’’’), srcGFP expression (green) driven by fkhGal4 is very strong in nearly all placodal cells, with only slightly lower levels in the most anterior cells. Note that the laser power used to reveal GFP was about 5 times higher for panels A-B’’ compared to panels C-D’’’. Cell outlines are marked by an antibody against junctional phosphotyrosine (PY20; blue).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72369-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In embryos that overexpress Fog (UAS-Fog) driven by fkhGal4, we have now stained with anti-Fog antibody and include this information as Supplemental Figure 6_1. In wild-type embryos we have shown and quantified in the manuscript (Figure 6) that Fog expression begins near the future pit site and then expands across the placode, correlating positively with average medial myosin II intensity and negatively with apical cell area. In contrast, when Fog is overexpressed already at late stage 10 (panels B-C’’ Supplemental Figure 6_1) Fog protein levels across the placode are very high and fairly homogeneous (similar to srcGFP in panels C-D’’’). Surface views and especially cross sections show that Fog antibody labeling is punctate throughout the more apical part of the cytoplasm, most likely corresponding to Fog-containing vesicles about to be secreted apically. Similar vesicles are also observed in the wild-type, but here only strongly at early stage 11 close to the forming invagination pit (A-A’’ Supplemental Figure 6_1).</p><p>Therefore, we conclude that the increased domain size of Fog expression most likely drives apical constriction in a larger number of cells and at an earlier timepoint than in the wild-type.</p><p>With respect to an increase in myosin activity itself, because many cells start bending the tissue and invaginate at the same time when Fog is overexpressed (in UAS-Fog x fkhGal4), segmentation of movies beyond the initial timepoints is near impossible. Hence the best proxy for changes in contractility is the intensity of apical-medial myosin. We have now quantified medial myosin intensity in embryos overexpressing UAS-Fog under fkhGal4 control in comparison to control embryos. We express this as the ratio of medial myosin to junctional myosin intensity to account for the fact that control embryos carry two copies of the sqhGFP transgene whereas fkhGal4 x UAS-Fog embryos only carry one copy (due to the combination of chromosomes required for the cross). This analysis showed that fkhGal4 x UAS-Fog cells in the placode show an 50% increase in medial myosin intensity. This is now included in Supplemental Figure 6_1 (as panel E) and discussed in the results. This increase could suggest stronger contractility, but as also many more cells constrict and internalise it is impossible to disentangle whether the aberrant process of invagination is mostly due to the change in cell number constricting or in addition also any change in strength of the constrictions. In terms of our theoretical considerations, overexpression of Fog clearly leads to an enlarged pit invaginating with a resultant aberrant and inflated lumen shape of the tubular organ. A detailed time-resolved and quantitative analysis of the Fog-overexpression phenotype would be interesting but due to the complex curvature of the forming enlarged pit is currently not possible with our existing methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To unambiguously demonstrate that cells far from the pit move toward the pit and then change behavior to apical constriction, a cell tracking analysis should accompany Figure 1, so that the reader can clearly identify that the same cells have moved and changed shape over time.</p></disp-quote><p>The tracking of all segmented placodal cells is inherent in our quantitative analysis, but was not explicitly shown, though in the original version of the manuscript it was shown implicitly in plots such as the now panel Figure 1E, Figure 4A-B’’. As we discuss below in response to Reviewer 1, point 1, cells are defined as near the pit and far from the pit based on their placodal position at t = 0 min and defined from our previous studies (Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018). Therefore, cells ‘far from the pit’ beyond t = +20min are now all in very close proximity to the pit and are contracting. This is also shown in the strain rate analysis in Figure 4, where in panels B and B’ the solid green line is showing cumulative cell shape change and is tracking at a value of just above zero (for radial change, B) or below zero (for circumferential change, B’) until t = +20 min, when the rate of constriction increases drastically for the originally ‘far from the pit’ cells.</p><p>But we agree that it is important to show this behaviour and change in a more intuitive way and have therefore changed Figure 1 accordingly:</p><p>Panels B-D now show all placodal cells and only the cells defined as near and far from the pit (defined at t = 0 min) until all cells are internalised. B shows these identities and highlights four individual examples. C and D show the apical area of near and far from the pit cells, respectively, clearly visualising that only cells in a position of proximity to the pit are actively constricting.</p><p>Panel E, as before, shows the cumulative apical area change of cells defined as near to or far from the pit (defined at t = 0 min), illustrating in the grey highlighted part of the solid curve that cells that were far from the pit do not change apical area until about t = +20min when also these cells, that are now in close proximity to the pit, constrict as shown in D.</p><p>New panels in F show the evolution of the apical area size for the four example cells highlighted in B. This clearly shows that the two cells originally ‘near the pit’ rapidly constrict their apical area whereas the two cells originally ‘far from the pit’ do not change their area initially but then switch to a fast contraction mode after t = +18’ 21’’. For the blue ‘far from pit’ cell in F, the panels in G show its involvement in a cell intercalation event, a rosette formation and resolution, that leads to the overall contraction of the area covered by this group of cells in the circumferential direction and expansion in the radial direction (as the strain rates in Figure 4 also show).</p><p>We hope that these additions make the cell behaviours and changes therein clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In general, the manuscript is quite densely written and one can easily get lost in the descriptions. The authors should simplify the description of their results, emphasizing the most important take home points. A short and simple conclusion should be drawn at the end of each Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively rewritten the manuscript with this in mind and hope the revised version is less dense and clearer, though we posit that quantitative analysis of complex processes requires accurate description, and we don’t want to lose accuracy in favour of simplicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. To unambiguously demonstrate that cells far from the pit move toward the pit and then change behavior to apical constriction, a cell tracking analysis should accompany Figure 1, so that the reader can clearly identify that the same cells have moved and changed shape over time.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our detailed response above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A more detailed discussion of the timing of events should accompany the authors overall model that dynamic patterns of Fkh and Hkb expression regulate the pattern of Fog/myosin dynamics. Specifically, it appears that Fog expression, myosin localization, and apical constriction correlate both in space and time across the placode, whereas Fkh and Hkb expression patterns are offset by ~30-60 min. Considering the time it takes for transcription, translation, and secretion of Fog, the authors should discuss whether the timing of events are consistent with their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are important considerations. We have previously analysed the literature for educated estimates of the rates that will affect the delay between transcription factor (Hkb, Fkh) activity in the nucleus and Fog secretion/binding to the GPCR followed by the downstream signalling cascade leading to myosin phosphorylation. We describe our estimations here and have also added this to the manuscript (lines 414-418):</p><p>“Estimates from mammalian cells as well as direct measurements in <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytial embryos put the rate of transcription in the range of 1-2min/kb (Shamir et al., 2016, Cell 164:1302; Garcia et al., 2013, Current Biology 23:2140-2145). Translation is estimated to take about 10aa/s (about 1 min/300aa protein), with protein folding occurring co-translationally and in the order of ms-min (Shamir et al., 2016, Cell 164:1302). Secretion/movement through the secretory pathway again on average takes in the order of minutes, though this of course depends on the cargo. Once bound to the receptor, the signalling cascade leading to myosin phosphorylation should occur in the region of seconds. Hence, a delay of 30-60 min appears very compatible with Fkh and Hkb activity leading to fog transcription, translation, folding, secretion, binding to the receptor followed by signalling to drive myosin phosphorylation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points</p><p>1. How are 'near the pit' and 'far from the pit' cells selected and defined? This should be explained in the main text or legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry if this was not well enough explained. As discussed above, we have now added the below definition to the main text as well as the legend in the modified Figure 1:</p><p>“As calculated previously (Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018), we employ a radial coordinate system centred at the invagination point at t = 0 min. We specify the ‘near to the pit’ region as the region located between the invagination point and up to 33% of the distance between the invagination point and the far edge of the placode (with this region usually being within 13.7 +/- 3 µm of the pit), and with the rest of the cells defined as ‘far from the pit’.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have now defined this in all relevant figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2E. I'm a little confused how the medial myosin cycle is defined. Looking at the data from figure 2D, it looks like medial myosin peaks only once (green boxes) over the time course. Or is this because data in Figure 2D are averaged across all cells in the radial stripe, so the cycles are obscured? Also, if cells far from the pit lack medial myosin, what is being quantified for cells far from the pit in 2E and F (and also 2G and H?)?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2E the average myosin cycle length for a cell in a given position at a given time is plotted as all cells go through many cycles. And yes, in Figure 2D, the reviewer is right in that these are data from all cells in that stripe pooled, quantifying the average medial myosin intensity, hence revealing the overall stronger apical-medial myosin intensity in the position near the pit. Figure 2D does not take into account individual cycles (which are presented in Figure 2 E-G). This type of analysis has been used by us and others in the past (Blanchard et al., 2010, Development; Fischer et al. 2014 PLoS One; Booth et al., 2014, Dev Cell; Machado et al., 2015, BMC Biol).</p><p>With regards to medial myosin intensity and fluctuations in ‘near the pit’ and ‘far from the pit’ cells (as defined at t = 0min), this split used for part of the analysis into two groups is of course to some extent arbitrary as biologically there is no such sharp divide, but as our analysis here shows it is a gradation. The splitting into two groups with predominant feature and behaviours that differ allows a meaningful quantitative analysis especially for the strain rate calculations. Splitting the cells into more groups (of biologically probably more meaningful shared characteristic and behaviours) will reduce the number of cells that we are able to track and analyse to an extent that will make statistical analyses impossible. Hence, there are always some cells included in the ‘far from pit’ group even at early time points that will show some medial myosin intensity and fluctuations. But as panel 3D-G show these cells show reduced intensity, longer cycle length and hence lower medial myosin strength and do not yet drive apical constriction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 4 was overall very hard to follow. I suggest moving A' and B' panels to the left so it is clear that A panels refer to cells near the pit and B panels away from the pit. Also, I think circumferential vs radial behaviors need to be clearly defined in the text, labeled on the figure (I appreciate the schematics, but I wasn't sure which was radial and which was circumferential until panel C), and discussed separately in the text. For panels K and L, a comparison to WT intercalation is needed to appreciate the defect in Hkb-/-.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry that this Figure was confusing and in the revised version have tried to make it more intuitively accessible.</p><p>By way of explanation, though, the strain rate analyses in A-B’’ are different to the analyses of individual cell behaviours in panels C onwards. For the strain rate analysis, as detailed in the Methods section ‘Morphogenetic strain rate analysis’, small domains of cells are analysed to capture the net effects of tissue shape changes as well as cell shape changes and the calculated intercalation rates. These changes are by definition always expressed as a strain rate along the orientation of the greatest absolute strain, with a second strain rate perpendicular to this. Because of the circular tissue geometry and focussed invagination point of the placode, any strain rates are then projected onto the radial coordinate system we use. This is the basis for the two components to any strain rate analysed and depicted in Figure 4, each strain has a circumferential and a perpendicular radial contribution. For analysing morphogenesis in other tissues, such analysis has used two perpendicular components of strain oriented along embryonic axes.</p><p>We have made sure to cite our initial analysis (Sanchez-Corrales, 2018) that has a detailed visual explanation of the strain rate analyses in Figure 2 A-B.</p><p>The oriented behaviours schematised and quantified in C-E due to the circularity and inherent biology of the tissue follow the same orientations of circumferential and radial, but these quantifications are based on individual events and individual cell junctions and how they evolve over time, rather than small domains of cells.</p><p>With regards to changes in the figure and manuscript, as suggested we have moved the explanatory panels to the start of the figure (now panels A and B), and we have added the words ‘radial’ and ‘circumferential’ to the small diagrams within the graphs in A’, A’’, B’, B’’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Figure 6. Several image panels (but not all) show paired gland placodes in more zoomed out images compared to previous figures. To be consistent with prior figures, I suggest cropping the images to show individual placodes in panels D-I and M-O.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted this and now just show a single placode as in all other panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 7. Fkh-Gal4 is used to overexpress Fog in an aberrant pattern. But since Fkh is what the authors propose to drive Fog expression in the proper pattern, it is important to show how endogenous Fog expression compares to Fog driven by Fkh-Gal4.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our detailed response to the editor’s comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 7. Please show paired panels for WT and UAS-Fog x Fkh-Gal4 with the same markers for D-H. For example, Crumbs is shown for the WT but membranes are shown for Fog overexpression. Also stages 12 and 13 are shown for Fog overexpression but not for WT.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated and changed panels in Figure 7, we now show the same membrane marker in comparable samples for wt and UAS-Fog, and show matched images for the different stages shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 7P compares experimental observations to the in silico model. Why are there only two coronae measured for the UAS-Fog condition, and 6-7 coronae for WT and Hkb-/-?</p></disp-quote><p>Because due to the large number of cells invaginating in the UAS-Fog x fkhGal4, nearly all secretory cells are internalised in these two coronae, any remaining cells are impossible to track and segment with our current methods due to the strong curvature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. L 208. &quot;hkb-/- mutants show a delayed symmetrical apical constriction&quot;. This part in particular should be reformulated to make it easier to digest. Maybe separating the apical constriction part from the intercalation part could make it easier. The title is not taking into account the whole analysis of cell intercalation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this section extensively to make it easier to understand. We have also split the section in two with new subheading, so the strain rate analysis and description of Figure 4 is separated from the discussion of data in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. L257-293. A short summary of the main observations described in this paragraph is missing at the end. This description for example &quot;in the hkb-/- mutants cells specified at t = 0 min to be near the coordinates of the later position of central apical constriction&quot; (L 272) is quite complicated and it took me a while to understand. The analysis of cell shape, tissue strain, and individual cell intercalation behavior is a little complex to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see comment above that also applies to this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. L440. &quot;Hence the expansion of Fkh protein to the center of the placode in the hkb-/- mutants might be the cause of the delayed constriction of cells here, whereas the earlier initial constriction at the site of the eccentric pit was absent in the mutant because it requires both Fkh and Hkb.&quot; I do not follow the idea here. I cannot see any change in the expression pattern of Fkh at any stage (as mentioned in the text), so how this can unchanged pattern could explain the delay observed in Hbk mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above:</p><p>We conclude from our data that the initial constriction at the eccentric position where the pit forms depends on both Fkh and Hkb. In the hkb<sup>-/-</sup> mutant the central cells in the placode manage to constrict in the absence of Hkb likely only require Fkh activity to initiate Fog expression and function (and hence constriction). These cells therefore undergo their normal apical constriction once Fkh expression has reached the central position (as Fkh expression is unaffected in the hkb<sup>-/-</sup> mutant as we show). As they now are the first cells to constrict and invaginate, the hkb<sup>-/-</sup> mutants show a central and delayed constriction and invagination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors state in the abstract that &quot;early transcriptional patterning of key morphogenetic transcription factors drives the selective activation of downstream morphogenetic modules, such as... that activates actomyosin activity&quot;. To support their claim the authors analyze transcription factor mutants, such as hkb-/-, which disrupts the pattern. However, complete loss of a transcription factor is likely to affect many cellular processes (i.e. not just actomyosin). There is no experiment that alters the pattern of gene expression in the domain (other than loss of the whole factor). The authors should discuss the limitations of this experiment a bit more or if they have a way to alter the expression pattern, include that data.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our detailed response to the editor’s question (1) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The conclusion that &quot;changes to invagination pit size or position... perturb final organ shape.&quot;: To test this, the authors overexpress Fog, which is expected to overactivate contractility at center of the invagination in addition to changing its pattern. The authors did not distinguish between or characterize possible effects of excessive contractility in central cells and expansion of the domain size. For example, how much is contractility being elevated in pit cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our detailed response to the editor’s question (2) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 6: Fog concentration clearly is anti-correlated with apical constriction, but it is not clear if this is cause or effect. For an apically secreted protein it is possible that apical constriction concentrates apical vesicles that contain this protein, leading to greater intensity. Authors should determine if the accumulation pattern precedes apical constriction.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the reviewer means that Fog concentration is anti-correlated with apical area (not apical constriction).</p><p>At earliest stages analysed by us, and an example is shown in Figure 6A-C, Fog intensity is already higher in a small group of cells at the position where the pit will form, but there is not yet any concentrated constriction of cells here yet. Thus, we would conclude that Fog increase precedes constriction.</p><p>The same can in fact be seen in the overexpression of Fog, using UAS-Fog x fkhGal4 (Supplemental Figure 6_1 B-B’’) where ectopic Fog protein levels are very high (compared to what the wild-type would show at this stage) but cells have not overconstricted yet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors use the terms &quot;near pit&quot; and &quot;far from pit&quot; consistently throughout the paper. However, the authors do not clearly define how these positions were determined. For example, in Figure 5 the line seems to be at 13.7uM, but Figure 6 has it at slightly less than 13.7uM. The line should be defined in the text and made consistent in the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above: we have now added an explicit definition of the terms to the results and the methods section.</p><p>With regards to the discrepancy between Figure 5 and 6 (i.e. where the dotted line in the graphs is place), this seems to be a mistake in assembling the panel in Figure 6. We thank the reviewer for noticing this and pointing it out!</p></body></sub-article></article>
