As a barrier organ, which is constantly exposed to environmental pathogens, the tongue is expected to host an immune cell network ensuring local immune defence. However, the composition and the transcriptional landscape of the tongue immune system are currently not completely defined. Here, we characterised the tissue-resident immune compartment of the murine tongue during development, health and disease, combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with in situ immunophenotyping. We identified distinct local immune cell populations and described two specific subsets of tongue-resident macrophages occupying discrete anatomical niches. <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup>+</sup> macrophages were located specifically in the highly innervated lamina propria beneath the tongue epidermis and at times in close proximity to fungiform papillae. <italic>Folr2</italic><sup>+</sup> macrophages were detected in deeper muscular tissue. In silico analysis indicated that the two macrophage subsets originate from a common proliferative precursor during early postnatal development and responded differently to systemic LPS in vivo. Our description of the under-investigated tongue immune system sets a starting point to facilitate research on tongue immune-physiology and pathology including cancer and taste disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Tongue</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>single cell sequencing</kwd><kwd>cell development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MI1328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mildner</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KL 2963/5-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Christoph SN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERCEA 803087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Christoph SN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KL 2963/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Christoph SN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KL 2963/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klose</surname><given-names>Christoph SN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The tongue is a unique barrier organ, which is constantly exposed to environmental pathogens, and therefore is expected to host an immune cell network ensuring local immune defence, which we characterised during development, health, and disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tongue is a highly innervated muscular organ with functions in articulation, mastication, and taste perception. Located at the entrance of the gastrointestinal tract, the tongue is constantly exposed to dietary and airborne antigens and therefore acts as a first-line immune organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu, 2021</xref>). Moreover, taste sensation plays a critical role in avoidance of spoiled food and beverages. Accordingly, a tongue-resident immune network would be expected with roles in immune defense, tissue remodeling and tongue homeostasis. However, in the immunological context, the tongue is an understudied organ and the composition of tongue immune cells and their transcriptional status is largely unknown. Here, we define the immune cell landscape of the tongue with a specific focus on mononuclear phagocytes, for example, tissue-resident macrophages (TRM).</p><p>Until now, the characterization of the mononuclear phagocyte compartment of the tongue mainly focused on Langerhans cells that were first described in the mouse epithelium 40 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhardt et al., 1979</xref>) and are identified in humans by their exclusive CD1a immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darling et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruchley et al., 1989</xref>). The characterization of sub-epithelial macrophage subsets is much more enigmatic and so far depended on the histological examination of a few membrane markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarbati et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shigeoka et al., 2021</xref>). For example, human CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages can be found in subepithelial areas of the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shigeoka et al., 2021</xref>), a localization that they share with CD11c<sup>+</sup> ‘dendritic’ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2009</xref>). Relying on single markers such as CD11c to identify cells of the ‘dendritic’ cell lineage is problematic since various additional cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes, can express CD11c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merad et al., 2013</xref>). Besides histological examinations of mononuclear phagocytes in the healthy tongue, the macrophage involvement in various pathological settings has also been studied. Tongue Langerhans cells were for instance shown to be critically involved in IL17-dependent antifungal immunity in the oral mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sparber et al., 2018</xref>), play an important role in T cell priming during squamous cell carcinoma development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saba et al., 2022</xref>) and are depleted in patients with advanced-stage acquired immune deficiency syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gondak et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, an increase of activated ED1<sup>+</sup> tongue macrophages was observed in systemic inflammation in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavallin and McCluskey, 2005</xref>). The recent COVID-19 pandemic has also suggested a potential link of viral infections with tongue immunity, with loss of taste being one of the hallmark symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agyeman et al., 2020</xref>). However, the lack of knowledge of the tongue immune cell compartment in physiology, hampers our understanding of tongue immune responses following pathogen challenge. Therefore, an unbiased characterization of the tongue immune cells is critical to classify and evaluate tissue-resident cell subsets, for example, macrophage dynamics during tongue development and pathologies.</p><p>To this end, we profiled the tongue-resident CD45<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic cell compartment by single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Amongst tongue innate lymphoid cells (ILC), for example, ILC2, and the specific presence of mast cells in early postnatal tongues, we further identified two main <italic>Irf8</italic>-independent macrophage populations, which were characterized by <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> and <italic>Folr2</italic> expression, respectively. <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-expressing macrophages were specifically enriched in the lamina propria of the tongue and were detected in fungiform papillae, which harbor taste buds, but were absent from the epidermis. <italic>Folr2</italic>-expressing tongue macrophages localized in muscular tissue and in the lamina propria. These anatomical niches were colonized during embryonic and early postnatal development from a <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-expressing precursor of high proliferation capacity. Both macrophage populations showed a robust inflammatory response after in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, including shared and unique pathways.</p><p>In summary, our data provide a detailed atlas of the immune cells of the tongue that will facilitate future research of this under-investigated barrier organ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of murine tongue hematopoietic cells</title><p>To examine the tissue-resident immune compartment of the tongue in an unbiased manner, we performed scRNA-seq of FACS-purified CD45<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic tongue cells isolated from PBS-perfused adult wild-type C57BL/6 mice.

The observed differences in the homeostatic inflammatory signature between tCX3CR1-MF and tFOLR2-MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>) led us to hypothesize that these cells might respond differently in inflammation. It has already been shown that a systemic inflammatory stimulus, such as the intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can lead to increased expression of TNFa in type II taste cells and thereby attenuates taste bud cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohn et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore tested the inflammatory response of tongue immune cells to systemic LPS.

As mentioned above, tongue macrophages did not express <italic>Lyve1</italic> during development and the FOLR2 antibody used for FACS did not work for immunohistochemical staining of the tissue. We thus relied on <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-GFP as a marker of macrophages. Tissue sections were counterstained with antibodies against CD31 to identify blood vessels, and, since various nerves (e.g. VII<sup>th</sup>, IX<sup>th</sup> and X<sup>th</sup> cranial nerve ganglia) innervate the tongue tissue during embryogenesis, we also stained tissue sections for anti-beta Tubulin III (TUJ1) to visualize neurons.

However, it is not clear from our histological data whether this reflects a sequential developmental maturation of macrophages or rather a progressive exchange of embryonic populations with adult, bone marrow-derived monocytes.</p><p>To gain further insight into this question, we investigated the tongue immune compartment from mice at post-natal day 3 (p3) with scRNA-seq. We chose p3 since it is the stage at which we could first identify <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-GFP<sup>int</sup>FOLR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We sequenced 13,898 cells (from a pool of n=7 mice) and overlaid the data on the scRNA-seq data derived from adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). All adult tongue immune cell populations were also present at p3, however, we noticed major differences in the frequency of several populations. Notably, p3 tongues harbored more mast cells (clusters 11 &amp; 13) and fewer <italic>Fn1</italic>+ myeloid cells (cluster 6) than adult tongues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). We also detected a newly appearing cluster of cells in p3 tongues (cluster 2), which was almost absent in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). These cluster 2 cells expressed high levels of proliferation-related genes, including <italic>Top2a</italic>, <italic>Ccnb2</italic>, <italic>Mki67</italic>, and further showed expression of typical macrophage lineage genes such as <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>, <italic>Tlr4</italic>, <italic>Pf4,</italic> and <italic>Lyve1</italic>, which suggests they represent proliferating macrophage precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Indeed, when the UMAP is projected in 3D, cluster 2 cells seemed to incorporate into tFOLR2-MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). To investigate the connection of cluster 2 precursors with tongue macrophages we used Slingshot, which models developmental trajectories in scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Street et al., 2018</xref>). Slingshot analysis revealed a possible bifurcation of the precursor cells at the cluster 1 level at which trajectories either split into cluster 0 or cluster 5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), which might indicate that both tFOLR2-MF and tCX3CR1-MF populations derive from a common precursor. To better understand the differences of tFOLR2-MF and tCX3CR1-MF cells at the p3 and adult state, we compared their expression profiles and performed GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both tongue macrophage subsets showed in general an increased proliferative gene program at early postnatal stages, while functional biological processes such as ‘positive regulation of angiogenesis’ and ‘cellular response to growth factor stimulus’ increased in adult tFOLR2-MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). tCX3CR1-MF on the other hand established a gene program that comprises ‘antigen processing’ and ‘defense response to virus’ during adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>), which indicates that the functional adaption to the niche likely takes place late during development. When we used latent time analysis to reconstruct the possible maturation of tongue macrophages, we detected a general down-regulation of MHC-related genes as tFOLR2-MF mature, which was accompanied by an increased expression of genes with STAT3 binding motif, while no clear maturation program could be detected in tCX3CR1-MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Transcriptomic analysis of hematopoietic tongue cells from newborn mice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) CD45<sup>+</sup> tongue leukocytes were isolated by FACS from newborn p3 mice.

In light of the emerging role of different immune cells such as ILCs, regulatory T cells or macrophages in tissue remodeling, nerve surveillance and homeostatic tissue organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monticelli et al., 2011</xref>), we characterized the mouse tongue-resident immune cell compartment under physiological conditions. We confirmed the existence of tLCs, cDCs, and Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes in the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sparber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tanaka et al., 2016</xref>) and additionally identified two new subsets of tongue-resident macrophages, one of which was characterized by <italic>Folr2</italic> and <italic>Lyve1</italic> expression, while the other subset expressed high levels of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>, MHCII-related genes and <italic>Itgax</italic> (encoding CD11c). The phenotype of these two tongue macrophage populations is reminiscent of the two recently defined interstitial macrophage populations which are present across various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakarov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dick et al., 2022</xref>). In agreement with this, our bulk RNA-seq analysis revealed greater transcriptional similarities of tongue macrophages with interstitial heart macrophages, for example, than with TRMs such as Langerhans cells or microglia.</p><p>Chakarov et al., further described an association of <italic>Lyve1</italic><sup>+</sup> macrophages with blood vessels and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup>+</sup> macrophages with nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakarov et al., 2019</xref>). In the adult tongue, tFOLR2-MF were distributed across both the lamina propria and the deep muscle of the tongue, but were absent from the epithelium. We could also observe the association of tFOLR2-MF to CD31<sup>+</sup> blood vessels. On the other hand, tCX3CR1-MF are largely restricted to the highly innervated lamina propria and along the fibers of the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve. In addition, rare clusters of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup>+</sup> macrophages could also be detected in innervated posterioir areas of the tongue. It is therefore quite likely that the previously characterized CD11c<sup>+</sup> ‘dendritic cells’ in the lamina propria of the human and mouse tongues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mascarell et al., 2009</xref>) correspond to the cells described here as tCX3CR1-MF. Our observation that tCX3CR1-MF acquire their disctinct localization post-natally and gradually might suggest that changes in the oral microbiota contribute to the development and alignment of tCX3CR1-MF in the lamina propria, which coincidences with lactation and weaning. Indeed, it was previously shown that local microbiota has a major impact on the development of mucosal LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capucha et al., 2018</xref>) and this might also be the case for tongue resident macrophage populations.</p><p>The proximity of tCX3CR1-MF to nerves raises the question of whether they perform specific nerve-associated functions. In the skin, large, peripheral nerve-associated <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup>+</sup> macrophages were recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolter et al., 2019</xref>) that were involved in the maintenance of myelin sheath integrity and axon sprouting after injury and had a transcriptional signature related to nervous system functions. This particular signature was absent from tCX3CR1-MF, although tCX3CR1-MF did express some genes that are enriched in microglia (for example, <italic>Hexb</italic>, <italic>Apoe</italic>) that also reside in close proximity to neurons. Various cranial nerve ganglia innervate the tongue tissue during embryogenesis and axons are guided by multiple chemoattractive factors to the tongue epithelium such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). It is known that microglia-derived BDNF plays an important role in synapse formation and plasticity in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore possible that the subsequent postnatal maturation of taste receptor cells and the synaptic interconnectivity with neurons might be influenced by tCX3CR1-MF. The interesting topic of whether and how macrophages interact with nerves in the tongue needs further investigation.</p><p>It is also possible that tongue macrophages contribute directly or indirectly to instances of taste dysfunction. Various infections including Covid-19 or middle ear infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mahmoud et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gautier and Ravussin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michael and Raut, 2007</xref>), different medical treatment regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wickham et al., 1999</xref>) and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogawa et al., 2017</xref>) have all been associated with taste disruption. Taste bud maintenance relies on a continuous renewal of differentiated taste receptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roper and Chaudhari, 2017</xref>) and it has been shown that systemic inflammation like peripheral LPS injection increases TNFα and IL10 production by taste cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2014</xref>), inhibits taste progenitor cell proliferation and interferes with taste cell renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohn et al., 2010</xref>). Such a mechanism might explain taste disorders associated with infections in general. We showed that systemic inflammation also causes a direct response from tongue-resident macrophages. We did not investigate the precise contribution of inflammation to taste sensation, yet consider the possibility that tongue macrophages may release cytokines and potentially neurotoxic products that could cause nerve damage. The reverse has also been shown, that tissue macrophages can also mediate neuronal protection and therefore limit neuronal damage upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matheis et al., 2020</xref>). Whether and how the various tongue mononuclear phagocytes are involved in taste perception remains to be explored and could be of clinical relevance in conditions such as anorexia or cancer, where appetite- and weight-loss is often aggravated by taste-dysfunctions.</p><p>The question remains of the role of tongue immunity in cases where tongue homeostasis is disrupted. It was recently shown that tongue CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages infiltrate tumor tissue in squamous cell carcinoma at a high frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarbati et al., 2021</xref>). CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages were interpreted to be ‘M2 macrophages’, and increased infiltration correlated with worse outcomes compared to patients with a high infiltration of CD11c<sup>+</sup> ‘M1’ macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarbati et al., 2021</xref>). Regardless of whether the ‘M1/M2’ classification really applies to in vivo situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nahrendorf and Swirski, 2016</xref>), our data corroborate the notion of the existence of distinct subsets of tongue macrophages, which might respond differently to tumor-specific environmental cues.</p><p>In summary, we present a comprehensive catalog of immune cells in the murine tongue in physiological conditions and upon LPS-induced systemic inflammation. We identified two novel macrophage subsets in the tongue, namely tCX3CR1-MF and tFOLR2-MF, and place these findings in the context of mammalian macrophage biology. We hope that these data will encourage and support further investigations of the tongue as barrier and as an underrated immunological organ.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement, experimental reporting, and study design</title><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with national and international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (Tierschutzgesetz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, European directive 2010/63/EU, as well as GV-SOLAS and FELASA guidelines and recommendations for laboratory animal welfare).

All cells with more than 10% mitochondrial gene count were removed. For the number of detected genes, a sample specific filtering value was applied, for experiment 2 (10x Chromium v2) the accepted range was between 300 and 2000, for the remaining samples (10 x Chromium v3) a minimum of 500 was required while the maximum cutoff ranged from 5000 (experiment 1) over 5500 (experiment 3)–6000 (experiment 4). The data was normalized and the 4000 most valiable genes were selected. Subsequently, the data was analyzed together by applying Seurats integration function (FindIntegrationAnchors) and making use of the pre-computed anchors (FindIntegrationAnchors), that is genes used to map the cells from different samples. Analogously, experiment 5 (<italic>Irf8</italic>-deficient cells) and experiment 1 were integrated. For the IRF8 sample, the range of detected genes for included cells was set to 500–5500 and cells with more than 10% mitochondrial gene count were removed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Dimension Reduction, unsupervised clustering and marker detection</title><p>A principal component analysis provided the basis for the computation of a UMAP and an unsupervised clustering of the cells. The resolution parameter for FindClusters was set to 0.42 (0.25 for experiment 5). Conserved cluster markers for all samples were computed using FindConservedMarkers with the detection method set to 'MAST'. Genes differentially expressed between clusters of different samples were detected analogously using FindClusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Cell cluster annotation, trajectory inference, and signature enrichment</title><p>To assign cell types to the clusters identified, we applied SingleR (version 1.6.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aran et al., 2019</xref>), using the ImmGen database as annotation resource. Slingshot (version 2.0.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Street et al., 2018</xref>) was applied for trajectory inference. To this end, we provided slingshot with the newborn-specific cluster as starting point. To shed more light on the macrophagic versus dendritic nature of the cells in the central clusters, we computed the enrichment of macrophage-specific as well as dendritic gene sets by use of GSVA (version 1.40.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hänzelmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Software, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with national and international guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (Tierschutzgesetz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, European directive 2010/63/EU, as well as GV-SOLAS and FELASA guidelines and recommendations for laboratory animal welfare).

immunological organ, with a main focus on tissue-resident myeloid cells under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. They identify two major subsets of macrophages, which occupy distinct anatomical niches and develop from local precursors, while under immune compromised conditions they can also be replenished from circulating hematopoietic precursors. These findings provide an important basis for future investigations of the tongue immune function in the context of infection, inflammation, and neoplastic diseases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77490.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ginhoux</surname><given-names>Florent</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/036wvzt09</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap><country>Singapore</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.09.479699">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.09.479699v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The systemic LPS challenge should be better justified and explain why choosing an ip model of LPS administration with minor impact on studied populations. Flow cytometry of blood and tongue will strengthen the study as well as expand on the putative differential role of the two macrophage subsets in antimicrobial defence.</p><p>2) Provide fluorescence microscopy images around P10 will complement the study to follow the transition of CX3CR1+ cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have only a few recommendations:</p><p>Figure 2 (in connection with Figure 5): Cells of the FOLR2+ macrophage subset express various levels of CX3CR1 (monitored with the GFP reporter). As shown in Figure 5, the levels of CX3CR1 decrease over time. Do CX3CR1(hi) and CX3CR1(lo) FOLR2+ macrophages differ in expression of any of the markers tested by FACS and/or transcriptomics? Can any additional information be gained about the differentiation process of the cellular subset?</p><p>Figure 4: The authors assessed the response of the two macrophage subsets to systemic LPS challenge. Given the constant exposure of the tongue to commensal and pathogenic microbes (and viruses) in the oral cavity, it seems of higher importance to probe the reactivity of the studied macrophage subsets to oral microbes. While such experiments might go beyond the scope of the current study, the authors should at least consider expanding their discussion on the putative differential role of the two macrophage subsets in antimicrobial defence.</p><p>Figure 5c: fluorescence microscopy images are shown for E14, p0 and p3 (not for p10 as indicated in the text). Showing data for later time points (around p10 when CX3CR1+FOLR2+ cells start to lose CX3CR1 expression) would be of interest to follow how the transition of CX3CR1+ cells becoming restricted to the LP.</p><p>Figure 6e: The authors conclude from the developmental trajectory analysis that both terminally differentiated macrophage subsets (cluster 0 and 5) derive from a common precursor. However, the CX3CR1+ FOLR2- subset appears as early as E17.5 as a separate subset. Do the CX3CR1+ FOLR2- cells differ by any means between E17.5, p3 and adulthood (e.g. parameters analyzed by flow cytometry or genes analyzed by RNAseq)?

We identified a general down-regulation of MHC-related genes from immature to mature tFOLR2+ macrophages and an increased gene expression that show STAT3 binding motifs. A similar analysis was performed for the tCX3CR1-MF population, but we could not detect a developmental program in these cells (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2c+d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: The authors assessed the response of the two macrophage subsets to systemic LPS challenge.

We also agree that investigating the role of oral microbiota on the development of tongue immune cells would indeed be very interesting, especially since the maturation of these cells seems to coincide with lactation and weaning. Indeed, Caputcha et al<italic>.,</italic> 2018, revealed that local microbiota has a major impact on the development of mucosal LCs and this could also be the case for myeloid cells of the tongue. It would be interesting to investigate tongue immune cell development in germ-free mice, for example, but we do not currently have permission for such experiments as part of this study. We have added relevant discussion in the main text of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5c: fluorescence microscopy images are shown for E14, p0 and p3 (not for p10 as indicated in the text).

The strict arrangement of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup>Lyve1<sup>-</sup> cells in the lamina propria is therefore a feature of the adult, but not the developing tongue.

On the contrary and as mentioned correctly by the Reviewer, the <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup>Folr2<sup>-</sup> population is already present at E17.5 and is maintained through adulthood. As suggested by the Reviewer, we now compared the expression profile of p3 and adult tCX3CR1-MF to each other and now present this in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. We also discuss the microbiota as a possible factor that might influence the development of tongue macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Among the lymphoid populations, the authors detected Tregs, ILC2 and Rora+ T cells.

With this reclustering, T cells could further be separated into 11 distinct subsets in which we could identify ILCs, γδ T cells, central T cells but not Th17 cells. The new analysis of T cells is shown in new Figure 1b.</p></body></sub-article></article>
