strategies for navigating in various ecologies all over the world. Regardless of species, insects share the presence of a group of morphologically conserved neuropils known collectively as the central complex (CX). The CX is a navigational center, involved in sensory integration and coordinated motor activity. Despite the fact that our understanding of navigational behavior comes predominantly from ants and bees, most of what we know about the underlying neural circuitry of such behavior comes from work in fruit flies. Here, we aim to close this gap, by providing the first comprehensive map of all major columnar neurons and their projection patterns in the CX of a bee. We find numerous components of the circuit that appear to be highly conserved between the fly and the bee, but also highlight several key differences which are likely to have important functional ramifications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bumblebees forage widely for pollen and nectar from flowers, sometimes travelling kilometers away from their nest, but they can somehow always find their way home in a nearly straight line. These insects have been known to return to their nest from new locations almost 10 kilometers away. This homing ability is a complex neurological feat and requires the brain to combine several processes, including observing the external world, controlling bodily movements and drawing on memory.</p><p>While the navigational behavior of bees has been well-studied, the neuronal circuitry behind it has not. Unfortunately, most of what is known about insects’ brain activity comes from studies in species such as locusts or fruit flies. In these species, a region of the brain known as the central complex has been shown to have an essential role in homing behaviors. However, it is unknown how similar the central complex of bumblebees might be to fruit flies’ or locusts’, or how these differences may affect navigational abilities.</p><p>Sayre et al. obtained images of thin slices of the bumblebee central complex using a technique called block-face electron microscopy, which produces high-resolution image volumes. These images were used to obtain a three-dimensional map of over 1300 neurons. This cellular atlas showed that key aspects of the central complex are nearly identical between flies and bumblebees, including the internal compass that monitors what direction the insect is travelling in. However, hundreds of millions of years of independent evolution have resulted in some differences. These were found in neurons possibly involved in forming memories of the directions and lengths of travelled paths, and in the circuits that use such vector memories to steer the insects towards their targets. Sayre et al. propose that these changes underlie bees’ impressive ability to navigate.</p><p>These results help explain how the structure of insects’ brains can determine homing abilities. The insights gained could be used to develop efficient autonomous navigation systems, which are challenging to build and require a lot more processing power than offered by a small part of an insect brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bombus terrestris</kwd><kwd>central complex</kwd><kwd>navigation</kwd><kwd>insects</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>neuroanatomy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>714599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heinze</surname><given-names>Stanley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-04851 and 621-2012-2213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heinze</surname><given-names>Stanley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Templin</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Templin</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000181</institution-id><institution>Air Force Office of Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Templin</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001230</institution-id><institution>Macquarie University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>iMQRES 2019060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sayre</surname><given-names>Marcel Ethan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Serial-section electron microscopy uncovers the intricate neural network of the bumblebee central complex, revealing highly conserved projection patterns as well as novel circuit elements potentially unique to bees.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Honeybees and desert ants are iconic navigators (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collett, 2019</xref>). Honeybees can forage tens of kilometers away from their nest and can also communicate the distance and direction of foraging locations to fellow workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frisch, 1967</xref>). Desert ants forage hundreds of meters away from their nest in landscapes sometimes entirely bereft of visual landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wehner, 2020</xref>). Both insects preferentially make use of the most reliable visual cues, such as polarized skylight, but can also make use of an arsenal of backups to ensure a robust compass signal, including windflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Müller and Wehner, 2007</xref>) and magnetoreception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collett and Baron, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleischmann et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although their navigational behavior is less well characterized than that of honeybees and desert ants, bumblebees are also impressive foragers, as well as generally charismatic insects that play vital ecological roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goulson, 2003</xref>). Bumblebees forage hundreds to thousands of meters away from their nest and have been shown to be capable of homing from novel locations at distances up to 9.8 km (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goulson and Stout, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prŷs-Jones and Corbet, 2011</xref>). Like honeybees, bumblebees rely on celestial cues such as polarized light for homing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wellington, 1974</xref>) and have been shown to compensate for wind drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riley et al., 1999</xref>). Bumblebees also show a remarkable capacity to learn novel tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loukola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chittka, 2017</xref>).</p><p>While behaviorally, navigation and orientation are best understood in ants and bees, our understanding of how insect brains control navigation behavior has been largely obtained in a set of different species, most notably the desert locust <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic>, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and more recently, Monarch butterflies (<italic>Danaus plexippus</italic>) and dung beetles (<italic>Scarabaeus sp.</italic>; Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honkanen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turner-Evans and Jayaraman, 2016</xref>). Yet none of these species show the sophisticated homing behavior of hymenopteran insects and the question remains how these tiny brains enable such flexible and impressive navigational skills.</p><p>Work in other insects has revealed that one region of the insect brain lies at the heart of navigational control: the central complex (CX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honkanen et al., 2019</xref>). The CX is highly conserved across insects and plays important functional roles in multi-sensory integration, coordinated motor activity, and sleep. The CX receives external and internal sensory information that informs the insect about its visual environment, mechanosensory cues, and self-motion cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">el Jundi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okubo et al., 2020</xref>). CX cells use these cues to generate sensory maps that encode the heading direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heinze and Homberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Varga and Ritzmann, 2016</xref>) and traveling direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). The CX also likely compares current heading with a desired goal direction to generate appropriate motor commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). A function of the CX in the context of motor control has indeed been firmly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Across insects, the CX comprises four distinct neuropils (five in the fruit fly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>): the protocerebral bridge (PB), fan-shaped body (FB; also called the upper division of the central body; CBU), the ellipsoid body (EB; lower division of the central body; CBL), and the noduli (NO). These neuropils are highly interconnected by the arborizations of three classes of neurons. First, columnar cells are central to most computations carried out by the CX. They link the four adjacent CX neuropils and provide the basis for intrinsic computations, but also generate output to other brain areas. Input to the CX moves predominantly via the second class, tangential neurons, which connect many different brain regions to distinct compartments of the CX. The third class comprise pontine cells, including hΔ cells and, in flies, vΔ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). These are FB interneurons whose input and output processes are confined to the FB. For each class of cell, there exist numerous cell types, each of which is defined by their detailed morphology, polarity, and ultimately, by their connectivity to other neurons.</p><p>One of the keys to understanding how this brain region is involved in so many different processes, ranging from motor control, sensory encoding, to sleep control, is the tight relation between structure and function, facilitated by the almost crystalline anatomical layout of this brain area. This link has inspired much research on the CX, which has culminated in the recent release of the first ever comprehensive map of all CX neurons and their connectivity, achieved for the fruit fly CX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). Even in this previously highly studied and well-understood model organism, connectomics analysis revealed the presence of many new cell types and produced novel insights into neural pathways and computational circuit motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Yet, the question arises how much of this <italic>Drosophila</italic> connectomics data is representative for other species and how much of it is specific for the fruit fly and its ecology. Neuroanatomical and physiological work outside of the fruit fly has clearly revealed differences in the anatomy and physiology in the CX between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinze and Homberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El Jundi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hensgen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von Hadeln et al., 2020</xref>). However, the anatomical data from all species except the fruit fly is generally based on sparse labeling methods for identifying neurons, mostly intracellular dye injections and immunohistochemistry. While these methods yield beautiful morphological features of individual neurons, they are not comprehensive and often biased toward the largest neurons. Importantly, these studies will never be able to answer which neural elements are missing, no matter how many neurons are reported, and can neither provide definite data on cell quantities, projectivity motifs and connectivity.</p><p>To address this issue, a counterpart of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CX connectome will be needed. Obtaining similar data in a bee species will have the power to validate computational principles identified in the fly but also expand our understanding of how more complex behavioral abilities, that is, those not found in flies, are controlled by the CX.</p><p>Here, we provide the first step in such an endeavour by reporting the first comprehensive map of neural projections in the bumblebee CX (i.e. ‘projectome’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kasthuri and Lichtman, 2007</xref>). Using cellular resolution serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM), we traced the main neurites of all major CX columnar cells and FB interneurons, amounting to over 1300 neural skeletons. From these reconstructions, we established information about the numbers of cells, cell type identity and their projection patterns. Due to the tight structure function links in the CX, this detailed account of projection patterns yields a first approximation of the information flow principles in the bee CX. We additionally identified several cell types that may be unique to the bee, providing starting points for more detailed investigations. Most importantly, our findings highlight a conserved core circuitry of the CX and thus contribute to the notion that the CX contains an ancestral circuit, highly preserved across insects, but with additional layers or modifications adapted to species-specific ecologies and behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In total, we reconstructed more than 1300 columnar and hΔ neurons across three data sets from three individuals that varied in resolution (Figure 2a). The lowest resolution data set (126 nm) was used to trace the majority of all CX neurons. However, due to the relatively coarse resolution of 126 nm, we were not able to resolve cell types with main axon diameters of less than 0.6 µm, so that an unknown number of neuron types with small fiber diameters are missing from our analysis. This precluded tracing of most tangential cells, in particular in the EB, PB, and FB.</p><p>To aid our estimation of total cell quantities, we additionally traced two higher resolution data sets from different individual bees. These were both centered on the NO, with one containing within it a partial CX (100 nm resolution), while the second one covered a single nodulus (24 nm resolution; Figure 2a). Both of these data sets had already been used for the SBEM analyses presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>. Due to these additional higher resolution image stacks, the most detailed data are available for the NO. Additionally, we characterized CX neuropils using immunohistochemical staining and obtained full morphologies of certain individual neurons using intracellular dye injections.</p><p>Although our projectome analysis was limited to the large neurons with columnar arborizations, these reconstructions provide the most comprehensive neuroanatomical survey to date of CX cell types in any insect apart from the fruit fly.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>General structure of the bumblebee CX</title><p>As in other insects, the bumblebee CX spans the mid-line of the protocerebrum in the central brain and is composed of four adjacent neuropils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>), when labeled with antibodies against the presynaptic marker synapsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klagges et al., 1996</xref>).

Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies raised against serotonin (5HT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) revealed horizontal layering in the CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–e’’</xref>). In preparations labeled with anti-TH, at least three layers can be identified in the FB; one that contains very fine processes, another with blebbed fibers, and a third lacking any TH immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In samples stained against 5HT, a similar three-layer pattern emerged, containing zones with either fine branches, blebbed fibers, or no immunoreactivity at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The EB contained at least two layers, a dorsal layer filled with fibers from dopaminergic (TH) neurons and a ventral layer innervated by serotonergic processes.</p><p>To see how the observed layering in the CB corresponded across preparations and to electron microscopy data, whole brains stained with either TH or 5HT were imaged, manually segmented, and registered to the surface mesh of the 126 nm SBEM data set, which was used as reference volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d’,e’</xref>; see Materials and methods). The resulting registrations revealed at least four distinct layers in the FB, two of which were TH and 5HT immunoreactive (layers 1 and 3a; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d”,e”</xref>), one which was only occupied by TH fibers (layer 3b; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d”</xref>), and a fourth that appeared to only contain 5HT-positive processes (layer 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e’’</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the PB was devoid of both TH- and 5HT-positive processes and synapsin immunolabeling did not reveal any glomeruli-like structure as is the case in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>).

Their fibers extended ventrally to the PB where they branched to make contacts with their first synaptic partners. Following the PB, columnar cells fasciculated into prominent bundles. Eight in total, these bundles spanned the width of the CX and were bilaterally symmetric about the mid-line with four bundles in each hemisphere. The resulting formation was that of a chiasm, where neurons from a bundle in one hemisphere projected in the direction of the contralateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). From lateral to medial, these bundles are generally referred to as the W, X, Y, and Z bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams, 1975</xref>) and can be associated with either the right or left hemisphere with the addition of L or R abbreviation (i.e. RW or LZ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,h</xref>). In locusts and flies these bundles correspond to the developmental origin of a neuron from one of four neuroblasts on either side of the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyan and Reichert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyan et al., 2017</xref>), and therefore they served as our prime reference when describing columnar arborization patterns.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Columnar cell projection patterns in the bumblebee CX.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Views of the three SBEM data sets used in this study.

An exception to this rule was the layout of the innermost bundle (Z-bundle), in which traced neurons innervated three adjacent arborization domains in each hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Therefore, our data demonstrated that the bumblebee PB contains 18 columns (nine in each hemisphere), which are connected to nine corresponding columns in the CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). Columns in the PB were numbered L1/R1 to L9/R9 starting at the midline, while columns of the CB were numbered C1-C9 from right to left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Upon reaching the CB, columnar cells defasciculated from their bundle and branched into discrete zones, usually, but not always, within a well-defined column. Finally, except for one cell type discussed below, columnar cells projected further, linking the PB and CB with the NO or another tertiary neuropil outside of the CX.</p><p>We next determined the innervated columns for all neurons of a given bundle, i.e. all neurons in the identity-giving W, X, Y, and Z bundles. All columnar cells followed one of four projection patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref>). Columnar cell types that followed the ‘default’ projection pattern had no offset in the CB relative to the bundle they originate from. That is, neurons of the lateralmost PB-column (L9/R9) connected to the lateralmost CB column (CB1/CB9) and neurons from each of the following columns innervated a CB column shifted medially by one column. Thus, all neurons of one PB hemisphere projected to corresponding regions covering the entire width of the CB. Interestingly, neurons of the medial-most columns of the PB (L1/R1) are swapped between the hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), creating an interlocked layout of the neuronal systems that belong to either hemisphere.</p><p>Three alternative projection patterns were observed that could be derived from the described default pattern by shifting either the column of origin in the PB or by shifting the target projection in the CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref>). Cells which are ‘CB-shifted’ were shifted by one CB column in the direction of the contralateral hemisphere, whereas cells that are ‘PB-shifted’ were shifted by one PB column toward the ipsilateral hemisphere. Finally, cells labeled here as ‘both-shifted’ were shifted by one PB column in the direction of the contralateral hemisphere and one CB column in the ipsilateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). In these alternative projection patterns, neurons did not exist in all PB columns. Interestingly, while most neurons followed the default pattern, all cell types that projected to the NO were characterized by the CB-shifted pattern, while neurons that are likely to be main CX output neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref> followed a pattern with shifted PB innervation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Columnar cell types</title><p>We identified columnar cell types based on their projection fields within CX neuropils, their heterolateral projection patterns in the CB (i.e. the column they project to relative to the bundle they originate from), their neurite paths, their population size (number of cells per PB column), and by the tertiary neuropil they innervate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Unlike fly FBt-NO cells, these FB-NOc cells only arborize in a single nodulus contralateral to their cell body and have no overlap with any LNO cell. Further, at approximately 15–20 individuals per hemisphere, this single group of cells is more numerous than all NO-innervating FB tangential cells in the fly. Given their arborizations in the NO, the FB, and the SMP/CRE and their apparent uniqueness within the bee, they might play a role in either relaying stored vectors from long term memory to the CX (see main text), or in storing path integration vector memory directly. Their wide branching pattern across the FB is reminiscent of ring neurons in the EB, which, in the fly, reorganize their outputs onto EPG head direction cells via Hebbian like plasticity and synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Depending on the identity of the upstream and downstream partners, synaptic weights in the fan-like array of the FB-NOc neurons could be remodeled in a columnar manner, potentially serving as substrate for storing the path integration vector as a distribution of synaptic weights across the FB columns. Given the large number of these cells, several such distributions could be stored at any moment in time. A reward reinforcement signal from dopaminergic FBt neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>), for example in response to locating a food source, could trigger the transformation of a current path integration vector, for example stored in activity patterns of PFN or hΔ cells, into a synaptic weight distribution for long-term storage of the homing vector. (<bold>e</bold>) Reconstructions of other FBts. These cells differed from FB-NOc neurons and their morphology was more consistent with FB tangential neurons of the fly, as they possessed branches overlapping with LNO cells and likely send their fibers contralaterally, although this is difficult to determine with the limited field of view of our data set (asterisk).

Based on these analyses, the projections from tangential neurons delineated three domains in the bumblebee NO: the small unit (NOs), main unit (NOm), and the cap (NOc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f–g</xref>). These regions were supplied by distinct types of tangential cells. Two small types (LNO4 and LNO5) innervated specifically the NOs, while two larger neurons densely innervated the entire NOm with numerous fibers (LNO1 and LNO2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). A fifth large neuron, entering the NO together with the LNO4/5 cells, innervated a subcompartment of the NOm overlapping with the projection fields of LNO1/2 cells (LNO3). Finally, a set of 15–20 smaller input cells projected to the NOc region. These cells did not have neurites projecting from the direction of the ipsilateral lateral accessory lobes (LAL), but emerged from a fiber bundle that vertically passed the EB and originated in the contralateral anterior protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The same bundle contained numerous tangential cells of the FB, suggesting that the tangential neurons supplying the NOc region also belong to this group of neurons. This proposed morphology was confirmed by an intracellular dye fill from <italic>Megalopta</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>) and we named these neurons FB-NOc cells.</p><p>With respect to columnar cells our reconstructions revealed 12–20 PFN neurons with large to medium fiber diameters in the NOm, while PEN cells were restricted to the NOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–e,g</xref>). Additional cells with smaller fiber diameters originated alongside the larger PFN neurons, and mostly projected exclusively to the NOc region. Those cells which projected to the NOc were termed PFNc cells and their collective fiber bundles were adjacent to the main PFN cells along the entire neurite path toward the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). They thus most likely constitute the only identifiable subtype of PFN cells. Given their projection fields, these cells overlapped only with the FB-NOc cells but not with LNO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>).</p><p>Compared to other columnar cells of the CX, PFN cells are by far the most numerous cell type. In our low resolution data, we identified 202 PFN cells total, while in the 100 nm data we identified a minimum of 160 PFN neurons in a single hemisphere, with many still left to be traced. Finally, with the 24 nm data set, and including the PFNc neurons, we were able to identify a total of 427 PFN neurons in one hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), with a maximum number of 100 PFN cells projecting from a single column in the PB/CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>; R4). Based on these numbers, we estimate the total numbers of PFN cells to be at least 854 for the entire CX, double the number found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, approximately half of the found PFN cells belong to the PFNc subtype (201 in the analyzed hemisphere).</p><p>At least two thirds of PFN neurons had very small fiber diameters, making them impossible to trace using the 126 nm resolution data set. Additionally, as branches within the FB could only be traced over short distances and no layering was present in the NO, we were unable to subtype this large group of neurons further, leaving PFNc and PFN (main) as the only obvious subtypes. However, clear and consistent differences in the diameter of the main PFN neurites in each columnar bundle demonstrated that the population of PFN cells is not homogeneous and many subtypes likely exist. With regard to their columnar projection pattern, PFN cells are laterally shifted by one column in the FB and are entirely absent from the innermost PB columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).

Akin to a biological compass, EPGs track the flies rotational movement as a single bump of activity in the EB and two bumps of activity in the PB, one in each hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>). Tangential EB neurons feed predominantly visual information from the anterior visual pathway to EPGs in the EB, tethering the bump to features of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). At the same time, rotational self motion cues are sent to the PEN cells, predominantly via the NO and probably also directly via the PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green et al., 2017</xref>). While activity in the EB input cells directly generates an activity bump in the EPG network that is based on allothetic information, idiothetic information laterally shifts the bump position via the PEN activity. Importantly, this circuit relies on an anatomical offset between the EB projections of PEN and EPG cells: EPGs follow a default projection pattern, whereas PENs are shifted by one column in the EB. Therefore, EPGs projecting to any given column in the EB will be flanked on either side by PEN fibers, connecting to neighboring EPG cells. This offset has the effect whereby PEN activation results in shifting the activity bump either to the left or to the right, thereby translating clockwise or counterclockwise body rotations into counterclockwise or clockwise movements of the neural activity in the EPG population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>An identical offset in projections between EPG/PEG and PEN cells was also present in the bumblebee CX: EPG/PEG cells followed the default projection pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>), whereas PEN cells were shifted by one column in the CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In the fly, 74 EPG/PEGs and 42 PENs span the width of the CX with a similar, but slightly different distribution of these cells per PB column (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we found one set of EPG/PEG cells with arborizations in the innermost PB columns of the contralateral hemisphere (‘EPG_L1’ and ‘EPG_R1’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). In contrast to the rest of the EPG/PEGs, these cells contained branching fibers in the outermost EB columns of the ipsilateral hemisphere relative to their arbor in the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These cells may provide a pathway for an activity bump to ‘jump’ from one lateral end to the other in the bumblebee EB, which compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic> is structurally an open loop (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The fan-shaped body</title><p>The FB is the largest and arguably the most functionally mysterious of the CX neuropils. In our data set, the majority of FB columnar cell types were found to connect the PB with the FB and onward to tertiary regions. They possessed arborizations in the FB where they commingle among themselves, FB tangential neurons, and interneurons that were confined solely within the FB, the hΔ cells, or pontine cells (Figure 11; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>As with the EB, we focused our reconstructions on the columnar cells with large neurite diameters. We revealed at least nine types of FB columnar cells in the bumblebee CX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). One group of cells, the already mentioned PFN cells, innervated the posterior portion of the FB and represented the most numerous columnar neurons of the FB. Even considering only the largest PFN cells obtained in the low resolution data (202 individuals) their number exceeded the total count of all remaining columnar FB cells combined (163 neurons). This ratio is likely even more biased toward PFN cells when considering that the 202 PFN cells likely comprise only one fourth of the total number of these cells (as identified in our high-resolution data set). As the extent of the fine processes within the FB was not traceable, the exact layer these cells project to could not be identified. Although fiber diameters of different sizes present in each columnar bundle of PFN cells demonstrates the existence of subtypes, these could not be reliably established.</p><p>The limits imposed by the unresolved neuronal terminals apply to all neuron types of the FB and were amplified by the fact that neural processes outside the imaged tissue block were truncated. Nevertheless, all identified cell types were clearly distinct from each other based on their columnar projection patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>), the fiber trajectories within the FB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b’</xref>), the exit point they left the FB, and the location of the main branches.</p><p>Two types of neurons had main neurites located near the dorsal edge of the bundle connecting the PB with the FB and possessed characteristically large fiber diameters when leaving the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This main neurite entered the FB dorsally giving rise to numerous thin branches. While passing through the FB in a ventral direction this neurite dramatically, but consistently, thinned before turning toward the contralateral lateral complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). Due to this thinning, many cells were lost at that point. All these cells followed a projection pattern that exhibited shifted innervations of the PB. Based on these features as well as a single dye filled example from the halictid sweat bee <italic>Megalopta genalis</italic> these cells were identified as PFL neurons, the main output cells of the CX.

This high number makes them the second most numerous cell type of the CX after the columnar PFN cells. Their numbers were surprisingly unevenly distributed across the bundles of origin. Interestingly, the X and Y bundles on both hemispheres contained almost exactly twice the number of hΔ cells compared to the W and Z bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).

To this aim we manually traced more than 1300 columnar and pontine neurons of the bumblebee CX and established neural projection patterns underlying overall information flow within this brain region. Based on these patterns, we extrapolated whether anatomically constrained computational algorithms identified in particular in the fruit fly could also exist in the bumblebee. The present study is therefore a first step toward evaluating how conserved the neural circuits uncovered by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>) are and which of these circuits are general features of insect brains and which ones are specific adaptations relevant to fruit fly ecology and behavior.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>What information is missing from our low-resolution projectome?</title><p>Additionally to the low-resolution data, we collected higher resolution data sets of the NO from a different individual. This not only allowed us to trace the fine neurites of PFN cells, which have been proposed to integrate heading with distance information in bees and likely play a major role in path integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>), but also enabled us to estimate how many neurons we are likely missing when relying on low resolution data only.</p><p>The comparison between the three data sets revealed that the lowest resolution data clearly misses all neurons with neurite diameters smaller than a certain cutoff, in our case 0.6 µm. This cutoff was not identical across all regions of the data, as especially toward the boundaries of the main image stack, resolution was much poorer compared to the center.</p><p>Additionally, the inability to resolve fine details also led to the loss of all but the main branches of arborizations within neuropils. For instance, in the noduli, the PFN neurons as well as the LNO input cells possessed only fibers totalling a few µm in the 126 nm data, but possessed cable lengths of several orders of magnitude larger when reconstructed based on the higher resolution data. Synapses were not clearly visible in any of the three data sets.</p><p>This not only has implications for detailed maps of overlapping arborizations, but limits cell type identification. For instance, E-PG/P-EG cells both occupy similar regions in the PB, EB, and gall, share projection patterns and morphology, but differ in polarity, with one cell type receiving input predominantly in the EB (E-PG) and the other in the PB (P-EG). The information needed to resolve these cell types clearly lies in higher resolution data. Other examples are PFL1 versus PFL3 cells, as well as subtypes of PFN or hΔ cells, all of which, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, are defined based on the innervated layer of the FB and, ultimately, by their underlying connectivity. Without higher resolution and the associated ability to reconstruct full branching trees, we are unable to discern the subtype identity of any of these cells in the bumblebee.</p><p>Adding a different perspective, we also compared the skeletons of our low-resolution EM-based data to detailed neuron morphologies obtained by intracellular dye injections and confocal microscopy. This analysis not only demonstrated that regions of cells that lie outside of the imaged volume are obviously missing from our data, but that our low-resolution EM data can be supplemented by full arborization trees obtained by light microscopical data, as long as neurons are selectively labeled. The complete morphologies obtained with this method confirmed the result of the comparison between low- and high-resolution EM data and highlighted that neither polarity indicators (fine versus beaded endings), nor the full size of branches were captured in the EM-based reconstructions based on low-resolution images.</p><p>However, mapping of EM-based skeletons and neuron skeletons based on confocal data yielded surprisingly good matches, even in the occasional cases when data from <italic>M. genalis</italic> was mapped onto bumblebee data. This indicated that the gross morphology of neurons can be readily compared across these imaging modalities and future data based on single neuron dye fills can indeed be used to validate identity of neuron types in our projectome data.</p><p>We conclude that, despite all the missing details, known cell types can be reliably identified based on our data. Sub-classifications of these main types that are based on either fiber polarity or details of innervated layers are, however, not possible and require additional data for cross validation. Mostly owing to the missing projections outside of the CX, the morphology of unknown types of neurons are also impossible to determine without additional verification based on dye-filled preparations. Nevertheless, by using the presented data, even an individual example of a dye filled neuron is sufficient to assign identity to all individuals of this type in our projectome. Each complete neuron morphology therefore automatically provides information about the entire isomorphic set of its kind. The existence of our projectome thus substantially increases the value of single neuron morphologies obtained in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Novel insights into the overall layout of the insect CX</title><p>For decades CX research did not question that the CX contains 16 columns in the PB (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanesch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinze and Homberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El Jundi et al., 2018</xref>).

As in most other insects, vertical columns are not visible using immunohistochemical labeling with antibodies against synapsin, neither in the FB, EB or PB, and a definite insight into this structural feature required EM based tracing of main fiber trajectories of the CX.</p><p>Interestingly, the existence of nine columns in the EB was already reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams, 1975</xref> and was confirmed also for bees, e.g. by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hensgen et al., 2021</xref>. In each case, seven wide, medial columns are flanked by two narrow hemicolumns at the lateral edges of the EB, generating eight equal sized projection fields along the length of the EB. The division of the fly EB into eight equally wide segments (referred to as ’tiles’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>) around the EB ring is directly equivalent and suggests that the existence of eight versus nine columns in the PB does not affect the overall structure of the CX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Rather, the ninth column likely evolved after the core circuitry of the CX.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Different circuit solutions for anatomically closing the loop in three insect species.</title><p>Stripped patterns indicate overlapping neural branches.

In the bumblebee EB, EPG/PEG cells at the innermost PB column are swapped relative to the fly. Additionally, the projections of the PEN cells in the lateralmost column of the EB cover twice the width as those PEN cells located in all other EB columns. Locusts have evolved a third and slightly different modification, likely a third mechanism for closing the loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pisokas et al., 2020</xref>). They use only eight EPG/PEG neurons instead of nine, but midline crossing input fibers of the innermost EPG cells are suited to functionally close the loop.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68911-fig12-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This hypothesis is consistent with the eightfold symmetry of the CX head direction circuit in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pisokas et al., 2020</xref>). It is also supported by our data, which show that most divergence in projection patterns between the fly and the bumblebee neurons was found at the innermost PB column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), that is this additional column provides the substrate to evolve novel CX components without disrupting the existing functions based on the outer eight columns. This also suggests that the columns 2–9 in flies and bees are homologous to columns 1–8 in locusts and other insects. The consistent lack of PFN and PEN neurons in the innermost columns further supports this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).</p><p>Underlining the high degrees of organizational conservation, we were able to identify four discrete columnar cell projection patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>), three of which were identical to the patterns produced by the corresponding neurons in the fly. Importantly, these projection patterns define the computations that are carried out within the EB and the FB. This resemblance in structure therefore suggests that highly conserved computational principles operate at the core of the CX across insects. For instance, functional recordings and connectomics analysis in the fly have led to a model in which navigation-related vector computations are carried out by columnar cells and interneurons in the FB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>). Columnar cell projection patterns provide the structural backbone of these computations and would therefore define which vector operations can be achieved. Using the same argument, those patterns that were identified as being different, namely those of PFL2 neurons in bees and of PFL3 neurons in flies, directly suggest that distinct computations are implemented in either species, a finding that will be discussed in more detail below.</p><p>On the level of neuropils, and in contrast to the strictly conserved columnar organization, the layers of the CB identified via immunohistochemical staining against serotonin (5HT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, an enzyme required to produce dopamine), bear no close resemblance between bees and flies. We found at least three horizontal layers in the FB and two layers in the EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–e’’</xref>), while, based on immunolabeling of synaptic markers alone, many more layers are present in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>), as well as in other insects, like locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von Hadeln et al., 2020</xref>) and butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heinze and Reppert, 2012</xref>). As the layers of the CB largely correspond to innervation by tangential input neurons, this suggests that which information is fed into the CX is highly species specific. In contrast, the computational algorithms (defined by the columnar layout) that use this input information are much more conserved. These structural differences are consistent with the idea that different sensory cues are relevant to different species , but that the decision about where to turn to in response to sensory information follows the same guiding principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honkanen et al., 2019</xref>). The same argument applies to input into the FB that relays internal state or memory output from the mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the most pronounced difference between bees and flies was found in the organization of the NO. While the fly data, and in fact data on many other species (locusts, butterflies, moths, beetles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinze and Homberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heinze and Reppert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Immonen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adden et al., 2020</xref>), reveal a highly structured organization into stacked layers, we found the bee noduli to be comparably disorganized. Our reconstructions only revealed three discrete territories, providing the possibilities for increased levels of cross-talk between the PFN neurons that remain segregated in other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e-e'</xref>). Interestingly, and discussed in detail below, pronounced intra-columnar microcircuits among PFN cells was one prediction made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref> for insects with highly developed path integration ability, such as bees.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conserved core circuits and bee-specific neurons?</title><p>In total, we found 11 types of columnar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Importantly, the majority of these cell types have known homologues in other insects. These include EPG/PEGs, PENs, PFNs, hΔs, and putative motor output cells, PFL1,3 and PFL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Homberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinze and Homberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El Jundi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hensgen et al., 2021</xref>). Drawing comparisons to the fly data, we can distinguish four different categories of cross species resemblance: First, some cell types appear to be extremely conserved, including in quantity, distribution, morphology, and projectivity. In particular, EPG/PEG and PEN cells were indistinguishable between the species with respect to these parameters. Second, other cell types differed in numbers but maintain key characteristics, such as projection pattern, suggesting conserved roles in CX computations. This was the case for PFN and hΔ cells, at least when disregarding potential subtypes. Third, some cell types share quantities, but differ in projectivity. In this category we found the main output neurons of the CX in particular, that is, PFL1,2,3 cells (discussed in detail below). Finally, some cell types appear to have no counterpart in the fly and might be unique to the bee. These include PFx1, PFx2, PFx3, PFx4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), PF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), and PFLx neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), all of which project to the FB following the ’default’ pattern.</p><p>In contrast to findings in the fruit fly, we did not observe any clear homologues for vΔ cells. In the fly, these cells have input and output branches constrained within single FB columns, but different layers, potentially shifting neural activity vertically (i.e. across layers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). As these neurons have been implied in vector transformations based on fly connectomics data, the lack of such neurons in bees, if confirmed, can be expected to have important functional consequences. However, PF1 neurons in the bee, which only innervate the PB and FB and have branches across multiple layers in the FB may fulfill a similar role. Additionally, bee counterparts of vΔ cells might have small fiber diameters and could have been missed in our analysis.</p><p>Interestingly, we also did not find any obvious candidates matching the fly FX cells, columnar neurons lacking arborizations in the PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). One potential candidate in the bee could be the PFx cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Three of these cell types that have bilaterally projecting fibers toward regions in the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), similar to the fly FX cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). However, whereas FX cells in the fly only arborize in the FB, PFx neurons in the bee also possess arborizations in the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Intracelluar injection of one such cell revealed processes innervating both hemispheres of regions possibly within the CRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1c–d’</xref>).</p><p>Finally, a fourth FB columnar cell of the bee, PFx2 neurons, sends fibers contralaterally toward the LX, but follows the default projection pattern, making these cells clearly distinct from the PFL output neurons. Given these characteristics, these cells might correspond to <italic>Drosophila</italic> PFRa or PFG cells. Both cells receive input from PFN neurons in flies. This outlines a possible line of enquiry to establish equivalence despite diverging morphology by delineating the up- and downstream synaptic connections and hence place neurons in a corresponding computational context.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Head direction coding across species</title><p>Two columnar cell types, EPG and PEN cells, link the EB and the PB and form the core of the head direction circuit in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>). The numbers of both EPG and PEN cells per PB column identified in the bumblebee closely approximated corresponding numbers in the fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and, importantly, their projection patterns, characteristically offset by one column in the EB between both cell types, were also conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>One major distinction between the bee and the fruit fly is the gross morphology of the EB. As the name suggests, the EB in the fly is toroidal, whereas in the bee the EB more closely resembles an eyebrow or a bent cylinder. In the fly, this morphology is a prime example of structure matching function. Because the EB is shaped as a torus, EPG cells from medialmost PB columns and EPGt cells from the lateralmost ninth columns have overlapping fibers within the EB, enabling an heading encoding activity bump to move in 360° with the same rotational freedom as a compass needle rotating within a compass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). Based only on gross morphology, the bee EB would not seem to be well suited to serve this same function. However, our data revealed that in bumblebees the proposed head-direction circuit differs from its fly counterpart at lateral extremes of the EB, that is those positions that would correspond to the ring closure in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Specifically, we found that EPG/PEG cells in the innermost PB columns were swapped in the bee relative to the fly. Unlike in all other columns, these cells project exclusively within the ipsilateral hemisphere and innervate the outermost EB column on the same side of the CX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Additionally, the projections of the PEN cells in the lateralmost column of the EB covered twice the width as those PEN cells located in all remaining EB columns. These differences might enable a circuit solution to compensate for the morphologically open EB and produce a closed, ring-like circuit suited to encode smooth rotational movements in the bumblebee.</p><p>Intriguingly, in a recent modeling study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pisokas et al., 2020</xref> proposed that locusts have evolved a third solution to closing the loop, a solution that differs from both the bee and the fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). While most insects do not have a closed EB, evidence presented here and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pisokas et al., 2020</xref> suggests that these different circuit modifications may fulfill the same functional purpose. It is worth noting however, that by modeling the head direction circuit in the locust and the fly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pisokas et al., 2020</xref> found that other, more minor, morphological differences between the circuits of both species can significantly alter the dynamics of the ring attractor circuit underlying the head direction system in ways that could adapt circuit function in line with species specific behavioral demands. It will thus be interesting to explore the possible functional consequences and possible behavioral correlates of the detailed characteristics of the bumblebee head direction system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Functional implications of the neuroarchitecture of the noduli</title><p>Several recent functional studies have implicated the NO as centers that relay idiothetic self-motion cues, including translational optic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>), rotational angular velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turner-Evans et al., 2017</xref>), and wind direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Currier et al., 2020</xref>) to other regions within the CX. So far three neuron types that innervate the NO have been shown to facilitate the encoding of self-motion cues, with anatomical homologues having been identified across insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinze and Homberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El Jundi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von Hadeln et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hensgen et al., 2021</xref>). These include PFN, PEN, and LNO tangential cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e-f</xref>). LNO tangential neurons provide predominantly input to PFN and PEN neurons, carrying sensory information from other regions of the brain, mostly from the ipsilateral LX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Currier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Different LNO types carry sensory information to the NO along multiple parallel channels. In the fly, this is reflected by the structural layout of the NO, in which the fibers of LNO, PFN, and PEN cells are neatly organized into discrete layers. Five subtypes of PFN cells project into five territories in the fly NO. With the addition of PENs that arborize in the dorsalmost layer, there are six distinct zones, each supplied by its own LNO input channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, the fly NO contains numerous FB tangential cells (FBt) which overlap with and in some cases receive direct input from LNO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the bee, we found three anatomical domains, NOs, NOm, and NOc, based on the input arborizations from tangential cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e-g</xref>). Similar to the fly, PEN cells, likely encoding angular velocity, send their processes to a single zone, the NOs, where they receive isolated tangential cell input and do not overlap with PFN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>e). In contrast to flies however, PFNs only arborize in two structurally discrete territories, the NOm and NOc. All PFNs that are associated with the same column in the PB display a surprising amount of overlap in the NO, with many spreading throughout the entire NOm or NOc domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Similarly to the PFN organization, the LNO input cells associated with this region are equally overlapping. Besides suggesting fewer sensory input channels in bees than flies, with the notable exclusion of contralateral input, such an organization additionally offers the possibility of a large degree of intra-column recurrent connectivity in the bee NO relative to the fly, a prediction made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref> to support path integration memory. However, connectivity data will be needed to verify such a claim. A second prediction of this model was that more PFN neurons would be required to increase the capacity and precision of vector memory in species with highly developed path integration. Given that we found more than twice the number of PFN cells in bees compared to the fly, this prediction is clearly met, even though its functional significance remains hypothetical.</p><p>Even if all circuits present in flies are conserved in bees, the newly discovered circuit of PFNc neurons in the bee NOc provides an additional possibility for structured recurrent connections between PFN neurons as potential substrate for path integration memory that can be directly used for steering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>). The fly connectome data revealed that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neither highly structured intracolumnar recurrent connections exist, nor are PFN outputs to steering cells hemisphere specific (as required by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref> model). Both assumptions can in theory still be met in PFNc neurons, as long as they receive speed input indirectly, for example via PFNv neurons in the PB.</p><p>Another specialization of the bee noduli compared to their fly counterparts is evident in the structure of the NO input. Interestingly, whereas the NOm contains putative input fibers from three LNO cells, the NOc receives no branches from LNO cells at all. Rather, the NOc is innervated by a group of 15–20 FB tangential cells that, based on projection, quantity, and lack of overlap with LNOs, have no equivalent in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CX and were termed FB-NOc neurons. Based on one completely filled example from <italic>Megalopta</italic>, these cells have distant ventral cell bodies and fibers that extend dorsal-anteriorly, occupying regions in the vicinity of the SMP/CRE (FB-NOc cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>). While we cannot confirm identical morphologies of the neurons in the bumblebee and these cells might also comprise a family of related cell types rather than a group of identical cells, the fiber trajectories of all found neurons are fully consistent with the morphology of the <italic>Megalopta</italic> neuron. Our data therefore strongly suggest that the FB-NOc tangential neurons provide an additional input channel to the bee NO that specifically synapses onto the PFNc cells, the smallest and most numerous PFN cell type. The much higher cell count of PFN cells in the bumblebee compared to the fly therefore appears to be closely associated with the presence of an additional input channel.</p><p>While the function of these FB-NOc tangential cells is unknown, their arborizations in the NO, the FB, and the SMP/CRE and their apparent uniqueness within the bee make them potential candidates to play a role in mediating the highly developed ability of bees for vector navigation. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Le Moël et al., 2019</xref>, and based on the computational model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>, complex navigation strategies, such as trap lining, could be explained by vector navigation, when enabling storage and retrieval of PFN population activity in long-term memory, for example in the mushroom body. Stored vectors from previous foraging segments could be compared to and combined with vectors representing the current state of the path integrator, enabling the choice of optimal foraging routes and novel shortcuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Le Moël et al., 2019</xref>). The key prediction of such a model is direct information flow between the mushroom body and the CX path integration memory, for example PFN neurons, both for storing and for recalling vectors. The found FB-NOc neurons are anatomically suited to serve this function, as their branches outside the CX coincide with brain regions innervated by MB output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rybak and Menzel, 1993</xref>). A prediction of this hypothesis is that the connection of these neurons to and from PFNc neurons is column specific, an idea that is directly testable via connectomics work and which is consistent with the high number of 15–20 FB-NOc neurons per hemisphere (ca. two per PFN column).</p><p>In summary, the specializations identified in the noduli of the bumblebee are consistent with the idea that this region plays a key role in path integration and that the highly developed abilities for path integration related behaviors in bees are indeed reflected in the circuitry of the noduli. Further analysis of the synaptic connectivity of the NOc circuit will have to test these predictions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Proposed steering circuits differ between insect species</title><p>PFL neurons relay signals to descending neurons in the lateral accessory lobes (LAL), making them likely candidates for cells which propagate steering or other motor commands to the ventral nerve cord (VNC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steinbeck et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>).

This is supported by the fact that PFL2 cells have bilateral projections to descending neurons in both LALs, and, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, they are offset from the default projection in the FB by 180°. Note that ’stored’ vector refers to an accumulated vector, akin to an outbound vector in the context of a foraging bee. In bumblebees, PFL2 cells are only offset in the FB by 135°, suggesting perhaps they would not be suitable to drive forward motion when the bee is facing 180° away from its ’stored’ vector (i.e. toward its nest or ’home vector’). However, PFL2 cells that innervate multiple columns may receive head direction input from each of those columns. If so, PFL2 cells could therefore compare as many as three offsets, one 90° away from its heading, one 135° away from its heading, and the other 180° away from its heading.

This relies on the assumption that this particular cell receives head direction input in each of these three columns, which may not be the case.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68911-fig14-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>PFL neurons are thought to relay motor commands, such as steering (PFL3 neurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rayshubskiy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>) and forward velocity (PFL2 neurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>), from the CX to the LALs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steinbeck et al., 2020</xref>). Given that PFL1,3 neurons in the bee share characteristics with both fly PFL1 and PFL3 neurons, such an arrangement may suggest that the projection offset of these neurons evolutionarily diverged in the fly. This is supported by the fact that similar numbers of cells per column exist for all PFL1 + PFL3 neurons in the fly and all PFL1,3 neurons in the bee. Further, an identical bee-like projection offset for both PFL1 and PFL3 neurons is also consistent with data from dye filled neurons in the Monarch butterfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinze et al., 2013</xref>). PFL3s in the fly would be well suited to drive rotational movements when the fly is facing +/- 90° away from a goal location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>). Due to their offsets in the FB and bilaterally projecting output fibers in the LALs, PFL2s were suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref> to drive forward motion when the fly is facing in the direction opposite to their ’stored’ vector (i.e. facing toward their starting point or goal vector).</p><p>Assuming a corresponding function in the bee, PFL1,3 neurons would be most active (i.e. propagate steering commands) when bees are facing +/- 45° away from their ’stored’ vector and PFL2 neurons would drive forward velocity when they are facing +/- 135° away from their stored vector (although see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, if we assume direct and exclusively contralateral connections between PFN and PFL neurons to underlie steering as hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stone et al., 2017</xref>, the opposite offset by PFN neurons would add 45° to these values, leading to a fly-like +/- 90° and +/- 180° away from their ’stored’ vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). But as the detailed projections of PFL cells, that is the extent of their inputs in the PB and their projection width and innervated layer in the FB, are unknown and partially differ between cells originating in different PB columns, conclusions about phase offsets and possible functional implications for behavior remain preliminary, especially without support from computational models. Nevertheless, the distinct anatomical offsets between flies and bees clearly suggest that bees have evolved a different mechanism for target driven steering, as strictly applying the fly-derived steering concept to bees would result in a 45° error relative to a stored vector. Synaptic resolution connectivity data are clearly required to resolve this interspecies discrepancy.</p><p>Overall, the differences found at the level of the main output neurons of the CX are intriguing and suggest that the behavioral control of steering does depend on the species, possibly explaining divergent flight patterns and, combined with distinct sensory input channels, might possibly even account for different navigational strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, while limited in resolution and missing the smaller cell types of the CX as well as the projections that leave the imaged volume, the projectome analysis of the bumblebee CX provides pioneering insights about the quantity and projectivity of all major CX neurons in the brain of the bumblebee.

Due to overwhelming support for CX homology across insects, the greater availability of functional and neuroanatomical data in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>), and in an effort to make our anatomical descriptions more comparable to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> connectomics data, we adhere here to the short hand nomenclature used for <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>) but have also provided alternative names historically used in other insects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Briefly, columnar neurons are named with a three letter abbreviation according to the neuropils they innervate. In the fruit fly, these abbreviations are ordered by connectivity, with the first two letters being determined by the two neuropils the neuron receives the most input from, in order of which has the greatest amount of input first, and the third letter is given by the neuropil in which the neuron sends predominantly output to. For instance, a PEG cell receives mostly input in the PB and the EB and sends output to the gall. For a more in-depth description of fruit fly CX neuron nomenclature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>. Since connectivity information does not exist for neurons in our dataset, we define neuron homology based on corresponding morphology and arborization domains between species. As general connectivity patterns are likely conserved as well, based on the tight anatomical resemblance as well as functional conservation of CX neurons across species, we have adopted the fly naming scheme for the bumblebee. For neurons in which there are no clear homologues in the fly, we used the neuropils that they innervate within the imaged volume to define the neuron name. For example, PFx neurons innervate the PB, the FB, and an unknown tertiary region denoted here as ‘x’. Lastly, we consider all CX neurons to fall into one of three classes: columnar neurons, FB interneurons (i.e., hΔ), and tangential neurons (see Introduction). Neurons within these classes were defined as belonging to the same neuron type if they were anatomically indistinguishable from each other, yielding the columnar neuron types listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> as well as several types of hΔ neurons. While some of these likely consist of several distinct subtypes based on connectivity and detailed projection areas (e.g. PFN neurons), we were not able to unambiguously identify those due to the limits imposed by the resolution of our image data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Animals</title><p>Bumblebees (<italic>Bombus terrestris</italic>), were obtained from a commercial supplier (Koppert, Netherlands) and kept in a greenhouse on campus at Lund University, Sweden.

Tissue was then rinsed 3 x for 10 min intervals in Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) before being transferred into Dent’ s fixative containing 80:20 methanol to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were it was left to soak for 75 min on a gentle shake. Next, neural tissue was rinsed 3 x in Tris-HCl over 10 min intervals and placed into a blocking solution consisting of 5% normal donkey serum (NDS) in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline with 0.5% Triton-X 100 (PBST). After a 3 hr incubation, blocking solution was swapped with primary antibody solution containing 1% NDS, 0.5% PBST, and 1:25 mouse anti-synapsin monoclonal antibodies (3C11; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; Iowa City, IA). In some experiments, a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against serotonin (5-HT; AB_572263; ImmunoStar; Hudson, WI) was also included at a concentration of 1:2000.

Anti-mouse conjugated to Cy5 was used to detect synapsin and anti-rabbit conjugated to Cy3 to detect 5-HT, when applicable. Secondary-containing Eppendorf tubes were then placed in a centrifuge and spun for 5–10 min at 8000 g to separate potential antibody aggregates.

Bees were anesthetized over ice until immobile and then waved to a plastic holder. A frontal window was cut into the head cuticle and, where necessary, air sacs, fat, and neural sheath were removed using tweezers. Electrode tips were then filled with 4% neurobiotin (Vector Laboratories) in 1 M KCl, and backed with 1 M KCl. Silver wire placed in the ventral part of the head near the mandibles as a reference electrode and the main electrode inserted frontally in the brain and positioned using a micromanipulater (Sensapex, stepping mode). Once a cell was successfully impaled, a depolarizing current of 1–3 nA was applied to iontophoretically inject neurobiotin.</p><p>Injected brains were dissected free from the head capsule and fixed in a solution containing 4% PFA, 2% saturated picric acid, and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.01 M PBS overnight at 4°C.

Neural tissue was then rinsed 4 x 15 min in 0.01 M PBS, embedded in albumin/gelatin, and post fixed overnight at 4°C. To image the CX, a single thick section (400 µm) was cut from the albumin/gelatin block using a vibrating blade microtome and stored in 0.01 M PBS until further processing. This same technique was used for the noduli, using a smaller section thickness (200 µm). Large volume en bloc staining was then performed, beginning with osmification in a solution containing 2% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferricyanide in double distilled water (ddH20) for 1 hr at room temperature. Tissue was then washed 3 x 5 min in ddH20 and then sequentially immersed in 1% thiocarbohydrazide for 20 min and 2% osmium tetroxide for 30 min both steps being followed by 3 x 5 min rinses with ddH20.

Lead aspartate solution was made by adding 0.066 g lead nitrate to 10 ml ddH20, with a pH adjusted to 5.5 using KOH. Next, tissue was rinsed 3 x 5 min with ddH20 and dehydrated in an increasing ethanol series (20%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 2 x 100%) at 5 min intervals. Samples were then slowly infiltrated with increasing concentrations of Durcupan resin to ethanol (25%, 50%, 75%) at 2 hr intervals and left in 100% Durcupan overnight. The following day, tissue was transferred to fresh Durcupan for 2 hr and left to polymerize for 48 hr at 60°C. Finally, samples were trimmed and mounted onto aluminum stubs using two part conductive silver epoxy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image acquisition and processing</title><p>Blocks of brain tissue were imaged using a Zeiss Sigma VP scanning electron microscope equipped with a Gatan 3View ultramicrotome. Three different scans were acquired for this study: an overview scan of the entire central complex imaged at a voxel size of 126 nm x 126 nm x 100 nm (field of view 400 µm x 400 µm), a slightly higher resolution scan of the noduli at 100 nm x 100 nm x 100 nm (field of view 95 µm x 95 µm), and a high-resolution scan of the noduli at 23.6 nm x 23.6 nm x 50 nm (field of view 46 µm x 46 µm). All scans were obtained with a beam energy of 2 kV under high vacuum. Following image acquisition, image alignment and contrast optimization were carried out using Amira 5.3. Image stacks were then down sampled to 8-bit depth, enabling the use of the Skeletonize plugin for Amira (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmitt et al., 2004</xref>) as well as to perform image segmentation using Amira’ s segmentation editor. For segmentation of CX neuropils in each of the three SBEM data sets the image stacks were down-sampled to in Amira to 1 µm x 1 µm x 1 µm voxel size.</p><p>A Leica SP8 DLS inverted confocal microscope was used to collect image data from immunohistochemically labeled brains as well as for individual neurons injected with neurobiotin. Image stacks of entire brains were generated using a 20x oil-immersion objective. To accomplish this, a mosaic of 8–10 image stacks (voxel size of 0.76 µm x 0.76 µm x 1 µm) were collected and stitched together in the x-y plane using Leica Application Suite X (LAS X) Navigator. Due to the relatively large brain size and limited working distance, brains had to be imaged both frontally and posteriorly with some overlap to allow for subsequent merging. Frontal and posterior image stacks were manually positioned in Amira using the transform tool and then registered using the affine registration tool with one stack as a reference. Once the transformations were applied to the stack being registered, both were exported and stitched together to form one stack of the full brain using the stitching plugin in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preibisch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The resulting image stack was then down-sampled in Amira to 1 µm x 1 µm x 1 µm voxel size to enable reconstruction using Amira’ s segmentation editor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Segmentation and neuron tracing</title><p>Neurons were manually reconstructed for all three SBEM data sets using both Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and CATMAID software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>). We used Amira with the third-party plugin Skeletonize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmitt et al., 2004</xref>) at the beginning stages of this project. With this method, branch points (nodes) are placed along the length of a neuronal process. Nodes are automatically connected by a straight line (edge), the diameter of which can be adjusted to approximate the diameter of the neuronal process that is being traced. Amira enabled the use of orthogonal slices along the xz and yz planes which contained a better resolution in the lowest resolution data set (126 nm x 100 nm compared to 126 nm x 126 nm). The Skeletonize plugin was also used to reconstruct and visualize neurons injected with neurobiotin.</p><p>At later stages in the development of this study, we transferred all tracing data from Amira to CATMAID, an open-source and collaborative neural reconstruction software that enabled us to simultaneously trace EM image data over the web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>). We did so with the aid of natverse, a suite of R packages that include many functions for handling and analysing neuroanatomical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bates et al., 2020</xref>). We specifically used the nat and catmaid packages to convert, re-scale, and upload neurons and neuropil surface data from Amira to CATMAID. Once in CATMAID, neuron skeletons were manually traced by placing nodes along the length of a neuronal fiber. CATMAID’s 3D Viewer was used to visualize neurons and generate many of the images used throughout this study. To increase tracing efficiency, we did not adjust node diameter to approximate fiber diameter when tracing in CATMAID as was done in Amira.</p><p>Neuropils were reconstructed using the segmentation editor in Amira 5.3. This was carried out by tracing key cross-sections in all three spatial planes using the paintbrush tool. Such a process results in a scaffold which was then turned into a surface by interpolation using the ’wrap’ function. This method was used to reconstruction neuropils in each of the three SBEM data sets as well as whole mount brains immunolabeled with synapsin, serotonin, or tyrosine hydroxylase.</p><p>Immunolabeling of serotonin and tyrosine hydroxylase was used to aide in the visualization of layers within the CB (available in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://insectbraindb.org/app/">insect brain database</ext-link>, Heinze et al.,2021). Using Amiras segmentation editor, immunoreactive layers in the CX were reconstructed for each immunostained brain and were affine registered to the CB of the EM data. Doing so enabled us to establish a rough idea of layering within the FB and EB, and to visualize the trajectories of reconstructed neurons from the 126 nm data set relative to these immunopositive layers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data availability</title><p>Reconstructed neurons are available to view and download on the Insect Brain Database (IBdb; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinze et al., 2021</xref>): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.insectbraindb.org/app/connectomics;experiment=61;handle=EIN-0000061.1">https://www.insectbraindb.org/app/connectomics;experiment=61;handle=EIN-0000061.1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.insectbraindb.org/app/connectomics;experiment=62;handle=EIN-0000062.1">https://www.insectbraindb.org/app/connectomics;experiment=62;handle=EIN-0000062.1</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the facilities, and the scientific and technical assistance, of the Microscopy Australia Facility at the Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis (CMM), The University of Queensland.

Truly a resource to be cherished and shared widely.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A projectome of the bumblebee central complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Albert Cardona as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hannah Haberkern (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please consider implementing some of the suggestions from Reviewer #2 regarding additional references to figures in the main text, with panel-lettering resolution where appropriate, to better follow the text.</p><p>2) Please give the discussion a thorough read and consider shorting some bits, perhaps pruning away some of the more speculative statements. This is entirely up to you, in the spirit of making the manuscript more readable to better reach future researchers who may devise experiments to test the formulated hypotheses deriving from this anatomical and comparative study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have not found minor points to enumerate. As far as I can tell, the authors have very carefully checked the numbering and references to figures in the text, as well as language, grammar, and clarity of exposition. I find the figures complete and largely self-explanatory.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I found the manuscript easy and enjoyable to read. The figures are beautiful, and the text is well written. I do have a few suggestions that I think would enhance the clarify and presentation further.</p><p>Broader points:</p><p>1. The text flow occasionally feels disconnected from the figures. I had the impression that the figures as well as the text were each constructed to work well on their own, but on several occasions, I had trouble relating statements in the text to the respective figures. I think two things would help here:</p><p>a. Make sure to make frequent references to individual panels rather than going several sentences and the referencing a full figure. This should be the case for the results and the discussion. One example is in the Discussion section, lines 594ff, where it would be nice to refer back to the figures that show the corresponding results. Another example is the paragraph in line 361ff.</p><p>b. Revisit the order of the figures and panels. In some cases, I found myself going back and forth a lot, which felt disruptive in my reading process. One example is Figure 5, which does not seem to be well integrated at all. I think one solution could be to move Figure 5C to the SI and then combine Figure 5 and 6.</p><p>2. It is not fully clear to me how information from the different datasets was combined. In particular, how did you arrive at the cell number counts for a given type?</p><p>3. Further, I would find it helpful to have a &quot;algorithm&quot; of how you arrived at a type label for a given traced neuron. I think it might also be worth discussing the term &quot;type&quot; here a little bit, since the types you consider here are broader and based on less complete information than the types defined in the fly (connectome) and you relate the two. I had trouble understanding how for example PFx and PFL were distinguished.</p><p>4. Maybe it would be helpful to indicate where neurites were lost. I found myself wondering this for example in case of the tracings in the FB. It is hard to see this from the figures directly.</p><p>5. Some parts of the discussion are a bit too speculative for my taste but maybe I simply had trouble following the logic. It was, for example, not clear to me what made the PFNc types so special (e.g. line 661ff). I felt like some key information, mostly about the connectivity of PFNs in the FB but also in the NO, is missing and I would not focus on discussion topics that sort of require this information to be appropriately addressed. Therefore, my suggestion would be to drastically shorten the Discussion section on &quot;Functional implications of the neuroachitecture of the noduli&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The description of the CX is quite extensive and informative for the CX aficionado while it may seem a bit hard to read for persons more distant to the topic.

This particularly refers to the section covering the noduli, which was disproportionately long in the original version of the manuscript. As some of the details will be relevant to specialist readers, we have integrated the eliminated sections in a shorter form with the figure legends of the supplemental figures (which had been heavily referenced in the removed sections).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, I found the manuscript easy and enjoyable to read.

It is not fully clear to me how information from the different datasets was combined. In particular, how did you arrive at the cell number counts for a given type?</p></disp-quote><p>Most total cell estimates listed in Figure 3 were taken from the 126 nm dataset, with the exception of the two noduli-innervating cell types, PFN and PEN. For these two cells, we derived total numbers from the 24 nm noduli data set, the resolution of which allowed us to trace finer fibers. We assumed bilateral symmetry for these two cell types and therefore included double the number of cells reconstructed from the 24 nm dataset as our estimate. The exact number of cells identified for each hemisphere and from both datasets can be found in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Figure 3 legend has been updated for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Further, I would find it helpful to have a &quot;algorithm&quot; of how you arrived at a type label for a given traced neuron. I think it might also be worth discussing the term &quot;type&quot; here a little bit, since the types you consider here are broader and based on less complete information than the types defined in the fly (connectome) and you relate the two. I had trouble understanding how for example PFx and PFL were distinguished.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Results subsection “Columnar cell types” we state the following about identifying neuronal types:</p><p>“We identified columnar cell types based on their projection fields within CX neuropils, their heterolateral projection patterns in the CB (i.e., the column they project to relative to the bundle they originate from), their neurite paths, their population size (number of cells per PB column), and by the tertiary neuropil they innervate.”</p><p>In the example of PFx cells and ‘PFL1,3’ cells, ‘PFL1,3’ cells have a single column ipsilateral projection offset in the FB, whereas PFx cells follow the ‘default’ projection pattern. Additionally, PFx neurons follow a different trajectory through the FB compared to PFL neurons, and also have a much thinner main neurites (especially near the PB, where PFL neurons are the largest of all columnar cells).</p><p>Because our data sets lack connectivity and full arborization information, we were unable to classify neuronal subtypes (with the exception of PFN main vs PFNc cells, however those likely contain subtypes themselves). However, many neuron types can readily be identified by comparing their morphology and projectivity to light microscopy data of homologous neurons in other species, as was done here with the sweat bee.</p><p>To more clearly recapitulate our approach to naming neurons and defining cell types, we have rewritten and expanded the “Nomenclature” section in Methods lines 792ff:</p><p>“… Briefly, columnar neurons are named with a three letter abbreviation according to the neuropils they innervate. In the fruit fly, these abbreviations are ordered by connectivity, with the first two letters being determined by the two neuropils the neuron receives the most input from, in order of which has the greatest amount of input first, and the third letter is given by the neuropil in which the neuron sends predominantly output to. For instance, a PEG cell receives mostly input in the PB and the EB and sends output to the gall. For a more in-depth description of fruit fly CX neuron nomenclature, see Hulse, 2020.</p><p>Since connectivity information does not exist for neurons in our dataset, we define neuron homology based on corresponding morphology and arborization domains between species. As general connectivity patterns are likely conserved as well, based on the tight anatomical resemblance as well as functional conservation of CX neurons across species, we have adopted the fly naming scheme for the bumble bee. For neurons in which there are no clear homologues in the fly, we used the neuropils that they innervate within the imaged volume to define the neuron name. For example, PFx neurons innervate the PB, the FB, and an unknown tertiary region denoted here as &quot;x&quot;. Lastly, we consider all CX neurons to fall into one of three classes: columnar neurons, FB interneurons (i.e., hΔ), and tangential neurons (see Introduction). Neurons within these classes were defined as belonging to the same neuron type if they were anatomically indistinguishable from each other, yielding the columnar neuron types listed in table1 as well as several types of hΔ neurons. While some of these likely consist of several distinct types based on connectivity and detailed projection areas (e.g. PFN neurons), we were not able to unambiguously identify those due to the limits imposed by the resolution of our image data.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Maybe it would be helpful to indicate where neurites were lost. I found myself wondering this for example in case of the tracings in the FB. It is hard to see this from the figures directly.</p></disp-quote><p>The endpoints of the neurites are where the neurites were lost and could not be traced further. While it would be possible to highlight these endpoints in the figures, we feel that this would create clutter rather than being helpful. We have thus decided to leave the images as they are for clarity. Generally, fibers that were thinner than 600 nm in diameter were untraceable. Sometimes neurons were also lost due to other issues with the image data. For instance, there may be an image in which a piece of debris from the cutting knife obscured the imaging plane (a common issue in serial-block face EM).</p><p>We would like to emphasize at this point, that the datasets underlying this paper are publicly available to view (and download) at the Insect Brain Database (IBdb) [https://www.insectbraindb.org/app/connectomics;experiment=61;handle=EIN-0000061.1 and https://www.insectbraindb.org/app/connectomics;experiment=62;handle=EIN-0000062.1 ]. We have generated a user-friendly 3D viewing platform that will allow users to view the entire data set, search for neuron types, or filter the data according to figures of this manuscript. The interactive viewer is continuously optimized and expanded to obtain a flexible, fast, and aesthetically pleasing rendering of the data (currently optimized for display speed).</p><p>Importantly, in this tool, all neurons can be individually assessed by the user. This will allow each reader of the paper to evaluate the data and clearly see the extent to which each neuron could be traced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

To begin with, at 15-20 cells per hemisphere, FB-NOc cells are more numerous than all FBt-NO cell types in a single hemisphere of the fly combined (13; Hulse et al., 2020). Further, FB-NOc cells are not the only tangential cells innervating the NO, as we found six other FBt-NO cells exist alongside FB-NOc cells in the bee. Secondly, they occupy a layer which receives no input from GLNO/LNO cells. The only cells inverating this region (NOc) are PFNc cells and FB-NOc cells. Additionally, based on morphology and arborization domains, there is no obvious corresponding neuron to FB-NOc cells in the fly. All of these features make this system of cells unique to the bumblebee and therefore a target of attention for speculation and future work.</p><p>We have now shortened the discussion on the NO and moved some of the more speculative ideas to the Supplemental Figure. We are forthcoming about the speculative nature of these ideas but feel that they are important for guiding future research, so we’ve decided against removing them entirely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The description of the CX is quite extensive and informative for the CX aficionado while it may seem a bit hard to read for persons more distant to the topic.
