disease states, disease prevalence, patient demographics, medical histories, and reasons for prescribing a drug often are incomplete, conflicting, missing, or uncharacterized in spontaneous adverse drug event (ADE) reporting systems. These missing or incomplete features can affect and limit the application of quantitative methods in pharmacovigilance for meta-analyses of data during randomized clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from patients with hypertension were retrieved and integrated from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System; 134 antihypertensive drugs out of 1131 drugs were filtered and then evaluated using the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) of the posterior distribution to build ADE-drug profiles with an emphasis on the pulmonary ADEs. Afterward, the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO) captured drug associations based on pulmonary ADEs by correcting hidden factors and confounder misclassification. Selected drugs were then compared using the Friedman test in drug classes and clusters obtained from GLASSO.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Following multiple filtering stages to exclude insignificant and noise-driven reports, we found that drugs from antihypertensives agents, urologicals, and antithrombotic agents (macitentan, bosentan, epoprostenol, selexipag, sildenafil, tadalafil, and beraprost) form a similar class with a significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs. Macitentan and bosentan were associated with 64% and 56% of pulmonary ADEs, respectively. Because these two medications are prescribed in diseases affecting pulmonary function and may be likely to emerge among the highest reported pulmonary ADEs, in fact, they serve to validate the methods utilized here. Conversely, doxazosin and rilmenidine were found to have the least pulmonary ADEs in selected drugs from hypertension patients. Nifedipine and candesartan were also found by signal detection methods to form a drug cluster, shown by several studies an effective combination of these drugs on lowering blood pressure and appeared an improved side effect profile in comparison with single-agent monotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We consider pulmonary ADE profiles in multiple long-standing groups of therapeutics including antihypertensive agents, antithrombotic agents, beta-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, or agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, in patients with hypertension associated with high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We found that several individual drugs have significant differences between their drug classes and compared to other drug classes. For instance, macitentan and bosentan from endothelin receptor antagonists show major concern while doxazosin and rilmenidine exhibited the least pulmonary ADEs compared to the outcomes of other drugs. Using techniques in this study, we assessed and confirmed the hypothesis that drugs from the same drug class could have very different pulmonary ADE profiles affecting outcomes in acute respiratory illness.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>GJW and MJD accepted funding from BioNexus KC for funding on this project, but BioNexus KC had no direct role in this article.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>data-driven methodology</kwd><kwd>pulmonary symptomology</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>artificial intelligence</kwd><kwd>FDA ADE database</kwd><kwd>COVID-19-related pharmacovigilance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BioNexus KC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wyckoff</surname><given-names>Gerald J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaberi-Douraki</surname><given-names>Majid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative models and data-driven approaches developed for the COVID-19 pandemic and predicting SARS-Cov-2 comorbidities for high-risk populations including hypertension show that the future of large-scale biomedical science will be significantly underscored by data-driven decision-making and AI knowledge-based development and validation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues with 115,094,614 confirmed cases and over 2.6 million deaths as of March 5, 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">WHO, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">WHO, 2021</xref>). Surprisingly, it is estimated that as high as 45% of infected individuals may remain asymptomatic, contributing to disease transmission and underlying the disparity in symptomology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oran and Topol, 2020</xref>). A commonality of severe clinical course and mortality is comorbid conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">CDC, 2019</xref>). Hypertension was recognized early on as being a prevalent risk factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>), possibly due to its pervasiveness. Hypertension affects 23% of adults in China, where the original study was conducted, but affects 45% of US adults. Moreover, specific antihypertensive medications, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), target proteins of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">James et al., 2014</xref>). The RAS is intricately linked to initial infection and possibly the progression of COVID-19 through a RAS receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which acts as the viral entry point of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wiese et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, data science has emerged as a new and important discipline in medicine and healthcare. Different quantitative therapeutic efforts in drug repurposing or repositioning combined with adverse drug event (ADE) identification have led to more efficient therapies while improving the clinical course, lowering fatality, and decreasing cost burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith and Smith, 2021</xref>). The previous work focused on the incidence of pulmonary ADEs associated with ACEI and ARB use in patients with hypertension and other comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stafford et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaberi-Douraki et al., 2021</xref>). The findings indicate that specific drugs—rather than entire classes—have higher incidences of pulmonary ADEs, which may have implications for treating patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Most epidemiological studies are not this granular as they do not analyze drug effects at the individual drug level but rather compare pharmacological classes. The current study examines additional drugs that more broadly target hypertension, including pulmonary hypertension, to describe methods used to identify clinically important patterns of ADE data. We utilized the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system from the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center for Drug Statistics Methodology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.whocc.no/">https://www.whocc.no/</ext-link>). The ATC system classifies drugs based on site of action in addition to chemical, pharmacological, and therapeutic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rønning, 2001</xref>). Here, we identify a clear signal distinct from different drugs in patients with hypertension as an underlying medical condition which helps to quantify the anomaly and unexpectedness of an ADE reported for a drug through disproportionality analysis. For this purpose, we proceeded with a specific pairwise analysis of individual drugs compared to the drug classes using a modified empirical Bayes method to identify any distinctions between drugs within a class and compared to other classes.</p><p>In our previous work, 13 different pulmonary ADEs were selected based on clinical importance, and as they were prevalent among the top reported symptoms in patients with COVID-19, to assess the related variation due to adverse event differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stafford et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaberi-Douraki et al., 2021</xref>). In the present work, we include 25 pulmonary, infectious diseases, or cardiac-associated ADEs. Our novel method identifies extraneous causes of differential reporting including sampling variance and selection biases by reducing the effect of covariates. This method is both adaptive (it removes different covariates for different drugs) and appropriate for the systematic application and routine analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tatonetti et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesize that drugs from the same class based on the ATC classification system could have different ADE profiles. For this purpose, penalized regression method will be used to detect clusters of drugs, may differ from the ATC classification, and will be validated by the Friedman test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Puijenbroek et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zorych et al., 2013</xref>). Safety signals for a specific drug and associated adverse events are then identified and evaluated through different methods, such as the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2001</xref>), the relative reporting ratio (RR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DuMouchel, 1999</xref>), the information component (IC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bate and Evans, 2009</xref>), and the (EBGM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DuMouchel, 1999</xref>). These methods are utilized to calculate the ratio of an ADE compared to the same event occurring with other drugs, however, PRR or RR is more liberal when an event incidence is small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duggirala et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>To derive the desired information from datasets, there are a few main methodological steps in this study.

The FAERS database consists of voluntarily or mandatorily reported ADEs from healthcare professionals, manufacturers, and consumers; encompassing drug-related adverse occurrences pertaining to standard use, medical error, overdose, or product quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, 2014</xref>). ADE reports from FAERS are typically coded in accordance with the preferred term (PT) level of MedDRA. The MedDRA provides an internationally recognized hierarchical terminology (system organ class [SOC], high-level group term (HLGT), HLT, PT, and lowest level term [LLT]) for coding ADE reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mozzicato, 2012</xref>). This study aggregates raw ADE reports to terms from the HLT and SOC levels. ATC classification is likewise an internationally applied hierarchical system for active drug substances based on site of action (organ or system) and mechanistic properties (therapeutic, pharmacological, and chemical). Drugs in this study were grouped according to ATC classification. Data integration into 1DATA occurred through the PostgreSQL 13.2 version (PostgreSQL Global Development Group), which allows concatenation of drug and ADE information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">PostgreSQL, 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Adverse drug event</title><p>ADEs cause approximately 30 billion dollars a year of added healthcare expenses, along with negative—including fatal—health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). The practice of prescribing drugs based on information from drug preapproval labeling may misrepresent or deprecate the incidence and prevalence of specific ADEs. The FDA defines the term ‘adverse event’ as: “any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including the following: an adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from drug overdose whether accidental or intentional; an adverse event occurring from drug abuse; an adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected pharmacological action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">FDA, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">FDA, 2020b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Relative risk</title><p>The main method used in this study, Bayesian shrinkage, is based on a baseline frequency, which is the relative risk or relative reporting ratio<disp-formula id="equ1">.<mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>It compares a drug-ADE count, <italic>N</italic>, to its expected count, <italic>E</italic>.

This figure shows the optimal representation of three active variables in biplots acquired by PCA by diminishing the effect of supplementary variables that have no or little influence on the pulmonary ADEs.

The assessment of drugs or ADEs based on RR is variable because of information that the RR methodology does not include, including underreported or overreported events. To assess the effect that the RR methodology has when a small number of ADE occurrences are compared to the whole database, the fifth percentiles from the lower confidence interval of EBGM (EB05) were used as a very conservative alternative, and the results are compared to RR. This assessment was performed using EBGM, is reported similar to the prevalence evaluation using RR values from above. The frequencies of a single drug having multiple ADEs in HLT groups or a single HLT ADE occurrence in multiple drugs were calculated. It was then found that the top 10 drugs with pulmonary ADEs consisted of AHAs, ATAs, and UAs. Bosentan, tadalafil, treprostinil, and beraprost based on EBGM were ranked substantially higher than their corresponding ranks when using RR, with respect to pulmonary ADEs. This suggests that the conservative, EBGM method with a fifth percentile cut-off will allow for the examination of large datasets of ADEs when high variability is present in the number of ADEs across drugs or drug classes, and still allow for a robust reporting methodology as compared to the RR methodology. This allows analysis of very large sets of drugs and ADEs (such as approximately 500,000×134 matrix here) without loss of sensitivity or imparting an over-emphasis on ADEs from infrequently prescribed drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>GLASSO</title><p>The total number of distinct drugs used by patients with hypertension was 134 after filtering out drugs with very low frequency (&lt;0.001) in the Principle component analysis section.

It was found that few drugs in ACEIs, diuretics, and combinations tended to cause pulmonary issues. More than half of the drugs were in ARBs, AHAs, ATAs, and CCBs when considering two different pulmonary ADEs at the HLT level.

AI-enabled technologies can help in better understanding disease indication occurrence and disease determinants or patterns. Quantitative methods have countlessly been applied in various medical fields of study, for example, measurement of disease frequency, prevalence or incidence; evaluation of source of bias and variation of observational studies; multivariate data analysis of risk factors such as applied logistic regression analysis; machine learning for survival analysis or analysis of time at risk (survival) data; boosting power for clinical trials using AI-assisted analysis, etc. In this study, we aimed to apply AI-driven methodologies involving EBGM and GLASSO techniques in predicting SARS-Cov-2 comorbidity for high-risk populations with hypertension.</p><p>Quantitative methods, that is, PPR, RR, ROR, EBGM have been used to detect signals for spontaneously reported data. After filtering data by quantitative methods, we proposed that selected drug-ADE based on drug association mechanism would be a valuable procedure for clinical review and comparison of similar drugs with similar ADE profiles. In this study, we demonstrated a systematic way of filtering and selecting data that addresses the noise inherent to such data. None of these methods are free from including false-positive and false-negative signals, however, EBGM and the IC are recommended over other quantitative methods when evaluating by mean average precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zorych et al., 2013</xref>). This helped the workflow to build a model to understand the bias-variance tradeoff to achieve a balance between the two desirable but incompatible features. Given the absence of a gold standard, no available method is overwhelmingly better than the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bate and Evans, 2009</xref>). The confirmatory methods proposed in this study (GLASSO and Friedman test) for assessing quantitative methods could reveal the strengths and drawbacks of the methods.</p><p>Drugs from different branches in the 3D plot represent distinctive effects of pulmonary ADEs on the separation. For example, PC3 is dominated by fungal, PC2 by more pleural and vascular, and PC1 by respiratory tract effects (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). PCs were constructed using the expected counts of a drug and a pulmonary ADE through a linear combination. The spatial separation of drugs indicated that drugs at the perimeter of each branch (numbered) performed disparately regarding pulmonary ADE profiles, suggesting they may not best be managed as having ADE profiles defined by their class. This figure shows the optimal representation of three active variables in biplots acquired by PCA by diminishing the effect of supplementary variables that have no or little influence on the pulmonary ADEs. Using the Friedman test, these separated drugs have significant differences between their drug classes and compared to other drug classes.</p><p>The consistency of the Friedman test and GLASSO to capture EBGM signals of drugs used in small and large populations could be a beneficial tool for drug comparative analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2019</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stafford et al., 2020</xref>, have already applied two methods in pharmacovigilance to animal and human data separately. This study proposed and successfully combined penalized regression together with the non-parametric Friedman test in considering to a better visualization of drug-drug and drug-ADE associations. The RR method is widely utilized due to its simplicity and user-friendly processing. RR, however, may be highly variable for small occurrences of an event. The assessment of drugs or ADEs based on RR showed unstable performance, especially for hidden information. The estimates of small occurrences compared to the whole database were also inflated for events. To correct these issues, the fifth percentiles from the lower confidence interval of EBGM (EB05) was introduced to use as a conservative alternative compared to RR.</p><p>EBGM detected that 16 out of 25 pulmonary ADEs in MedDRA databases were associated with macitentan, followed by bosentan with 14 pulmonary ADEs. Both of these drugs belong to the endothelin receptor antagonist class of drugs and are utilized in pulmonary arterial hypertension to prevent vasoconstriction, fibrosis, and inflammation on vascular endothelium and smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lexicomp, 2016</xref>). Both drugs are proposed to curb the pulmonary vascular resistance to prevent right heart failure and death, however, pulmonary ADEs of both drugs can be of major concern compared to the outcomes of several other AHAs utilized in this study. At the same time, because these two medications are used in a disease affecting pulmonary function and commonly reported ADEs to include therapeutic failure, these drugs were not surprising to emerge among the highest with reported pulmonary ADEs and, in fact, they serve to validate the methods utilized in this paper. Conversely, doxazosin and rilmenidine were found to have the least pulmonary ADEs in selected drugs from hypertension patients since only two ADE signals were detected based on EBGM. Although it can be used in hypertension, doxazosin is primarily utilized for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and works by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors in the vascular smooth muscle, resulting in vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lepor et al., 1997</xref>). Additionally, studies in countries outside of the US suggest that rilmenidine, a sympatholytic, has a favorable ADE profile for patients with hypertension and diabetes, it is not approved in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meredith and Reid, 2004</xref>). After excluding GL Cluster 1, almost the same results can be observed for the remaining GL Clusters. It is also worth mentioning here that the results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp5 supp6 supp7 supp8">Supplementary files 3; 5–8</xref>, as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>The second group found by EBGM and GL clustering consisted of two drugs from CCBs (nifedipine) and ARBs (candesartan) grouped in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and showed four similar pulmonary ADEs: parenchymal lung disorders NEC, pneumothorax and pleural effusions NEC, lower respiratory tract inflammatory and immunologic conditions, and fungal lower respiratory tract infections. Several studies based on these drugs showed effective combination and blood pressure lowering effects in patients with hypertension and appeared an improved side effect profile in comparison with single-agent monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasebe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kjeldsen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mancia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujikawa et al., 2005</xref>). This is undoubtedly an interesting finding resulted from the EBGM analysis and demonstrated how these two drugs can be combined and investigated for pharmacokinetic assessment in drug development including bioavailability and bioequivalence, drug safety pharmacovigilance, and efficacy and comparative tolerability of the combination of nifedipine and candesartan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Patterson and Jones, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Midha and McKay, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our previous work showed that quinapril and trandolapril were significantly different from other ACEI and ARB drug classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaberi-Douraki et al., 2021</xref>). Separating from its drug class was initially observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> when the PCA biplot was performed. However, these two drugs will not be present when more precautionary methods are applied for several reasons: (1) The dataset is no longer the same as before which contain only ACEIs or ARB. (2) The methods are very differen. (3) Several other drugs and ADEs are added to the study, 134 as opposed to only 16 drug.(4) In the previous work, the focus was on analyzing 13 pulmonary ADEs at the PT level; however, in the current study, we obtained and compare 25 ADEs in HLT groups and each HLT contains several PT ADEs. To be more accurate, ADEs for the 25 ADEs in HLT groups contain approximately 200 different PT vs. only 13 ADEs. (5) The whole purpose of this study was to use EBGM as a much more accurate method compared to RR and RR estimation is also better than the PRR method used before. (6) The implementation of the filtering process of penalized regression GLASSO helps eliminate the insignificant and noise-driven reports.</p><p>Two drugs, tadalafil and sildenafil, are also used for the modulation of dopaminergic pathways and modifying risk factors to prevent and treat erectile dysfunction. Using the 1DATA database when curating the data for the medicinal products of these drugs and checking their active ingredients of tadalafil and sildenafil, the top products are found to be Adcirca (n = 32446) and Revatio (n = 21,358) marketed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, respectively, and Cialis (n = 15,623) and Viagra (n = 20820) marketed to treat erectile dysfunction, respectively. We also assessed whether these drugs only show up at high doses or not. This also confirmed that the dose has an insignificant effect on the outcome of ADEs, data are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>.</p><p>As part of the future work, it is worth mentioning that this study aimed to reveal the potential risk of patients using hypertensive drugs in terms of pulmonary issues. The 1DATA database will be updated with MedDRA 24.0 that contains the new COVID-19 terms due to its outbreak. It has encouraged the authors to involve terms related to viral infections that facilitate the capture of ADEs caused by COVID-19 in patients with hypertension in the near future. In addition, the pulmonary ADEs of HLT codes in this study were filtered by setting the highest level, SOC, with the focus on respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders (n = 28), and infection class containing viral infection (n = 2). The plan is to include ADEs from the class of blood and lymphatic system disorders such as thrombosis, coagulation, or platelet disorders. In the big data era, as the spontaneous reports from different data sources including the FDA FAERS database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, 2014</xref>), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shimabukuro et al., 2015</xref>), and the WHO International Database are increasing in size; drug profiles-based ADEs can be established based on quantitative methods, retrieving the signals, or detecting new signals in large numbers of reports by different methods with the combination of clinical review is needed for pharmacovigilance.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Validation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>30 pulmonary ADEs.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70734-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Contribution of Pulmonary ADEs in 2D and 3D PCAs.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70734-supp2-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Frequency of pulmonary ADEs when RR larger than two or the 5th quantile of EBGM, EB05, large than two.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70734-supp3-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Description of arc diagram visualization.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70734-supp4-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Comparative analysis of drug and associated pulmonary ADEs in different GLASSO Clusters.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70734-supp5-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Friedman test for drugs in ATC class and GLASSO class.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70734-supp6-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>A.

The goal was to assess SARS-CoV-2 comorbidity among high-risk populations with hypertension. The statistical approach is fundamentally rigorous, although it does contain a series of subjective thresholding decisions (no domain context or specific statistical reason for the decision), particularly in in data processing and filter, that could potentially alter results, particularly for the lower use drug cases. The inability to justify each decision point is not uncommon in big data analysis. Nonetheless, the technical analysis and interpretation of results for the more frequently occurring drugs is robust, supported by statistical analysis, and provides important insights for the planning of future experiments further assessing the etiological mechanisms by which hypertension and/or anti-hypertensive treatment alters the risk and outcome of patients with SARS-CoV-2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70734.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Where possible, please elaborate on thresholds used for analysis in data processing and filtering.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We have tried to address this comment in the Preprocessing and Data Cleaning section of Results and the first part of the Methods section which shows how we performed the data cleaning and apply the thresholds. We have added the explanation in the Method part (lines 142 – 163). Here are some more details about data processing. Briefly, 480,236 spontaneous reports were originally extracted from our database (1131 drugs and 1520 ADEs in HLT).</p><p>a) The first threshold was applied to eliminate reports when the corresponding drugs were reported less than 500 times. The number of drugs was reduced from 1131 to 134. This process only reduced the size of the dataset by 0.1% and we were left by over %99.9 of the data.</p><p>b) Relative risks and EBGM scores were then calculated for 134 drugs. PCAs were performed conditioning on 25 selected pulmonary ADEs.</p><p>c) EB05 &gt; 1 and two different pulmonary ADEs were applied to obtain 44 drugs from 134.</p><p>d) The GLASSO method was then implemented to 44 drugs with pulmonary ADEs to select 22 drugs for the Circos plot and Freidman’s test.</p><p>Above are in the manuscript. The first paragraph of the Results has also explained how we applied the thresholds for the main steps of data processing. Below is the edited part in the Method section (lines 142 – 163):</p><p>1. Working hypothesis: drugs from the same drug class could have different pulmonary ADE profiles affecting outcomes in acute respiratory illness, with potential implications in SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>2. Designing error correction techniques for data scrubbing and retrieval.</p><p>3. Implementing data exploration technique for initial data analysis to visually explore and understand the characteristics of the data from post-marketing drug safety surveillance.</p><p>4. Data curation and annotation to organize and integrate data collected from various sources from the FDA, MedDRA, and ATC classification. This phase entails annotation, organization, clustering, and presentation of the assorted data types from the 1DATA databank.</p><p>5. ADE-associated information retrieval for patients with hypertension provides massive collections of reports to investigate adverse drug events based on comparative population data analysis.

Be sure to carefully state where multiple comparison corrections to the p-value were made and how. This is done in some parts but could be clearer in others.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. The p-value was referred to the situation when we tested the significant difference among all the classes or clusters for pairwise and group comparisons. The adjusted p-value was specific for the pairwise comparison, for which we employed the Bonferroni correction. Some additional statements have been added in the Method part (Lines 275 – 285). Below is the edited part of the Method section:</p><p>“Using SAS (SAS University Edition version 9.4, North Carolina, U.S), sample differences among antihypertensive drug groups according to therapeutic main group ATC (ACEIs, ARBs, BBAs, CCBs, and TDs) were evaluated for a pairwise comparison analysis with the assumption that data were not normally distributed using the non-parametric Friedman test for two independent unequal-sized data. The Friedman test was also applied to perform multiple comparison tests (P-value for statistical significance &lt; 0.05). The p-values in Table 4, Figure 4, and Figure 5, when they are less than 0.05, indicate significant differences across ATC classes or GL clusters. In addition, pairwise comparison analysis was completed in SAS in order to estimate how any two ATC classes differ as well as GL clusters. The significance level of comparing drugs in ATC classes/GL clusters against each other was adjusted using a rigorous paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction to control family-wise type I error(31).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please clarify if clustering was done following dimensionality reduction or whether these were separate steps.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. The clustering referred to the grouping of nodes in Circos plots (Figure 2-B). We have added an explanation in the main text from Lines 424-427:</p><p>“Figure 3A shows the association between the remaining 22 drugs after then the elimination process from the penalized regression GLASSO. It means that the clustering was done after applying the GLASSO method which is a dimensionality reduction method.”</p><p>The bridges between any drugs indicated the clustering. The data used were obtained from the EBGM scores of 22 drugs selected by the GLASSO method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The use of buzz words like &quot;machine learning&quot; and &quot;AI&quot; is over done given the preponderance of work is based in traditional statistics.

But the fact is that we used data mining and data analytics as parts of artificial intelligence and machine learning for the extraction of messy, incomplete, implicit, or previously unknown information for potentially useful data in all of the places in the work. EBGM and GLASSO involve statistical learning. Data mining techniques are the core procedure we have applied to other parts of this study. That’s why we referred to it as “machine learning” and “AI”.

This is due to the limit of words for the abstract, we can only partially explain our method. Below is the edited part of the abstract:</p><p>“Data from patients with hypertension were retrieved and integrated from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. 134 antihypertensive drugs out of 1151 drugs were filtered and then evaluated using the Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) of the posterior distribution to build ADE-drug profiles with an emphasis on the pulmonary ADEs (pADE). Afterward, the Graphical Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (GLASSO) captured drug associations based on pADEs by correcting hidden factors and confounder misclassification. Selected drugs were then compared using the Friedman test in drug classes and clusters obtained from GLASSO.” (Lines 31-38)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.
