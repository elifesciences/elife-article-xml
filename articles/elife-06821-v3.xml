determinants of differentiation such as cell shape and/or seeding density inform this transcriptional program remain enigmatic. Here, we uncover a novel mechanism licensing transcription in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) adipogenically primed by confluence. Prior to adipogenesis, confluency promotes heterodimer recruitment of the bZip TFs C/EBPβ and ATF4 to a non-canonical C/EBP DNA sequence. ATF4 depletion decreases both cell-density-dependent transcription and adipocyte differentiation. Global profiling in hMSCs and a novel cell-free assay reveals that ATF4 requires C/EBPβ for genomic binding at a motif distinct from that bound by the C/EBPβ homodimer. Our observations demonstrate that C/EBPβ bridges the transcriptional programs in naïve, confluent cells and early differentiating pre-adipocytes. Moreover, they suggest that homo- and heterodimer formation poise C/EBPβ to execute diverse and stage-specific transcriptional programs by exploiting an expanded motif repertoire.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06821.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06821.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06821.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human body fat consists mostly of fat-storing cells called adipocytes. These cells develop in two main steps. First, mesenchymal stem cells—which can potentially become one of many different types of cell—commit to becoming pre-adipocyte cells. These pre-adipocytes then develop into mature adipocytes. Proteins called transcription factors control both steps of this process by binding to particular sites in the DNA of the cell and activating certain genes that control the cell's identity and activity.</p><p>Various different transcription factors are known to stimulate the development of mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes. Experiments performed on cells that have been grown in the laboratory suggest that the cells must also be tightly packed together to become adipocytes.</p><p>Cohen et al. have now investigated the role a protein called C/EBPβ plays in the development of adipocytes, and have found that it plays different roles at different stages of development. When mesenchymal stem cells become tightly packed, more of another protein called ATF4 is produced. This protein binds to C/EBPβ, and the resulting two-protein complex then binds to sites on the DNA of the mesenchymal stem cell to activate genes that turn the stem cell into a pre-adipocyte. Reducing the amount of ATF4 in mesenchymal stem cells reduces the number of pre-adipocytes that develop.</p><p>When not bound to ATF4, and in response to certain cell signals, C/EBPβ binds to different DNA sites and helps pre-adipocytes develop into mature adipocytes. Whether transcription factors other than ATF4 partner with C/EBPβ to change DNA-binding-site preferences remains unknown. Future studies will search for these, with the aim of providing a clearer molecular understanding for how C/EBPβ acts as a ‘bridge’ that links together the two stages of adipocyte development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06821.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06821.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>adipogenesis</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32 HL084966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Daniel M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 DK098769</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Won</surname><given-names>Kyoung-Jae</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK49780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lazar</surname><given-names>Mitchell A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM074048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Christopher S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK098542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steger</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcription factor C/EBPβ binds to different DNA sequences depending on whether it binds to ATF4, which enables C/EBPβ to conduct diverse transcriptional programs during adipocyte differentiation by exploiting an expanded motif repertoire.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Post-mitotic adipocytes arise from the differentiation of MSCs in a process termed adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cristancho and Lazar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44a">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>). The cell-fate decisions occurring during the stages of adipogenesis are controlled by multiple sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farmer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cristancho and Lazar, 2011</xref>). Best described among these are PPARγ and C/EBP TFs, which drive a process of terminal differentiation that results in the expression of metabolic genes and adipokines important for the adipocyte phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hwang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lefterova and Lazar, 2009</xref>). PPARγ is recognized as a master regulator because it is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kubota et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosen et al., 1999</xref>) and sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tontonoz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shao and Lazar, 1997</xref>) for adipogenesis. C/EBP proteins can also induce adipocyte differentiation of fibroblasts, although none can induce differentiation in the absence of PPARγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosen et al., 2002</xref>). Cistromic analyses have revealed that PPARγ and C/EBPα occupy sites near most of the genes that are up-regulated during adipogenesis, including their own, suggesting that they coordinate expression of the majority of genes determining adipocyte function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lefterova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mikkelsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soccio et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the transcriptional circuitry formed by PPARγ and C/EBPα may explain how adipocyte cell identity is established and maintained.</p><p>Genomics studies have provided important new insights into the TFs acting before PPARγ and C/EBPα.

Here, we use this cell density ‘checkpoint’ as a means to identify transcriptional mechanisms that prime cells to a permissive pre-adipogenic state. We identify on a genome-wide scale putative enhancer and promoter regions with differential occupancy for RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) in response to changes in cell density and treatment with DMI cocktail. The findings support roles for C/EBPβ and GR as primary drivers of DMI-induced gene expression.</p><p>We also observe a surprising enrichment for C/EBPβ-binding sites at RNAPII enhancers responding to high-seeding density prior to the addition of DMI cocktail. While lacking a canonical, palindromic C/EBPβ motif, these enhancers exhibit dramatic enrichment for an asymmetric, composite motif that juxtaposes half-sites for canonical C/EBP and AP-1 motifs. We demonstrate that these hybrid motifs recruit C/EBPβ as a heterodimer with another bZIP family member, ATF4. Genome-wide binding by ATF4 demonstrates its exclusive co-localization with C/EBPβ, and depletion of ATF4 decreases adipogenesis. Together, these observations suggest that a program of C/EBPβ-ATF4-dependent gene expression triggered by high-seeding density plays an important role in priming hMSCs for adipogenesis. The observation that C/EBPβ hetero- and homodimeric complexes exhibit different sequence specificities provides novel mechanistic insights into how C/EBPβ can be differentially targeted to control distinct programs of gene expression at distinct phases of adipocyte differentiation, and revises the prevailing view that C/EBPβ is transcriptionally inactive in the absence of exogenous adipogenic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wiper-Bergeron et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raghav et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of regulated enhancers during hMSC differentiation</title><p>RNAPII is recruited to active enhancers on a global scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Szutorisz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), and we performed RNAPII ChIP-seq in primary hMSCs to annotate putative cis-acting regulatory elements during human adipocyte differentiation.

To address this idea, we placed several RNAPII-annotated regions that are targeted by C/EBPβ and harbor either a hybrid or canonical motif into luciferase reporters, and assayed their activity in response to DMI cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, reporters carrying the hybrid motif had reduced in activity in the presence of DMI, while those with the canonical C/EBP sequence were increased by DMI. Moreover, the hybrid motif mediates transcriptional activity since targeted mutation of either the hybrid sequence specifically (Hyb-) or the C/EBP motif generally (C/EBP-) lowered luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To further test the functional significance of C/EBP motifs in regulating gene transcription, we quantified mRNAs for genes with nearby RNAPII-annotated regions bound by C/EBPβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with the changes in both RNAPII occupancy and the luciferase reporters, genes associated with the hybrid motif showed decreased expression upon DMI stimulation. In contrast, genes associated with the canonical C/EBP motif (<italic>AKR1C1</italic>, <italic>ALOX15b</italic>, <italic>FKBP5</italic>, <italic>HSD11b1</italic>, and <italic>ZBTB16</italic>) were activated by DMI treatment along with a control adipocyte marker (<italic>PDK4</italic>). As a whole, these findings suggest that C/EBPβ targets a non-canonical C/EBP motif to activate HD-primed enhancers. Furthermore, although the addition of DMI cocktail increases C/EBPβ occupancy globally, including sites associated with the HD-primed enhancers, it reduces the activity of the HD-primed enhancers while inducing enhancers harboring canonical C/EBP motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ATF4 is a density-dependent factor that targets HD-primed enhancers as a heterodimer with C/EBPβ</title><p>Hybrid motifs recruit C/EBP TFs as heterodimers with bZip proteins from the AP-1 or ATF families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shuman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wolfgang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2008</xref>).

To map ATF4-binding sites on a genome-wide scale, we performed ChIP-seq in pre-adipocyte hMSCs (HD, without DMI), and identified 1451 discrete ATF4 peaks. Remarkably, ATF4 binds almost exclusively with C/EBPβ, with more than 90% of its sites co-localized with C/EBPβ-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, motif analysis shows an extraordinary level of sequence specificity at ATF4 binding sites, with strong nucleotide selection at nearly every position of the core hybrid motif, and extremely high concordance between the presence of ATF4 and the hybrid motif, with 85% of peaks containing the recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

ATF4 occupies sites near all of the genes observed in the HD-primed clusters that function in amino acid transport and metabolism and tRNA aminoacylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Relative to C/EBPβ, ATF4 occupies sites that are highly enriched for RNAPII, with the majority of these falling in the HD-primed clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Thus, ATF4 is intimately tied to HD-primed RNAPII, implicating it in the activation of gene transcription in response to high-cell-density seeding of hMSCs. These data also imply that ATF4 abundance may be regulated by cell density. Indeed, western analysis revealed that while ATF4 levels in uncommitted LD cells were negligible, ATF4 was up-regulated in response to high-cell-seeding density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, upon addition of DMI cocktail, ATF4 expression diminished modestly at 3 hr and prominently by 24 hr. As expected, C/EBPβ showed a rapid and sustained induction by DMI in hMSCs. To determine if ATF4 genomic occupancy was correlated with its abundance, we performed ChIP in cells cultured at LD or HD with or without DMI treatment. ATF4 occupancy at hybrid sites was strongly reduced in either untreated LD hMSCs or DMI-treated HD hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). C/EBPβ, in contrast, bound to the hybrid sites irrespective of the cell seeding conditions. Concomitant with C/EBPβ up-regulation by differentiation cocktail, a trend of increased binding was apparent in the DMI condition. These observations indicate that ATF4 protein level is modulated by signals derived from both cell density and DMI cocktail, leading to functional interaction with C/EBPβ in primed hMSCs as well as early in adipogenesis.</p><p>Essentially no ATF4 peaks were observed that lack co-bound C/EBPβ, suggesting heterodimer binding. To interrogate whether ATF4 and C/EBPβ can simultaneously occupy the same genomic loci, we performed sequential ChIP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). After an initial ChIP for C/EBPβ, ATF4 binding was highly enriched relative to the IgG control at all sites containing a hybrid motif, while no such enrichment occurred at control sites where C/EBPβ binds independently of ATF4 (PPARγ) or is absent (INS). Together, the data demonstrate ATF4 is a density-dependent TF that co-localizes with HD-primed enhancers in hMSCs by targeting the hybrid motif as a heterodimer with C/EBPβ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Loss of ATF4 attenuates adipogenesis and cell-density-dependent transcription</title><p>To investigate whether ATF4 regulates adipocyte differentiation, we depleted its expression in primary hMSCs, and in the well-characterized mouse pre-adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Transient transfection with ATF4 siRNAs decreased the level of Oil Red O staining relative to controls, indicating lower lipid accumulation in the ATF4 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In parallel, early markers of adipogenesis were decreased threefold–fourfold in ATF4 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), including the mRNAs encoding the lineage-determining TFs PPARγ2 and C/EBPα, as well as several of their downstream transcriptional targets. This deficit in adipogenic gene expression became more pronounced over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and together, these data suggest that ATF4 expression is important for adipogenesis. To better define the role of ATF4, we measured genomic binding in ATF4 knockdown cells. As expected, ATF4 occupancy was significantly reduced at all sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Notably, RNAPII occupancy was diminished at all but one of the ATF4-binding sites, and most of these showed a significant reduction, indicating that ATF4 functions to recruit RNAPII. C/EBPβ binding was decreased at all sites, but reached significance at a minority, which is not surprising given that C/EBPβ can occupy these sites under conditions with little or no ATF4 binding. These data establish ATF4 as a novel density-dependent TF that transduces signals from multiple pro-adipogenic stimuli including cell density and DMI cocktail to program the activity of HD-primed enhancers and promote adipocyte differentiation.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06821.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>ATF4 promotes adipocyte differentiation and density-dependent transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ATF4 knockdown in hMSCs and 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes assessed by western blotting.

This stage-specific gene expression program is driven by robust sequence-specificity of the C/EBPβ-ATF4 heterodimer, such that it preferentially occupies hybrid sequences relative to the C/EBPβ homodimer, with ATF4's genomic function tied exclusively to C/EBPβ. Whether these findings are emergent properties of the intrinsic DNA-binding specificities of ATF4, C/EBPβ and the C/EBPβ-ATF4 heterodimer or result from other mechanisms is unknown.

Genomic DNA was purified from hMSCs, stripped of protein, and sonicated to a relatively homogenous population of 250 bp fragments. Akin to EMSA, recombinant TFs and isolated DNA were interrogated via solution phase binding. Samples were processed subsequently in a manner similar to ChIP-seq using immunoprecipitation to isolate non-crosslinked protein-DNA complexes followed by analysis of bound DNA by next generation sequencing. A similar in vitro cistromics assay (IVC) has successfully examined TF binding with <italic>Drosophila</italic> components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guertin et al., 2012</xref>).

The total number of bound sites exceeding a 1 RPM threshold plateaued near the low end of the C/EBPβ titration, and gained sites at the upper end of the titration had lower binding strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that the addition of more protein drives binding to low-affinity DNA sites. In support of this, de novo motif analyses revealed stronger enrichment of the C/EBP motif at the top-ranked sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Yet, the C/EBP motif was the top-ranked sequence for both the strongest and weakest sites, indicating appropriate specificity for the C/EBPβ homodimer even at the higher protein levels. We anticipated that the number of C/EBPβ-binding sites observed in vitro would exceed that found in cells due to the removal of accessibility barriers imposed by chromatin. To test this, we examined the level of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), a marker of active transcription and open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stasevich et al., 2014</xref>), in hMSCs at regions bound by C/EBPβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Upon addition of ATF4, C/EBPβ exhibited reduced occupancy of C/EBPβ-homodimer sites and de novo binding at sites not represented in the homodimer cistromes generated with higher C/EBPβ concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, tracks 1–4). Induced C/EBPβ-binding sites displayed parallel enrichment for ATF4 occupancy (tracks 5 and 6). Motif analysis showed robust enrichment of the hybrid motif at these sites, reproducing the exquisite specificity mapped in the hMSC ATF4 cistrome. Remarkably, ATF4 by itself exhibited no detectable binding to these regions (track 7), demonstrating that its interaction with the genome is exclusively heterodimeric. In total, we identified 111 peaks in the ATF4 homodimer cistrome, and these were enriched for multimers of a c-JUN motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). These rare sites are not occupied by ATF4 in hMSCs, revealing that homodimeric binding by ATF4 may not be physiological. Together, the EMSA and in vitro cistromics experiments demonstrate that the DNA-binding properties of ATF4 and C/EBPβ are sufficient to reconstitute their sequence specificities observed in cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data reveal that C/EBPβ controls distinct gene expression programs in hMSCs at different stages of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

High cell density has long been known to be an important condition for adipocyte differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Green and Kehinde, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pittenger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McBeath et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cristancho et al., 2011</xref>). It is likely that a combination of cues is required in tissue microenvironments supporting adipogenesis in vivo. ATF4 joins a small, yet growing list of TFs that confer adipogenic competency. A major block in identifying TFs controlling the formation of pre-adipocyte cells is the lack of molecular markers distinguishing naïve hMSCs from committed pre-adipocytes. Nevertheless, several candidate TFs have been identified in murine cell culture models. ZFP423 is expressed almost exclusively in adipogenic fibroblasts, and is necessary for adipocyte differentiation in vitro and for the development of adipose tissue in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>). TCF7L1 promotes commitment of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to a pre-adipocyte state in response to cell confluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cristancho et al., 2011</xref>). KAISO, in contrast, represses pre-adipocyte differentiation by recruiting the co-repressor SMRT to promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raghav et al., 2012</xref>). Each of these studies marks an important advance in understanding pre-adipocyte biology, yet it remains unclear as to how, or if, these pre-adipocyte TFs functionally interact with each other or with the TFs responding to adipogenic signals. Here, the identification of the C/EBPβ-ATF4 heterodimer points to a mechanism that connects adipogenic competency and early differentiation through the sharing of C/EBPβ.</p><p>Mice lacking ATF4 are lean and resist diet-induced obesity, although they have adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masuoka and Townes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seo et al., 2009</xref>). Our demonstration of a role for ATF4 in adult stem cell adipocyte differentiation suggest that this regulatory mechanism could be especially relevant in adult adipose tissue, consistent with the recent demonstration that adipogenesis occurs via distinct cell lineages during development vs adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). Depletion of ATF4 in 3T3-L1 cells blocks adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). ATF4 is also required for the development of blood and bone cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masuoka and Townes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seo et al., 2009</xref>). It is of interest to note that ATF4 plays a central role in handling ER stress induced by amino acid imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kilberg et al., 2009</xref>), and accumulating evidence indicates that ER stress pathways couple obesity to other metabolic dysfunctions such as diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ozcan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scheuner and Kaufman, 2008</xref>), suggesting that ATF4 may regulate lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Our observation that ATF4 regulates similar biological processes in hMSCs primed for differentiation may suggest an anticipatory response to meet an increased demand for protein synthesis during adipogenesis.</p><p>The binding profiles of ATF4 and C/EBPβ in hMSCs can be explained by the inherent sequence specificities of the homo- and heterodimeric complexes. First, genomic binding of ATF4 requires heterodimerization with C/EBPβ. While elegant biochemical studies have demonstrated the propensity of ATF4 and C/EBPβ to heterodimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinson et al., 1993</xref>), early studies also reported DNA-binding activity for ATF4 homodimers at palindromic cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vinson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Podust et al., 2001</xref>). In this light, our finding of a paucity of ATF4 homodimeric sites is unexpected, and indicates that while such interactions may be detectable when the relative concentration of the motif is high, the affinity of ATF4 homodimers for the CRE sequence is insufficient to produce binding in cells, or in vitro when a large amount of competitor DNA is present. In support of these coclusions, PBM-based assays failed to identify a robust motif for ATF4 homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weirauch et al., 2014</xref>), whereas HT-SELEX assays showed robust sequence preference of ATF4 for hybrid motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The IVC demonstrates that C/EBPβ and ATF4 target distinct DNA half sites, TTRS and TGAT, respectively. The relative plasticity of C/EBPβ homodimer in accommodating multiple DNA sequence variants is borne out in vivo, as the top motif associated with the cellular C/EBPβ cistrome shows considerable degeneracy at the −1 and −2 positions. In contrast, the C/EBPβ-ATF4 heterodimer is restricted to hybrid motifs of two inverted half-sites, TTRSATCA. Thus the biochemical properties of the heterodimer are sufficient to explain the nearly 1:1 correspondence between ATF4 binding and the presence of hybrid motifs in vivo. Interestingly, ATF4 heterodimerizes with the C/EBP related protein, CHOP, in the context of ER stress to bind hybrid motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that while heterodimerization is required for DNA binding, the specific C/EBP partner can vary in different biological contexts.</p><p>C/EBPβ homodimers bind to hybrid sequences with low affinity relative to the C/EBPβ-ATF4 heterodimer, and this interaction requires elevated protein concentrations. DMI-treated hMSCs show persistent occupancy of the hybrid sites by C/EBPβ despite low ATF4 levels. An interesting possibility is that persistent binding is attributable to the elevated C/EBPβ concentrations in differentiating cells, however the effects of DMI-induced post-translational modification of C/EBPβ on homodimer binding cannot be excluded. Notably, robust RNAPII recruitment at hybrid sites was observed in cells only in the presence of ATF4. Thus, hetero vs homodimeric binding may have important consequences for licensing transcription activity, especially under conditions where the basal activity of C/EBPβ is limiting, possibly due to associated repressor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wiper-Bergeron et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raghav et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our findings may have broad impact on the understanding of bZip TFs that readily form different dimer pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vinson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Newman and Keating, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reinke et al., 2013</xref>), as well as TF families using other structural domains for the formation of homo- and heterodimeric protein complexes. By analogy with the C/EBPβ-ATF4 heterodimer, other C/EBPβ-bZip heterodimers may selectively recognize non-degenerate DNA sequences, which could illuminate fundamental rules governing their operation on a genome scale, and help to explain discrepancies between the palindromic C/EBP motif identified in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weirauch et al., 2014</xref>) and the ChIP-seq motif with substantial variation at the central positions. Consistent with this paradigm, heterodimers displaying greatest affinity for TGACGCAA, which differs from the C/EBPβ-ATF4 motif by single T/C substitution at the fourth position, were observed through forced expression of C/EBPα with either c-JUN or c-FOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2011</xref>) and inferred from DNase I footprinting in 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siersbæk et al., 2014a</xref>). We propose that the degenerate C/EBP motif observed in cells results from the binding of different homo- and heterodimeric protein complexes with distinct sequence specificities. Because C/EBP proteins are widely expressed with additional bZip family members, determining how they target the genome is critical to understanding their control of basic processes including cell growth and development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>hMSCs were obtained from Lonza and maintained in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine. hMSCs were used at passages 4 through 7.

To eliminate artifacts introduced by regions of low ChIP signals caused by poor mappability, regions of no RNAPII sequence coverage were masked based on their mappability scores from the ENCODE Duke Uniqueness 35 bp track. Masked regions (low mappability, low ChIP signal) that were juxtaposed to bins with enriched RNAPII signal were assigned an interpolated USHP score, that is, the average USHP score of adjacent upstream and downstream bins unaffected by mappability. RNAPII data were smoothened by recalculating USHP scores as the moving average of a 60 bp window centered on each 20 bp bin. Genomic regions with high sequencing depth in the input (no ChIP) tracks were subtracted from the RNAPII data to remove false positive peaks. Finally, each bin was assigned a ‘USHP slope’ score computed from the difference of the USHP values for the bin lying 60 bp downstream vs the bin 60 bp upstream divided by the intervening bp length (100 bp internally).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-6-2"><title>RNAPII feature detection</title><p>RNAPII features were defined as the intervals spanning regions of increasing USHP slopes paired to regions of decreasing USHP slopes.

Each positive sloping region was joined with the nearest downstream negative slope region, with a maximum cutoff distance of 400 bp between the 3′ and 5′ ends of the positively and negatively sloping regions. Adjacent RNAPII features were then evaluated for peak merging based on the peak to trough ratios (rations &lt; 2.5 were merged), such that complex RNAPII features comprised of poorly resolved multiplets were treated as a single feature. To evaluate enrichment of sequence reads within the putative RNAPII features, features within 2 kb were clustered, and these domains expanded to ±1 kb to sample the local RNAPII background. Peak-associated bins within these domains were masked and the average USHP signal per bin in the local neighborhood computed. RNAPII features with USHP maxima that were 3.5-fold greater than the mean of non-peak associated local USHP bins were used in subsequent analyses. In addition, RNAPII features intervals were subject to a signal threshold requiring a tag count of ≥20 per feature or a tag density of at least 14.5 sequence tags per bp.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Stephen Farmer, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All the reviewers considered your studies to be well executed. However, a major concern is the biological relevance of the reported discovery, in particular the role of cell density or confluence as a “trigger” during adipogenesis in vivo. If the authors would like to make the argument that this mechanism relates specifically to adipogenesis their data are incomplete. ATF4 knockout mice have adipose tissue although they are leaner and resist diet induced obesity, but there is little evidence they have a defect in adipogenesis. It would appear from a number of studies that ATF4 plays a more important role in regulating energy metabolism than in directly affecting adipogenesis. In fact, the authors never directly assess adipogenesis but rather lipid accumulation, which can be affected by altering cellular metabolism. The authors should attempt to distinguish between the two: it would be relatively straightforward to examine the cells metabolically, for instance flux analysis, metabolomics, simple glycolysis assays. Without some attempt to distinguish between a differentiation phenotype and a cellular metabolic phenotype many of the conclusions about adipogenesis are not supported by the data. Furthermore, in addition to measuring oil droplet accumulation a qPCR survey of dynamic adipocyte differentiation marker expression should be conducted to elucidate the block in greater detail.</p><p>A previous study by Yu et al. (cited in the manuscript) has suggested that ATF4 controls expression of C/EBPβ and PPARγ through promoter binding in a 3T3 model. The current manuscript suggests a model where ATF4 binding at enhancer elements is critical. Can the authors distinguish these two models experimentally, e.g. through rescue of adipogenesis in ATF knockdown cells through C/EBPβ overexpression?</p><p>The authors describe 1451 ATF4 ChIP-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that are found in HD MSC cells. Presumably, the peaks fall mainly within cluster 10-11 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> since there is an enrichment of the hybrid motif, but it is hard to follow if the ATF4 binding events also exhibit a certain GO enrichment which could clarify the biological context ATF4 binding (or absence thereof) might have. The manuscript might greatly benefit from a clearer analysis and display of ATF4-binding events/hybrid motif usage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06821.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All the reviewers considered your studies to be well executed.

We have made the following modification to the second paragraph of the discussion to provide a reference point for readers: This study identifies ATF4 as a cell density sensor that links the physical and chemical requirements for adipogenesis. High cell density has long been known to be an important condition for adipocyte differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cristancho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Green and Kehinde, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McBeath et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pittenger et al., 1999</xref>). It is likely that a combination of cues is required in tissue microenvironments supporting adipogenesis in vivo.</p><p>Regarding adipogenesis in ATF4 knockout mice, we agree and make the following modification to the Discussion’s third paragraph: Mice lacking ATF4 are lean and resist diet-induced obesity, although they have adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masuoka and Townes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). Our demonstration of a role for ATF4 in adult stem cell adipocyte differentiation suggest that this regulatory mechanism could be especially relevant in adult adipose tissue, consistent with the recent demonstration that adipogenesis occurs via distinct cell lineages during development versus adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>In fact, the authors never directly assess adipogenesis but rather lipid accumulation, which can be affected by altering cellular metabolism. The authors should attempt to distinguish between the two: it would be relatively straightforward to examine the cells metabolically, for instance flux analysis, metabolomics, simple glycolysis assays. Without some attempt to distinguish between a differentiation phenotype and a cellular metabolic phenotype many of the conclusions about adipogenesis are not supported by the data. Furthermore, in addition to measuring oil droplet accumulation a qPCR survey of dynamic adipocyte differentiation marker expression should be conducted to elucidate the block in greater detail</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point; clarifying how ATF4 affects lipid accumulation in response to adipogenic signals improves the study. To directly address adipogenesis, we measured the expression of key differentiation markers in hMSCs with normal and reduced levels of ATF4. Transcriptional activation of <italic>PPARγ</italic> and <italic>C/EBPα</italic>, both encoding adipose-determining transcription factors, is significantly decreased in hMSCs depleted for ATF4 in response to adipogenic signals. Several downstream gene targets important for adipocyte differentiation also have reduced expression, suggesting that ATF4 affects lipid accumulation by promoting adipogenesis. These data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and referred to in the subsection headed “Loss of ATF4 Attenuates Adipogenesis and Cell-Density-Dependent Transcription” as follows: In parallel, early markers of adipogenesis were decreased 3-4-fold in ATF4 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), including the mRNAs encoding the lineage-determining TFs PPARγ2 and C/EBPα, as well as several of their downstream transcriptional targets. This deficit in adipogenic gene expression became more pronounced over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>), and together, these data suggest that ATF4 expression is important for adipogenesis.</p><p><italic>A previous study by Yu et al. (cited in the manuscript) has suggested that ATF4 controls expression of C/EBPβ and PPARγ through promoter binding in a 3T3 model. The current manuscript suggests a model where ATF4 binding at enhancer elements is critical. Can the authors distinguish these two models experimentally, e.g. through rescue of adipogenesis in ATF knockdown cells through C/EBPβ overexpression</italic>?</p><p>Our data do not indicate that ATF4 directly regulates <italic>C/EBPβ</italic> or <italic>PPARγ</italic> expression. Both mRNA and protein for C/EBPβ appear unchanged in hMSCs depleted of ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). It should be noted that Yu et al. report ATF4 binding by ChIP to cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) in the <italic>Cebpβ</italic> (-152 to 0) and <italic>Pparγ</italic> (-360 to -58) promoters as evidence for direct regulation of these genes, yet ATF4 displays little or no interaction with the CRE motif in unbiased genome-wide studies from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Nature Cell Biology 2013. doi:10.1038/ncb2738) and hMSCs (this work).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06821.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(A) C/EBPβ gene expression in HD hMSCs treated with control (PPIB) or ATF4 siRNAs.

However, rather than restoring function, forced expression of C/EBPβ under ATF4 knockdown conditions will yield abnormally high C/EBPβ levels, limiting the interpretation of any potential effects on adipogenesis. Forced C/EBPβ expression has been shown by the Spiegelman and Farmer labs to trigger adipogenesis in NIH-3T3 cells, likely by overwhelming and/or overriding the system and obviating the need for pre-adipocyte-specific transcription. Thus, we do not believe that this experiment can resolve how ATF4 contributes to adipogenic commitment.</p><p><italic>The authors describe 1451 ATF4 ChIP-seq peaks (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) that are found in HD MSC cells.

GO results derived from mapping ATF4-binding sites to nearby genes are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>. They are similar to the GO results obtained from the HD-primed RNAPII sites. To provide a clearer display of the relationship between ATF4 and RNAPII genomic occupancy, we determined the fraction of ATF4 or C/EBPβ sites that co-localize with RNAPII, and present the results as pie charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref>. Description of these data has been added the following to the second paragraph of the subsection headed “ATF4 Is a Density-Dependent Factor that Targets HD-primed Enhancers as a Heterodimer with C/EBPβ”: “Genomic occupancy of ATF4 is associated predominantly with genes […] in response to high-cell-density seeding of hMSCs.”</p><p>We have also expanded the third paragraph of the Discussion based on these results as follows: “It is of interest to note that ATF4 plays a central role […] demand for protein synthesis during adipogenesis.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
