chloride channel TMEM16A is a member of a conserved protein family that comprises ion channels and lipid scramblases. Although the structure of the scramblase nhTMEM16 has defined the architecture of the family, it was unknown how a channel has adapted to cope with its distinct functional properties. Here we have addressed this question by the structure determination of mouse TMEM16A by cryo-electron microscopy and a complementary functional characterization. The protein shows a similar organization to nhTMEM16, except for changes at the site of catalysis. There, the conformation of transmembrane helices constituting a membrane-spanning furrow that provides a path for lipids in scramblases has changed to form an enclosed aqueous pore that is largely shielded from the membrane. Our study thus reveals the structural basis of anion conduction in a TMEM16 channel and it defines the foundation for the diverse functional behavior in the TMEM16 family.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26232.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26232.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26232.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell membranes are made up of two layers of oily molecules, called lipids, embedded with a variety of proteins. Each type of membrane protein carries out a particular activity for the cell, and many are involved in transporting other molecules from one side of the membrane to the other.</p><p>The TMEM16 proteins are a large family of membrane proteins. Most are known as lipid scramblases and move lipids between the two layers of the membrane. However, some TMEM16 proteins transport ions in or out of the cell, and are instead called ion channels. TMEM16 proteins are found in animals, plants and fungi but not bacteria, and play key roles in many biological activities that keep these organisms alive. For example, in humans, ion channels belonging to the TMEM16 family help keep the lining of the lung moist, and allow muscles in the gut to contract.</p><p>The structure of a scramblase shows that two protein units interact, with each unit containing a furrow that spans the membrane, through which lipids can move from one layer to the other. However, to date, the shape of a TMEM16 ion channel has not been determined. It was therefore not clear how a protein with features that let it transport large, oily molecules like lipids had evolved to transport small, charged particles instead.</p><p>TMEM16A is a member of the TMEM16 family that transports negatively charged chloride ions. Using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, Paulino et al. have determined the three-dimensional shape of the version of TMEM16A from a mouse. Overall, TMEM16A is organized similarly to the lipid scramblase. However, some parts of the TMEM16A protein have undergone rearrangements such that the membrane-exposed furrow that provides a path for lipids in scramblases is now partially sealed in TMEM16A. This results in an enclosed pore that is largely shielded from the oily membrane and through which ions can pass. Additionally, biochemical analysis suggests that TMEM16A forms a narrow pore that may widen towards the side facing the inside of the cell, though further work is needed to understand if this is relevant to the protein’s activity.</p><p>The three-dimensional structure of TMEM16A reveals how the protein’s architecture differs from other family members working as lipid scramblases. It also gives insight into how TMEM16 proteins might work as ion channels. These findings can now form a strong basis for future studies into the activity of TMEM16 proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26232.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26232.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Ligand Gated Ion Channels</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>patch-clamp electrophsiology</kwd><kwd>ion permeation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>339116 AnoBest</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutzler</surname><given-names>Raimund</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006447</institution-id><institution>Universität Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Forschungskredit FK-16-036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulino</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-particle cryo-EM and electrophysiology studies of the chloride channel TMEM16A reveals the structural basis for anion conduction and uncover its relationship to lipid scramblases of the same family.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) are important constituents of diverse physiological processes, ranging from epithelial chloride secretion to the control of electrical excitability in smooth muscles and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hartzell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oh and Jung, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014</xref>). These ligand-gated ion channels are activated upon an increase of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration as a consequence of cellular signaling events. Although CaCC function can be accomplished by unrelated protein architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kane Dickson et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kunzelmann et al., 2009</xref>), the so far best-characterized processes are mediated by the protein TMEM16A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caputo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). TMEM16A is a member of the large TMEM16 family of membrane proteins, also known as anoctamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). The family is exclusively found in eukaryotes and contains 10 paralogs in mammals that all share considerable sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Milenkovic et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although it was initially anticipated that all TMEM16 proteins would function as anion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hartzell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), it is now generally accepted that only two family members (the closely related TMEM16A and B) are ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pifferi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scudieri et al., 2012</xref>), whereas most others work as lipid scramblases, which catalyze the passive and bidirectional diffusion of lipids between the two leaflets of a phospholipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Whitlock and Hartzell, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2016</xref>).</p><p>The TMEM16 family shows a new protein fold, as revealed by the structure of the fungal homologue nhTMEM16, which functions as lipid scramblase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>). nhTMEM16 consists of structured cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal components and a transmembrane domain (TMD) containing 10 transmembrane helices. As general for the TMEM16 family, the protein is a homo-dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fallah et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sheridan et al., 2011</xref>) with each subunit containing its own lipid translocation path located at the two opposite corners of a rhombus-shaped protein distant from the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>). This lipid path is formed by the ‘subunit cavity’, a membrane-spanning furrow of appropriate size to harbor a lipid headgroup. Since the subunit cavity is exposed to the membrane, it was proposed that its polar surface provides a favorable environment for lipid headgroups on their way across the membrane, whereas the fatty-acid chains remain embedded in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>). In the vicinity of each subunit cavity, within the membrane-embedded domain, a conserved regulatory calcium-binding site controls the activity of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>). In light of the nhTMEM16 structure and the strong sequence conservation within the family, a central open question concerns how the TMEM16A architecture has adapted to account for its altered functional properties. Previous results suggested that the same region constituting the scrambling path also forms the ion conduction pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). However, in what way the distinct structural features of a scramblase, which allows the diffusion of a large and amphiphilic substrate, are altered in a channel that facilitates the transmembrane movement of a comparably small and charged anion, remained a matter of controversy.</p><p>Here we have resolved this controversy by the structure determination of mouse TMEM16A (mTMEM16A) by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at 6.6 Å resolution and a complementary electrophysiological characterization of pore mutants. Our data define the general architecture of a calcium-activated chloride channel of the TMEM16 family and reveal its relationship to the majority of family members working as lipid scramblases. The protein shows a similar overall fold and dimeric organization as the lipid scramblase nhTMEM16. However, conformational rearrangements of helices lining the lipid scrambling path have sealed the subunit cavity, resulting in the formation of a protein-enclosed ion conduction pore that is for most parts shielded from the membrane but that might be partly accessible to lipids on its intracellular side.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination</title><p>We were interested in the structural properties that distinguish ion channels from lipid scramblases in the TMEM16 family and thus decided to investigate the structural properties of the chloride channel TMEM16A by single particle cryo-EM. For that purpose, we generated a stable HEK293 cell-line, which constitutively expresses the (<italic>ac</italic>) isoform of mTMEM16A, and purified the protein at a saturating calcium concentration in the detergent digitonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Images of flash-frozen samples were recorded on a FEI TITAN Krios electron microscope equipped with an energy filter and a K2-summit camera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The three-dimensional structure of the mammalian ion channel at a nominal resolution of 6.6 Å was reconstructed from total of 213,243 particles picked from 4178 micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>; and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Since the resolution did not significantly improve after addition of further images, it is likely limited by the sample.

Due to the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, it likely shows the channel in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound conformation. In light of the irreversible rundown of TMEM16A-mediated currents observed in patch-clamp experiments at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, it is at this point ambiguous whether this conformation corresponds to a conducting or a non-conducting state of the channel. Within the membrane, the overall dimensions of mTMEM16A are very similar to nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). All transmembrane helices are well resolved and thus, could be unambiguously allocated. On the extracellular side, the mTMEM16A map contains a substantial amount of unassigned density that can be attributed to extended loops connecting transmembrane α-helices 1–2 (α1α2 loop) and transmembrane α-helices 9–10 (α9α10 loop), which are respectively 50 and 65 residues longer compared to nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both loops appear to be structured, folding into a compact extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, this domain harbors six cysteines that have been shown to be indispensable for channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) and that are thus potentially involved in disulfide bridges. On the cytoplasmic side, the N-terminal domain of mTMEM16A exhibits a similar fold and location with respect to the TMD as its counterpart in nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Consequently, there is no interaction between the N-terminal domains of adjacent subunits, which was previously proposed based on biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tien et al., 2013</xref>). A 92 residue long extension in mTMEM16A that precedes the folded N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) appears to be unstructured, but there is unaccounted electron density that cannot be interpreted at the current resolution of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B–D</xref>). At the C-terminus, which is 38 residues shorter than its equivalent part in nhTMEM16, the first α-helix (Cα1) is folded but it has moved away from the dimer axis and thus no longer contacts its symmetry mate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The remainder of the C-terminus is likely unstructured and, unlike in nhTMEM16, does not interact with the adjacent subunit. Hence, the interaction of the subunits within the mTMEM16A dimer differs significantly from nhTMEM16 since the cytosolic domains do not contribute to the dimer interface. Instead, interactions are established mainly at the extracellular part of transmembrane α-helix 10, which is in a similar location as in nhTMEM16 but extends further towards the outside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>). In the TMD, all membrane-spanning segments are well defined including two short amphiphilic α-helices at its N-terminal part that interact with the polar headgroups at the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). In general, the transmembrane helices are in comparable locations to their counterparts in nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>) and thus account for the overall similarity between both structures.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26232.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Features of the mTMEM16A structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Unassigned EM density (contoured at 11σ) of the extracellular α1α2 and α9α10 loops.

This region is well defined, except for the loops connecting α-helices 5 and 6 and 6 and 6’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Although, at the current resolution, neither the helix-pitch nor side-chains are resolved, there are several structural features that constrain the location of residues and thus allow for their approximate assignment. The placement is facilitated by conserved loops connecting α-helices 4–5, 7–8 and 8–9, which are well defined in the cryo-EM map and thus determine the register of the transmembrane segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We could further constrain the position of the conserved calcium-binding site, as density between α-helices 6, 7 and 8 coincides with the position of the two bound calcium ions of nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The ion conduction pore is lined by residues located on α-helices 3–7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast to the transmembrane segments close to the dimer interface (i.e. α-helices 1, 2, 9, 10), several of the pore-forming α-helices have changed their position relative to nhTMEM16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). These changes are most pronounced for α-helices 3, 4 and 6. As a consequence of conformational rearrangements, α4 and α6, which line the opposite borders of the membrane-accessible subunit cavity of nhTMEM16, have come into contact at the extracellular part of the membrane to form a protein-enclosed conduit that is shielded from lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). Together with α-helices 3, 5 and 7, they constitute the narrow neck of an aqueous pore that spans the extracellular two thirds of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Towards the intracellular side, the detachment of α4 and α6 results in the a dilation of the pore to a wide intracellular vestibule that is exposed to both the cytoplasm and the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

Since the current resolution of the data does not permit a quantitative analysis of its geometry, we restrict our description of the pore to its general geometric features. The wide, intracellular entrance narrows above the region constituting the regulatory Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Under the assumption that the structure is close to a conducting state, the narrow upper part most likely requires permeating ions to shed their hydration shell. This is consistent with the observation that the anion selectivity of TMEM16A follows a type 1 Eisenman sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu and Hartzell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), which favors larger anions with a lower solvation energy. The pore is amphiphilic and contains charged, polar and apolar residues. The low effective affinity of Cl<sup>-</sup> conduction suggests weak interactions with permeating ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Due to the absence of a detailed structural representation of the ion conduction path, we focused on the role of long-range coulombic interactions on anion conduction. We have thus mutated basic residues in the pore to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and recorded currents in inside-out patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In these recordings, we can expect deviations from the linear current-voltage relationships of WT in cases where a mutation alters the rate-limiting barriers at either entrance to the narrow part of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Läuger, 1973</xref>). Such behavior has been previously observed for mutations of Lys 588, where the removal of the positive charge has resulted in a strong outward rectification of the current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jeng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). In the model of mTMEM16A, this residue is located at the end of the funnel-shaped vestibule close to the neck of the ion conduction path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In our data, the mutation K588A has resulted in a similar rectification, indicating that the truncation of the positively charged side-chain has perturbed the electrostatic interaction with permeating anions, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>) effectively increasing the energy barrier of negatively charged ions to enter the pore from its intracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). A similar effect was observed for the nearby mutant K645A, which removes a positive charge from α-helix six at a position that is located slightly further towards the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). In contrast, several mutations of positively charged residues located in the wide intracellular vestibule did not alter the linear current-voltage relationship of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). At the opposite end of the pore, the mutation R535A has resulted in an inward-rectification, indicating that the mutation hampers the entrance of the anion from the outside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). In between Lys 645 and Arg 535, the mutation R515A has caused a deviation from the linear current-voltage relationship in both directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,E</xref>). Thus, this positive charge most likely lowers a rate-limiting energy barrier for anion permeation halfway through the narrow part of the mTMEM16A pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). This is consistent with the six-fold lower currents measured for this mutant, despite its robust expression at the surface of HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). In no case have we seen any change in the reversal potential measured in asymmetric chloride concentrations, which indicates that no single positive charge dominates the strong anion selectivity of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Since the majority of TMEM16 proteins work as lipid scramblases, which catalyze the diffusion of lipids between the two leaflets of a bilayer, it was postulated that the few family members functioning as ion channels may have evolved from an ancestral scramblase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Whitlock and Hartzell, 2016</xref>). However, the way in which TMEM16 channels have adapted to fulfill their distinct functional task has remained unknown. The structure of mTMEM16A reported here has now resolved this question. As anticipated from the strong sequence conservation, the general architecture of each subunit is shared between both branches of the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A previous structure-based hypothesis suggested a possible subunit rearrangement in dimeric TMEM16 channels, where both subunit cavities come together to form a single enclosed pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>). Although this hypothesis was already refuted by recent functional investigations, which demonstrated that the protein contains two ion conduction pores that are independently activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jeng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim et al., 2016</xref>), the ultimate proof for a double barreled channel is now provided by the mTMEM16A structure, which reveals the location of two pores, each contained within a single subunit of the dimeric protein. A different proposition, referred to as the proteolipidic pore hypothesis, postulated that the ion conduction pathway in TMEM16 channels is partly composed of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Whitlock and Hartzell, 2016</xref>). The authors suggested that immobilized lipid headgroups lining the membrane-exposed ion conduction pore may lower the dielectric barrier for permeating ions on their way across the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Whitlock and Hartzell, 2016</xref>). Our study has also provided strong evidence against this hypothesis. Instead, the model of mTMEM16A shows that α-helical rearrangements have resulted in occlusion of the lipid pathway, while opening up a conductive pore which is largely shielded from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref>). The only potential access of lipids is provided on the intracellular side where the detachment of transmembrane α-helices 4 and 6 form a funnel-shaped vestibule that is exposed to the cytoplasm and the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). The gap between both α-helices may be a relic of an ancestral scramblase, and as suggested by the observed distortion of the detergent micelle in mTMEM16A, possibly destabilizes the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B,D</xref>). Notably, this gap is also present in nhTMEM16, where a similar effect of membrane-bending has been proposed to facilitate scramblase activity, as suggested by molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bethel and Grabe, 2016</xref>). In this respect, it is noteworthy that the intracellular region connecting transmembrane α-helices 4 and 5 has recently been identified to play an important role in lipid scrambling in TMEM16F and was thus assigned the term ‘scramblase domain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas TMEM16A itself does not facilitate lipid transport, scrambling activity was conferred to a chimeric TMEM16A protein carrying the ‘scramblase domain’ of TMEM16F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) or the equivalent region of TMEM16E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gyobu et al., 2015</xref>). Although these results emphasize the general role of the intracellular funnel region for lipid interactions, the altered structure of the ‘subunit cavity’, in particular the absence of a membrane-exposed polar crevice in TMEM16A, leave the mechanism of lipid scrambling in these chimeras ambiguous.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26232.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mechanistic relationships within TMEM16 family.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Depiction of the mTMEM16A pore.

Analysis of mutants shows minimal influence of basic residues in the wide intracellular vestibule, but pronounced rectification upon similar replacements near the narrow neck of the pore. Remarkably, equivalent mutations of two of these residues (Arg 515 and Lys 645) have previously been described to alter the selectivity between different anions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peters et al., 2015</xref>). Assuming that the imaged protein conformation resembles a conducting state, its pore structure suggests that permeating anions have to shed their hydration shell and interact with pore-lining residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The low effective affinity of Cl<sup>-</sup> conduction indicates that there might not be a single strong site for ion coordination, but that the ions might instead weakly interact with the extended pore region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu and Hartzell, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that no single mutation was identified so far that weakened the strong selectivity for anions over cations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although ion conduction was previously also reported for TMEM16 family members which function as lipid scramblases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), it was proposed that these processes are leaks accompanying the movement of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), which differs significantly from the selective anion permeation described here for TMEM16 channels.</p><p>In summary, our work has unraveled how TMEM16 proteins use a similar architecture to exert substantially different functions. Both structures, namely the scramblase nhTMEM16 and the ion channel mTMEM16A, define the structural relationships within the family, whereby a hydrophilic membrane-exposed cavity in TMEM16 scramblases has changed to an aqueous membrane-shielded pore in TMEM16 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Despite the unusual functional breadth of the family, this ligand-gated ion channel turns out to share its mechanism for ion conduction with other, structurally unrelated, channel proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>A HEK293 cell-line stably expressing the mouse TMEM16A(<italic>ac</italic>) isoform (mTMEM16A, UniProt Q8BHY3.2) containing a 3C cleavage site, a myc- and an SBP-tag at its C-terminus was generated using the Flp-In System (Flp-In-293 Cell Line, R75007, Invitrogen).

Similar classes, comprising 377,371 particles, were combined and subjected to auto-refinement in RELION. The resulting map was masked and had a resolution of 7.35 Å. To further improve the quality of the density map, per-particle alignment of the frames was performed using the polishing algorithms in RELION.

The equation used to fit the experimental I-V data and to determine the descriptive energy profile of the constructs is shown below.<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>h</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The model contains three free parameters (n, σ<sub>β</sub> and σ<sub>h</sub>) that govern the shape of the I-V relation, which, with reasonable constraints, can be reliably determined from our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

the position-dependent effect of mutations in the mTMEM16A pore</title><p>To analyze the position-dependent effect of mutations on the rectification of the current, we have employed a barrier model akin to that described by Läuger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Läuger, 1973</xref>). We assumed that there is no saturation of the pore as the Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration we used was more than two times lower than the apparent K<sub>M</sub> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because the apparent K<sub>M</sub> value is high (&gt;300 mM), it is also safe to assume that no deep wells exist along the pore. We thus assumed that all wells in the model have the same energy level as the external and internal media, which also implies that at zero voltage the forward and backward rate constants for the same barrier are identical. We further assumed that the barriers are evenly distributed along the channel so that each of the rate constants have the same voltage dependence with the corresponding polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Scheme 1</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26232.023</object-id><label>Scheme 1.</label><caption><title>Depiction of the free energy profile of ions permeating the pore of an ion channel.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26232.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26232.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26232-app1-fig3-v1"/></fig></p><p>In this model, β is the rate constant of the outermost barrier and the rate constant of the innermost barrier is defined as δ = σ<sub>β</sub>β.

It can also be seen that this equation can be reduced to the Nernst equation at zero current.</p><p>The general features of the model are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>. In the simplest case where the energy profile consists of only the δ and β barriers without the h barriers, increasing n causes the non-linearly increasing conductance of the current at both ends of the I-V curves to saturate while the conductance at zero voltage remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 1A, B</xref>). The introduction of h barrier(s) with height(s) identical to the δ and β barriers results in a decrease in the overall current amplitude and a non-linear increase in the conductance with increasing voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 1C, D</xref>). This non-linear increase in the conductance eventually flattens as n approaches infinity and the resulting I-V curves become ohmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 1D</xref>, inset). This indicates that, for any value of n, the presence of h barrier(s) of significant height relative to the δ and β barriers cannot result in bell-shaped conductance-V curves. As σ<sub>h</sub> increases, i.e. the height of the h barriers decreases, however, the non-linearly increasing conductance-V curves revert to bell-shaped curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 1E, F</xref>).</p><p>We tested this model first by fitting the I-V curve of WT at symmetrical 150 mM Cl<sup>-</sup>. The conductance-V relation obtained from the interpolated I-V curve is bell-shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Appendix 1—figure 2A, B</xref>), which is consistent with n &gt; 2 and small h barrier(s) relative to the δ and β barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). The imperfect symmetry indicates asymmetry in the barrier heights on the ends of the energy profile. However, when all parameters were allowed to vary the fitting did not converge and the resulting parameter estimates had very wide 95% confidence intervals. Nonetheless, the qualitative agreement with the calculated model behavior allowed us to constrain σ<sub>h</sub> to reasonable values and/or to omit the h barrier(s) completely. Such measure allowed us to obtain a reasonable value for n, which was estimated to be 2.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>). Again, assuming large σ<sub>h</sub>, we fitted the family of I-V curves of WT below 150 mM Cl<sup>-</sup> globally and obtained a reasonable agreement with the model and an estimate of 3.1 for n (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Appendix 1—figure 2C</xref>). The value of n was therefore chosen to be three and was subsequently used as a fixed parameter to determine the relative rates σ<sub>β</sub> and σ<sub>h</sub> for the mutant constructs. The relative increase of the barrier height is obtained by<disp-formula id="equ16"><mml:math id="m16"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ17"><mml:math id="m17"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where E<sub>a</sub> is the activation energy corresponding to the respective rate constant. These parameters were used to construct descriptive energy profiles to illustrate the effect of the mutations and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>. We have arbitrarily placed the energy profiles relative to the innermost or the outermost barrier for illustrative purpose. This most likely has little effect on the energy profiles of the mutants where the mutated residue is located on the peripheral ends (R535A, K588A and K645A) as these mutations are unlikely to affect the energy barrier on the opposite end of the pore. This may not be the case, however, for the R515A mutant as this residue lies in the middle of the pore. The small current observed for this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) implies that the whole energy profile might in fact be shifted upwards compared to that of the WT. This might be expected if the effect of R515 is of coulombic nature, and like the other mutations in the pore mutation of which may elevate nearby energy barriers especially in a narrow pore. Nonetheless, the general observation is that as the mutation moves along the pore, its effect on local ion conduction/barrier height shifts accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which is reflected on their macroscopic conduction properties as observed in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26232.024</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>General features of the model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) I-V and (<bold>B</bold>) conductance-V curves calculated with σ<sub>β</sub> = 1 with the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>h</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> term omitted and the indicated values of n.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: H Criss Hartzell (Reviewer #1); Youxing Jiang (Reviewer #2); Sjors HW Scheres (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the structure of the mammalian Ca-activated Cl channel TMEM16A determined by cryo-EM. The authors conclude that the structure differs in a significant way from another member of the TMEM16 superfamily that is a phospholipid scramblase. First, the mechanism of dimerization appears to be modified compared to the nhTMEM16 scramblase. Second and most notably, the furrow formed mainly by helices 4-6 has be reconfigured so that helix 4 now encloses the conduction pathway to form a protein-lined channel rather than a groove. If this is true, this is a very significant finding. The TMEM16 family has been the subject of intense interest and scrutiny recently and this paper adds significant new information. The work is carefully performed and beautifully presented. Nevertheless, reviewers have raised some concerns most of which we believe can be addressed by carefully underscoring the limitations of your data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I have been struggling to understand whether the protein is in a conducting or non-conducting state. The authors assume a conducting state because it was purified in the presence of Ca. However, it is well-known that TMEM16A inactivates in the presence of high Ca. This has been shown by the Dutzler lab as well as others. In our hands, TMEM16A enters a non-conducting state within several minutes in the presence of 0.5 mM Ca – the concentration used here for purification. Furthermore, it is not clear to me that the &quot;pore&quot; of the cryo structure is large enough to accommodate a Cl ion, not to mention larger ions like iodide (radius 2.2Å) that is more permeant than Cl. It seems that there is barely enough space for a Cl ion to move through the pore of the Ala model. At the level of residues 546, 595, and 641 there is a constriction that is barely large enough to accommodate a Cl ion. With the significantly larger sidechains of the real amino acids at this location: N546, P595, and I641, there does not seem to be enough space for a Cl ion to pass. To get some insight into this, I replaced the Ala residues with the TMEM16A amino acids using the most common rotamer for each position and then energy minimized the structure. I understand that this structure could be completely bogus, but the aperture is &gt;1Å too small in places to accommodate a Cl ion. This suggests that either this is a non-conducting state or that the conduction pathway is not located in the cavity between helices 4-6. I appreciate that the cryo structure may not have the resolution to allow the conclusions that I am suggesting, but yet the possibility that this is a non-conducting structure seems a possibility that must be addressed.</p><p>2) The mutagenesis experiments tend to support the idea that the Cl conduction pathway is the in the furrow (now a pore), but the residues chosen for mutation are located at the extreme ends of the enclosed pore (the α carbons of R515 and K588 are ~20 Å apart). While most of the residues that intervene between the vestibules are hydrophobic and perhaps not ideal candidates for mutagenesis analysis, it would be nice to have data on some amino acids that are located in the middle of the presumptive conduction pathway. The effect of the R515A mutation in particular is relatively small. Given the timeframe for revised submission, if additional experiments are not possible, the authors should discuss the limitations of their existing data.</p><p>3) The obtained resolution of 6.6Å from 4,000 K2-recorded micrographs is somewhat disappointing, and raises the question why no higher resolution was obtained. The 2D class averages look somewhat suboptimal. Still, the detailed data acquisition and image processing procedures described all appear to be performed to a high standard. Perhaps the protein sample itself wasn't optimal? Also, perhaps the sample micrograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> looks very/too contrasted. Could it be that the area imaged was too thin and the sample had dried too much? Anyway, these are not questions for the authors to answer now, but suggestion to consider for a next structure.</p><p>It is refreshing to see that the authors are well aware of its limitations, and are adequately careful in its interpretation. From the cryo-EM point-of-view, this paper is thereby sound and there are no technical reasons to reject it.</p><p>4) Discussion section: &quot;[…] as suggested by the observed distortion of the detergent micelle in mTMEM16A&quot;. The distortion is not at all clear from the figure. A better figure is needed to support this part of the discussion.</p><p>5) Subsection “Image processing”: &quot;Overfitting was further prevented by correcting the final FSC curve for the effect of a soft mask using high-resolution noise substitution&quot; This is not correct. The high-resolution noise substitution at this point is not to prevent overfitting, but rather to correct for convolution effects of real-space masking on the FSC curve.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26232.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) I have been struggling to understand whether the protein is in a conducting or non-conducting state.

The mechanism for this process is currently unclear and it has also not been shown whether a similar process would happen for the purified protein in detergent solution.

Consequently, we restricted our interpretation on the overall shape of the pore and its impact on ion conduction. The approximation of the pore shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref> results from a structure that was based on the refined poly-alanine coordinates where the positions of sidechains were substituted and subjected to few cycles of refinement as described in subsection “Electropysiology”. It was thus not calculated from the poly-alanine model. We have included this model in the resubmission of our manuscript for the reviewers to judge. The analysis with the program HOLE suggest a radius of the narrow part between 1.8 and 2.2 Å (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows this pore in relation to modeled Cl<sup>-</sup> ions (radius 1.8 Å) to illustrate that its general features are reasonable.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26232.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the pore radios along the channel axis as calculated by the program HOLE from a model of the channel containing side-chains.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26232.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26232.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26232-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>Still, we want to emphasize that in its details, the model is likely not correct since, neither the location of the side-chains, nor the exact position of the main-chain atoms and their register are unambiguously defined. A detailed description of the pore will thus have to be provided with a high resolution structure.</p><p>To make this clear in our manuscript we have introduced the following changes:</p><p>Subsection “Functional properties of pore-mutations”:</p><p>“Since the current resolution of the data does not permit a quantitative analysis of its geometry, we restrict our description of the pore to its general geometric features. The wide, intracellular entrance narrows above the region constituting the regulatory Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Under the assumption that the structure is close to a conducting state, the narrow upper part most likely requires permeating ions to shed their hydration shell.”</p><p><italic>2) The mutagenesis experiments tend to support the idea that the Cl conduction pathway is the in the furrow (now a pore), but the residues chosen for mutation are located at the extreme ends of the enclosed pore (the α carbons of R515 and K588 are ~20 Å apart). While most of the residues that intervene between the vestibules are hydrophobic and perhaps not ideal candidates for mutagenesis analysis, it would be nice to have data on some amino acids that are located in the middle of the presumptive conduction pathway. The effect of the R515A mutation in particular is relatively small. Given the timeframe for revised submission, if additional experiments are not possible, the authors should discuss the limitations of their existing data.</italic> </p><p>As we do not think that the current structure allows a detailed interpretation of the pore, we restricted ourselves to the investigation of the role of positively charged residues for anion conduction. For that purpose we have mutated all relevant basic amino acids in the pore region, most of which are located at both ends of the narrow neck and the intracellular vestibule. Due to the long-range nature of coulombic interactions and the low dielectric environment of the membrane the effect of the removal of positive charges is not restricted to their immediate surrounding. This is underlined by the strong effect of alanine mutations on conduction. Except for Lys 603 in the center of the neck, for which we were not able to record currents, most mutants were expressed on the surface of HEK cells and showed robust current response. Among these, the mutation of several residues showed a behavior that is consistent with their location along the pore lining. We strongly disagree that the effect of R515A is small. Given its robust expression, the mutation of this residue had a strong impact on the total currents and thus likely on the conductance of the channel. It should be noted that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> shows normalized currents, while the R515A current is six-fold lower in amplitude than for WT (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is consistent with a predicted role for a mutant introducing a rate-limiting barrier for ion conduction in a model channel shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> and a fit to the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>. It should also be emphasized that, due to the absence of defined loops at both ends, the register of the weakly conserved transmembrane α-helix 3, where R515 is located, is poorly defined. Its location might thus turn out to be deeper in the pore than anticipated from the current model. A detailed analysis of uncharged pore residues is beyond the scope of the current manuscript and will be subject of future investigations.</p><p>We have introduced the following changes to the manuscript:</p><p>In subsection “Functional properties of pore-mutations”:</p><p>“Due to the absence of a detailed structural representation of the ion conduction path, we focused on the role of long-range coulombic interactions on anion conduction. We have thus mutated basic residues in the pore to alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and recorded currents in inside-out patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).”</p><p>And</p><p>“Thus, this positive charge most likely lowers a rate-limiting energy barrier for anion permeation halfway through the narrow part of the mTMEM16A pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). This is consistent with the six-fold lower currents measured for this mutant, despite its robust expression at the surface of HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).”</p><p>We have also introduced panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> showing the fluorescence of the YFP-fusion construct of mutant R515A.</p><p><italic>3) The obtained resolution of 6.6Å from 4,000 K2-recorded micrographs is somewhat disappointing, and raises the question why no higher resolution was obtained.

This is likely not due to deficits in the data collection since the alignment of the microscope was carefully checked and optimized during data collection. The quality of the 2D classes reflects in our opinion the limited resolution of the data and might be a consequence of the small size of the protein in a large digitonin micelle. The high contrast seen in the representative micrograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> is the result of the dose-weighted sum of 100 frames with a high total electron dose of 80 e<sup>-</sup>/Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2013</xref>). By comparing the electron dose of the incident beam with the transmitted beam, we assume that the ice might rather have been too thick than too thin. More importantly, as the addition of further images did not improve the resolution significantly, we believe that the bottleneck resides in the quality of the protein sample, which we are currently optimizing.</p><p><italic>4) Discussion section: &quot;[…] as suggested by the observed distortion of the detergent micelle in mTMEM16A&quot;.
