change, so called ‘plasticity first.’ Herein, we quantify gene expression plasticity and regulatory adaptation in a wild bird (Eurasian Tree Sparrow) from its original lowland (ancestral stage), experimentally implemented hypoxia acclimation (plastic stage), and colonized highland (colonized stage). Using a group of co-expressed genes from the cardiac and flight muscles, respectively, we demonstrate that gene expression plasticity to hypoxia tolerance is more often reversed than reinforced at the colonized stage. By correlating gene expression change with muscle phenotypes, we show that colonized tree sparrows reduce maladaptive plasticity that largely associated with decreased hypoxia tolerance. Conversely, adaptive plasticity that is congruent with increased hypoxia tolerance is often reinforced in the colonized tree sparrows. Genes displaying large levels of reinforcement or reversion plasticity (i.e. 200% of original level) show greater genetic divergence between ancestral and colonized populations. Overall, our work demonstrates that gene expression plasticity at the initial stage of high-elevation colonization can be reversed or reinforced through selection-driven adaptive modification.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>genetic variation</kwd><kwd>tree sparrows</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Third Xinjiang Scientific Expedition and Research 2022xjkk0205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Yanhua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Yanhua Qu 2019QZKK0501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Yanhua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Natural Science Foundation of China Yanhua Qu NSFC32020103005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qu</surname><given-names>Yanhua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An integrative approach allows investigations of the relationship between an initial plasticity and the subsequent adaptive evolution during rapid adaptive modification of complex systems in the wild.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding the interactions between organisms and their environments is becoming increasingly important as environmental change and human activity change the original distribution of many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Visser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wingfield et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCairns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oostra et al., 2018</xref>). While some organisms can easily cope with environmental change, others run the risk of local or global extinction. An organismal response to environmental change partially depends on its ability of phenotypic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pfennig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scoville and Pfrender, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fox et al., 2019</xref>). For organisms that have recently colonized a new environment, phenotypic change may involve two stages. At the early stage, species may rapidly change their phenotype through plasticity without involving genetic changes. Under a persisting strong selective pressure, selection may bring genetic change to canalize phenotypic changes. Consequently, phenotypic plasticity has been considered to play a stepping stone for genetically based evolutionary change at a late stage, so called ‘plasticity first’ hypothesis (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West-Eberhard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwander and Leimar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levis and Pfennig, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corl et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Under this hypothesis, plasticity may serve adaptive evolution in two alternative ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ho and Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ho et al., 2020</xref>). On the one hand, if plasticity changes the phenotype in the same direction as adaptive evolution does, genetic variation can strengthen the change toward an optimal phenotypic value in the new environment (reinforcement plasticity). On the other hand, if the plastic change works in the opposite direction as that driven by adaptive evolution, the subsequent genetic change would have to revert the initial plastic response (reversion/reduction plasticity). As previous studies on morphological and physiological traits have revealed mixed evidence for the reinforcement and the reversion of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pigliucci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lande, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pfennig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moczek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levis and Pfennig, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corl et al., 2018</xref>), it remains unclear if and how genetic change acts to reinforce or reverse plasticity in the wild species (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Campbell-Staton et al., 2021</xref>). The potential challenges are how to quantify phenotypic change relative to plasticity and adaptive evolution, and how to define what genes are involved in the phenotypic change, especially as many phenotypes are likely polygenically mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Novembre and Barton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pritchard et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of gene expression provides a potential approach to quantify the relative contributions of phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation since gene expression can bridge an organism’s genotype to its cellular biology and, by extension, higher-order physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wray et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morris et al., 2014</xref>). While the entire transcriptional program is orchestrated by the gene regulatory network, it is possible to trace the genes that are co-expressed or underpin the phenotypic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fukao et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, gene expression evolves in a stabilizing manner, where regulatory elements accumulate mutations that keep gene expression at an optimal level for physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Coolon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodgins-Davis et al., 2015</xref>). Herein, we used gene expression data to quantify regulatory plasticity and adaptation, as well as the relevant genetic changes in a group of wild birds that have recently colonized a highland environment, the Eurasian Tree Sparrows, <italic>Passer montanus</italic> (hereafter referred to as tree sparrows).</p><p>The tree sparrow is a human commensal that has spread over a wide variety of habitats in the Eurasian continent, and that has been successfully introduced to Australia and North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Widmann, 1889</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graham et al., 2011</xref>). This species colonized the Qinghai-Tibet plateau approximately 2600 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qu et al., 2020</xref>), possibly concurrently with the introduction of barley agriculture in the highlands. The Qinghai-Tibet plateau is a harsh environment with an average elevation of 4500 m above sea level (m a.s.l.) where only a few endemic animals can survive. For mammals and birds living at high elevations, hypoxia is one of the strongest selective pressures that drive physiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barve et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McClelland and Scott, 2019</xref>). Compared to the lowland ancestral population, highland tree sparrows have evolved physiological and gene expression changes for hypoxia tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qu et al., 2020</xref>), but how these changes relate to plasticity and adaptive evolution is largely unknown.</p><p>In order to explore this, we acclimated a group of lowland birds to an experimentally implemented hypoxic condition similar to that where we collected highland birds (i.e. 3200 m a.s.l). We could assess gene expression plasticity and regulatory adaptation in hypoxia tolerance by studying tree sparrows collected (a) in their original lowland environment (representing the physiologically ancestral stage), (b) shortly after their exposure to the new environmental stimulus (representing the ancestral plasticity at the initially plastic stage), and (c) after having adapted to the highland environment (the colonized stage). Using the framework described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we quantified gene expression change stemming from hypoxia acclimation and highland colonization and defined genes with the expression plasticity being reinforced or reversed at the colonization stage. We test whether these genes increase genetic variation between ancestral and colonized populations using a permutation test. We use this framework in four datasets including groups of co-expressed genes associated with hypoxia tolerance and those correlated to muscle phenotypes for the cardiac and flight muscles, respectively. These independent comparisons congruently show that gene expression at the plastic stage is more often reversed than reinforced at the colonized stage, and the selection-driven genetic change depends on the magnitude of reinforcement and/or reversion plasticity.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A schematic representation of quantifying gene expression plasticity and genetic change in relevant genes.</title><p>Experimental design, transcriptomic data of the flight, and cardiac muscle were collected from tree sparrows obtained in their original lowland habitat (ancestral stage), experimental exposure to the hypoxic condition (plastic stage), and colonization to a high-elevation environment (colonized stage).

Reinforcement/reversion plasticity, the genes with reinforcement or reversion plasticity were defined by comparing expression changes between the ancestral and plastic stages (plastic change), and between plastic and colonized stages (evolved change). The strength of reinforcement/reversion plasticity is measured by a range of thresholds, i.e., &lt;100% and &gt;50%, &lt;150% and &gt;100%,&lt;200% and &gt;150%, and &gt;200%.

We focused on the flight and cardiac muscles because they affect thermogenic capacity and oxygen transport and delivery and are thus critical for the highland adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Storz et al., 2010</xref>). Considering that response to environmental change often involves complex coordinated biological response, such as the co-regulation of genes underpinning physiological functions, we analyzed the resultant expression data for all individuals using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). Weighted correlation network is a system biology method for identifying groups of highly co-expressed genes (modules), summarizing module-level expression, and identifying important genes within modules (hub genes). Consequently, these co-expressed genes can capture expression-stage correlations due to the hypoxia-dependent expression. We identified six and nine modules of co-expressed genes with their expression changes that are significantly associated with the three stages (i.e. ancestral, plastic, and colonized stages) for the flight and cardiac muscle, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Using a threshold of &gt;50% increase/reduction of gene expression between two comparisons, we attributed 36 and 15 genes to the reinforcement group and 209 and 60 genes to the reversion group for flight and cardiac muscle, respectively. Interestingly, we found fractions of genes with reversion plasticity are larger than those of genes with reinforcement plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To confirm the robustness of this observation with respect to random sampling errors, we carried out a parametric bootstrap procedure as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho and Zhang, 2019</xref>, which aimed to identify genes resulting from genuine differences rather than random sampling errors. Bootstrap results also confirmed that genes exhibiting reversing plasticity significantly outnumber those exhibiting reinforcing plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We then explore whether this result is robust with different magnitudes of plasticity by using a range of thresholds of &lt;150% and &gt;100%, &lt;200% and &gt;150%, and &gt;200% to attribute genes to reinforcement and reversion groups. These different categories consistently showed an excess of genes with reversion plasticity (six out of eight comparisons, two-tailed binomial test, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). To further confirm the robustness of the discovered pattern against the arbitrariness of threshold selection, we also adopted different categorizations according to the magnitude of plasticity (i.e. 20%, 40%, and 60% bin settings along the spectrum of the reinforcement/reversion plasticity), and these analyses showed similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that high-elevation colonization of tree sparrows generally reverses gene expression plasticity.</p><p>If the reinforcement and/or reversion gene expression plasticity in hypoxic tolerance were the target of selection in the high-elevation environment, we would expect to see an increase in the genetic divergence between the ancestral and colonized populations. To evaluate this we searched for genomic signatures of selection using resequencing data from 12 lowland and 11 highland tree sparrows generated from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qu et al., 2020</xref>). Significantly elevated genetic divergence (i.e. <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub>) within the candidate genes beyond the genic background would provide evidence for selection acting on this group of co-expressed genes (i.e. polygenic adaptation). We thus calculated the average <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> for the genes with reinforcement or reversion plasticity using all SNPs included in the genic region, 2 kb upstream and downstream regions, respectively. We considered the upstream and downstream regions because gene regulation may refer to genetic variation in nearby non-coding regions. By comparing to the <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> distributions generated from 100 random samplings of the same number of SNPs from the genic background (see Methods), we found that the empirical <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values significantly increased in the genes with the levels of reinforcement/reversion plasticity reaching above 200% (p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). In all cases, the empirical <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> values increased significantly in the 2 kb upstream and/or downstream regions of the candidate genes, but not in the genic regions. This observation thus suggests that selection-driven genetic change is more targeted on the non-coding regions and depends on the magnitude of reinforcement/reversion plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Gene expression and muscle phenotype analyses show adaptive plasticity and maladaptive plasticity</title><p>The evolutionary outcome of the phenotypic plasticity for a population colonizing a novel environment depends on the direction of plastic change with respect to the local optimum of the novel environment.

Using an integrative approach of field-based studies, experimentally implemented acclimation experiments, multiomic and muscle phenotypic data, our study demonstrates the importance of gene expression plasticity in facilitating initial survival and population persistence at an early stage of colonization. In particular, our results provide novel insight into an issue of active debate within evolutionary biology (i.e<italic>.</italic> reinforcement vs. reversion plasticity) by showing that the evolutionary consequence of plasticity depends on the adaptive plasticity (reinforcement) or maladaptive plasticity (reversion). We also demonstrate that natural selection drives genetic divergence when the magnitude of reinforcement and/or reversion plasticity becomes intense, providing novel insights into the mechanism of plasticity first and genes as followers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwander and Leimar, 2011</xref>.</p><p>Our gene expression and sequence analyses provide several lines of evidence in support of gene expression plasticity contribution to the high-elevation colonization of tree sparrows. First, we show that co-expressed genes and muscle phenotype-associated genes change either the intensity or the direction of their expression profiles, and that gene expressions at the plastic stage are more often reversed than reinforced at the colonization stage. Second, by combining gene expression and muscle phenotype, we show that selection operates intensely on maladaptive plasticity during the initial stage of responding novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghalambor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ghalambor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ho and Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Campbell-Staton et al., 2021</xref>). Third, the genes with intensified levels of reinforcement and reversion expression plasticity show large genetic divergence (<italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub>) in their upstream and downstream regions between the ancestral and colonized populations, suggesting that selection has driven genetic changes in the noncoding regions after the tree sparrows had colonized the novel environment.</p><p>These observations thus support that plasticity serves as a stepping stone in a successful colonization of a new environment and that genetic changes that evolve at a late stage will modify the plastic change to an optimal phenotype in the new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwander and Leimar, 2011</xref>). It is interesting to think about why phenotypic change at the plastic stage sometimes differs from those at the colonized stage. A likely reason is that initially plastic change allows organisms to survive upon a sudden environmental shift but the fitness is much reduced compared to that after a long-term colonization to the novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang and Agrawal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leonard and Lancaster, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuo et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, the overall physiological states of the organisms right after an environmental shift may result in low fitness. To coordinate the phenotype values to close the organismal fitness, a genetic change may be required to modify the plastic change of phenotype to approach the optimum to the novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Storz, 2021</xref>). Thus, the consequence of genetic change on plasticity is dependent on the cost of plastic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ho and Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corl et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of our study is that we could only consider hypoxic conditions in the acclimation experiment, while also other factors associated with high-elevation environments, e.g<italic>.</italic>, low temperature and UV radiation, may be of importance. Although we assume that hypoxia is the dominant selective force in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qu et al., 2020</xref>), the use of a single environmental stimulus makes our conclusions more conservative. Also, it is reasonable to assume that plastic change in organisms is time-dependent and that our results cannot catch gene expression occurring at the later stage of plastic response (i.e<italic>.</italic> after one month). Since we could only run the acclimation experiment for one month it is likely we have not identified all genes related to hypoxia tolerance. Despite this, we could observe a clear pattern of reinforcement and reversion plasticity and the associated genetic changes. Our sample sizes are rather small (n=12 for the flight muscle and n=9 for the cardiac muscle), mostly because of the logistical challenge of keeping tree sparrows in the necessary common garden experiments. In order to compensate for this, we utilized comparative transcriptomics to generate the four independent datasets (a group of co-expressed genes and a group of phenotype-associated genes for the flight and cardiac muscles, respectively). As the analyses of these four independent datasets show similar results, we believe the conclusions drawn from our study are robust.</p><p>Despite some limitations, our study demonstrates an easy implemented framework for quantifying phenotype plasticity and how to relate this to genetic change. Short-term acclimation response of lowland populations has been found to be different from the populations adapted to the high-elevation environments. For example, people newly exposed to high-elevation environment increase their red blood cells as compared to people at sea level, which is likely mediated by <italic>HIF</italic> and <italic>EPO</italic> genes in the hypoxia response cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Erzurum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peng et al., 2017</xref>). This physiological change, however, is less activated in native people at high-elevation when compared to people at sea level, demonstrating an example of reversion of phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Storz, 2021</xref>). Together with previous studies, our work shows that short-term acclimation response and long-term adaptive evolution in hypoxia response may affect different evolutionary pathways. Our work provides an understanding of how plasticity facilitates species to invade new habitats and survive environmental change. Such an understanding is important, in particular when numerous species are being introduced to new regions of the globe through human intervention and spread as invasive species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Visser, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling</title><p>We generated transcriptomic data from hypoxia-acclimated lowland tree sparrows by exposing five lowland tree sparrows to hypoxic conditions for 30 days using a hypoxic chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qu et al., 2020</xref>).

All analyses were conducted with the R statistical software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">R Development Core Team, 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Sampling of transcriptomic data used in this study.</title><p>All birds collected were adults and at pre-breeding season.

Their objective was to test the &quot;plasticity first&quot; hypothesis, which suggest that traits that are already plastic (their value changes when facing a new environment compared to the original environment) facilitates the colonisation of novel environments, which, if true, would be predicted to result in the evolution of gene expression values that are similar in the population that colonised the new environment and evolved under these particular selection pressures. To test this prediction, they studied gene expression in cardiac and muscle tissues in individuals originating from three conditions: lowland individuals in their natural environment (ancestral state), lowland individuals exposed to hypoxia (the plastic response state), and a highland population facing hypoxia for several generations (the coloniser state). They classified gene expression patterns as maladaptive or adaptive in lowland individuals responding to short term hypoxia by classifying gene expression patterns using genes that differed between the ancestral state (lowland) and colonised state (highland). Genes expressed in the same direction in lowland individuals facing hypoxia (the plastic state) as what is found in the colonised state are defined as adaptative, while genes with the opposite expression pattern were labelled as maladaptive, using the assumption that the colonised state must represent the result of natural selection. Furthermore, genes could be classified as representing reversion plasticity when the expression pattern differed between the plasticity and colonised states and as reinforcement when they were in the same direction (for example more expressed in the plastic state and the colonised state than in the ancestral state). They found that more genes had a plastic expression pattern that was labelled as maladaptive than adaptive.

It is possible that longer term effects would be identifiable in gene expression in the lowland individuals facing hypoxia on a longer time scale. Furthermore, a sample size of 3 or 4 individuals per group depending on the tissue for wild individuals may miss some of the natural variation present in these populations.

We appreciate the very encouraging comments recognizing the value of our work. We have addressed concerns from the reviewer in greater detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q1.

This is partly because it is quite challenging to bring wild birds into captivity to conduct the hypoxia acclimation experiments. We had to work hard to perform acclimation experiments by taking lowland sparrows in a hypoxic condition for a month. We indeed have recognized the similar set of limitations as the review pointed out and have discussed the limitations in the study, i.e., considering hypoxic condition alone, short time acclimation period, etc. Regarding sample sizes, we have collected cardiac muscle from nine individuals (three individuals for each stage) and flight muscle from 12 individuals (four individuals for each stage). We have clarified this in Supplementary Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q2. Finally, I could not find a statement indicating that the lowland individuals placed in hypoxia (plastic stage) were from the same population as the lowland individuals for which transcriptomic data was already available, used as the &quot;ancestral state&quot; group (which themselves seem to come from 3 populations Qinghuangdao, Beijing, and Tianjin, according to supplementary table 2) nor if they were sampled in the same time of year (pre reproduction, during breeding, after, or if they were juveniles, proportion of males or females, etc). These two aspects could affect both gene expression (through neutral or adaptive genetic variation among lowland populations that can affect gene expression, or environmental effects other than hypoxia that differ in these populations' environments or because of their sexes or age). This could potentially also affect the FST analysis done by the authors, which they use to claim that strong selective pressure acted on the expression level of some of the genes in the colonised group.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asked how individual tree sparrows used in the transcriptomic analyses were collected. The individuals used for the hypoxia acclimation experiment and represented the ancestral lowland population were collected from the same locality (Beijing) and at the same season (i.e., pre-breeding) of the year. They are all adults and weight approximately 18g. We have clarified this in the Supplementary Table S1 and Methods. We did not distinguish males from females (both sexes look similar) under the assumption that both sexes respond similarly to hypoxia acclimation in their cardiac and flight muscle gene expression.</p><p>The Supplementary Table 2 lists the individuals that were used for sequence analyses. These individuals were only used for sequence comparisons but not for the transcriptomic analyses. The population genetic structure analyzed in a previously published study showed that there is no clear genetic divergence within the lowland population (i.e., individuals collected from Beijing, Tianjing and Qinhuangdao) or the highland population (i.e., Gangcha and Qinghai Lake). In addition, there was no clear genetic divergence between the highland and lowland populations (Qu et al. 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q4.

We found it very interesting to discuss our results (from a bird species) together with similar findings from humans. In the revised version of manuscript, we have discussed short-term acclimation response and long-term adaptive evolution to a high-elevation environment, as well as how our work provides understanding of the relative roles of short-term plasticity and long-term adaptation. We appreciate the two important work pointed out by the reviewer and we have also cited them in the revised version of manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This is a well-written paper using gene expression in tree sparrow as model traits to distinguish between genetic effects that either reinforce or reverse initial plastic response to environmental changes.

The question is an important and interesting one but I have several major concerns on experimental design and interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for a precise summary of our work and constructive comments to improve this study. We have addressed your concerns in greater detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q1. The datasets consist of two sources of data. The hypoxia treated birds collected from the current study and highland and lowland birds in their respective native environment from a previous study. This creates a complete confounding between the hypoxia treatment and experimental batches that it is impossible to draw any conclusions. The sample size is relatively small. Basically correlation among tens of thousands of genes was computed based on merely 12 or 9 samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the critical comments from the reviewer. The reviewer raised the concerns about the batch effect from birds collected from the previous study and this study. There is an important detail we didn’t describe in the previous version. All tissues from hypoxia acclimated birds and highland and lowland birds have been collected at the same time (i.e., Qu et al. 2020). RNA library construction and sequencing of these samples were also conducted at the same time, although only the transcriptomic data of lowland and highland tree sparrows were included in Qu et al. (2020). The data from acclimated birds have not been published before.</p><p>In the revised version of manuscript, we also compared log-transformed transcript per million (TPM) across all genes and determined the most conserved genes (i.e., coefficient of variance ≤ 0.3 and average TPM ≥ 1 for each sample) for the flight and cardiac muscles, respectively (Hao et al. 2023). We compared the median expression levels of these conserved genes and found no difference among the lowland, hypoxia-exposed lowland, and highland tree sparrows (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P&lt;0.05). As these results suggested little batch effect on the transcriptomic data, we used TPM values to calculate gene expression level and intensity. This methodological detail has been further clarified in the Methods and we also provided a new supplementary Figure (Figure S5) to show the comparative results.</p><p>The reviewer also raised the issue of sample size. We certainly would have liked to have more individuals in the study, but this was not possible due to the logistical problem of keeping wild bird in a common garden experiment for a long time. We have acknowledged this in the manuscript. In order to mitigate this we have tested the hypothesis of plasticity following by genetic change using two different tissues (cardiac and flight muscles) and two different datasets (co-expressed gene-set and muscle-associated gene-set). As all these analyses show similar results, they indicate that the main conclusion drawn from this study is robust.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q2. Genes are classified into two classes (reversion and reinforcement) based on arbitrarily chosen thresholds. More &quot;reversion&quot; genes are found and this was taken as evidence reversal is more prominent. However, a trivial explanation is that genes must be expressed within a certain range and those plastic changes simply have more space to reverse direction rather than having any biological reason to do so.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the critical comments. There are two questions raised we should like to address them separately. The first concern centered on the issue of arbitrarily chosen thresholds. In our manuscript, we used a range of thresholds, i.e., 50%, 100%, 150% and 200% of change in the gene expression levels of the ancestral lowland tree sparrow to detect genes with reinforcement and reversion plasticity. By this design we wanted to explore the magnitudes of gene expression plasticity (i.e., Ho &amp; Zhang 2018), and whether strength of selection (i.e., genetic variation) changes with the magnitude of gene expression plasticity (i.e., Campbell-Staton et al. 2021).</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, we have now realized that this threshold selection is arbitrarily. We have thus implemented two other categorization schemes to test the robustness of the observation of unequal proportions of genes with reinforcement and reversion plasticity. Specifically, we used a parametric bootstrap procedure as described in Ho &amp; Zhang (2019), which aimed to identify genes resulting from genuine differences rather than random sampling errors. Bootstrap results suggested that genes exhibiting reversing plasticity significantly outnumber those exhibiting reversing plasticity, suggesting that our inference of an excess of genes with reversion plasticity is robust to random sampling errors. We have added these analyses to the revised version of manuscript, and provided results in the Figure 2d and Figure 3d.</p><p>In addition, we adapted a bin scheme (i.e., 20%, 40% and 60% bin settings along the spectrum of the reinforcement/reversion plasticity). These analyses based on different categorization schemes revealed similar results, and suggested that our inference of an excess of genes with reversion plasticity is robust. We have provided these results in the Supplementary Figure S2 and S4.</p><p>The second issue that the reviewer raised is that the plastic changes simply have more space to reverse direction rather than having any biological reason to do so. While a causal reason why there are more genes with expression levels being reversed than those with expression levels being reinforced at the late stages is still contentious, increasingly many studies show that genes expression plasticity at the early stage may be functionally maladapted to novel environment that the species have recently colonized (i.e., lizard, Campbell-Staton et al. 2021; <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, yeast, guppies, chickens and babblers, Ho and Zhang 2018; Ho et al. 2020; Kuo et al. 2023). Our comparisons based on the two genesets that are associated with muscle phenotypes corroborated with these previous studies and showed that initial gene expression plasticity may be nonadaptive to the novel environments (i.e., Ghalambor et al.2015; Ho &amp; Zhang 2018; Ho et al. 2020; Kuo et al. 2023; Campbell-Staton et al. 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q3. The correlation between plastic change and evolved divergence is an artifact due to the definitions of adaptive versus maladaptive changes. For example, the definition of adaptive changes requires that plastic change and evolved divergence are in the same direction (Figure 3a), so the positive correlation was a result of this selection (Figure 3d).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised an issue that the correlation between plastic change and evolved divergence is an artifact because of the definition of adaptive versus maladaptive changes, for example, Figure 3d. We agree with the reviewer that the correlation analysis is circular because the definition of adaptive and maladaptive plasticity depends on the direction of plastic change matched or opposed that of the colonized tree sparrows. We have thus removed previous Figure 3d-e and related texts from the revised version of manuscript. Meanwhile, we have changed Figure 3a to further clarify the schematic framework.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Q1. Here are private recommendations that I think could help improve the manuscript.West-Eberhard was a pioneer back in 2003 in explicating the hypothesis of &quot;plasticity first&quot;. I think it is important to cite their main work in the first paragraph of introduction and to use the term &quot;plasticity-first&quot;, which is widely known among evolutionary biologists studying phenotypic plasticity, instead of &quot;plasticity followed by genetic change&quot;, since the three papers cited in paragraph 1 call it « plasticity first ».</p><p>West-Eberhard, M.J. (2003) Developmental Plasticity and Evolution, Oxford University Press.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting West-Eberhard (2003) and we have cited this important work.

In Figure 3, the figure in panel A and B is labelled &quot;normaxia&quot;, but I think that &quot;normoxia&quot; is usually the term used.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spot the typo. We have modified Figure 3a and we no longer used the term “normaxia”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Material and methods</p><p>It would be important to merge supplementary table 1 and 2 and only present the individuals that were used with their respective cardiac and muscle libraries (if they come from the same individual?). Also, the origin of the individuals used in the hypoxia experiment should be explained at the beginning of the methods section and explicated in the supplementary table. Information on sex or stage of development (juvenile? Adult? Male? female?) and time of year (in breeding stage? Pre-migration (if any), etc) would allow the reader to see that individuals from lowland differed only in their exposure to hypoxia or not, or if other variables may affect gene expression patterns. Similarly, if all individuals form the highland are males and the lowland hypoxia exposed individuals are females (or juveniles versus breeders, or different time of year, etc) this should be stated in the methods. Gene expression is labile so the reader should know if other variables influence the results presented or not.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggestion. We have added detailed information (i.e., age, collecting time and season) to the supplementary Table 1. We have also added this information to the Methods. Because the birds used in transcriptomic analysis (Supplementary Table 1) were different individuals from those used in the sequence analyses (Supplementary Table 2), these two tables cannot be merged.</p><p>References:</p><p>Campbell-Staton SC, Velotta JP, Winchell KM. 2021.
