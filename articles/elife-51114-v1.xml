expectancy in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a CTG repeat disorder involving misbalance between two RNA binding factors, MBNL1 and CELF1. However, how DM1 condition translates into conduction disorders remains poorly understood. Here we simulated MBNL1 and CELF1 misbalance in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart and performed TU-tagging-based RNAseq of cardiac cells. We detected deregulations of several genes controlling cellular calcium levels, including increased expression of straightjacket/α2δ3, which encodes a regulatory subunit of a voltage-gated calcium channel. Straightjacket overexpression in the fly heart leads to asynchronous heartbeat, a hallmark of abnormal conduction, whereas cardiac straightjacket knockdown improves these symptoms in DM1 fly models. We also show that ventricular α2δ3 expression is low in healthy mice and humans, but significantly elevated in ventricular muscles from DM1 patients with conduction defects. These findings suggest that reducing ventricular straightjacket/α2δ3 levels could offer a strategy to prevent conduction defects in DM1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myotonic dystrophy type 1</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>conduction defects</kwd><kwd>TU-tagging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004923</institution-id><institution>AFM-Téléthon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MyoNeurAlp strategic program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jagla</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tefor Infrastructure</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jagla</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Equipe FRM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jagla</surname><given-names>Krzysztof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009438</institution-id><institution>National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Grant for Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakamori</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Drosophila DM1 models suggest that elevated cardiac expression of straightjacket/α2δ3, a regulatory subunit of voltage-gated calcium channel, contributes to cardiac conduction defects in DM1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most prevalent muscular dystrophy in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Theadom et al., 2014</xref>), is caused by a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 3’ untranslated region of the <italic>dystrophia myotonica protein kinase</italic> (<italic>dmpk</italic>) gene. Transcripts of the mutated <italic>dmpk</italic>, containing expanded CUGs, form hairpin-like secondary structures in the nuclei, and sequester RNA-binding proteins with affinity to CUG-rich sequences. Among them, Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) protein is trapped within the repeats, forming nuclear <italic>foci</italic> aggregates that hallmark the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taneja et al., 1995</xref>). In parallel, the CUGBP- and ELAV-like family member 1 (CELF1) is stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuyumcu-Martinez et al., 2007</xref>), creating misbalance between MBNL1 and CELF1. This leads to missplicing of several transcripts and a general shift from adult to fetal isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freyermuth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Savkur et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, repeat toxicity induces a range of splice-independent alterations including impaired transcript stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sicot et al., 2011</xref>). A combination of splice-dependent and splice-independent events thus underlies DM1 pathogenesis, with the latter remaining largely unexplored. DM1 affects mainly skeletal muscles and the heart, with about 80% of DM1 patients showing impaired heart function with arrhythmia and conduction disturbance, which can sometimes end in heart block and sudden death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Die-Smulders et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Groh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mathieu et al., 1999</xref>). Cardiac symptoms, and particularly conduction defects, thus decrease life expectancy in DM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Data suggest that cardiac phenotypes, including conduction defects, are due to MBNL1/CELF1 misbalance. It was shown in a DM1 mouse model that PKC phosphorylates CELF1 leading to increased CELF1 levels, whereas PKC inhibition caused CELF1 reduction and amelioration of cardiac dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that increased CELF1 levels could cause heart phenotypes in DM1, a possibility supported by findings that heart-specific upregulation of CELF1 reproduces functional and electrophysiological cardiac changes observed in DM1 patients and mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koshelev et al., 2010</xref>). In parallel, analyses of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>) and evidence that misregulation of MBNL1-splice target gene <italic>SCN5A</italic> encoding a cardiac sodium channel leads to cardiac arrhythmia and conduction delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freyermuth et al., 2016</xref>), indicate that Mbnl1 contributes to DM1 heart phenotypes. However, in spite of aberrant SCN5A splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freyermuth et al., 2016</xref>) and downregulation of a large set of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalsotra et al., 2014</xref>), gene deregulations causing cardiac dysfunctions in DM1 remain to be characterized.</p><p>To gain further insight into mechanisms underlying cardiac DM1 phenotypes, we used previously described <italic>Drosophila</italic> DM1 models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Picchio et al., 2013</xref>). The heart of the fruit fly is simple in structure, but like the human heart, it displays pacemaker-regulated rhythmic beating, involving functions of conserved ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ocorr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taghli-Lamallem et al., 2016</xref>). We simulated pathogenic MBNL1/CELF1 misbalance specifically in the fly heart by attenuating the <italic>Drosophila MBNL1</italic> ortholog <italic>Muscleblind (Mbl</italic>) and by overexpressing the <italic>CELF1</italic> counterpart <italic>Bruno-3</italic> (<italic>Bru-3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Picchio et al., 2018</xref>). This caused asynchronous heartbeat (anterior and posterior heart segments beating at different rates), which in <italic>Drosophila</italic> results from partial conduction block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birse et al., 2010</xref>). Using these two fly DM1 models, we hoped to identify molecular players involved in DM1-associated conduction defects. We did not observe asynchronous heartbeats in flies expressing in the heart 960CTG repeats. This DM1 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Picchio et al., 2013</xref>) developed other cardiac phenotypes such as arrhythmia. To identify deregulated genes underlying conduction defects, we applied a heart-targeted TU-tagging approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller et al., 2009</xref>) followed by RNA sequencing. This cardiac cell-specific genome-wide approach yielded a discrete number of evolutionarily conserved candidate genes with altered cardiac expression in both DM1 models used, including regulators of cellular calcium. Among them, we found increased transcript levels of <italic>straightjacket</italic> (<italic>stj</italic>)<italic>/CACNA2D3 (α2δ3)</italic>, which encodes a major regulatory subunit of Ca-α1D/Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel, and is a key regulator of calcium current density, which triggers cardiac contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bodi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dolphin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mesirca et al., 2015</xref>). The role of <italic>stj</italic> transcript level in proper conduction is supported by cardiac-specific overexpression of <italic>stj</italic>, which leads to asynchronous heartbeat. Conversely, attenuating its expression by cardiac-specific knockdown in both DM1 fly heart models reverses cardiac asynchrony. Our hypothesis that <italic>stj</italic> contributes to the cardiac DM1-associated pathology is supported by our finding that ventricular <italic>α2δ3</italic> expression level is low in healthy mouse and human hearts, but is significantly increased in DM1 patients with cardiac conduction defects. Hence lowering <italic>α2δ3</italic> in ventricular cardiomyocytes could offer a potential treatment strategy for DM1-associated conduction defects and in particular intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Imbalance of MBNL1 and CELF1 counterparts in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart results in asynchronous heartbeat</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterparts of MBNL1 and CELF1, the Mbl and Bru-3 proteins, are both present in the fly heart cells, including contractile cardiomyocytes, and localize predominantly but not exclusively to the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Besides frequently observed arrhythmia, about 58% of <italic>Hand&gt;MblRNAi</italic> and 28% of <italic>Hand&gt;Bru-3</italic> flies displayed asynchronous heartbeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>), a hallmark of conduction disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birse et al., 2010</xref>). In some cases, asynchronous heartbeat can result in total heart block when at least one heart segment stops contracting. About 3% of <italic>Hand&gt;MblRNAi</italic> and 4% of <italic>Hand&gt;Bru-3</italic> flies did develop a total heart block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Finally, <italic>stj,</italic> whose transcript levels were significantly increased in both DM1 contexts, encodes an auxiliary subunit of this same Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel, and is known to positively regulate this channel’s abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2</italic> mutations are known to lead to diverse heartbeat dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Splawski et al., 2004</xref>), and <italic>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2</italic> deregulation is associated with DM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rau et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart of Cav1.2 (Ca-1αD) also ensures cardiac contractions and calcium transients in the fly heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Limpitikul et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a conserved role of Cav1.2/Ca-1αD in heartbeat. Here, by following a fluorescent calcium sensor (GCaMP3), we found that calcium waves shadowed synchronous cardiac contractions but were disrupted in asynchronously beating DM1 fly hearts, implying that aberrant calcium transient in cardiomyocytes is associated with heart asynchrony. Thus even if no specialized conduction system is present in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart, propagation of calcium waves along the cardiac tube is finely regulated to ensure synchronous heartbeat. Among selected calcium regulators, only cardiac overexpression of <italic>stj</italic> resulted in asynchronous heartbeat, so we focused our study on this candidate gene.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>Stj/α2δ3,</italic> new candidate gene for DM1-associated conduction defects</title><p>A previous large study dedicated to identifying genes involved in heat nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neely et al., 2010</xref>) identified <italic>stj/α2δ</italic>3 as an evolutionarily conserved pain gene. Here, we found <italic>stj</italic> transcripts upregulated in cardiomyocytes of two DM1 fly models <italic>Hand&gt;Bru-3</italic> and <italic>Hand&gt;MblRNAi</italic> exhibiting asynchronous heartbeat. We also show that reducing <italic>stj</italic> transcript levels significantly ameliorated heart asynchrony in <italic>Hand&gt;Bru-3</italic> hearts while improving the conduction defect phenotype of <italic>Hand&gt;MblRNAi</italic> flies. Thus additional gene deregulations contribute to asynchronous heartbeat in <italic>Hand&gt;MblRNAi</italic> context, attesting the complexity of heart dysfunction in DM1. At the protein level, Stj is also more abundant in cardiomyocytes of two <italic>Drosophila</italic> DM1 contexts with cardiac asynchrony, while at a very low level in the wild-type cardiomyocytes. This suggests Stj protein involvement in the DM1-associated asynchronous heartbeat in flies. The precise mechanisms causing <italic>stj</italic> transcript elevation in DM1 contexts remain to be defined, but our data suggest that a combination of splice-dependent and 3’UTR-dependent mechanisms could be in play.</p><p>Intriguingly, vertebrate <italic>stj</italic> counterpart <italic>α2δ</italic>3 also displays low transcript and protein levels in ventricular cardiomyocytes and a distinctively higher expression in atrial cardiac cells. We hypothesize that this differential expression could be related to the mechanisms regulating cardiomyocyte contraction in atria and in ventricles. The high <italic>α2δ</italic>3 expression in atria is consistent with cardiomyocyte-dependent conduction in atria that do not harbor a specialized conduction system. By contrast, its low expression in ventricles could be correlated with the presence of His-Purkinje fibers facilitating conduction in the large ventricular muscles. We were, however, unable to test <italic>α2δ3</italic> involvement in cardiac conduction defects in a DMSXL mouse DM1 model carrying large numbers of repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huguet et al., 2012</xref>) as it displays only mild cardiac involvement without conduction disturbances. We thus tested <italic>α2δ</italic>3 expression directly in human cardiac samples. Ventricular cardiomyocytes from healthy donors showed, like the control mice, low <italic>α2δ</italic>3 transcript expression, which was significantly elevated in ventricular cardiac cells from DM1 patients with conduction defects. DM1-associated increase of expression also occurs for α2δ3 protein and is accompanied by high transcript levels of the main cardiac channel unit <italic>Cav1.2/α1,</italic> suggesting that the <italic>α2δ</italic>3 elevation leads to a higher channel density and increased calcium entry to the cardiomyocytes. This could contribute to IVCD affecting the ventricular cardiomyocyte conduction rate and thereby the synchrony of cardiac contraction.</p><p>Taken together, with evidence based on heart-specific transcriptional profiling of DM1 <italic>Drosophila</italic> models and on gene deregulation in cardiac samples from DM1 patients, we propose that the conduction disturbance observed in DM1, and in particular IVCD, arises from likely impacted Ca-α1D/Cav1.2 calcium channel function in ventricular cardiomyocytes in which regulatory subunit stj/α2δ3 plays a central role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

The authors use the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model system which permits genetic manipulation of the misbalance between two RNA binding proteins, which triggers the disease. They examined the perturbations in gene expression in the heart that this produced and identified genes controlling calcium levels and notably a subunit of a calcium channel, α2δ3 known in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as straightjacket, which is present at an abnormally high level. They go on to show that overexpression of this gene in normal flies leads to asynchronous beating of the heart, whereas its downregulation in fly models for myotonic dystrophy improves the performance of the heart. Observations on mice and humans indicate that α2δ3 is normally low in the cardiac ventricles but is elevated in patients with myotonic dystrophy. These findings therefore suggest that reducing the level of this calcium channel sub-unit may be of therapeutic benefit for the prevention of cardiac conduction defects in patients suffering from myotonic dystrophy.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration.

Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rolf Bodmer (Reviewer #1); David Brook (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as it stands. However, if you can respond to the comments then we encourage a resubmission of the revised manuscript which will be sent to the same reviewers. They and the editor thought that responding to their comments would take more than the statutory revision period. They appreciated the fly work, with some points to be addressed, but were more critical of the data showing a link with DM. In addition to improving the results on patient material, the link would be reinforced by showing that in the fly model that you had developed, with the expanded repeat RNA, similar effects on <italic>stj</italic> are seen as with CELF1 and MBNL1 changes in expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Plantié et al., studies a potential role of straightjacket/α2δ3 deregulation in cardiac conduction defects in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1, taking advantage of the fruit fly as a genetic model. DM1 is a muscular dystrophy disease caused by a CTG triple repeat in <italic>dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (dmpk</italic>) which causes imbalance between Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1 (<italic>Mbl</italic> D. mel)) and CUGBP and ELAV-like family member 1 (CELF1 (<italic>Bru-3</italic> D. mel)). Importantly, as observed in flies the authors confirm transcriptional upregulation of α2δ3 in cardiac ventricles of DM1 patients supporting their findings. In their approach they used two different DM1 fly models exhibiting conduction defects and performed heart-specific TU-tagging based transcriptional profiling experiment, where they identified 4 genes involved in calcium handling (among them straightjacket, <italic>stj</italic>). Converging evidence from two different DM1 fly models with conduction defects that reveal a common subset of differentially expressed genes, demonstrates scientific rigor and strengthens the conclusions, including the link between the conduction defect and regulation of calcium transients. Overall, the findings are of high interest and relevance for understanding the mechanisms of DM1. However, several concerns need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given that both genes together found to exhibit altered expression in DM1 patients (Mbl/MBNL1 down and Bru-3/CELF1 up) and that the fly models exhibit phenotype only in 25% (<italic>Bru-3</italic> OE) or 58% (<italic>Mbl</italic> KD) of the flies, it would be of interest, whether there is an additive or synergistic effect on heart function by combining <italic>Mbl</italic> KD and <italic>Bru-3</italic> OE.</p><p>2) More information is needed on the phenotypes of the other 3 genes, as they are potentially also contributing to the DM1-like phenotypes. For example, use different drivers for <italic>inaD</italic>, since lethal with <italic>Hand-Gal4</italic>.</p><p>3) Statistical methods need to be explained better and appropriately applied to all quantitative measurements. For example, the categorical data (how many flies show defects out of how many) need to be statistically evaluated, such as by Chi-square test (e.g. Figure 1C, Figure 5C,D), or corrected for non-normal distribution in other situations. In Figure 5D, is <italic>Hand&gt;MblRNAi;stjRNAi</italic> statistically different from <italic>Hand&gt;MblRNAi</italic> alone?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors produced MBNL/CELF imbalance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart by decreasing the fly homologs Mbl/Bru-3. This produced asynchronous heart beats. They used heart-targeted TU-tagging specifically in heart cells followed by RNA sequencing to identify genes with altered expression that correlated with aberrant heart rhythm. They focus on <italic>straightjacket (stj)</italic>/CACNA2D3 (α2δ3), a subunit of the Cav1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel. Overexpression of <italic>stj</italic> in flies results in asynchronous heartbeats in 25-30% of flies and loss of <italic>stj</italic> function weakly rescues Mbl and rescues more convincingly rescues Bru-3.</p><p>One issue is the difficulty in establishing the specificity of the observed changes upon loss of Mbl or gain of Bru-3 as these relate to changes observed in DM1. For example, in both Mbl loss and Bru-3 gain, three other genes were shown to be down regulated and subsequent down regulation of each gene caused abnormal heart beats. MBNL and CELF families are highly conserved with antagonistic activities even in planaria so altered express will cause many abnormalities most of which are probably not related to DM. In this regard the study lacks experiments in a DM1 model where changes in straightjacket levels are observed in response to expression of CUG repeat RNA in the heart; CUG repeat RNA is the direct cause of the cardiac arrhythmias in DM1.</p><p>Another issue is that the level of Stj does not necessarily correlate with the extent of abnormal heart beats in Mbl knock down hearts (Figure 5C). While this could indicate additional contributing factors as suggested by the authors, it could also reflect a lack of cause effect relationship between MBNL/CELF, <italic>stj</italic> and cardiac arrhythmia.</p><p>The results attempting to show regulation of Stj mRNA by binding of Bru-3 is not convincing. There are no controls presented (mutation of putative binding sites) and what is the basis for identifying the Bru-3 and Mbl binding sites? A demonstration that Bru-3 regulates Stj mRNA levels by binding to the indicated element in the 3' UTR will need a good deal more work to establish the proposed hypothesis.</p><p>The statement that the results presented in Figure 6 &quot;indicating a link between DM1 associated conduction defects and cardiac α2δ3 transcript regulation&quot; is overstated. Given the large number of gene expression changes in DM1 heart, these data is not sufficient to make that case.</p><p>The data presented as immunofluorescence is difficult to interpret.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3'UTR of the DMPK gene. The repeat is transcribed but not translated into protein. The repeat expansion transcripts remain trapped in the nucleus where they sequester muscleblind-like proteins and stimulate the stabilization of CELF1. MBNL1 and CELF1 are counterbalanced factors involved in RNA splicing and an imbalance in these factors leads to a perturbation of RNA splicing in multiple transcripts and this is a key factor in DM1 pathophysiology. Electrocardiographic abnormalities are common in DM1, though this is rarely complete heart block.</p><p>In the present paper Plantié et al. identify Straightjacket (<italic>stj</italic>) deregulation as a factor in DM1-associated cardiac conduction defects. The authors overexpressed Bruno-3 (Bru-3) the fly ortholog of CELF1 and knocked down Mbl Muscleblind ortholog of MBNL1. Figure 1 shows the level of increase and or knockdown. In the case of Bru-3 this appears to be very highly expressed, whereas in DM1 CELF1 shows a comparatively modest increase and is stabilized via phosphorylation. Recent work indicates that number of repeat expansion transcripts is relatively small, possibly in the 6-20 range, which suggests that the amount of MBML1 sequestered may be relatively low.</p><p>Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics the authors were able to perform heart-specific transcriptional profiling, which led to the identification of a subset of genes, including <italic>stj</italic>. The authors provide supporting evidence on calcium waves and rescue experiments for the relevance of this gene to heart conduction. However, is there any evidence that <italic>stj</italic> is mis-spliced as this is thought to be the primary consequence of the MBNL1/CELF1 imbalance? I am not aware of compelling evidence to support upregulation of genes as a consequence of MBNL1/CELF1 imbalance. A paper from Ebralidze et al. (2004) proposed RNA leaching of transcription factors in DM1 causing reduced gene expression, but this was not linked to MBNL1/CELF1 imbalance. In subsection “Increased cardiac expression of <italic>stj</italic> involves 3’UTR regulation and contributes to asynchronous heartbeats in DM1 flies”, the authors suggest a possible mechanism involving <italic>stj</italic> isoforms with extended 3'UTRs but it is unclear how this is contributing to increased <italic>stj</italic> expression.</p><p>The final part of the paper provides the key link to DM1 as the authors show increased α2δ3 (<italic>stj</italic> ortholog) transcript expression in ventricular biopsies. It would be reasonable to expect Western blot data to demonstrate increased protein levels and possibly some evidence of effects in tissues from other regions of the heart.</p><p>Overall this is an interesting observation but a little more work is needed to strengthen two aspects: first the molecular mechanism underlying an increase in <italic>stj</italic> levels and second evidence that the α2δ3 protein is increased in DM1 heart.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Straightjacket/α2‎δ3 deregulation is associated with cardiac conduction defects in myotonic dystrophy type 1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rolf Bodmer (Reviewer #2); David Brook (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers are largely satisfied with the considerable additional work and modifications introduced in this re-submitted manuscript. However, before publication they require you to address the following points. There are still concerns of over-interpretation. In particular, while it is reasonable to propose that Mbl and Bru-3 bind and regulate the <italic>stj</italic> 3' UTR, the evidence is just not there. Also, the evidence that exon 15 is regulated by Mbl and Bru-3 is not convincing. The western blots showing the increase in α2δ3 protein are helpful and add support for the contention that the ortholog is affected in the disease. Overall the results of the effects of altered Mbl and Bru-3 are well done and are worth reporting with several modifications.</p><p>The authors need to indicate in the manuscript that the expression of CUG RNA repeats in the fly model does not impact <italic>stj</italic> expression. Also putting this information in the context that the DMSXL mouse model does not show conduction defects does not provide a justification for the lack of an effect on <italic>stj</italic> in their fly model; rather it means that the mouse model is not representative of DM1 heart phenotype.</p><p>The RNAseq tracts in Figure 5E are not sufficient to demonstrate a change in splicing of the exon indicated by the authors. The sequencing is not sufficiently deep to even detect all of the constitutive exons in their entirety. This analysis requires RT-PCR across the alternative exon. The RT-PCR in Figure 5E—figure supplement 2 is not the standard (or correct) approach to determine PSI – this requires using primers on flanking constitutive exons. The authors claim that Bru-3 gain or Mbl protein loss 'promotes' inclusion of exon 15 specific for <italic>stj-RC</italic>. However, since &quot;<italic>stj</italic> total&quot; is augmented by the same relative level, it is overall expression that is augmented, and in this approach does not speak to an alteration in splicing pattern. Exon 15 does not seem to be preferentially selected for, there is just overall more expression. The conclusions should reflect that. Alternatively, since the alternative splicing of <italic>stj</italic> is not a main point for the paper this part can be removed.</p><p>Figure 5E—figure supplement 2 is not sufficient to implicate that there are Mbl and Bru-3 binding sites in the indicated regions. There needs to be an analysis of statistical enrichment; one can find short sequences matching RNA binding protein binding motifs given they are short and variable.

We tested additional RNAi lines for each of them (listed in Materials and methods section). Notice that for <italic>inaD</italic> we tested two additional RNAi lines and found they do not display lethality when crossed with Hand-Gal4.

For example, the categorical data (how many flies show defects out of how many) need to be statistically evaluated, such as by Chi-square test (e.g. Figure 1C, Figure 5C,D), or corrected for non-normal distribution in other situations. In Figure 5D, is Hand&gt;MblRNAi;stjRNAi statistically different from Hand&gt;MblRNAi alone?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we provide now statistical evaluation of asynchronous heartbeat data in all presented genetic contexts. We applied Fisher’s exact test. In Figure 5D<italic>Hand&gt;MblRNAi;stjRNAi</italic> rescue was compared with <italic>Hand&gt;MblRNAi;UPRT</italic> double UAS condition and it is not significantly different. However, it is (p=0,02), when compared with <italic>Hand&gt;MblRNAi</italic> alone (as suggested by the reviewer). This is also true for <italic>Hand-Bru-3;stjRNAi</italic> rescue condition.

For example, in both Mbl loss and Bru-3 gain, three other genes were shown to be down regulated and subsequent down regulation of each gene caused abnormal heart beats.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding relation to DM1, knockdown of Mbl mimics sequestration of Mbl while gain of Bru-3 mimics an increase of Bru-3 level, both observed in DM1. In our previous study (Picchio et al., 2018) by using transcriptional profiling we already demonstrated that 85% of genes deregulated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> DM1 model expressing 960 CTG repeats are common with Mbl RNAi and about 50% with Bru-3 gain of function context. We thus consider that analysing Mbl loss and Bru-3 gain of function and in particular genes commonly deregulated in these two contexts could provide valuable cues to DM1. This strategy was applied in the present study.</p><p>To better characterize cardiac phenotypes of three other candidate genes (<italic>inaD, Syn1</italic> and <italic>Rgk2)</italic> and avoid potential off target effects we analyzed heart physiology in additional RNAi lines for those genes. Newly generated data are included to revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MBNL and CELF families are highly conserved with antagonistic activities even in planaria so altered express will cause many abnormalities most of which are probably not related to DM. In this regard the study lacks experiments in a DM1 model where changes in straightjacket levels are observed in response to expression of CUG repeat RNA in the heart; CUG repeat RNA is the direct cause of the cardiac arrhythmias in DM1.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue needs some clarifications indeed as not all cardiac phenotypes observed in DM1 patients are easily reproduced in animal models expressing toxic CTG repeats. This is the case of DM1 associated conduction defects which were previously described i double KO mice for MBNL1 and MBNL2 (Lee et al., 2013) and in cardiac CELF1 gain of function context (Koshelev et al., 2010) but not in DMSLX mice harboring long CTG repeats (Algalarrondo et al., 2015).</p><p>Like in mice, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, cardiac conduction defects are only present in loss of Mbl and gain of Bru-3 contexts but not in CTG repeats DM1 model. This indicates that loss of MBNL1/Mbl and gain of CELF1/Bru-3 models are more adapted than CTG repeat DM1 models to reproduce this severe cardiac phenotype observed in DM1 patients. Taking this into account we directly asked whether the increase in <italic>stj</italic> expression (contributing to conduction defects in fly models) could be detected in cardiac samples of DM1 patients with conduction defects.</p><p>It turned out that this is the case both at Stj/CACNA2D3 transcript and as we show now by Western blot at protein levels as well. Consistent with lack of cardiac conduction phenotypes, we do not detect changes in <italic>stj</italic> expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> CTG repeat DM1 model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue is that the level of Stj does not necessarily correlate with the extent of abnormal heart beats in Mbl knock down hearts (Figure 5C). While this could indicate additional contributing factors as suggested by the authors, it could also reflect a lack of cause effect relationship between MBNL/CELF, stj and cardiac arrhythmia.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, conduction defects have been previously observed in MBNL1/2 DKO (Lee et al., 2013) and CELF1 gain of function (Koshelev et al., 2010) mouse models and we show here that this DM1-associated cardiac phenotype is also present in analogous contexts in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. As suggested by partial rescue of Mbl knockdown Stj is not the sole player, but it appears to be an important contributor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results attempting to show regulation of Stj mRNA by binding of Bru-3 is not convincing. There are no controls presented (mutation of putative binding sites) and what is the basis for identifying the Bru-3 and Mbl binding sites? A demonstration that Bru-3 regulates Stj mRNA levels by binding to the indicated element in the 3' UTR will need a good deal more work to establish the proposed hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that presented data do not sufficiently support 3’UTR-based regulation of Stj expression and that amount of work required to establish our hypothesis is not compatible with the time frame of all other revisions. However, to make a step forward we performed in silico search for MBNL1 and CELF1 binding sites (Lambert et al., 2014) within the 3’UTR <italic>stj</italic> region. We found that the long 3’UTR sequence contains several predicted CELF1/Bru-3 and MBNL1/Mbl binding sites (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), suggesting that an interplay between Bru-3 and Mbl proteins bound to 3’UTR could regulate <italic>stj</italic> isoforms abundance. In parallel, as demonstrated by Exon15 targeted qRT-PCR analysis (Figure 5—figure supplement 2) the Mbl loss and Bru-3 gain of function, both promote inclusion of Exon 15 leading to the upregulation of <italic>stj-RC</italic>. Thus, we hypothesize that in DM1 context a combination of splice-dependent and 3’UTR-dependent mechanisms control elevation of <italic>stj</italic> transcripts in cardiac cells. We include an appropriate comment to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statement that the results presented in Figure 6 &quot;indicating a link between DM1 associated conduction defects and cardiac α2δ3 transcript regulation&quot; is overstated. Given the large number of gene expression changes in DM1 heart, these data is not sufficient to make that case.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and modify this Results section as follow:</p><p>“Ventricular α2δ3 transcript and protein levels were both significantly higher in DM1 patients with conduction disturbances compared to controls (Figure 6C, D). We also found, by analyzing the same human samples a higher expression of the main Calcium channel α1/Cav1.2 unit (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) further supporting the view (Figure 6E) that Ca<sup>2</sup> inward current deregulation underlies DM1-associated conduction defects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>In the present paper Plantié et al. identify Straightjacket (stj) deregulation as a factor in DM1-associated cardiac conduction defects. The authors overexpressed Bruno-3 (Bru-3) the fly ortholog of CELF1 and knocked down Mbl Muscleblind ortholog of MBNL1. Figure 1 shows the level of increase and or knockdown. In the case of Bru-3 this appears to be very highly expressed, whereas in DM1 CELF1 shows a comparatively modest increase and is stabilized via phosphorylation. Recent work indicates that number of repeat expansion transcripts is relatively small, possibly in the 6-20 range, which suggests that the amount of MBML1 sequestered may be relatively low.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that knocking down Mbl or overexpressing Bru-3 will not perfectly reproduce DM1 condition and in consequence all aspects of gene deregulations observed in DM1. Nevertheless, loss of Mbnl1 and gain of CELF1 functions have already been used to model DM1 by other labs. In our previous study (Picchio et al., 2018) by using transcriptional profiling we demonstrated that 85% of genes deregulated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> DM1 model with muscle targeted expression of 960 CTG repeats are common with Mbl RNAi and about 50% with Bru-3 gain of function context. We thus consider that analysing Mbl loss and Bru-3 gain of function and in particular genes commonly deregulated in these two contexts could provide valuable cues to DM1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Using Drosophila genetics the authors were able to perform heart-specific transcriptional profiling, which led to the identification of a subset of genes, including stj. The authors provide supporting evidence on calcium waves and rescue experiments for the relevance of this gene to heart conduction. However, is there any evidence that stj is mis-spliced as this is thought to be the primary consequence of the MBNL1/CELF1 imbalance? I am not aware of compelling evidence to support upregulation of genes as a consequence of MBNL1/CELF1 imbalance. A paper from Ebralidze et al. (2004) proposed RNA leaching of transcription factors in DM1 causing reduced gene expression, but this was not linked to MBNL1/CELF1 imbalance. In subsection “Increased cardiac expression of stj involves 3’UTR regulation and contributes to asynchronous heartbeats in DM1 flies”, the authors suggest a possible mechanism involving stj isoforms with extended 3'UTRs but it is unclear how this is contributing to increased stj expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide now a more compelling evidence for the up regulation of one particular stj isoform – <italic>stj-RC</italic> in both <italic>MblRNAi</italic> and Bru-3 gain of function contexts (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Stj-RC carries long 3’UTR but also contains alternatively spliced Exon 15. As demonstrated by Wang et al., (2015), both MBNL1 and CELF1 do not only act as alternative splice regulators but also display 3’UTR binding activities with potential role in regulation transcripts stability. In the case of <italic>stj-RC</italic> transcript its 3’UTR sequence contains several predicted CELF1/Bru-3 and MBNL1/Mbl binding sites, suggesting that an interplay between Bru-3 and Mbl proteins bound to 3’UTR could regulate <italic>stj-RC</italic> abundance (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). In parallel, Bru-3 gain and Mbl loss, both promote inclusion of Exon 15 (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Thus, we hypothesize that a combination of splice-dependent and 3’UTRdependent mechanisms is involved in up regulation of <italic>stj</italic>. We add appropriate comments to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The final part of the paper provides the key link to DM1 as the authors show increased α2δ3 (stj ortholog) transcript expression in ventricular biopsies. It would be reasonable to expect Western blot data to demonstrate increased protein levels and possibly some evidence of effects in tissues from other regions of the heart.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. With limited amount of available tissue from cardiac biopsies we were able to perform Western blot on 3 out of 5 DM1 ventricular cardiac samples analysed for transcript expression. We found that similarly to transcripts, α2δ3 protein is significantly elevated in DM1 condition. These new data are included to Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall this is an interesting observation but a little more work is needed to strengthen two aspects: first the molecular mechanism underlying an increase in stj levels and second evidence that the α2δ3 protein is increased in DM1 heart.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and hope our additional data included to Figure 5 and Figure 6 strengthen two above aspects.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to indicate in the manuscript that the expression of CUG RNA repeats in the fly model does not impact stj expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We introduced the following sentence to the Introduction: “We did not observe asynchronous heartbeats in flies expressing in the heart 960CTG repeats.

The sequencing is not sufficiently deep to even detect all of the constitutive exons in their entirety. This analysis requires RT-PCR across the alternative exon. The RT-PCR in Figure 5E—figure supplement 2 is not the standard (or correct) approach to determine PSI – this requires using primers on flanking constitutive exons. The authors claim that Bru-3 gain or Mbl protein loss 'promotes' inclusion of exon 15 specific for stj-RC. However, since &quot;stj total&quot; is augmented by the same relative level, it is overall expression that is augmented, and in this approach does not speak to an alteration in splicing pattern. Exon 15 does not seem to be preferentially selected for, there is just overall more expression. The conclusions should reflect that. Alternatively, since the alternative splicing of stj is not a main point for the paper this part can be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that alternative splicing is not a main point here and modify a portion of the text subsection “Increased cardiac expression of <italic>stj</italic> contributes to asynchronous heartbeats in DM1 flies” related to Figure 5E and Figure 5—figure supplement 2, which were also modified accordingly.
