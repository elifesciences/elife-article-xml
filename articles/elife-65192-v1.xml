223-amino-acid-long transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein. S1R modulates activity of multiple effector proteins and is a well-established drug target. However, signaling functions of S1R in cells are poorly understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that biological activity of S1R in cells can be explained by its ability to interact with cholesterol and to form cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the ER membrane. By performing experiments in reduced reconstitution systems, we demonstrate direct effects of cholesterol on S1R clustering. We identify a novel cholesterol-binding motif in the transmembrane region of human S1R. Mutations of this motif impair association of recombinant S1R with cholesterol beads, affect S1R clustering in vitro and disrupt S1R subcellular localization. We demonstrate that S1R-induced membrane microdomains have increased local membrane thickness and that increased local cholesterol concentration and/or membrane thickness in these microdomains can modulate signaling of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α in the ER. Further, S1R agonists cause disruption of S1R clusters, suggesting that biological activity of S1R agonists is linked to remodeling of ER membrane microdomains. Our results provide novel insights into S1R-mediated signaling mechanisms in cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sigma-1 receptor</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>mitochondria-associated membranes</kwd><kwd>lipid microdomains</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS056224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bezprozvanny</surname><given-names>Ilya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG055577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bezprozvanny</surname><given-names>Ilya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM113079</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liou</surname><given-names>Jen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Michael K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosen</surname><given-names>Michael K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006769</institution-id><institution>Russian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-15-00184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bezprozvanny</surname><given-names>Ilya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Signaling function of sigma 1 receptor is related to its ability to organize cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholesterol is an essential component of cellular membranes, and levels of cholesterol in cells are tightly controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Goldstein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldstein and Brown, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). The plasma membrane (PM) is highly enriched in cholesterol and other sterols, containing 30–40% cholesterol and 10–30% sphingolipids based on molar amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). It is widely accepted that cholesterol is not distributed homogeneously in the PM and instead forms lipid rafts, or cholesterol-enriched microdomains, that play important signaling roles in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Levental et al., 2020</xref>). Although cholesterol is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the concentration of cholesterol in ER membranes is much lower than in the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). Level of ER cholesterol is maintained by an &quot;on-and-off&quot; switch of the Scap-SREBP pathway with a half-maximal response of SREBP-2 at about 5 molar % cholesterol in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). There is limited information about spatial distribution of cholesterol in the ER membrane, but recent studies suggested existence of cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Area-Gomez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayashi and Fujimoto, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Montesinos et al., 2020</xref>). One of the most studied examples of such microdomains are mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which are sites on the ER membrane in immediate proximity to the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Csordás et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Prinz et al., 2020</xref>). MAMs have been shown to play important roles in a variety of cellular functions, such as ER to mitochondria Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Csordás et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hajnóczky et al., 2002</xref>), ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hajnóczky et al., 2002</xref>), lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Csordás et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vance, 2014</xref>), and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garofalo et al., 2016</xref>). Unsurprisingly, MAM dysregulation was observed in numerous pathophysiological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schon and Area-Gomez, 2013</xref>), cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morciano et al., 2018</xref>), and lysosomal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Annunziata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sano et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Sigma 1 receptor (S1R) is a 223-amino-acid-long, single-pass transmembrane ER protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayashi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ryskamp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schmidt and Kruse, 2019</xref>) that has a short cytoplasmic tail and a large luminal ligand-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mavylutov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). It has been suggested that S1R acts as a molecular chaperone that can stabilize a native conformation of multiple client proteins in stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayashi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Su et al., 2010</xref>). Recent studies also suggested that S1R can act as an RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). S1R is highly enriched in the liver and expressed in the nervous system. Analysis of S1R knockout (KO) mice revealed a number of nervous system abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couly et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that S1R plays an important role in neurons. In humans, mutations in S1R lead to a juvenile form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Saif et al., 2011</xref>) and distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almendra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gregianin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Horga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ververis et al., 2020</xref>). In animal models, genetic ablation of S1R exacerbates pathology of several neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hong et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mavlyutov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). S1R is considered to be a potential drug target for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Herrando-Grabulosa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim and Maher, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ryskamp et al., 2019</xref>). S1R binds multiple classes of drugs with nano- and sub-micromolar affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maurice and Su, 2009</xref>). Based on their biological activity, S1R ligands are classified into agonists and antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maurice and Su, 2009</xref>). Signaling functions of S1R in cells are under intense investigation. The most prominent hypothesis is that under resting conditions S1R forms an inert complex with GRP78/BiP protein in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hayashi and Su, 2007</xref>). When activated by agonists or in conditions of cellular stress, S1R dissociates from BiP and is able to interact with a variety of client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hayashi and Su, 2007</xref>).</p><p>S1R preferentially localizes to MAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hayashi and Su, 2007</xref>), and genetic KO of S1R in mice results in impaired MAM stability as evidenced by reduced number of contacts on electron micrographs and biochemical fractionation of MAM components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>). MAMs are cholesterol-enriched microdomains within the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Area-Gomez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayashi and Fujimoto, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Montesinos et al., 2020</xref>), and previous studies demonstrated that S1R can directly interact with cholesterol and ceramides in MAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayashi and Fujimoto, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayashi and Su, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that S1R association with cholesterol plays a critical role in organization of specialized lipid microdomains in the ER, including MAMs. Using two in vitro reconstitution systems, we demonstrated cholesterol-dependent clustering of S1R in lipid bilayers. We identified a novel cholesterol-binding site in the S1R sequence and demonstrated the importance of this site for S1R clustering. We further demonstrated that S1R agonists reduced the number and size of S1R clusters in the presence of cholesterol. Based on these results, we conclude that the main biological function of S1R in cells is related to its ability to organize and remodel cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the ER. Our conclusion is consistent with MAM defects observed in the S1R KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>S1R localizes to MAMs</title><p>To investigate the subcellular localization of S1R, we transfected HEK293 cells with a construct encoding a S1R-GFP fusion protein and performed confocal imaging experiments. Previous reports indicated that intracellular localization of the C-terminally tagged S1R is similar to that of the endogenous receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayashi and Su, 2003b</xref>). To visualize the ER, we co-transfected cells with mCherry-Sec61β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zurek et al., 2011</xref>). In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayashi and Su, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayashi and Su, 2003b</xref>), S1R-GFP formed puncta in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine if these puncta corresponded to MAMs, we co-stained cells with a mitochondrial marker TOM20 and established that S1R-GFP puncta were frequently found in close opposition to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast to wild-type (WT) S1R, an ALS-causing mutant S1R-E102Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Saif et al., 2011</xref>) was distributed uniformly in the ER and was not enriched in proximity to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to increase the spatial resolution of our experiments, we utilized the protein retention expansion microscopy (pro-ExM) procedure that resulted in a 4.0–4.5-fold physical expansion of the specimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>). HEK293 cells were co-transfected with S1R-GFP, mCherry-Sec61β, and stained with anti-GFP, anti-mCherry, and anti-TOM20 antibodies and processed according to the pro-ExM procedure for imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Measurements of signal intensities of mCherry-Sec61b and S1R-GFP markers along the selected ER tubule indicated enrichment of S1R in the areas of mitochondrial proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We then calculated the overlap between S1R-GFP, mCherry-Sec61β, and mitochondria. On average, 12 ± 5% of mCherry-Sec61β signal area overlapped with mitochondria, while a higher degree of overlap was observed for S1R-GFP and mitochondria, with fractional area of 31 ± 7% (n [number of cells] = 5, p-value=0.0034). As an alternative approach, we performed a biochemical fractionation of MAMs from mice liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which confirmed enrichment of S1R in MAM fraction. Taken together, this data confirmed that S1R-GFP is enriched in ER subdomains in close opposition to mitochondria, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hayashi and Su, 2007</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>S1R targeting to mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) in HEK293 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intracellular distribution of wild-type S1R-GFP (green) was visualized in HEK293 cells by co-expressing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker mCherry-Sec61β (red) and by immunostaining with a mitochondrial marker TOM20 (magenta).

Frequently, the S1R coalesced into one large domain (more examples of S1R behavior in cholesterol-free and cholesterol-containing liposomes are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Similar results were obtained when 20 mol % of cholesterol was included in the lipid mixtures used for GUVs formation (data not shown).

We expressed wild-type and mutant S1R-GFP fusions in HEK293 cells and performed selective permeabilization of the PM with digitonin. At low concentrations, digitonin permeabilizes plasma, but not the ER membrane, thus leaving ER luminal epitopes inaccessible to antibodies. When cells expressing wild-type S1R-GFP were stained with anti-GFP antibodies, we did not observe any anti-GFP antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the C-terminus of the S1R-GFP fusion was inaccessible and located in the ER lumen, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mavlyutov et al., 2017</xref>).

Therefore, we excluded these mutants from further analysis.</p><p>Wild-type and mutant S1R were expressed in HEK293 cells and their distribution was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Wild-type S1R and the S1R-Y201S/Y206S mutant each formed puncta in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, the S1R distribution in the ER was diffuse for the S1R-Y173S, S1R-4G, and S1R-W9L/W11L mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). By performing TOM20-staining experiments, we confirmed that the puncta observed with the wild-type S1R and Y201S/Y206S mutant corresponded to MAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In order to obtain a quantitative measure of the S1R distribution in the ER network, we calculated Mander’s overlap coefficient between mCherry-Sec61β and S1R-GFP. Mander’s coefficient measures fractional overlap between two channels and varies from 0 (no correlation) to 1 (complete correlation). For wild-type S1R, Mander’s coefficient was M = 0.50 ± 0.02 (n = 3, 25 cells), indicating that not all mCherry-Sec61β signal colocalized with the GFP signal in S1R clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, Mander’s coefficient was equal to 0.77 ± 0.09 (n = 2, 11 cells) for S1R-Y173S, 0.72 ± 0.04 (n = 3, 30 cells) for S1R-4G, and 0.77 ± 0.03 (n = 3, 17 cells) for S1R-W9L/W11L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), reflecting more diffuse distribution patterns. We have also explored the insertion of four alanine stretch (S1R-4A) instead of glycines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for quantification). S1R-4A behaved similarly to S1R-4G mutant. Mander’s coefficient for the S1R-Y201S/Y206S mutant was equal to 0.49 ± 0.16 (n = 2, 12 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), similar to the wild type. Taken together, we concluded that the newly identified CARC motif is important for S1R targeting to MAMs and that the Y201/Y206 motif is dispensable. Effects of Y173 mutation may be related to misfolding of S1R, as this residue has no membrane contact in the S1R crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). To better showcase the distribution of S1R-4G and S1R-W9L/W11L in cells, we performed expansion microscopy of the samples, similar to the experiments that we performed with wild-type S1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that in contrast to the clustered distribution of wild-type S1R, S1R-4G and S1R-W9L/W11L mutants had diffuse localization inside and outside of the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We then asked if targeting to membrane contact sites is a general property of S1R or it is specific for MAMs. Previously S1R was shown to regulate store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Srivats et al., 2016</xref>), and we reasoned that S1R may also be present at ER-PM junctions. To test this hypothesis, we co-expressed S1R-GFP with a genetically encoded ER-PM marker mCherry-MAPPER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2013</xref>) in HeLa cells. We first examined subcellular distribution of WT protein and mutants using conventional confocal microscopy near the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As reported previously, MAPPER (shown in red) formed small punctate patterns corresponding to the ER membrane in close proximity to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). S1R-GFP appeared enriched in these same puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), in agreement with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Srivats et al., 2016</xref>). S1R-4G and S1R-W9L/W11L were distributed diffusely in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). When we analyzed cells using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we confirmed enrichment of S1R-GFP in MAPPER-positive puncta compared to the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We quantified S1R-GFP fluorescence in MAPPER-positive puncta and normalized this value to the total GFP fluorescence in the TIRF plane in the same cell. For wild-type S1R-GFP, 16 ± 7% of the fluorescence signal was localized to the ER-PM junctions compared to 7 ± 5% for S1R-4G mutant and 5 ± 3% for S1R-W9L/W11L mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that wild-type S1R localizes to and is enriched in ER contact sites such as MAMs and ER-PM junctions and that CARC motif is important for S1R targeting to these sites.</p><p>To further validate the importance of the CARC motif in S1R cholesterol-dependent clustering, we expressed and purified S1R-4G and S1R-W9L/W11L mutant proteins; and performed GUV reconstitution experiments in the presence of 10 mol % cholesterol. The S1R-W9L/W11L mutant formed less clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), consistent with the diffuse distribution of this mutant in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). However, S1R-4G still formed clusters when reconstituted in GUVs, similar to the wild-type S1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). This was in contrast to the diffuse distribution of the S1R-4G mutant in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). To explain these results, we reasoned that the W9L/W11L mutation abolished S1R association with cholesterol, but the 4G mutation only weakened it as this mutation still contains the CARC consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fantini and Barrantes, 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cholesterol binding of the S1R CARC mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of purified S1R-4G and S1R-W9L/W11L in cholesterol-containing giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with S1R-647 in magenta and NBD-labeled phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC) in green.

Purified recombinant S1R was incubated with cholesterol agarose, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and fractions containing beads and supernantant were analyzed by western blot with anti-S1R antibodies. First, we confirmed that recombinant S1R binds to cholesterol agarose, but not to the control resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To further confirm these findings, we expressed wild-type and mutant S1R-6His in HEK293 cells, and used cellular lysates from transfected cells in pulldown experiments with cholesterol agarose beads. In these experiments, anti-His tag antibodies were used for detection of recombinant S1R-6His.

S1R did not form clusters in DNPC GUVs neither in the absence nor in the presence of 20% cholesterol (0%: 6.8%, 92 liposomes, 20%: 2.9%, 77 liposomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). From these results, we concluded that local increase in membrane thickness contributes to S1R targeting to cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the ER. We then hypothesized that by clustering with cholesterol, S1R can also promote the formation of microdomains with thicker bilayer structure. To measure local membrane thickness in these microdomains, we utilized two designed molecular rulers that report on transmembrane thickness – MBP-TM17, with a short transmembrane helix, and MBP-TM27, with a longer transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The amino acid sequences of TM17 and TM27 were designed based on the synthetic peptides previously used in GUV studies of membrane thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaiser et al., 2011</xref>). Similar WALP-GFP fusion proteins were successfully used for measurements of the ER lipid heterogeneity in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Prasad et al., 2020</xref>). The hydrophobic length of MBP-TM17, calculated using 1.5 Å rise per residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hildebrand et al., 2004</xref>), matches well with the hydrophobic thickness of the DOPC bilayer (25.5 Å and 26.8 Å, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kučerka et al., 2006</xref>). The calculated hydrophobic length of TM27 is longer (40.5 Å) and matches well to a lipid bilayer with longer acyl chains or a bilayer with high cholesterol content (DOPC+30–40 mol % cholesterol, 36.0 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Milovanovic et al., 2015</xref>). MBP-TM17 and MBP-TM27 proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, purified using affinity and size exclusion chromatographies, and then covalently labeled with Alexa555 dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The MBP-TM17 and MBP-TM27 were first reconstituted into DOPC GUVs in the absence or presence of 10% cholesterol. We found that in the cholesterol-free conditions , MBP-TM17 was distributed largely uniformly in the GUV membrane while MBP-TM27 was enriched at the junctions between the individual GUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Cholesterol had little effect on the distribution of MBP-TMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We hypothesized that MBP-TM27 localized to the GUV junction sites based on a hydrophobic matching mechanism. Interestingly, clustering of S1R at the sites of contacts between different GUVs was occasionally observed in the absence of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel), most likely due to increase in local membrane thickness at these sites. When S1R and MBP-TM proteins were co-reconstituted together, they were distributed diffusely in the membrane in the absence of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). When these rulers were reconstituted together with S1R in the presence of 20% cholesterol, they displayed a different behavior: while MBP-TM17 remained largely diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, top panel), MBP-TM27 formed clusters that colocalized with S1R clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, bottom panel). Analysis of linear density of MBP-TM proteins inside and outside S1R clusters confirmed that MBP-TM27 was enriched in S1R domains, while MBP-TM17 showed no partitioning to S1R clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Importantly, this behavior was observed for an artificially designed MBP-TM27 protein, suggesting that recruitment and clustering events were mainly driven by lipid-protein interactions. These results suggested that in the presence of cholesterol S1R induces formation of membrane microdomains with increased local thickness.</p><p>To further validate that the same protein recruitment mechanism can be observed for known S1R biological partners, we extended our analysis to an inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α). S1R and IRE1α localize in a close proximity to each other in the ER, but do not necessarily interact directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rosen et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to protein-protein interactions, IRE1α oligomerization and stress-response activity can be also modulated by the surrounding lipid environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Halbleib et al., 2017</xref>). Loading ER with cholesterol affects IRE1α signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2003</xref>). First, to confirm colocalization of S1R and IRE1α in cells, we utilized a proximity-labeling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hung et al., 2016</xref>). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with S1R-APEX2 protein or control ER-targeted constructs APEX2-KDEL or Sec61β-APEX2. Following transfection, cells were incubated with biotin-phenol and exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for a short period of time to induce biotinylation of proteins in proximity to APEX2. Cell lysates were collected, and biotinylated proteins were pulled down using streptavidin-agarose. The eluate containing biotinylated proteins was analyzed by western blot. Significantly more biotinylated IRE1α was pulled down from the cells expressed S1R-APEX2 than from the cells expressing APEX2-KDEL or Sec61β-APEX2 control constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results suggested close proximity of IRE1α and S1R-APEX2, consistent with the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rosen et al., 2019</xref>). Short-term (2 hr) stress induction with 1 μM thapsigargin (Tg) had no measurable effect on colocalization of S1R and IRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To test whether S1R co-assembles with IRE1α in GUV membranes, we used a similar approach that we previously utilized for the MBP-TM rulers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). For these experiments, we generated an expression construct MBP-IRE1α-TM that consisted of the MBP protein fused to the transmembrane helix of human IRE1α and the upstream amphipathic helix (433–464 a.a) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2019</xref>). MBP-IRE1α-TM protein was expressed in bacteria, purified, and labeled with Alexa555 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). MBP-IRE1α-TM protein labeled with Alexa555 was co-reconstituted together with S1R labeled with Alexa647 in GUVs and imaged by fluorescence confocal microscopy. In the absence of cholesterol, the distributions of MBP-IRE1α-TM and S1R were uniform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, top panel). However, in the presence of 20% cholesterol, MBP-IRE1α-TM was recruited to S1R-positive clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, H</xref>, bottom panel). These results suggested that the transmembrane domain of IRE1α partitions into a lipid microenvironment established by S1R in the presence of cholesterol.</p><p>To confirm the functional relevance of IRE1α localization to S1R microdomains in the ER, we compared IRE1α-mediated signaling in wild-type, and S1R knockout (KO) HEK293 cells. S1R KO HEK293 cell line was generated by CRISPR approach, using the same procedure used to generate S1R KO MEF cells in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ryskamp et al., 2017</xref>). Western blotting experiments confirmed absence of S1R in S1R KO HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Unfolded protein response (UPR) was induced in these cells by addition of 1 μM Tg and levels of IRE1α phosphorylation were examined by western blot using anti-phospho-IRE1α antibody. We determined that under resting conditions the level of phosphorylated IRE1α was lower in S1R KO cells when compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Under ER stress conditions, the same peak level of IRE1α phosphorylation could not be achieved in S1R KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), and total cellular response, measured as integrated area under the curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), was significantly smaller in S1R KO cells compared to WT, suggesting an impairement in IRE1α signaling. To further examine the activity of IRE1α, we quantified levels of the XBP1s protein, a known downstream effector of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>). We found that production of XBP1s was delayed in S1R KO cells when compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that recruitment of IRE1α to S1R-organized microdomains in the ER facilitated IRE1α-mediated signaling. Our conclusions are supported by previously reported inhibition of IRE1α activity in cells transfected with S1R RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mori et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The dynamic organization of S1R clusters in double supported lipid bilayers</title><p>Based on their biological activity, agonists and antagonists of S1R have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maurice and Su, 2009</xref>). Previous research indicated that S1Rs can redistribute in the ER upon ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hayashi and Su, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hayashi and Su, 2007</xref>). In the next series of experiments, we sought to understand whether S1R ligands can analogously affect the formation and stability of S1R clusters in vitro. It is technically difficult to measure time-resolved dynamics of protein clustering in the membrane of GUVs using standard confocal microscopy. Thus, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), a system commonly employed to measure the dynamics of membrane-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ditlev, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Su et al., 2016b</xref>) SLBs are typically formed on a glass or mica surface, but in this format transmembrane proteins bind to the underlying glass/mica and usually become immobilized. Recently, several groups reported formation of polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-cushioned bilayers that retained mobility of transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pace et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Richards et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). When we attempted to form supported or cushioned bilayers with reconstituted S1R, we observed that protein and lipids were static, presumably due to interaction with the glass surface (data not shown). To overcome these limitations, we modified the bilayer formation procedure to generate double supported lipid bilayers (DSLBs). In DSLBs, PEGylated lipids are used as supports between the two separate bilayers: a lower bilayer that contacts the glass surface is composed of DOPC and 1 mol % DSPE-PEG2000-biotin lipids and an upper bilayer that rests on the first and is composed of lipids and purified transmembrane proteins. To build the DSLB, the first bilayer is formed by fusion and spreading of small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), prepared by freeze-thaw of DOPC and 1 mol % DSPE-PEG2000-biotin lipids, on a clean glass surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The second bilayer is formed by deposition of extruded LUVs containing 0.1% NBD-PC as a membrane dye that can be used to measure membrane lipid fluidity by TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of NBD-PC indicated that lipids in the upper bilayer are highly mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To incorporate protein in the DSLB, purified S1R-Alexa647 was first reconstituted in LUVs using the same approach as for the GUV studies. Protein-loaded LUVs were then applied to the pre-formed lower DOPC bilayer and allowed to spread and form a continuous upper bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The second bilayer was within the TIRF penetration depth (100 nm). FRAP experiments indicated that S1R molecules in this system are mobile and can quickly diffuse laterally in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Visualization of S1R clusters in double supported lipid bilayers (DLSBs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The DSLB technique.

Small clusters of S1R were highly mobile in the DSLB membrane, whereas large clusters were relatively static. To investigate effects of cholesterol on S1R clustering, we incorporated S1R-647 into DSLBs containing increasing amounts of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In agreement with the GUV data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we found that increased cholesterol in DSLBs caused S1R to cooperatively assemble into large clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The threshold for S1R clustering was in a narrow range between 2.5 and 5.0 mol % (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, black line), consistent with a typical ER cholesterol content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). To determine the number of S1R molecules in each of these clusters, we divided the integrated intensity of each cluster by the intensity of a mono-labeled His-pLAT-647 protein molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Su et al., 2016a</xref>). This analysis revealed that small S1R clusters most likely corresponded to S1R trimers, containing on average 2.65 ± 0.58 (n = 47) molecules, consistent with the crystal structure of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). The number of S1R molecules in the large clusters was widely distributed in a range between tens and hundreds of molecules, with a mean value of 38 molecules per cluster at 20 mol % cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Titration of cholesterol caused the right-shift in molecular weight distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and also increased the average cluster size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, red line). To measure the relative lateral mobility of the lipids, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments on NBD-PC within S1R clusters and in the surrounding membrane (in the presence of 20% cholesterol). Following photobleaching, the recovery of NBD-PC signal was complete outside of S1R clusters (Y<sub>max</sub>(out)=1.01 ± 0.06) but incomplete inside these clusters (Y<sub>max</sub>(in)=0.74 ± 0.07, p=0.008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Higher immobile fraction indicates that a fraction of molecules was immobilized at the bleached spot due to the fact that they were trapped in rigid domains. These data suggest that lateral mobility of the lipids within S1R clusters is reduced, consistent with known properties of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sezgin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We next evaluated the effects of S1R ligands on S1R clustering.

The effects of (+)-SKF-10047 on S1R clustering were concentration-dependent, with half-maximal effect observed at 50 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The effects of (+)-SKF-10047 were blocked by the addition of a S1R antagonist NE-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Consistently, agonists resulted in reduced cluster size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These results suggested that S1R agonists prevented formation of S1R clusters or promoted disassembly of S1R clusters in the membrane and that these effects could be blocked by S1R antagonists. Our results are consistent with previous biochemical studies that demonstrated that the proportion of S1R multimers formed in cells was decreased by the agonists (+)-pentazocine and PRE-084 but increased by the antagonists CM304, haloperidol, and NE-100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hong, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hong et al., 2017b</xref>). These results are also consistent with effects of (+)-pentazocine and haloperidol described in FRET experiments performed with cells transfected with fluorescently tagged S1Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mishra et al., 2015</xref>). Similar conclusions were made when using receptor bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) homomer assay and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yano et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, it has been reported that S1R agonists such as (+)-pentazocine and PRE-084 stabilized the oligomeric state of purified S1R in the presence of detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gromek et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that biochemical properties of S1R in the membrane and in detergent may differ from each other. Another potential reason for this discrepancy is that the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gromek et al., 2014</xref>) was focused on the analysis of smaller tetrameric species, while our analysis measured larger assemblies of at least ten S1R molecules. Taken together, our results indicate that S1R participates in the formation of thicker cholesterol-rich lipid clusters and S1R agonists act by disassembling these membrane microdomains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>S1R modulates many physiological processes, such as cell excitability, transcriptional activity, Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, stress response, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christ et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayashi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kourrich, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maurice and Goguadze, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ryskamp et al., 2019</xref>). However, S1R-mediated signal transduction differs from a canonical second messenger-coupled transmembrane receptor signaling, and S1R is often referred to as a ‘ligand-gated molecular chaperone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayashi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Su et al., 2010</xref>). In the seminal paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hayashi and Su, 2007</xref>, S1R was proposed to have chaperone-like properties at MAMs. However, the molecular mechanism of chaperone activity of S1R remains unexplained because S1R lacks structural similarity with known chaperones or extensive protein interaction interfaces. Based on our results, we propose that the biological activity of S1R in cells can be explained by the ability of this protein to form cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the ER, therefore acting as ER lipid scaffolding protein. A role of S1R in organization and remodeling of lipid raft microdomains in the plasma membrane has been proposed previously based on cell biological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vollrath et al., 2014</xref>). Our data further suggest that such microdomains have increased local membrane thickness, providing a favorable environment for recruitment of ER proteins with longer transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lorent et al., 2017</xref>). Increased local cholesterol concentration and membrane thickness can modulate activity of ER proteins recruited to these microdomains. Our hypothesis may explain how a small protein such as S1R is able to modulate activity of almost a hundred effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delprat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kourrich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ryskamp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schmidt and Kruse, 2019</xref>). We reason that activity of these proteins could be affected by changes in local lipid microenvironment and not only via protein-protein interactions with the S1R.</p><p>By performing experiments using reduced reconstitution systems, we have been able to demonstrate direct effects of cholesterol on S1R clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Previous studies identified two potential sites of S1R association with cholesterol – Y173 and Y201/Y206 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>). Our studies suggest that Y201 and Y206 residues are dispensable for cholesterol-mediated S1R clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, we identified a tandem CARC-like motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fantini and Barrantes, 2013</xref>) within the transmembrane region of S1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Mutations of this motif impaired association of recombinant S1R with cholesterol beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), affected cholesterol-dependent S1R clustering in GUV reconstitution experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and disrupted S1R targeting to MAMs and ER-PM contact sites in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The threshold for formation of S1R clusters was in a narrow range between 2.5 and 5.0 mol% of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Similar cholesterol dependence was previously described for SREBP-2 activation, with half-maximal response at 4.5 mol % of ER cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that S1R affinity for cholesterol is within the physiological range of ER cholesterol concentrations.</p><p>A recent study demonstrated that micrometer-sized large intracellular vesicles exhibit phase-separation behavior at contact sites between the ER and mitochondria, plasma membrane and lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">King et al., 2020</xref>), similar to phase separation observed in giant plasma membrane-derived vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levental et al., 2011</xref>).

This conclusion is consistent with MAM defects observed in S1R KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>), with earlier analysis of S1R targeting to detergent-resistant domains in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayashi and Fujimoto, 2010</xref>), and with previous suggestions that S1R contributes to stability of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vollrath et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The lipid regulation of PM proteins is a well-known phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rosenhouse-Dantsker et al., 2012</xref>). It was shown in direct and indirect experiments that activities of several ER channels including ryanodine receptors, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors can be modulated by cholesterol content, lipid packing, or membrane thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cannon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gustavsson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Madden et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sano et al., 2009</xref>).

Originally, a photoaffinity probe labeled high-molecular weight oligomers in rat liver microsomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pal et al., 2007</xref>).

The functional relevance of the S1R oligomerization is, however, not clear. In our experiments, we observed that S1R oligomers form continuous molecular weight distribution ranging from trimers to large (10–100 subunits) clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Formation of large clusters was facilitated by the presence of cholesterol. S1R agonists disrupted large S1R clusters in cholesterol-containing lipid bilayers in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G</xref>).

In contrast, MAM downregulation was observed in motor neurons in a genetic model of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Watanabe et al., 2016</xref>). Our results suggest that S1R agonists allow remodeling of lipid microdomains in the ER membrane, which may help to normalize MAM function in AD and ALS neurons. Long-term effects of S1R activation may include a more thorough remodeling of MAMs including size and protein composition needed for long-lasting metabolic adjustments in stress conditions. Changes in ER lipid microenvironment may also affect function of a variety of channels, transporters, and other signaling proteins localized to S1R signaling microdomains. The exact functional outcome of these lipid perturbations will be unique to each particular protein based on its activity in a lipid environment established by S1R.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose that many biological functions of S1R can be explained by its ability to organize and remodel cholesterol-enriched ER microdomains, which in turn affects activity of ER signaling proteins, stress-response, and metabolic status of the cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Key resources table is included in supplementary materials.</p><p>Raw data and tables used for generation of the figures are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9zw3r22dn">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.9zw3r22dn</ext-link>.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Acquisition parameters (such as laser power and gain) were kept constant for different samples. First, background subtraction was performed, and threshold was adjusted manually for S1R-GFP and mCherry-Sec61β channels. Thresholding was performed such as all the ER was segmented in the mCherry-Sec61β channel and S1R microdomains were clearly resolved in the S1R-GFP channel (typically, at 1.5× mean intensity level). For calculating mCherry-Sec61β:TOM20 and S1R-GFP:TOM20 colocalization in expanded samples, Colocalization Highlighter plugin was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins, 2007</xref>). Threshold levels were selected as mean signal intensities for mCherry-Sec61β and TOM20 channels, and manually adjusted for S1R-GFP channel to clearly segment microdomains (typically, at 1.5× mean intensity level). The area of colocalizaiong between two channels was normalized to the total area occupied by mCherry-Sec61β or S1R-GFP at the same threshold level. For MAPPER colocalization studies, mCherry-MAPPER channel was used for thresholding and identification of ER-PM junctions and used as mask for calculating integral intensity of S1R-GFP in these areas. Threshold level was adjusted until MAPPER puncta were clearly separated from the background. The mask was saved and used for calculation total S1R-GFP intensity in the masked areas for each cell. These value was normalized to the total fluorescent intensity of the cell to calculate the fraction of S1R residing in MAPPER-positive puncta.</p><p>For DSLB quantification, fluorescent intensities of individual LAT-647 and S1R molecules were manually measured after background subtraction in ImageJ. Similarly, the mean intensity of mono-cysteine-labeled LAT-647 molecules was measured in a separate experiment using the same laser power and gain settings. Intensities of small (putative trimers) S1R oligomers were divided by the calculated mean intensity of the pLAT-647 molecule to convert them to a number of molecules per cluster. For quantification of the domain formation in DSLBs, fluid bilayer areas were examined. Bilayer defects or unwashed liposomes were omitted from the analysis. To calculate the fraction of protein residing in clusters, we used an in-house MATLAB script. For each field of view, thresholding was applied to identify spots above the background. The threshold level was typically set at the intensity level of five mono-cysteine-labeled LAT-647 molecules. Then, individual intensities of each spot were calculated, local background signal was subtracted, and them summed together to give the value of total protein clustered in each field of view. Integral intensity of S1R clusters in each field of view was divided by the total protein intensity in the same field of view. Individual intensities of protein clusters were converted to the number of fluorescent molecules by dividing each value by the mean intensity of LAT-647 as described for the smaller oligomers above. For future analysis, we considered clusters as protein assemblies with more than 10 molecules of S1R. Size distribution data was considered lognormal based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For molecular weight distributions, calculated cluster sizes from at least ten fields of view were pooled together and used for calculation of the frequency histogram (bin width = 2) using GraphPad Prism 8. Frequency distribution was interpolated assuming lognormal fit of the data. For cluster size calculations, median cluster size was calculated for each experimental condition.</p><p>For western blot analysis, data were densitometrically analyzed using ImageJ software by normalizing the density of each band to IRE1α (for p-IRE1α quantification) or tubulin (for XBP1s quantification) of the same sample after background subtraction.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Wayne D Bowen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a detailed investigation of the sigma-1 receptor, with an emphasis on the effects of membrane cholesterol content. The authors report that sigma-1 receptor clusters in cholesterol-rich microdomains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), contributing to its previously-described localization at mitochondria-associated ER membranes. A series of reconstitution experiments show cholesterol-dependent clustering of the sigma-1 receptor, an effect which is modulated by membrane thickness and drug-like ligands of the receptor. These findings are supplemented by an investigation of the effects of sigma-1 receptor on IRE1a signaling, leading to the finding that sigma-1 knockout attenuates IRE1a function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the manuscript was likely to be of broad interest and addresses important biological questions surrounding the poorly understood sigma-1 receptor. However, concerns were raised regarding a number of points that need to be addressed in order for the manuscript to be suitable for publication. Specifically:</p><p>Most of the imaging experiments throughout the manuscript are interpreted only qualitatively, and many of these show relatively minor differences. Objective quantitative analysis should be provided wherever possible. Any subjective assessments should be conducted using blinding to avoid introduction of bias.</p><p>The connection between the biological effects on IRE1a activation and cholesterol-dependent clustering is relatively indirect. The reviewers agree that additional experimental data should be provided to further assess the validity of the authors' proposed model. For example, inclusion of rescue experiments in sigma-1 knockout cells using the cholesterol-binding mutants would help to strengthen the connection between IRE1a function and membrane cholesterol content. Similarly, disruption of cholesterol-rich domains by addition of beta-cyclodextrin could provide additional evidence to support the model. In addition, testing the effects of ligands in the cellular imaging experiments would strengthen the link between in vitro biophysical experiments and cellular physiology.</p><p>A related issue is that cholesterol binding is not tested explicitly for certain sigma-1 receptor mutants, potentially confounding interpretation of experimental data. These include experiments where alterations were made to the S1R sequence, with results interpreted in light of S1R no longer being able to bind cholesterol. Two specific places where this issue arises are:</p><p>1. Studies described on pages 6-7 and shown in Figure 3B where wild-type sigma-1 receptor is compared to S1R-Y201S/Y206S, S1R-Y173S, S1R-4G, and S1R-W9L/W11L. These mutations had differential effects on receptor distribution that were attributed to alterations in cholesterol binding without confirming the changes in cholesterol binding. This is particularly relevant for the explanation given for why S1R-W9L/W11L fails to cluster in both cells and the cholesterol supplemented GUV system, while the S1R-4G mutant exhibited cholesterol-induced clustering in the GUV system but not in cells (page 7, lines 27-31).</p><p>2. Another example is the membrane thickness experiment described at the top of page 8 and shown in Figure 4A. Shortening the S1R by deletion of 4 aa in the TM region produced a sigma-1 receptor that exhibited a more diffuse distribution when expressed in HEK293 cells. The authors appear to be attributing this only to the decreased length of the sigma-1 receptor transmembrane domain. However, it seems feasible (based on their other data) that if this construct fails to bind cholesterol, the same result would be observed. Confirming that the truncated sigma-1 receptor does in fact bind cholesterol would strengthen the argument being made here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65192.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the manuscript was likely to be of broad interest and addresses important biological questions surrounding the poorly understood sigma-1 receptor.

However, S1R expression levels in these experiments were much lower when compared to endogenous levels (evaluated by Western blot, data not shown). Increase in viral titer or addition of polybrene did not considerably improve expression levels of S1R. As a control, we have confirmed efficient transduction with these viruses in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures, indicating that problems with expression are related to the HEK293 cell lines. Because of inability to achieve high levels of S1R expression, we have not been able to perform IRE1a rescue experiments. Impaired IRE1a signaling in S1R KD cells has already been shown previously (Mori et al., PLoS One, 2013). In the absence of S1R rescue experiments, we decided to move the original Figure 6 to supplementary (now Figure 5S2) and focus on biophysical results with IRE1a transmembrane domain which are now included in combined Figure 5 as panels 5G and Figure 5H.</p><p>A related issue is that cholesterol binding is not tested explicitly for certain sigma-1 receptor mutants, potentially confounding interpretation of experimental data.

This is particularly relevant for the explanation given for why S1R-W9L/W11L fails to cluster in both cells and the cholesterol supplemented GUV system, while the S1R-4G mutant exhibited cholesterol-induced clustering in the GUV system but not in cells (page 7, lines 27-31).</p><p>To address this question, we performed series of pulldown experiments with cholesteryl-agarose. Recombinant S1R-6*His (WT or mutants) was mixed with cholesterol-coupled resin, washed and analyzed using Western blot analysis. First, we confirmed that recombinant S1R-6*His binds to cholesteryl-agarose, but not to control resin (Figure 4S1). Then we tested binding of S1R-4G-6*His and S1R-W9L/W11L-6*His and concluded that both have reduced affinity for cholesterol (Figure 4C and Figure 4D). To confirm these findings, we expressed exogenous S1R-6*His in HEK293T cells and used cell lysates in similar pulldown experiments. Cells were lysed and lysates were incubated with cholesteryl-agarose. We found that in this assay S1R-W9L/W11L-6*His binds weaker to cholesteryl-agarose compared to wild type protein (Figure 4E and Figure 4F). Binding of S1R-4G-6*His was compatible to the wild type (Figure 4F and Fig4E). Taken together, we concluded that affinity for cholesterol was reduced for both studied mutants, but these effects were more pronounced for S1R-W9L/W11L than for 4G mutant.</p><p>2. Another example is the membrane thickness experiment described at the top of page 8 and shown in Figure 4A. Shortening the S1R by deletion of 4 aa in the TM region produced a sigma-1 receptor that exhibited a more diffuse distribution when expressed in HEK293 cells. The authors appear to be attributing this only to the decreased length of the sigma-1 receptor transmembrane domain. However, it seems feasible (based on their other data) that if this construct fails to bind cholesterol, the same result would be observed. Confirming that the truncated sigma-1 receptor does in fact bind cholesterol would strengthen the argument being made here.</p><p>It is possible that delta 4 affects cholesterol binding, but the main rational for importance of membrane thickness comes from S1R/MBP-TM27 co-reconstitution experiments, not from S1R-∆4 mutant. The text related to Figure 4 was edited accordingly.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
