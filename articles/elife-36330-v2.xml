This is effected through a collection of sensing and signaling pathways that integrate information about the local environment and induce the requisite changes in various cellular programs that control organelle abundance and function, through multiple routes, including the modulation of transcription. In recent years, several transcriptional ‘master regulators’ of organellar biogenesis have been reported for mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jornayvaz and Shulman, 2010</xref>), autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chauhan et al., 2013</xref>) and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>). While the functional details of this control are still under investigation, coordinated transcriptional control of specific organelles is an emerging theme in cell biology.</p><p>Lipid droplets are the primary storage organelle for neutral lipids in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, the number and nature of these organelles vary greatly, both over time within a cell, and between cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiam and Beller, 2017</xref>). While a major function of lipid droplets is clearly as the storehouse of triglycerides and sterol esters, the diversity and variation of this organelle likely reflect the number of reported alternate functions of lipid droplets such as regulation of inflammation, general metabolism, and host-pathogen interplay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barisch and Soldati, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Melo and Weller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Konige et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the recognized importance of this organelle in health and disease, little is known of the signaling systems or proximal transcriptional regulators that control lipid droplet biogenesis, function and turnover in cells.</p><p>Recently, we used genome-wide, high-content siRNA screens to identify genes that affect cellular lipids. This analysis revealed that the Wnt ligand can potently stimulate lipid droplet accumulation in multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). In this paper, we report that the biogenesis of lipid droplets induced by Wnt signaling does not depend on the canonical TCF/LEF transcription factors. Our data show that the pro-lipid droplet signal induced by Wnt3a is mediated by members of the TFAP2 family of transcription factors. We thus conclude that TFAP2 may function as a ‘master’ regulator of lipid droplet biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Wnt-induced lipid droplet formation could be conveniently visualized using BODIPY, which accumulated in lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>), and quantified by automated microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and all subsequent figures). Similarly, accumulation of lipid droplets in Wnt-treated cells could also be revealed in cells expressing the lipid droplet protein PLIN1a tagged with the GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>; quantification in D and G, respectively) or by direct determination of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). In our previous work, we had observed that Wnt stimulates lipid droplet accumulation through upstream elements of the Wnt signalling pathway, including the canonical surface receptors and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a component of the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). This role of Wnt is well in-line with the established functions of Wnt signaling in the control of cellular metabolism, including carbohydrate, protein and lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prestwich and Macdougald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sethi and Vidal-Puig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackers and Malgor, 2018</xref>). Therefore, to further characterize the signaling cascade leading to the accumulation of lipid droplets after Wnt addition, we tested the key components from the canonical Wnt signalling pathway for a role in lipid droplet regulation, starting with the core enzyme of the destruction complex, GSK3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). We found that overexpression of both the wild-type, and the constitutively active S9A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stambolic and Woodgett, 1994</xref>) mutant of GSK3B were capable of attenuating lipid droplet accumulation in response to Wnt3a-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), consistent with the function of GSK3B activity as a negative regulator of Wnt signalling. Further, siRNAs to GSK3B were sufficient to induce lipid droplet accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>) — much like we had shown after gene silencing of APC, another member of the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36330.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Wnt pathway and the regulation of lipid droplets.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) HeLa-MZ cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or a S9A mutant of GSK3B 24 hr before the addition of Wnt-3a- or control-conditioned media (CM) for a further 24 hr.

Surprisingly, siRNAs to TCF/LEF transcription factors relevant in canonical Wnt signaling, failed to affect lipid droplet accumulation - and yet there is no doubt that lipid droplet accumulation in response to Wnt3a is transcriptionally mediated. Indeed, the expression of SOAT1 and DGAT2, which encode key-enzymes of lipid droplet formation, increased in response to Wnt3a-treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, silencing these genes inhibited lipid droplet accumulation in response to Wnt3a, most potently in combination with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; silencing efficiency <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), or with specific inhibitors to DGAT1 or SOAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, Wnt3a-induced lipid droplets were decreased after treatment with the general inhibitor of transcription Actinomycin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). While these data altogether confirmed that the Wnt pathway was mediating the pro-lipid droplet signal, our inability to link lipid droplet induction to TCF/LEF led us to consider the possibility that a branching signaling path, under the control of GSK3B and/or ß-catenin but not the canonical Wnt transcription factors TCF/LEF, was inducing the accumulation of lipid droplets in cells. To explore this possibility, we initiated several parallel and complementary systems-level analyses with the aim to identify the transcriptional regulators proximal to lipid droplet biogenesis.</p><p>To better understand the nature of the pro-lipid droplet signal induced by Wnt, we revaluated the involvement of individual components of the Wnt signaling pathway in the induction of lipid droplet accumulation. First, we tested the ability of each of the 19 human Wnt ligands to induce lipid droplet accumulation in L Cells by transfection and autocrine or paracrine induction of the Wnt pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Wnt ligands displayed a broad, but not universal capacity to induce lipid droplet accumulation that paralleled both their evolutionary pedigree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and previously reported abilities to activate canonical Wnt signaling as measured by a TCF/LEF reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Najdi et al., 2012</xref>). This confirmed that the pro-lipid droplet signal was indeed transiting, at least initially, through canonical Wnt signaling components.</p><p>To systematically assess the involvement of the remaining components of the Wnt pathway for involvement in the lipid droplet response, we performed a targeted screen for factors influencing lipid droplet accumulation using a library of 73 compounds selected for known interactions with elements of the Wnt pathway (see Materials and methods). We tested the library in both, Wnt3a-stimulated conditions to assess any inhibitory activity of lipid droplet accumulation, and unstimulated conditions to identify compounds with the ability to induce the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Indeed, treatment with several compounds reported to activate the Wnt-pathway-induced lipid droplet accumulation, such as BML-284 (activator of ß-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2005</xref>]), doxorubicin (activator of Wnt signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2009</xref>]), and forskolin (activation via PKA-Wnt crosstalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>). Conversely, known inhibitors of the pathway such as Tricostatin A (epigenetic regulator of DKK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vibhakar et al., 2007</xref>]) hexachlorophene (ß-catenin inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2006</xref>]), and niclosamide (inducer of LRP6 degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2011</xref>]) significantly decreased the appearance of lipid droplets in response to Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>).</p><p>While these data certainly confirm the role of Wnts in regulating lipid droplets, they did not reveal the pathway linking the Wnt destruction complex to the transcriptional changes we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>]). Given these results, and the large number of ß-catenin-independent targets of the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2009</xref>), we initiated several strategies to identify candidate regulators, in particular the proximal transcription factors directly upstream from lipid droplet biogenesis. Our aim was to identify factors linked to Wnt signalling and to characterize the signalling pathway from ligand-stimulation to lipid droplet accumulation.</p><p>We first started by taking the subset of genes annotated as ‘transcription factor activity’ (GO:0000988) from our primary genome-wide siRNA screen data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>) to identify transcription factors that influenced cellular cholesterol levels in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). While several of these candidates have well-established roles in regulating general proliferation (i.e. MACC1, JDP2, SP3, TP53, ZNF217, TAF1), or links to the WNT pathway in keeping with our findings (i.e. GLI3, SIX2, SOX9, FOXK2, BARX1), we were particularly interested in identifying candidates with reported functions in lipid metabolism. The latter subset included ARNT2, STAT3, KDM3A, ATF5, KLF5, KLF6 and members of the TFAP2 (AP-2) transcription factor family (see below).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36330.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>mRNA profiling and analysis of gene expression of cells treated with Wnt3a.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) HeLa-MZ cells were treated with control- or Wnt3a-conditioned media for 2 hr or 6 hr before RNA isolation and RNAseq analysis.

It is well-established that the formation of lipid droplets is stimulated artificially by the addition of exogenous fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin and Parton, 2006</xref>), and the process has been studied at the transcriptional level in multiple studies. We therefore combined our Wnt3a gene array data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>) with three published datasets of mRNA levels after treatment of cells with fatty acids or knockout of lipid droplet regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lockridge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaw et al., 2013</xref>). Our rationale was to identify the relevant transcription factors required for the induction of lipid droplet biogenesis by inferring from the expression data what is the common set of transcription factors active in response to Wnt3a and/or to the modulation of lipid droplets by fatty acid treatment or gene knockout. This analysis involved testing for over-representation of genes annotated to be regulated by a specific transcription factor in the set of the most perturbed genes after either treatment. Wnt3a-stimulation influenced a larger number of transcriptional regulators (172) as compared to lipid droplet modulation (91), but the vast majority of this subset (&gt;75%) were also changed by Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). With this approach, we found that many candidate transcription factors known to function in both lipid metabolism and adipogenesis were influenced by Wnt3a-treament and fatty acid perturbation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>), including TFAP2A (p-value Wnt3a treatment: 3.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup>; p-value fatty acid perturbation: 4.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup>).</p><p>As a third systems-level approach, we undertook a direct examination of the promoter regions of annotated lipid droplet proteins as was used by Sardiello and colleagues to identify the transcription factor TFEB and the CLEAR element as master regulators of lysosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sardiello et al., 2009</xref>). We collected and examined the upstream promoter sequences for the 145 proteins annotated as ‘Lipid Droplet’ (GO:0005811; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>) and tested for over-represented sequence motifs. Among the most enriched motifs in the upstream promoter region of lipid droplet genes were motifs identified as TFAP2A (pValue: 9.0 × 10<sup>−3</sup>) and TFAP2C (pValue: 1.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Further analysis revealed that 74 of the ‘Lipid Droplet’ proteins contained at least one of the TFAP2A or TFAP2C annotated binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>), which were generally present within the first few hundred base-pairs from the start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The TFAP2 (AP-2) family of basic helix-span-helix transcription factors have been long recognized to play key roles during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckert et al., 2005</xref>). Yet, little else is known regarding their function in adult animals where these proteins are expressed, although various TFAP2 homologs have been linked to tumour progression in cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li and Dashwood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2009</xref>). The family consists of five proteins in human and mouse, and are thought to form homo- and heterodimers that bind to similar promoter sequences albeit with different affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckert et al., 2005</xref>). Given our observation that downstream genes known to be regulated by TFAP2 family members change in response to Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), that the silencing of TFAP2 genes can regulate cholesterol amounts in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and that TFAP2 consensus sites are over-enriched in the promoter sequences of genes encoding for lipid droplet proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), we began to suspect that TFAP2 proteins mediate the pro-lipid droplet signal induced by Wnt3a. This notion was further buttressed by previous studies showing that TFAP2A directly interacts with both ß-catenin and APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>) making this family of transcription factors our leading candidate for mediating the pro-lipid droplet signalling activity of Wnt3a.</p><p>To gain a detailed description of the transcriptional changes in the context of TFAP2, Wnt and lipid droplets, we performed an RNAseq determination of mRNA levels in cells treated with Wnt3a for short times (2 hr and 6 hr) with the aim to identify early factors of the transcriptional control relevant for lipid droplet biogenesis. As expected, a pathway analysis of the most responsive genes at 2 hr found over-representation of terms related to mRNA processing, DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with the expected nature of the early Wnt3a-responsive genes. By 6 hr post-Wnt3a treatment, transcriptional regulators were still over-represented, but additional terms reflecting downstream effector pathways were present, including those related to glucose metabolism and endosomal trafficking, as well as fatty acid and cholesterol related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, the RNAseq analysis found that SREBF1 (Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Transcription Factor 1) mRNA levels were the most decreased of any transcription factor (0.60 of control) at the later time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, the most upregulated transcription factor at early times was DDIT3 (DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 3, also known as CHOP) — and increased DDIT3 could readily be detected at the mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A—B</xref>). This member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding (CEBP) protein family is a potent and direct inhibitor of SREBF1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chikka et al., 2013</xref>) and a known regulator of cellular lipid metabolism. While this interaction may contribute to the decrease in cellular free cholesterol and the downregulation of cholesterol metabolic enzymes after Wnt3a treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>]), overexpression of constitutively active SREBF1 truncations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shimano et al., 1997</xref>) had essentially no effect on the formation of lipid droplets, whether Wnt3a was present or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>) despite activating known target genes involved in cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Neither did treatment with the S1P/SREBF1 inhibitor PF-429242 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hawkins et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>) in either Wnt3a-stimulated, or naive conditions. These observations suggest that while relevant to the observed changes in cellular cholesterol homeostasis generated by Wnt3a, putative DDIT3-induced changes in SREBF1 expression have no significant role in lipid droplet accumulation in response to Wnt3a.</p><p>Along with DDIT3 and SREBF1, our list of early Wnt3a-responsive transcription factors includes several that have known functions in regulating cellular lipid homeostasis such as CEBPB and CEBPE, KLF5, KLF10, PPARG, MLXIPL, and PER2. Our list also included the TFAP2 family member TFAP2C, which our datamining strategies had already identified as involved in lipid homeostasis, and as a candidate transcription factor controlling lipid droplet biogenesis. In fact, 6 hr post-Wnt3a stimulation TFAP2C (1.72-fold) was among the most upregulated transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Given that our datamining efforts identified TFAP2 family members as putative transcription factors regulating lipid droplet proteins and that TFAP2C was among the most upregulated transcription factors in response to Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we next investigated whether TFAP2 family members played a direct role in regulating lipid droplets. To this end, we tested the ability of TFAP2A to directly bind to the promoter region of known lipid droplet, and lipid metabolic genes containing a predicted TFAP2 consensus site by ChIP-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), including the enzymes ACSL3, ACSL4, AGPAT2, AGPAT3, LPCAT2, and MGLL, and the lipid droplet resident proteins PLIN3, PLIN4, PNPLA2, and PNPLA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barneda and Christian, 2017</xref>). Indeed, we found that the TFAP2A protein was able to bind the upstream promoter of all the genes we tested, supporting the notion that expression was controlled by TFAP2 family members. Next, we tested whether Wnt3a retained the ability to induce lipid droplets after TFAP2 depletion by RNAi. While knock-down of either TFAP2A or TFAP2C had no or only a modest effect, tandem silencing of both homologs produced a marked reduction in the number of lipid droplets present in cells in response to Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>; knock-down efficiency <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and markedly decreased the amounts of cholesteryl esters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In keeping with these findings, these siRNA treatments diminished the mRNA levels of SOAT1, a key enzyme proximal to the production of lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) that mediate the production of cholesteryl esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2001</xref>). These observations indicate that TFAP2 family members exhibit complementary functions.</p><p>As an alternative approach, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout to generate HeLa-MZ cells clones lacking TFAP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). While tandem depletion by RNAi was necessary to reduce lipid droplet production after Wnt3a addition in L Cells, two knockout clones of TFAP2A demonstrated a complete lack of change in lipid droplet number after Wnt3a stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>; and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>) and failed to accumulate triglycerides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The ability of Wnt to induce LD formation could be rescued upon TFAP2A re-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), demonstrating that the inhibition observed in knock-out cells was not caused by some off-target or indirect effect of the treatment. Together, these results imply that TFAP2A/TFAP2C are necessary for mediating the pro-lipid droplet signal of the Wnt pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36330.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The TFAP2 family of transcription factors are both necessary and sufficient to mediated lipid droplet accumulation.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) L Cells were treated with siRNAs against the indicated targets for 48 hr before the addition of Wnt3a-conditioned medium for an additional 24 hr.

Intriguingly, not only did we find such a site upstream of the TFAP2C gene, but there was a DDIT3::CEBPA consensus site in 7 out of the 10 lipid-related transcription factors identified in our RNAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a 1.8-fold enrichment over the frequency in the total Wnt3a-influenced transcription factor set. This lends further support for the view of DDIT3 as an important transcriptional regulator of lipid homeostasis in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chikka et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To address this notion directly, we next tested whether DDIT3 itself was able to influence both TFAP2 family members, and the number of lipid droplets in cells. Indeed, overexpression of DDIT3-mCherry chimera increased mRNA levels of lipid droplet enzymes, without much of an effect on lipid droplet coat proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; relative overexpression <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>), with a concomitant increase in cholesteryl esters and triglycerides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further, silencing of DDIT3 influenced the mRNA levels of many lipid metabolic genes including decreasing the levels of SOAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; knock-down efficiency <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), as well as reducing cholesteryl ester accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and lipid droplet accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) in response to Wnt3a. These observations suggest that DDIT3 plays a regulatory role in lipid droplet biogenesis, presumably in concert with TFAP2.</p><p>We next tested the requirement of DDIT3 for the lipid droplet response directly by interfering with DDIT3 expression by both RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9. Silencing of DDIT3 expression diminished accumulation of lipid droplets both in response to Wnt3a stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), and after silencing of APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), an alternative strategy previously shown to be sufficient to induce lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). Wnt3a-induced increase in triglycerides was also ablated in these CRISPR clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further, knock-out clones lacking DDIT3 were completely non-responsive to Wnt3a with regards to lipid droplet number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Much like with TFAP2A, DDIT3 re-expression in knock-out cells rescued Wnt-induced LD formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), demonstrating that the inhibition observed in KO cells was not due to some off-target effects. In the context of the significant increase in DDIT3 message and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), these results suggest that induction of DDIT3 transcription in response to Wnt3a is necessary for lipid droplet biogenesis.</p><p>Given that the presence of DDIT3 was necessary to convey the pro-lipid droplet signal, we next tested whether over-expression of the transcription factor is sufficient to induce lipid droplet accumulation. As with TFAP2, overexpression of mCherry-tagged fusions of DDIT3 was sufficient to increase lipid droplet numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>) as well as cholesterolyl esters and triglyceride levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) in transfected cells as compared to the control. In total, these data suggest that in addition to regulation of cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chikka et al., 2013</xref>), DDIT3 may function as a more global regulator of cellular lipid homeostasis in part through regulation of the TFAP2 family of transcription factors. In an attempt to clarify the relationship between DDIT2 and TFAP2A, we tested whether TFAP2A overexpression restored Wnt-dependent LD formation in DDIT3 knock-out cells and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). While TFAP2A did not rescue DDIT3 knock-out cells, DDIT3 expression was able to restore LD formation in TFAP2A knock-out cells. Although future work will be required to determine the precise functions of DDIT3, it is tempting to speculate that TFAP2A drives DDIT3 expression (or that DDIT3 responds lipid droplet accumulation). DDIT3 therefore, in addition to a direct inducer of lipid storage, might act as TFAP2A repressor — in line with the known repressor function of DDIT3 in SREBP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chikka et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In conclusion, our data show TFAP2 family members function to modulate expression of lipid droplet proteins and induce the accumulation of lipid droplets in cells. We found TFAP2 is necessary to potentiate the pro-lipid droplet signal induced by Wnt3a, and expression of TFAP2 family members is sufficient to induce lipid droplet accumulation in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Not only do these data support the view that the TFAP2 family of transcription factors can function as regulators of lipid droplet biogenesis, they provide insight into the transcriptional network directing changes in lipid homeostasis and the accumulation of lipid droplets in response to Wnt stimulation. Our data also provides further decoding of the known relationships between Wnt signaling and the control of cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prestwich and Macdougald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sethi and Vidal-Puig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackers and Malgor, 2018</xref>). Finally, our observations indicate that, in addition to the canonical TCF/LEF transcriptional response, Wnt signalling via APC, GSK3, and ß-Catenin induces transcription-mediated lipid changes. These include decreased levels of SREBF1, which is likely to contribute to the observed reduction in total membrane cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott et al., 2015</xref>), and increased expression of DDIT3 and TFAP2, which triggers lipid droplet biogenesis with storage of cholesterol esters and triglycerides. These observations also lead to the notion that via TFAP2 transcription factors, Wnt exerts pro-proliferative effects in developmental and in pathological contexts by leading to the accumulation of lipid droplets.</p><p>In addition, Wnt3a has been recently identified as an intra-cell synchronizer of circadian rhythms in the gut, controlling cell-cycle progression, and the mRNA of Wnt3a itself exhibits circadian oscillations under the control of the master clock regulators Bmal1 and Per (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsu-Ura et al., 2016</xref>). Given this function, it is tempting to speculate that Wnts serve a more general role as a mid- or long-range circadian signalling intermediates, linking lipid metabolism to the master transcriptional clocks that coordinate metabolic functions with the day-night cycle. Because of its circadian nature, and capacity to induce lipid droplet accumulation in a broad range of cells types, Wnts could serve as a fundamental signal for cells to store lipids during times when nutrients are expected to be in excess for later use during periods of rest or fasting.</p><p>Both lipid droplets enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Solt et al., 2012</xref>), and the volume of lipid droplets themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchiyama and Asari, 1984</xref>), vary in a circadian fashion, which is completely consistent with a role as neutral lipid storage sites. TFAP2-binding sites are over-represented in the promoters of circadian-controlled genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bozek et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the Wnt/TFAP2 control of lipid droplets is one mechanism by which the daily storage of lipids in lipid droplets, and cellular lipid homeostasis itself, is coordinated. Further, targeted overexpression of TFAP2C induced the equivalent phenotype of steatosis in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holl et al., 2011</xref>), underscoring the role of TFAP2 proteins in the regulation of neutral lipid metabolism.</p><p>The Wnt pathway is also not the first developmental signalling pathway found to exert key regulatory functions in directing energy metabolism. The FOXA family of transcription factors, fundamental for early embryogenesis, play core roles in directing glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedman and Kaestner, 2006</xref>), while SOX17 has been shown to have additional, non-developmental functions regulating lipid metabolism in the liver of adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rommelaere et al., 2014</xref>). Given the overlapping requirement for a molecular queue to synchronize energy storage during both embryo development and daily metabolic activity, it is not surprising that some of these systems have evolved to serve dual roles in both biological contexts. These findings support the view that both Wnt signaling, and the TFAP2 family of transcription factors have important (and possibly linked) roles in development and circadian lipid metabolism of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

We have addressed all queries and issues that were raised: you will find below our detailed reply to each comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Key experiments need measurement of (neutral) lipids. Currently only BODIPY images are shown. In addition, these images need to be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>In all light microscopy experiments in the manuscript, lipid droplets (LDs) stained with BODIPY have been quantified by automated microscopy using the ImageXpress Micro XLS microscope from Molecular Devices. We also wish to add that BODIPY does not stain other organelles — including endosomes/lysosomes in Niemann-Pick type C cells, which accumulate cholesterol in endosomes/lysosomes. In this revised version, as an alternative LD marker, we used the LD protein perilipin A (PLIN1a) tagged with the GFP, expressed in cells treated or not with Wnt. We show that the LD association of PLIN1a-GFP recapitulates the BODIPY data (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1). In addition, we have also quantified triglycerides (TAG) and cholesteryl esters in cells treated or not with Wnt, and we find that accumulation of these characteristic lipid droplet molecules in Wnt-treated cells confirms our findings with BODIPY and PLIN1a-GFP (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Data on transcription factor binding (ChIP-seq or at least CHIP-qPCR) need to test binding on the proposed sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editor for this helpful suggestion. As requested, we have carried out CHIP-qPCR experiments, and tested the ability of TFAP2A to directly bind to the promoter region of known lipid droplet, and lipid metabolic genes containing a predicted TFAP2 consensus site, including the enzymes ACSL3, ACSL4, AGPAT2, AGPAT3, LPCAT2, and MGLL, and the lipid droplet resident proteins PLIN3, PLIN4, PNPLA2, and PNPLA3. We now show that the TFAP2A protein has a broad capacity to bind the promoter region of all the genes we tested, supporting the notion that expression is controlled by TFAP2A (new Figure 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Further testing the function of TFAP2 in WNT mediated LD formation using knock out cells. This should ideally include some clarification on the role/order of TFAP2A and DDIT3/CHOP.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested we have further tested the role of TFAP2A and DDIT3 in the CRISPR/Cas9 KO cells. The ability of Wnt to induce LD formation could be rescued in both TFAP2A and DDIT3 KO cell lines, upon re-expression of TFAP2 and DDIT3, respectively, demonstrating that the inhibition in both cell lines was not due to some off-target or indirect effects of the treatments. In an attempt to order/clarify the role of these transcription factors, we also tested whether</p><p>TFAP2A overexpression restored Wnt-dependent LD formation in DDIT3 KO cells and vice versa. We find that TFAP2A did not rescue DDIT3 KO, while DDIT3 was able to rescue TFAP2A KO. Based on the known repressor role of DDIT3 in SREBP expression, it is attractive to speculate that DDIT3 expression responds to the presence of lipid droplets. DDIT3 therefore, in addition to a direct inducer of lipid storage, might act as TFAP2A repressor repressor — in line with the known repressor function of DDIT3 in SREBP expression. This issue is now clarified in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
