result in rapid changes in the gene content of bacteria. While HGT aids bacteria to adapt to new environments, it also carries risks such as selfish genetic elements (SGEs). Here, we use modelling to study how HGT of slightly beneficial genes impacts growth rates of bacterial populations, and if bacterial collectives can evolve to take up DNA despite selfish elements. We find four classes of slightly beneficial genes: indispensable, enrichable, rescuable, and unrescuable genes. Rescuable genes — genes with small fitness benefits that are lost from the population without HGT — can be collectively retained by a community that engages in costly HGT. While this ‘gene-sharing’ cannot evolve in well-mixed cultures, it does evolve in a spatial population like a biofilm. Despite enabling infection by harmful SGEs, the uptake of foreign DNA is evolutionarily maintained by the hosts, explaining the coexistence of bacteria and SGEs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most animals, including humans, inherit genes from their parents. However, bacteria and other microorganisms can also acquire genes from members of the same generation. This process, called horizontal gene transfer (HGT for short), allows bacteria to quickly adapt to new environments. For example, rather than waiting for rare mutations to arise, bacteria can pick up ‘tried and true’ genes from their neighbours which allow them to exploit new resources or become resistant to antibiotics.</p><p>But gene sharing comes at a cost. For instance, taking up DNA is an energetically costly process and exposes bacteria to so-called selfish genes which replicate at the expense of other more useful genes in the genome. Given the costs and the threat of selfish genes, it remained unclear whether HGT is still beneficial in a stable environment where no new resources or antibiotics are present.</p><p>Here, van Dijk et al. used mathematical modelling to examine how gene sharing affects the growth rate of bacterial colonies living in a stable environment. The experiments showed that bacteria are able to take up new sequences of DNA even in the presence of selfish genes. This allows communities of bacteria to retain genes that provide a small benefit that would otherwise be lost from the population, even when taking up DNA imposes a cost upon the individual. van Dijk et al. found that this collective behaviour cannot evolve in well-mixed bacterial populations, but readily emerged in more structured populations, such as biofilms.</p><p>This work demonstrates how HGT, a key component of bacterial evolution, has allowed bacteria to coexist with harmful selfish genes. It also provides insights into how genes persist and spread through bacterial communities, which has implications for our understanding of antibiotic resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mathematical analysis</kwd><kwd>in silico evolution</kwd><kwd>digital evolution</kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>microbial communities</kwd><kwd>collective behaviour</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ICT-610427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Dijk</surname><given-names>Bram van</given-names></name><name><surname>Hogeweg</surname><given-names>Paulien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGY0072/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doekes</surname><given-names>Hilje M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) helps slightly beneficial genes persist in microbial populations, incentivising cells to invest in costly DNA uptake, even in the presence of harmful selfish genetic elements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), the transmission of genetic material between unrelated individuals, is a major factor driving prokaryotic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ochman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doolittle and Zhaxybayeva, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vogan and Higgs, 2011</xref>). Recent estimates of the rate of HGT in closely related bacteria are staggeringly high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iranzo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sakoparnig, 2019</xref>), with HGT possibly even outpacing gradual sequence evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hao and Golding, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puigbò et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vos et al., 2015</xref>). Combining this with the fact that prokaryotes adapt mostly through rapid gene loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo and Ochman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris et al., 2012</xref>), bacterial adaptation appears to be mainly driven by changes in gene content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Snel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Treangen and Rocha, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nowell et al., 2014</xref>). Rather than waiting for rare beneficial mutations to arise, taking up tried-and-true genes from a shared ‘mobile gene pool’ allows bacteria to adapt quickly to different ecological opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jain et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wiedenbeck and Cohan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casacuberta and González, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mell and Redfield, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niehus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopatkin et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, many bacterial species show patterns consistent with this rapid turn-over of genes, where strains from a single niche contain a relatively small set of genes, while the set of genes found by sampling strains from various niches (i.e. the pan-genome) is much richer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Welch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lefébure and Stanhope, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Touchon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, genes appear to be rapidly lost from any individual lineage, but are retained in a much larger gene pool through HGT.</p><p>When considering the effects of HGT on gene content, it is important to note that HGT can add novel genes to the genome. This might happen through plasmid transfer (i.e. conjugation), but also through recombination. For example, when bacteria take up DNA from their environment (i.e. transformation), genes inserted between two homologous regions may be integrated into the genome. The DNA that has been taken up may also carry mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which can integrate into the genome without a requirement for sequence similarity. Such processes have been coined ‘additive HGT’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thomas and Nielsen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soucy et al., 2015</xref>), which is distinct from ‘replacing HGT’ because of its ability to <italic>copy</italic> genes from one individual to another. On the one hand, DNA uptake may be beneficial for the cells, as it allows adaptations to new environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casacuberta and González, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mell and Redfield, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopatkin et al., 2016</xref>) or the recovery of lost genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vogan and Higgs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, DNA uptake also poses a risk in the form of Selfish Genetic Elements (SGEs) such as transposons, and may furthermore cause chromosome disruptions and cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baltrus, 2013</xref>). Finally, the translocation of DNA and the required state of competence generally comes at energetic and metabolic costs for the cell in terms of expressing and operating DNA uptake machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ephrussi-Taylor and Freed, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergé et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Villa et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, while picking up genes can be very beneficial for bacteria when adapting to a new environment, taking up foreign DNA is also a costly and highly risky endeavour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vogan and Higgs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baltrus, 2013</xref>). Given these disadvantages, is the uptake of DNA ever adaptive for bacteria when the environment does <italic>not</italic> change? Can HGT be considered an evolved trait of bacteria, or is it only a side-effect of other unrelated processes like infection by SGEs or DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Redfield, 2001</xref>)?</p><p>To address these questions, we here present and analyse a model of a bacterial population undergoing HGT of a single gene. We consider HGT through the uptake of genes from a shared pool of DNA, that is bacterial transformation. We assume that HGT is a costly process for the host cells, and that these costs are proportional to the rate of uptake. Such costs may reflect energetic costs for translocating DNA, growth impediments during the state of natural competence, or the various risks of incorporating foreign DNA into the genome. We show that this form of HGT has a positive impact on population growth rates by recovering slightly beneficial genes, which are hard to maintain in the population through selection alone. Based on whether or not the genes are lost from the population without HGT, and whether HGT can improve the population growth rate, we find that genes fall into one of five gene classes: (i) <italic>indispensable genes</italic>, that are never lost from the population, and for which HGT is therefore unnecessary and deleterious, (ii) <italic>enrichable genes</italic>, that are not lost from the population, but enriching the genes via HGT can nevertheless improve growth rates, (iii) <italic>rescuable genes</italic>, which are lost from the population without HGT, but can be rescued by HGT which improves population growth rates, (iv) <italic>unrescuable genes</italic> which are also lost from the population without HGT, but recovering them with HGT does not improve growth rates, and (v) <italic>selfish genetic elements</italic>, which confer a fitness penalty but can persist through HGT. For enrichable and rescuable genes, where HGT can increase population growth rates, we also investigate if HGT, that is the ability of cells to take up DNA, can evolve de novo. While the bacteria readily evolve to use HGT for enrichable genes, having sufficient donor cells to interact with, evolving HGT to ‘rescue’ rescuable genes faces a problem: HGT is needed for the gene to persist in the population, but sufficient donor cells are required to make HGT adaptive. This paradox is however resolved in a spatially structured population like a biofilm, as even a minority of donor cells can be locally abundant, giving rise to a localised ‘gene-sharing’ community that eventually overgrows the whole population. Finally, in this spatial eco-evolutionary context, HGT is evolutionarily maintained even when exploited by harmful genetic parasites, resulting in stable coexistence of bacteria and SGEs. Our model provides important insights and search images for how slightly beneficial genes may spread, or fail to spread, in an evolving microbial population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Throughout this study, we analyse how HGT affects the growth rates of bacterial populations, and to what extent bacteria can evolve to engage in HGT by evolving DNA uptake. We consider a ‘hard case’, where HGT is a continuously costly process for individual cells and is only beneficial under specific circumstances. Consider two cell types: cells that carry a beneficial gene (carriers, C), and cells that do not (non-carriers, N). The benefit of carrying the gene, <italic>b</italic>, makes carriers grow faster than non-carriers (or slower if <italic>b</italic> &lt; 0, e.g. the gene is a selfish element), but carriers lose the beneficial gene at a fixed rate <italic>l</italic>. Non-carriers can recover genes by interacting with carriers through HGT. We study these dynamics with different models, first using simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and later an individual-based model (IBM) that takes spatial population structuring into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The equations and full description of the models can be found in the Methods section.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Graphical overviews of the different models: This study uses a series of models with gradually increasing complexity.</title><p>The first two models (<bold>A+B</bold>) are composed of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), and the third model (<bold>C</bold>) is an individual-based model (IBM). The models describe a population of bacterial cells which either carry a beneficial gene (carriers, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝑪</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) or do not carry the genes (non-carriers, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝑵</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), both of which engage in costly HGT (e.g. take up DNA or enter a state of competence). The cells are competing for a limited resource, where the intrinsic growth is 1, <italic>b</italic> is the growth rate advantage (or disadvantage) for carrying the gene, <italic>l</italic> is the rate at which the gene is lost, <italic>h</italic> is the rate of HGT (<italic>i.e.</italic> uptake/competence), <italic>c</italic> is the cost of HGT, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝝋</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the growth rate of sub-populations/individual cells, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">ϕ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> represents the total growth rate. In the IBM, each cell has an individual rate of HGT (arbitrary values are shown in the cartoon), which we use to study the de novo evolution of HGT. The IBM also makes a distinction between the average growth rate of the population (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝒑</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝒐</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝒑</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) and the average growth rate of the line of descent (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝒍</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝒐</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝒅</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, previous 250 generations of cells). In the IBM, both beneficial genes (with benefit <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝒃</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, green) and harmful selfish genetic elements (SGEs, red) with a fitness penalty <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">𝜷</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> are taken into account.

Despite being continuously lost, these genes are beneficial enough to readily persist in the population through selection. An increased rate of HGT results in only marginally more carrier cells. For genes with a much smaller benefit, HGT can have a large impact on the frequency of carrier cells in the population. In fact, if the benefit is very small (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, white dotted line), carriers do not survive in the absence of HGT at all, but can occur in fairly high frequencies with sufficient HGT. Note however that the mere survival of carriers with beneficial genes does not imply a positive impact on the population growth rate, as the model assumes HGT comes at a cost. Actually, at sufficiently high rates of HGT, carrier cells with costly genes (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) can also persist in the population, which by definition is deleterious for growth.

Next, we study the same dynamics of carrier and non-carrier cells in a spatially explicit, eco-evolutionary context. We do this by implementing an individual-based model (IBM), where bacterial cells reside on a grid, interactions are local, and events like HGT and gene loss are implemented as stochastic processes (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

How does an enrichable gene in the well-mixed system become rescuable in the spatially structured population, as though it is less beneficial? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows how this can be intuitively understood by taking into account how, with low mixing, individuals in a spatial system mostly compete with their own kind (i.e. progeny and conspecifics). Even when the majority of the population consists of non-carriers, carriers are still competing mostly with other carrier cells. Thus, the effective benefit of carrying the gene is lower in a biofilm, hence the gene becomes harder to maintain within the population. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> is shown that, while carrier cells in well-mixed population experience a competitive advantage of 2% when carriers make up approximately half the population, carriers in a biofilm only reach a similar competitive advantage at very low carrier frequencies, that is when the carriers are almost extinct. At this point, the gene will readily be lost stochastically. The hampered ability of spatially structured populations to retain slightly beneficial genes, indeed changes how the population growth rate depends on the rate of HGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Bacteria evolve DNA uptake for rescuable genes only in a spatially structured population</title><p>The results described in the previous section illustrate that HGT (i.e. the uptake of DNA) is an evolutionarily stable strategy for a much broader range of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf84"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-values (fitness effects of genes) in a spatially structured population than in a well-mixed culture. Many more genes are furthermore classified as rescuable in these spatially structured populations, meaning that they can only persist through HGT.

Since rescuable genes cannot persist without HGT, the fate of a recently discovered gene depends on the ability of cells to engage in (local) HGT. Using this protocol, we investigated if the rescuable gene is able to spread through the evolution of HGT. We found that HGT never evolved for rescuable genes in well-mixed populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with our prior results in the well-mixed ODE model.

Interestingly however, we found that HGT did not always evolve immediately after the influx of rescuable genes started (yellow arrow), but nevertheless spread steadily once attained. To further elucidate the spread of genes, we barcoded each newly discovered gene with a unique ID, and visualised these on the spatial grid with different colours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Initially, rescuable genes fail to invade, even though different barcodes may locally persist for a while (episode I). After some time, however, one gene (green) manages to persist within a local community of transferring cells (episode II). This sets in motion a positive feedback mechanism, where the local abundance of the green gene alleviates the lack of donor cells, transforming nearby <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf106"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>-mutants into carriers, and so on (also see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This emergent ‘gene-sharing’ community eventually overgrows the other cells, and the rescuable gene ultimately persists in up to 70% of the population. After the influx of rescuable gene is stopped (episode III), the gene readily persists within the population, showing how this transferring community does not depend on the continuous influx of genes. In summary, HGT of rescuable genes through DNA uptake can only evolve if transfer happens within spatially localised sub-populations, and not under well-mixed conditions modelled by mass-action. Through a local ‘nucleation event’, communities can reach the alternative stable state that can maintain the rescuable gene. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> summarises the outcome of de novo HGT evolution for a broad range of genes (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf107"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-values) with different levels of mixing, revealing how the uptake of DNA evolves for many more genes in a spatially structured population. While HGT of enrichable genes always evolved, HGT only evolved for rescuable genes in spatially structured populations. Finally, as expected from prior results, HGT never evolved for indispensable and unrescuable genes.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-56801-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Gene-sharing ‘nucleation events’ and long-term coexistence with harmful SGEs.</title><p>For the IBM-model, this Video shows how gene-sharing of rescuable genes emerges through a ‘nucleation’-event, allowing local communities to eventually overgrow all other cells.

By looking at the initial invasion dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), we can see that these strong SGEs cannot rise to very high frequencies. As the hosts evolve lower rates of DNA uptake, these genetic parasites are pushed to very low frequencies. However, the reduced threat of genetic parasites causes the host cells to once again increase their rates of DNA uptake, leading to a secondary outbreak of SGEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, from T = 300,000 onwards). It is interesting to note that, while the population growth rates (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf134"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) clearly decrease due to this second infection, the growth rates along the line-of-descent (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf135"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, see Materials and methods) remains largely unaffected. Thus, while a sub-set of the population has been infected, individuals in this infected strain will not be amongst the long-term ancestors. Counter-intuitively, strong SGEs only have a minor impact on bacterial growth rates, as they are only retained at very low frequencies. Weaker SGEs instead impose a significant burden on the population by rising to much higher frequencies. Indeed, when SGEs are very costly, the population purges them entirely by evolving lower rates of DNA uptake (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5C</xref>). Finally, note how stopping the influx of SGEs does not impact the long-term coexistence of cells, beneficial genes, and these strong SGEs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the co-evolutionary process between SGEs and bacteria engaging in HGT of rescuable genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> shows long-term dynamics of barcoded SGEs in this spatial system. Although a diverse set of SGEs are initially discovered in parallel (coloured by their unique barcode), eventually only a single barcode remains after the influx of SGEs is stopped. Moreover, it can also be seen how SGEs are either locally abundant, or entirely absent. Thus, spatially separated strains of bacteria experience opposing selection pressures for taking up DNA. Lower rates of uptake are favoured in the presence of these strong SGEs, but higher rates of uptake are favoured when these genetic parasites have (locally) died out. Indeed, this heterogeneity of SGEs is crucial for the strong SGEs to persist, as well-mixed populations can only retain weaker SGEs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that strong SGEs failed to persist when HGT was too localised (e.g. only between neighbouring cells), as the SGEs then could not escape to a new pool of hosts that have high rates of DNA uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). We conclude that, in a spatially structured population, strong SGEs can stably coexist in a bacterial population which maintains its ability to engage in HGT to ‘rescue’ rescuable genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have studied the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of HGT by modelling a simple bacterial population undergoing the uptake of genes from a shared DNA pool.

This results in five distinct gene classes: (i) <italic>indispensable genes</italic>, that readily persist within the population and for which HGT is therefore always deleterious, (ii) <italic>enrichable genes</italic> which are not lost from the population without HGT, but moderate rates of HGT are adaptive, (iii) <italic>rescuable genes</italic> which are lost from the population without HGT, but can be rescued by HGT which improves population growth rates, and (iv) <italic>unrescuable genes</italic>, that are also lost from the population without HGT, but recovering them with HGT does not improve population growth rates, and (v) <italic>selfish genetic elements</italic>, genes that confer a fitness penalty, but can persist within the population with HGT.

We found that horizontal transfer of enrichable and rescuable genes is indeed a evolutionarily stable strategy, but can only evolve from scratch for enrichable genes. The evolution of HGT to ‘rescue’ a rescuable gene faces a problem under well-mixed conditions: HGT is required for the gene to persist, but sufficient carriers of the gene are necessary to evolve HGT. By modelling this process in a spatially structured population, we show that HGT can nevertheless evolve for these rescuable genes. As carriers of the gene can be locally abundant, emergent communities form that locally retain the gene via HGT, therewith slowly outgrowing other individuals. Finally, we show that once stable transferring communities have evolved, selfish genetic elements (SGEs) can stably coexist with the bacterial population and the beneficial genes. In spite of these genetic parasites exploiting the host’s ability to transfer, HGT is evolutionarily maintained, providing a doorway to the co-evolutionary process between bacteria and SGEs.</p><p>Here, we have used a simple model which ignores many of the complexities of natural bacterial populations, for example by assuming a constant environment and studying the impact of HGT one gene at a time. In reality, microbial ecosystems experience many changing selection pressures. Besides fluctuations in the available resources, traits like antimicrobial resistance, toxin production, and cooperative behaviour may confer large fitness benefits only under specific ecological circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Riley and Wertz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cordero et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vogwill and MacLean, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerardin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hehemann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimitriu et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, when considering the impact of HGT, we should also consider its implications for the genome as a whole, rather than only considering single genes. To take into account the impact of HGT on the whole genome, it is important to consider the possibility of differential gene mobility, where genes associated with MGEs may transfer much more frequently than other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rankin et al., 2011</xref>). However, we should then also take into account selection pressures that allow MGEs to have both mutualistic and parasitic relationships with their host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>). Although our extremely simple model ignores all the above intricacies, it retrospectively shines light on dynamics observed in our earlier eco-evolutionary modelling of antagonistic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Dijk and Hogeweg, 2016</xref>). In this multilevel model, which included changing selection pressures and the co-evolution of cells and mutualistic/parasitic genes, we showed that rarely beneficial toxin genes evolved to transfer much more frequently than their corresponding resistance factors. Despite the complex eco-evolutionary dynamics in this model, we can in hindsight understand how toxin genes evolved to correspond to ‘rescuable’ genes, and the resistance genes evolved to be ‘indispensable’. However, the rescuable toxin genes in this model experienced alternating selection pressures, only sporadically being highly beneficial for their hosts. Therefore, it remained unclear whether the ability of HGT to rescue genes required such alternating selection pressures, which was suggested to be important in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergstrom et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rankin et al., 2011</xref>). Here, our simple model has revealed that bacteria may also benefit from preferentially mobilising genes that are, constantly, slightly beneficial.</p><p>We have studied the impact of HGT by considering bacterial transformation as the mechanism by which genes transfer, that is by assuming (i) engaging in HGT is continuously costly and not only when it is successful, (ii) all carrier cells can act as a donor regardless of their ability to take up DNA themselves, and (iii) the ability for HGT is determined by the recipient cell. However, note that similar gene classes and comparable dynamics are observed when modifying these assumptions in our model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>), and that some of our key results may therefore hold for different mechanisms of HGT like conjugation. Indeed, there are some interesting parallels with earlier modelling work on plasmid persistence by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergstrom et al., 2000</xref>. On the one hand, this study shows that if genes carried on plasmids are sufficiently beneficial, HGT is not necessary, and plasmid-bearing cells are outcompeted by plasmid-free cells that have integrated the beneficial trait into the bacterial chromosome. These dynamics resemble those of the indispensable genes in our model, where transfer is not adaptive as the trait readily persists without HGT. On the other hand, Bergstrom et al. show that plasmids that are intermittently favoured can be retained by shuttling them back and forth between strains or species, reminiscent of the dynamics we have revealed for rescuable genes. However, there are of course some very important differences between conjugation and transformation, where plasmids for example confers other burdens on the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">San Millan and Craig maclean, 2019</xref>), cells require direct contact to conjugate, and the F-factor necessary for conjugation can itself reside either on a plasmid or on the bacterial chromosome. A promising direction for future modelling therefore is to more directly compare these two distinct mechanisms of HGT, so that we may one day learn to predict which genes will spread in an evolving microbial population.</p><p>Besides investigating the impact of HGT for a range of different fitness effects, we have also shown how spatial structure is a key component for the emergence of HGT of rescuable genes. Both conjugation and transformation have indeed been observed to occur more frequently in biofilms than in well-mixed cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madsen et al., 2012</xref>), and plasmids have furthermore been shown to be more persistent in biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stalder et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, spatial structure can slow down adaptation in asexual populations because individuals are mostly competing with their related conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gordo and Campos, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habets et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chacón and Harcombe, 2019</xref>). Relatedness has indeed been shown to be an important factor in stabilising HGT, for example of cooperative traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mc Ginty et al., 2011</xref>). Our model shows that, also without explicitely taking cooperation into account, HGT can only evolve in ‘gene-sharing’ communities which emerge in by local reproduction in spatially structured populations. Thus, not only are relatedness and spatial structure necessarily intertwined, they are crucial for the rare ‘nucleation events’ that initiates evolution towards increased rates of HGT. Intriguingly, similar nucleation events have been observed in origin of life studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu and Higgs, 2012</xref>) and models of microbial antagonistic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kotil, 2018</xref>). These types of emergent evolutionary transitions highlight how studying evolution under well-mixed conditions, and one mutant at a time, can be highly misleading. Studying biological systems in a spatial context will help us to better understand which eco-evolutionary outcomes are accessible, and maintainable, by evolution.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Horizontal gene transfer: rescue or catastrophe?</title><p>In nature, HGT can happen through a variety of mechanisms that each have their own potential advantages and disadvantages for the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vogan and Higgs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baltrus, 2013</xref>). Bacteria do not always have full control over the rates at which HGT happens, especially when considering it as a side-effects of other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Redfield, 2001</xref>). However, it remains an intriguing question under which specific circumstances bacteria benefit from HGT, whether it is a side-effect or not. By abstracting away from the different mechanisms of HGT, and what it means for a gene to be ‘beneficial’, we have revealed the conditions under which HGT is an adaptive trait for the host cells. In a similar spirit, earlier modelling by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vogan and Higgs, 2011</xref> has shown that HGT can be adaptive with respect to genes that are frequently lost. However, in their work, natural selection eventually favoured improved replication accuracy, therewith decreasing the advantage of HGT. Other models have shown that HGT is beneficial to mitigate the effects of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muller, 1964</xref> by decreasing assortment load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vig-Milkovics et al., 2019</xref>), analogous to the impact of sex and recombination on the balance between drift and selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lynch et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schultz and Lynch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lynch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vos et al., 2019</xref>). Our work complements these aforementioned studies by showing that, however low the rate of gene loss may be, there may always be a class of slightly beneficial traits for which HGT is adaptive and evolvable. Although genes with such small fitness effects are very hard to detect experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bataillon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wiser and Lenski, 2015</xref>), our model is a proof of principle that HGT may play a key role in preventing the loss of these genes, which may explain the differential rates of HGT as observed in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nogueira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rankin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Novick and Doolittle, 2020</xref>).

We do this by modelling the same processes with gradually increasing complexity, starting from simple Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), and then evaluating the same dynamics in an Invididual-based Model (IBM). A graphical representation of these models is found in the main text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The models consider the competition between cells of two types: carrier cells (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf136"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) that carry a gene, and non-carrier cells (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf137"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>).

Proportional to the density of available carrier cells, non-carriers can be transformed back into a carrier cell by means of ‘additive’ HGT.

id="s4-3"><title>Individual-based model</title><p>The individual-based model (IBM) describes the same dynamics as the ODE models, but differs in some important aspects. Firstly, individuals are discrete entities that live on a 2D grid, and reproduce locally. This allows us to study the model with and without spatial pattern formation by modifying the rate at which cells mix. When mixing is disabled or very limited, a spatially structured population like that of a biofilm will form, while an increased amount of cellular mixing will approximate a well-mixed culture. Under well-mixed conditions, individuals will interact with random individuals in the population (approximating the all-against-all dynamics of the ODEs), while individuals will interact mostly with their conspecifics in case of the biofilm. We explicitly define a competition range (focal cell plus its eight neighbouring grid points) and a HGT range (all cells within distance <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf163"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) which determine smaller samples of the total population with which individuals can interact. Each individual (potentially) has its own <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf164"><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-parameter, allowing us to study the evolution of HGT in an eco-evolutionary context (see implementation of mutations below). As we primarily focus on the question if cells benefit from taking up genes from their environment or other cells, we assume that the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf165"><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-parameter of the recipient cell determines the probability of HGT. While we tested if HGT could evolve de novo by studying the invasion critereon for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf166"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in the ODE model, we study the de novo evolution of HGT in the IBM by continuously introducing carriers at a low rate. With a rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf167"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, genes with benefit <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf168"><mml:msup><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> are (re)discovered, allowing us to study how and if newly discovered genes/selfish elements spread through the population. Finally, note that processes such as gene loss, HGT, and competition are no longer deterministic like in the ODEs, but implemented as events that can stochastically happen at each simulated time step. To ensure the chance-events in the IBM (reproduction, HGT, gene loss) accurately represent the rates as used in the ODE, all probabilities were multiplied by a small constant ΔT = 0.1.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Updating grid points</title><p>All grid points <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf169"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in the IBM contain a single cell which can be a carrier or non-carrier (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf170"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for carriers, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf171"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for non-carrier), which can carry a SGE (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf172"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for SGE infected cells, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf173"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for uninfected cells), and has an individual HGT-parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf174"><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

In general, our results do not depend on the absolute value of these two parameters. Instead, our results depends on the relationship between these two parameters, meaning that for lower (arguably more realistic) rates of gene loss, the relevant parameter range will still be extensive if the costs for HGT are also lower. If the costs are very high, the range where HGT is adaptive (i.e. enrichable and rescuable genes) becomes much more narrow, but is nevertheless retained (i.e. the gene classes discussed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> simply shift to lower values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf194"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>). As these costs may entail a wide variety of different burdens on the cell (operating and expressing DNA pumps, diverting resources to the physiolocial state of natural competence, the burden of expressing redundant gene copies, chromosome disruptions, cytotoxicity, and the risks of SGEs), we do not know quantitative information to judge the relevant value for this cost parameter. Instead, we argue that our model instead gives conceptual clarifications and demonstrations of novel possibilities. Parameters such as the benefit (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf195"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), the HGT-rate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf196"><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), the amount of mixing (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf197"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), and the HGT distance (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf198"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) have been extensively sweeped, as discussed in the main text/Supplementary Material.

This result can be intuitively understood. Small (invading) HGT<sup>+</sup>-populations pay the continuous costs for HGT, but hardly ever interact with their conspecifics, and hence the positive fitness effects of maintaining the slightly beneficial gene are too small to overcome the costs for HGT. Higher fitness can only be achieved when the population size is large enough, such that the benefits conferred by HGT outweigh its costs. The presence of an Allee effect was confirmed by numerically integrating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ30 equ30 equ30 equ30">Equations 25-28</xref> for different initial conditions. We then indeed see that the system converges to different equilibria depending on the initial frequency of HGT<sup>+</sup>-cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Part II: Supplementary results and figures</title><sec id="s10-1"><title>Similar gene classes exist with different assumptions for the cost of HGT</title><p>In the main text, we assume that the costs for HGT scale proportional with the rate of HGT. Moreover, we assume that the costs are always present, that is also when no carriers are present to interact with. The assumption is that both carriers and non-carriers can take up DNA, but do so to no avail when no carrier DNA is present. Below, we show what the effect is on population growth rates when these assumptions are varied. Specifically, we consider a scenario with constant costs, and a scenario where the costs are only payed when carriers are present from which to take up DNA.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Similar gene classes exist with different assumptions for the cost of HGT In the top panel (with costs as in the main text), we can observe all the gene classes discussed in the main text.</title><p>In the middle panel (with fixed costs), HGT always improves the growth rates for genes with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf363"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Therefore, it is not adaptive to invest in costly HGT (the maximal growth rate is 1.0 with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf366"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). Thus, for this range of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf367"><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>’s, we observe a similar ‘unrescuable’ gene class as the one discussed in the main text. When growth rates <italic>can</italic> be improved within this range of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf368"><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>’s, the genes can be compared to the rescuable genes or enrichable genes, depending on whether or not HGT is required for the gene to persist. Indispensable genes do not exist under this regime, as HGT always increases growth rates when <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf369"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. We argue, however, that a constant cost with extremely high rates of HGT is fairly unrealistic, as every HGT-event carries inherent risks, for example by chromosome disruptions, cytotoxicity, and the integration of SGEs. In the bottom panel, we investigate a scenario where costs are only present when actually taking up DNA from carrier cells (<italic>i.e.</italic> instead of c*h, the costs are c*h*C). Under this scenario, most gene classes from the main text exist. Unrescuable genes however do not exist, as there are no cost if no carriers are present. Similarly, the Allee effect as discussed in the main text is also not present, as this Allee effect requires costs in the absence of donor cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56801-app1-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s10-2"><title>Comparing our results with conjugation-like scenarios</title><p>In the main text, we discussed how HGT may not be able to evolve for rescuable genes due to the Allee effect: HGT is only adaptive if the gene is present, but the gene can only be present with HGT.

After 50.000 time steps, both the conjugation-like (C- cannot act as donor) and the transformation-like (C- can act as donor) mechaninisms of HGT show that only a subset of the populations managed to evolve HGT for low physical distances(see figure below). The details of this figure of course depend on <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf375"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, as slightly more beneficial genes may spread easier. It is however interesting to consider how the ‘gene-sharing’ discussed in the main text, works best when the genes can be picked up from afar, ensuring that the clumping of carrier cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is alleviated. This distance-effect is of course not applicable to conjugation, as physical contact is required between cells in order to conjugate.

As discussed in the previous paragraph, a conjugation-like scenario causes the Allee effect to also exist for enrichable genes. Indeed, we observed that well-mixed populations could not evolve HGT for enrichable genes (i.o.w.

Interestingly, their model shows that even when costly, HGT is most like to evolve for genes with slight benefits to their hosts, which would be lost in the absence of HGT. HGT for these genes required a spatial context to evolve, but once these conditions were fulfilled, it evolved even in the presence of selfish genetic elements, which carry no benefit to their hosts.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Slightly beneficial genes are retained by collectives evolving Horizontal Gene Transfer despite selfish elements&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Paul G Higgs (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study uses a combination of two modelling approaches (differential equation models and IBMs) to ask how HGT can evolve de novo, and what kind of genes will allow for selection and maintenance of HGT. The analysis reveals that depending on the benefit (or harm) they provide, genes can be categorised into indispensable, enrichable, rescuable, unrescuable or selfish. They analyse these different gene types and show that HGT is more likely to evolve and be maintained for &quot;enrichable&quot; genes that have a small benefit to their carriers or for both enrichable and rescuable genes if a spatial version of the model is considered.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting paper that gives some useful ways to think about HGT (the gene categories) and important insights into its evolution. We also agreed that the modelling approaches used were interesting, informative and appropriate. The paper is well-written, in particular the figures, which are very visually appealing.</p><p>A first key point is clarifying what mechanism of HGT the model is capturing: how is transfer occurring? What does the cost represent and how are genes acquired or lost? The paper contains mixed messages as to whether HGT occurs through plasmids or by transformation. According to the definition of &quot;additive HGT&quot;, it should be through plasmids, and not by transformation, which requires recombination (Introduction paragraph two). But then other parts of the model (like acquiring genes from cells a certain distance away) suggest transformation. This choice will be important in determining the model structure, the rate of loss of the genetic element and its costs and benefits as detailed below.</p><p>Regarding the cost, what does it represent, and why is the cost proportional to the rate of transfer (ch) rather than just a constant cost (c)? If the HGT mechanism is conjugation, there is a cost of replicating the plasmid inside the cell, but the cost is constant – it doesn't depend on how fast the genes are transferred, just on how many plasmids are in the cell. Alternatively, if fragments of DNA are taken up from the environment, maybe there is a small cost to expressing uptake genes, and this might be proportional to h, although one would expect the main fitness benefits and costs are associated with the genes/junk/SGEs that are acquired by HGT rather than simply from having the ability to acquire genes by HGT.</p><p>Regarding gene loss, how it is modelled will also depend on the mechanism of HGT. If the gene is on a chromosome, then loss could be deletion of a gene during genome replication, or deleterious mutation that stops the function of the gene. On the other hand, if the beneficial gene is on a plasmid, loss of the beneficial gene is loss of the plasmid. This will clearly also affect the magnitude of the parameter value. In Equation 3, the loss rate from C<sup>-</sup> is the same as the loss rate from C<sup>+</sup>, which would be true if the gene is on a chromosome. But if that is the case, the gene that allows HGT should also be on the chromosome (contradicting with the additive HGT assumption) and it should also be lost sometimes, in which case a C<sup>+</sup> could change to a C<sup>-</sup>, or an N<sup>+</sup> to an N<sup>-</sup>. Another way to say this is &quot;where does the C<sup>-</sup> come from?&quot; If the beneficial gene were gained by HGT then it must have been gained by a + cell, then the C<sup>-</sup> was created by deletion of the gene that previously allowed HGT.</p><p>Another way to view the model is that the C<sup>+</sup> represents a cell where the beneficial gene is on a plasmid that can be transferred by conjugation, whereas the C<sup>-</sup> represents a cell where the beneficial gene is already on a chromosome and cannot be transferred. In that case the loss rate from the chromosome by deletion should be different from the loss by losing the plasmid. Losing the plasmid means losing the benefit and the cost and the ability to transfer all at the same time. There is an interesting paper of Bergstrom that discusses the conditions for maintenance of a plasmid with a beneficial gene (Bergstrom et al., 2000). It would be useful to discuss similarities and differences of the present model with the Bergstrom model. An important part of the Bergstrom model is the transfer of the beneficial gene to the chromosome. This seems to be analogous to the mutation of a C<sup>+</sup> to a C<sup>-</sup> in this model. In Equation 3 the rate of gain of the beneficial gene is hN<sup>+</sup>(C<sup>-</sup> + C<sup>+</sup>). This means that C<sup>-</sup> cells can donate the gene. This would apply if the gene is acquired by transformation, rather than conjugation. How would this change in the conjugation case? The rate of gain would be hN+C<sup>+</sup> only. The N<sup>+</sup> cannot gain from the C<sup>-</sup>. Does that mean the plasmid cannot spread? I think the assumption that the cost of HGT is proportional to h is relevant here. If the cost were a constant c (not ch) then a plasmid with high enough h would invade whatever the cost to the cells.</p><p>Finally on loss, the current choice of parameter for the rate of loss is odd. The authors claim that their results hold for more realistic values (subsection “Parameters used”) but making the parameter-region where HGT is adaptive for the host cells narrower. Is the parameter region large enough to be biologically relevant?</p><p>A second point that caused confusion is that the model assumes that each gene will either have a beneficial or a deleterious effect all the time. In reality, of course, MGEs lie on a parasitism-mutualism continuum relationship with the host bacterium because the “beneficial” gene will not be beneficial all the time (see Harrison et al., 2015, Discussion paragraph two). The same MGE transferring the beneficial gene may be an SGE depending on the bacterial host or the environment. The model thus considers a rather artificial case in which a single gene always has the same effect on its host. We see that it is a valid simplification to simulate each gene benefit individually, understand the conditions in which it may spread, and thereby infer that as long as genes with such benefits exist, then HGT should evolve. But this last logical step is not spelled out clearly enough in the paper.</p><p>Whether or not the gene is beneficial may also change the mechanism of transfer, where genes that are beneficial in the long term are more likely to integrate on the chromosome and reducing the rate of loss possibly by orders of magnitude. This last point is crucial, because if the rate of loss is low enough then slightly beneficial genes could be maintained in the absence of HGT. In other words, the authors may want to consider a case where the rate of loss differs depending on the costs and benefits of the gene in a given context.</p><p>A related point is how deleterious can SGEs become without disrupting HGT? This seems to be explored in Appendix 1—figure 5B and C. Is the result that SGEs would simply disappear if they are too deleterious? There seems to be a suggestion in the supplement that grid size may change this result. It would also be good to expand on this in the main text.</p><p>In sum, in order for the manuscript to be accepted in <italic>eLife</italic>, we ask the authors to at least do the following:</p><p>1) Include a detailed discussion at the beginning of the paper about the assumptions of the model and which biological situation is represented. Are you simulating HGT by conjugation or transformation? Who decides whether transfer is possible – the donor, the receiver, or both?</p><p>2) The authors should more explicitly explain where their parameter choices for costs, benefits, rates of loss, etc. and how they relate to the chosen mechanism of HGT. Also, why is it reasonable to assume that they are independent of each other?</p><p>3) Revise the choices of cost, benefit and rates of loss according to the biological situation and taking into account the ideas discussed above. Will the conclusions hold and will they be biologically relevant (if the parameter range is very small, is HGT likely to evolve)?</p><p>4) More fully cite the relevant literature on HGT costs and how they arise (TREE 2013 and San Millan and MacLean, Microbiology Spectrum 2017)</p><p>5) Flesh out what happens if SGEs are more deleterious.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56801.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting paper that gives some useful ways to think about HGT (the gene categories) and important insights into its evolution.

We modified the text to point out that the mechanism we study is most similar to HGT through bacterial transformation (Introduction paragraph three, Results paragraph one and Materials and methods first paragraph). However, we would also like to point out that many of the results in our manuscript may apply to HGT in the Abstract, generating useful search images for experimentalists and bioinformaticians. To show that our results could be insightful when different assumptions are considered, we added two supplementary paragraphs (and three figures) where discuss our model in light of different assumptions. We show that under various assumptions it is still fitting to talk about genes being rescuable (or not), indispensable (or not), and that the evolutionary “paradox” (<italic>i.e.</italic> HGT is needed for the gene to persist, but the gene only persist with HGT) applies even more when C<sup>-</sup> cannot act as a donor, as as the case with conjugation.</p><p>Next, we now elaborate on how additive gene transfer can also occur through the uptake of DNA (<italic>i.e.</italic> through flanking homology / non-homologous recombination / transposons). This is relevant, as such additive incorporation of foreign DNA is essential for SGEs to be able to persist, which is why our model best applies to additive HGT (rather than replacing HGT).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the cost, what does it represent, and why is the cost proportional to the rate of transfer (ch) rather than just a constant cost (c)?

Most notably, (i) the expression and operation of DNA uptake machinery is costly, and (ii) the physiological state of competence is shown to stop cell division or paralyse core metabolic processes (see for example Ephrussi-Taylor and Freed, 1964; Bergé et al., 2017, Villa et al., 2019). Moreover, we argue that every HGT-event carries a risk, for example by chromosome disruptions, cytotoxicity, and the integration of SGEs. The latter SGEs are of course explicitly discussed in the remainder of the manuscript.</p><p>We have also considered the model for constant costs, which is now included in a supplementary paragraph (and figure). These new supplementary results (Appendix 1 Part II) show that similar gene classes are observed for different assumptions for the costs of HGT. However, with fixed cost, the indispensable gene class is lost, as more and more HGT will always increase the frequency of carriers in the population. We consider these constant costs unrealistic however, as we expect that very high rates of HGT would eventually be a burden for the host cells (as explained above)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding gene loss, how it is modelled will also depend on the mechanism of HGT. If the gene is on a chromosome, then loss could be deletion of a gene during genome replication, or deleterious mutation that stops the function of the gene.

Indeed, given that the benefit of rescuing slightly beneficial genes is, by definition, also small, the gene(s) responsible for HGT may require HGT too. We have considered this secondary effect earlier in the project, but have not yet extensively analysed its implications. Although we agree with the reviewers that this would be an interesting extension of our analysis, we feel it would cloud the message of our current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another way to view the model is that the C<sup>+</sup> represents a cell where the beneficial gene is on a plasmid that can be transferred by conjugation, whereas the C<sup>-</sup> represents a cell where the beneficial gene is already on a chromosome and cannot be transferred. In that case the loss rate from the chromosome by deletion should be different from the loss by losing the plasmid. Losing the plasmid means losing the benefit and the cost and the ability to transfer all at the same time.

It would be useful to discuss similarities and differences of the present model with the Bergstrom model.

We added a paragraph to the Discussion to elaborate on the comparison between conjugation (i.e. Bergstrom) and transformation (i.e. our work), and therein also speculate on promising directions for future modelling, to better contrast the two mechanisms.</p><p>Changing whether or not C<sup>-</sup> can act as a donor does not change our initial analysis, which was done in the simpler model from Figure 1A. However, it does change some of the implications for evolution of HGT. The Allee effect (as discussed in the main text), now also exists for the enrichable genes when C<sup>-</sup> cannot act as a donor. An extra supplementary paragraph (and figure) now illustrates this. Interestingly, these new supplementary result suggest that the act of “rescuing” genes may be even more relevant with respect to conjugation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally on loss, the current choice of parameter for the rate of loss is odd.

HGT is adaptive when <italic>b</italic>&lt;<italic>l</italic>/<italic>c</italic>, meaning that our results may also apply to lower loss, depending on the costs. We do not know of any quantitative information to judge this issue on the balance between loss and costs accurately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second point that caused confusion is that the model assumes that each gene will either have a beneficial or a deleterious effect all the time.

But this last logical step is not spelled out clearly enough in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, that last logical step is important to point out. We elaborate on this in the (new) second paragraph of the Discussion. Here, we also discuss how much of our work was based on one of our earlier work. In this earlier eco-evolutionary model, we do study the co-evolution of beneficial genes and parasitic DNA, by allowing genes to evolve their own rate of transfer (van Dijk and Hogeweg, 2015). Here, we found that rarely beneficial toxin genes would evolve very high gene mobility, while their corresponding resistance factors evolved minimal gene mobility.</p><p>With the current model, our goal was to better understand how much of these dynamics could be explained simply by the benefit of these genes (which could also be seen as the average benefit of a gene with alternating selection pressures). We now refer back to this earlier work, to illustrate how our simple model shines light on dynamics that were first observed in a more complex eco-evolutionary context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Whether or not the gene is beneficial may also change the mechanism of transfer, where genes that are beneficial in the long term are more likely to integrate on the chromosome and reducing the rate of loss possibly by orders of magnitude.

In other words, the authors may want to consider a case where the rate of loss differs depending on the costs and benefits of the gene in a given context.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is most relevant for conjugation. We now explicitly consider our results in light of transformation, and gene deletion then occurs through DNA deletion or substitution on the chromosome. While the dynamics of genes residing on plasmids vs the chromosome are indeed intriguing, it does not play a role in our current model.</p><p>This is not entirely accurate, as for any rate of gene loss &gt; 0, there still is a class of genes that cannot be maintained without it, and can be maintained with HGT. As mentioned above, the absolute value of <italic>l</italic> is not particularly important, but the relationship between l and c is important. The reason why <italic>l</italic> and <italic>c</italic> are as they are in the IBM, is mainly to increase the speed of the relevant dynamics (for example, the local nucleation events from Figure 5 become very rare when scaling these rates down too much, even though they do always, eventually, occur).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related point is how deleterious can SGEs become without disrupting HGT? This seems to be explored in Appendix 1—figure 5B and C. Is the result that SGEs would simply disappear if they are too deleterious? There seems to be a suggestion in the supplement that grid size may change this result. It would also be good to expand on this in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the text what happens with SGEs that are even more costly (subsection “HGT is evolutionarily maintained in the presence of harmful SGEs”). If HGT is not evolvable, nothing interesting happens when considering very costly SGEs, as the condition h &gt; l – b still holds. Thus, no matter how costly, there is always a HGT-rate where the SGE can persist (barring SGEs with fitness penalty greater than 1.0, the intrinsic growth rate).</p><p>When HGT is evolvable (<italic>i.e.</italic> when we allow the individuals in the IBM to evolve their rates DNA uptake), they will decrease their rates of HGT in the presence of costly SGEs. In the spatially structured populations, this can result in interesting oscillations in the HGT-rate, as described in the main text. However, as can be seen from Figure 6, the costly SGEs go through major bottlenecks. When even costlier SGEs are considered (see Appendix 1—figure 4), the selection pressures for decreasing HGT-rates eventually purges all SGEs from the system. For β=0.04 (e.g. see the 5th column of Figure 10), the rate of HGT will continue to oscillate due to a tug-of-war between infected HGT<sup>+</sup> strains and uninfected HGT<sup>-</sup> strain. As discussed in the main text, the HGT<sup>+</sup> strain has the advantage of being able to maintain the rescuable gene, while the HGT<sup>-</sup> strain has the advantage of not being susceptible by SGEs. Due to the finite population size, the SGE is eventually lost, and the population will bounce back to higher rates of HGT (again, see column for β = 0.04). Even costlier SGEs (β = 0.05) do not persist at all, and quickly go extinct. Indeed, as mentioned, grid size does change these dynamics for β = 0.04, but we found that β = 0.05 (and greater values) could not persist even in larger populations (400x400 cells). Due to computational limitations, we have not tested what happens with even larger populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, in order for the manuscript to be accepted in eLife, we ask the authors to at least do the following:</p><p>1) Include a detailed discussion at the beginning of the paper about the assumptions of the model and which biological situation is represented. Are you simulating HGT by conjugation or transformation? Who decides whether transfer is possible – the donor, the receiver, or both?</p></disp-quote><p>Since one of our main research questions is “When is taking up a gene beneficial for the bacteria?”, the model best represents bacterial transformation, where cells take up DNA from their environment. We now make it explicit that we consider transformation (Introduction paragraph three, Results paragraph one and Materials and methods first paragraph), where the receiver decides whether transfer is possible. We also address the costs that this mechanism may entail (Introduction paragraph two and three).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should more explicitly explain where their parameter choices for costs, benefits, rates of loss, etc. and how they relate to the chosen mechanism of HGT. Also, why is it reasonable to assume that they are independent of each other?</p></disp-quote><p>This is much clearer in the revised manuscript. For transformation, the independence of these parameters is a more reasonable assumption than for conjugation. Nevertheless, one may argue that higher rates of HGT may cause more gene loss due to illegitimate recombination / insertion into coding regions. Either way, as we do not know the precise values of these parameters and how they may correlate, the model allows us to consider the impact of 1 variable at a time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Revise the choices of cost, benefit and rates of loss according to the biological situation and taking into account the ideas discussed above. Will the conclusions hold and will they be biologically relevant (if the parameter range is very small, is HGT likely to evolve)?</p></disp-quote><p>The statement that the parameter range is more narrow for lower loss (in the original manuscript) may have been misleading, and has been changed to avoid this confusion. Whatever the absolute loss rate, it is the relationship between loss and the costs that enable/hinders the evolution of HGT. This is now explained in the Materials and methods (section “Parameters used”). That said, <italic>if</italic> the parameter range for rescuable/enrichable genes is more narrow in reality, then the ability to evolve HGT will depend on the efficiency of selection (population size and mutation rates), and as mentioned by the reviewers, on the rate at which the gene for HGT is itself lost. We (and others) should take that final point into account for future modelling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) More fully cite the relevant literature on HGT costs and how they arise (TREE 2013 and San Millan and MacLean, Microbiology Spectrum 2017)</p></disp-quote><p>We now cited both these papers. As San Millan and MacLean references specifically the costs of plasmids, this is cited when comparing our results with what is known about conjugation and plasmids (i.e. Bergstrom, 2000) in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Flesh out what happens if SGEs are more deleterious.</p></disp-quote><p>We added descriptions of what happens with very costly SGEs in the main text. (subsection “HGT is evolutionarily maintained in the presence of harmful SGEs”)</p></body></sub-article></article>
