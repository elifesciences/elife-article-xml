has highlighted how decreased lymphocyte number/function contribute to worsened infection/cancer. Yet, an interesting contrast exists with autoimmune disease development, wherein diminishing pathogenic effectors may benefit the post-septic host. Within this framework, the impact of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis on the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was explored. Notably, CLP mice have delayed onset and reduced disease severity, relative to sham mice. Reduction in disease severity was associated with reduced number, but not function, of autoantigen (MOG)-specific pathogenic CD4 T cells in the CNS during disease and draining lymph node during priming. Numerical deficits of CD4 T cell effectors are associated with the loss of MOG-specific naive precursors. Critically, transfer of MOG-TCR transgenic (2D2) CD4 T cells after, but not before, CLP led to EAE disease equivalent to sham mice. Thus, broad impairment of antigenic responses, including autoantigens, is a hallmark of sepsis-induced immunoparalysis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that can happen when the immune system overreacts to an infection and begins to damage tissues and organs in the body. It causes an extreme immune reaction called a cytokine storm, where the body releases uncontrolled levels of cytokines, proteins that are involved in coordinating the body’s response to infections. This in turn activates more immune cells, resulting in hyperinflammation.</p><p>People who survive sepsis may have long-lasing impairments in their immune system that may leave them more vulnerable to infections or cancer. But scientists do not know exactly what causes these lasting immune problems or how to treat them.</p><p>The fact that people are susceptible to cancer and infection after sepsis may offer a clue. It may suggest that the immune system is not able to attack bacteria or cancer cells. One way to explore this clue would be to test the effects of sepsis on autoimmune diseases, which cause the immune system to attack the body’s own cells. For example, in the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks and destroys cells in the nervous system. If autoimmune disease is reduced after sepsis, it would suggest the cell-destroying abilities of the immune system are lessened.</p><p>Using this approach, Jensen, Jensen et al. show that sepsis reduces the number of certain immune cells, called CD4 T cells, which are are responsible for an autoimmune attack of the central nervous system. In the experiments, mice that survived sepsis were evaluated for their ability to develop a multiple sclerosis-like disease. Mice that survived sepsis developed less severe or no autoimmune disease. After sepsis, these animals also had fewer CD4 T cells. However, when these immune cells were reinstated, the autoimmune disease emerged.</p><p>The experiments help explain some of the immune system changes that occur after sepsis. Jensen, Jensen et al. suggest that rather than being completely detrimental, these changes may help to block harmful autoimmune responses. The experiments may also hint at new ways to combat autoimmune diseases by trying to replicate some of the immune-suppressing effects of sepsis. Studying the effect of sepsis on other autoimmune diseases in mice might provide more clues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>EAE</kwd><kwd>CD4 T

affecting 1.7 million and killing 270,000 Americans yearly, and economic burden (&gt; $20 billion annually) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">CDC, 2020</xref>). Sepsis is characterized by cytokine storm, a maladaptive response to a mismanaged infection, that is comprised of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Although the acute cytokine storm is a grave situation, patients who survive a septic event are susceptible to further complications with increased susceptibility to unrelated secondary infection, increased viral reactivation, and decreased 5-year survival relative to non-septic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dombrovskiy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Donnelly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gaieski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kutza et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walton et al., 2014</xref>). These factors have been attributed to the sepsis-induced lymphopenic state and functional deficits of the surviving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hotchkiss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hotchkiss et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hotchkiss et al., 2001</xref>). This state of immunoparalysis is so profound that the majority of sepsis-associated mortality has shifted to be late deaths following secondary infections or other morbid conditions as a result of immunologic impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Delano and Ward, 2016</xref>). Therefore, emphasis has been strongly shifted toward determining the mechanisms by which sepsis impairs the immune response to subsequent infection or cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Condotta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Condotta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Danahy et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jensen et al., 2018b</xref>). Yet, this focus on the sepsis-induced loss of beneficial host responses has come at the expense of understanding how sepsis may influence other subsequent maladaptive immune responses. As opposed to infection/cancer, wherein effectors promote disease control, autoantigen-specific effectors promote disease and are detrimental to the host.</p><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease of the CNS and is potentially the most common non-traumatic cause of CNS disability in young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Compston and Coles, 2002</xref>). MS poses a major personal and economic burden; it effects mostly women and on average presents at age 30, an age crucial for family planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fox, 2004</xref>). The etiology of MS involves a complex interaction between genetic and environmental components, resulting in a clinical presentation including, but not limited to, sensory, motor, and/or cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dendrou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freedman et al., 2018</xref>). MS is thought to result from autoreactive CD4 T cell responses to the myelin antigens in the CNS followed by inflammatory cellular infiltration, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of MS, this role for CD4 T cells is well-established and induced by immunization against myelin antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stinissen et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>While there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the impact of sepsis on autoimmunity, descriptions of how sepsis influences specific cell subsets can provide insight into how autoimmune disease may be influenced. With regard to the critical role for CD4 T cells in EAE disease, the sepsis-induced lymphopenic state is known to impact both naive and memory CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jensen et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sjaastad et al., 2020b</xref>). In particular, sepsis can diminish the number of naive CD4 T cell precursors subsequently limiting the number of cells capable of responding to a given antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martin et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, sepsis can impair the effector function of surviving T cells further limiting the capacity of cells to mount an antigen-specific response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mohr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pötschke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sjaastad et al., 2018</xref>). Sepsis can also impair antigen-specific T cell responses through various cell extrinsic factors, including diminished number/function of dendritic cells (DCs) and diminished capacity of endothelial cells to promote chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Danahy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strother et al., 2016</xref>). Cumulatively, these findings suggest that, while detrimental to control of pathogens/cancer, sepsis may alternately diminish a host’s capacity to develop autoimmunity.</p><p>Herein, we demonstrate that following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), mice have diminished EAE disease severity. Autoantigen-specific effector CD4 T cells were reduced in CLP hosts with EAE due to a loss of their naive precursors, which was the determining factor in the impediment of EAE disease. These data further define how the sepsis-induced immunoparalysis reduces host capacity to generate antigen-specific responses, regardless of whether it is a foreign antigen or an endogenous autoantigen.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sepsis reduces EAE disease severity and the number of CNS infiltrating pathogenic effector CD4 T cells</title><p>The influence of the immunoparalysis phase of sepsis, which follows the resolution of the cytokine storm, on the ability of the host to develop autoimmunity is undefined. To address this relationship, we employed well-established models of polymicrobial sepsis and inducible autoimmunity, CLP and EAE, respectively. CLP effectively mimics the pathophysiology of acute peritonitis and corresponding septic inflammation, with the capacity to modulate disease severity through adjustment of surgical parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dejager et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sjaastad et al., 2020a</xref>). Likewise, EAE presents an ideal model system to study the impact of sepsis on the development of autoimmune disease since it is a robust, inducible system allowing for manipulations prior to disease initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stinissen et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>CLP, sham, and non-surgery mice were immunized with MOG<sub>35-55</sub> peptide 5 days post-surgery, a time when the cytokine storm has resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Danahy et al., 2019b</xref>), to induce EAE and disease progression was monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Therefore, to address whether the CLP-induced reduction in EAE disease was a durable phenomenon, we included a group of mice that had undergone CLP surgery 25 days prior to EAE immunization and evaluated the development of EAE disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Interestingly, even at this later time point CLP survivors continued to exhibit reduced disease severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>) and delayed disease onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) relative to sham or no surgery controls, though disease severity was increased relative to day 5 CLP mice. The more severe disease relative to day 5 mice was due to a noted variability among the day 25 CLP mice, wherein some individuals developed severe disease and others had minimal disease. This difference in EAE severity suggests that the influence of the immunoparalysis state may wain with time, at least in some of the mice. Therefore, to capture the maximal state of suppression, we focused on comparisons of day five sham and CLP hosts.</p><p>It is important to stress that sham surgery is the preferred control for assessing how the septic event influences the development of subsequent T-cell-mediated immune responses, since those mice experience the same surgical procedures as CLP mice (excluding those that initiate the septic event) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cuenca et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sjaastad et al., 2020a</xref>). In particular, anesthesia, such as the ketamine used for the surgical procedures, can influence CD4 T cell function and capacity to induce EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ohta et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, to ensure that differences observed were due to the septic event, rather than being imposed by surgery, we utilized sham surgery as a relevant control to CLP procedure for the remainder of our experiments.</p><p>To further address how sepsis altered the systemic parameters of disease, we assessed serum cytokine/chemokine concentrations in sham and CLP hosts both prior (day 0) to and during EAE disease (day 15 post-EAE induction). Notably, the differences in clinical scores between sham and CLP hosts were associated with an altered pattern of expression by various systemic cytokines following EAE immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>); this included numerous effector cytokines associated with EAE disease development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b–i</xref>). Given the difference observed in disease between sham and CLP mice, in conjunction with an altered cytokine response, histopathologic scoring of the parenchymal and meningeal regions of the spinal cord during active disease was performed. Corresponding with their milder disease, CLP mice with EAE had less CNS pathology as highlighted by reduced inflammatory cell infiltrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,H and E</xref>) in both the parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) and meninges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) of the spinal cord, the primary target of EAE inflammation. Further, CLP mice had milder axonal demyelination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, LFB) and vacuole formation, factors associated with EAE-induced paralysis.</p><p>The difference in infiltrate observed extended to a reduced frequency and number of both microglia and infiltrating monocytes and macrophages present within the CNS in CLP hosts, relative to their sham counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a–e</xref>). A significant reduction in MHC II expression was also observed on both microglia and infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in CLP hosts compared to sham-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3f,h</xref>). This reduction compounded with the already reduced number of myeloid cells leading to ~100 fold reduction in MHC II-expressing cells in CLP hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3g,i</xref>). Prior studies have demonstrated alterations in MHC expression by myeloid cells which are dysregulated following sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jensen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Monneret et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siegler et al., 2018</xref>). MHC II expression is not only a marker of activation of these cell populations but also serves to present antigen to CD4 T cells, including autoreactive T cells that are critical mediators of disease in EAE. Therefore, this global infiltrate reduction in CLP hosts may reflect the lack of an autoimmune response in the CNS for which CD4 T cells are critical mediators.</p><p>To address whether the reduction in histological inflammatory cell infiltrate reflected a difference in the accumulation of pathogenic antigen-specific CD4 T cells, total CNS (brain and spinal cord) was harvested from sham and CLP mice, following perfusion, at day 15 post-EAE induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

This finding indicates the autoantigen-specific CD4 T cells present in the CNS after CLP surgery are functionally competent and potentially were the least impacted by the septic event.

Consistent with our observation of disparate disease development among CLP hosts, we observed a corresponding bifurcation in the number of MOG-specific CD4 T cells in individual mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) further suggesting that the ability to initiate EAE disease might correspond to the number of MOG-specific CD4 T cells available. Additionally, similar to prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jensen et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Skirecki et al., 2020</xref>), an increased frequency of activated (CD44<sup>hi</sup>) CD4 T cells was observed in CLP hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Importantly, this extended to an increase in the frequency of memory-like CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells among MOG-specific CD4 T cells in CLP hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). This increase in CD44 expression could occur either be through homeostatic proliferation following the severe lymphodepletion that occurs following a septic event or potentially through antigen release due to sepsis-induced tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, even for those cells that do recover in numbers they are phenotypically and functionally distinct, which may further contribute to the differences in EAE disease development and progression following immunization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Loss of autoantigen-specific naive CD4 T cells is the determining factor in sepsis-induced impediment of EAE</title><p>To further delineate the contributions of the sepsis influence directly on CD4 T cells or their environment, we utilized an adoptive transfer system wherein naive MOG-specific, TCR-transgenic 2D2 CD4 T cells were transferred into congenically distinct recipient mice. By having the fixed TCR of the 2D2 cells, the function of the 2D2 cells could be equally assessed between sham and CLP hosts. Mice receiving 2D2 cells 1 day prior to surgery (6 days prior to EAE induction) were part of the ‘pre-transfer’ group. Alternatively, a second cohort of mice received 2D2 cells 4 days post-surgery (1 day prior to EAE induction), a time at which sepsis-associated inflammation has resolved and the immunoparalysis state is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Danahy et al., 2019b</xref>), were in the ‘post-transfer’ group. 2D2 cells in the pre-transfer group are exposed to both the intrinsic and extrinsic changes that sepsis induces. In contrast, the 2D2 cells in the post-transfer experiments were only influenced by the sepsis-induced changes in the environment, such as reduced DC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strother et al., 2016</xref>), reduced capacity to traffic across endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Danahy et al., 2017</xref>), and alterations in the proportion of regulatory CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>). These impairments are all likely to be present in the context of post-septic environment and may influence the development of EAE. Thus, the post-septic environmental factors which influence CD4 T cells can be assessed by transferring cells into the host after the immunoparalysis state has been established. Further, by comparing the pre- and post-transfer cells from sham and CLP mice the intrinsic and extrinsic influences of sepsis can be parsed.</p><p>Thus, to address the intrinsic and extrinsic impact of sepsis on priming of CD4 T cells, 2D2 cell number, proliferation, as assessed by recent proliferation marker Ki67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2018</xref>), and apoptosis, as assessed by presence of active caspase 3/7 (FLICA<sup>+</sup>) and membrane depolarization (PI<sup>+</sup>), were evaluated in the iLN 7 days post-EAE induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>). Notably, cells that were transferred prior to surgery were numerically diminished in CLP hosts relative to sham counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) recapitulating the observations with endogenous MOG-specific CD4 T cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Strikingly, 2D2 cells that were transferred after surgery were numerically equivalent between sham and CLP hosts, suggesting the septic environment (e.g. diminished DC number/function, increased proportion of regulatory CD8 and/or CD4 T cells) did not limit their capacity to expand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Further, the transferred 2D2 cells from all groups had a similar proportion of recently proliferated as well as apoptotic (FLICA<sup>+</sup> PI<sup>+</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d,e</xref>). Given that the post-transfer groups had equivalent cell numbers, proliferation, and apoptosis; these data demonstrate that autoantigen CD4 T cells are not limited by the post-septic environment in their capacity to be primed and expand. Thus, while sepsis notably induces a variety of T-cell-extrinsic immunologic impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Danahy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strother et al., 2016</xref>), these impairments can be overcome in the context of EAE immunization. In addition, there was no observed difference in the expression of several canonical extrinsic death-inducing proteins known to limit the expansion of CD4 T cells (i.e. Fas, FasL, TRAIL) between sham and CLP hosts for either the pre- or post-transfer groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) further supporting the notion that survival differences do not account for the numerical deficit in CD4 T cells exposed to sepsis. Therefore, pre-transfer 2D2 cells proliferate and die equivalently in both sham and CLP hosts, indicating that sepsis does not intrinsically impair the capacity of these cells to proliferate in response to cognate antigen recognition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Sepsis reduces the number of MOG-specific CD4 T cells but not their capacity to proliferate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design: Thy1.2 C57Bl/6 mice were separated into Pre- and Post-transfer groups.

Coinciding with the cellular expansion seen in the iLN, mice that received 2D2 CD4 T cells prior to surgery developed less severe disease than their sham counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b,c</xref>), similar to results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. However, CLP mice that received 2D2 CD4 T cells post-surgery developed equivalent disease as sham counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b,c</xref>). This result demonstrates that a determining factor by which sepsis limits EAE stems from a reduction in number of naive MOG-specific CD4 T cell precursors. Importantly, there was a numerical reduction in the CNS infiltration of both transferred 2D2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>) and endogenous MOG-specific CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>) of CLP mice that received transfer prior to surgery demonstrating that both populations of cells were similarly influenced by the septic event. Conversely, there was not a numerical deficit in 2D2 CD4 T cells when transferred into CLP hosts post-surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>), while the number of endogenous MOG-specific CD4 T cells in the CNS in the same hosts were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g</xref>).

Prior work has established how the sepsis-induced immunoparalysis state negatively impacts a host’s subsequent capacity to control infection/cancer. Yet, the consequence of sepsis on other disease states, in particular autoimmunity, remains poorly defined. Herein, we have characterized the septic impact on the development of an autoimmune disease.</p><p>Although the impact of sepsis on autoimmunity is understudied, the known influences of sepsis on CD4 T cells and their environment provided a pivotal framework to begin interrogating this relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hotchkiss et al., 2001</xref>). Our observation of reduced EAE disease severity in CLP mice, associated with the loss of MOG-specific naive CD4 T cell precursors, further extends the characterization of the immunoparalysis state as being non-permissive to the formation of antigen-specific T cell responses. However, the use of cell transfers may have aided in overcoming the T cell extrinsic factors, such as DC number/function and capacity of endothelia to promote cell trafficking. Therefore, these other factors may still be relevant to autoimmune disease development during the sepsis-induced immunoparalysis state.</p><p>Pivotal to our findings were the enumeration of MOG-specific CD4 T cell precursors and use of TCR-transgenic 2D2 CD4 T cells. With these tools, we established that sepsis diminishes the number of MOG-specific CD4 T cell precursors but does not alter capacity of the surviving cells to proliferate (either by intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms) or promote disease if numerically bolstered. This does not, however, suggest that intrinsic and extrinsic factors are non-consequential to CD4 T cells in individuals that survive a septic event. Rather, this is likely reflective of the system of disease induction used. While a large bolus of antigen and adjuvant in the immunization strategy is likely able to overcome the intrinsic and extrinsic defects observed in other systems, this proven experimental model has given us the ability to further interrogate how the sepsis-induced cytokine storm influences the naive CD4 T cell repertoire and development of autoimmunity.</p><p>In the context of EAE, our findings suggest that the number of MOG-specific naive CD4 T cell precursors is a critical determining factor in the development of disease. The significance of naive myelin antigen-specific CD4 T cell precursors in the development of MS is highlighted by studies showing that genetic and environmental factors influence the MS incidence and severity through modulation of autoreactive naive T cell precursor frequency. Specifically, allelic differences in HLA-expression may influence the development of MS by differential generation of autoreactive naive CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patsopoulos, 2018</xref>). Environmental factors can also influence the precursor frequency either by influencing central tolerance (i.e. vitamin-D-regulated HLA DRB1*1501 expression) or peripheral tolerance (i.e. gut-microbe-regulated Treg frequency and function) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freedman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ramagopalan et al., 2009</xref>). As antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses play a significant role in the pathogenesis of MS, it is plausible that sepsis can modulate the development of MS and/or disease relapses. However, there are no clinical data on the effect of sepsis on the disease development or relapses in patients with MS. Additionally, we observed a numerical recovery of MOG-specific CD4 T cells with time after sepsis in some animals. Yet, the recovered MOG-specific CD4s from CLP hosts may still exhibit inherent differences from MOG-specific CD4s within sham counterparts (e.g. potential reduced avidity of ‘recovered’ cells). Indeed, the acquisition of an antigen-experienced phenotype by MOG-specific CD4 T cells from CLP mice demonstrates one such difference that may influence the function of these CD4 T cells. Auto-reactive T cells from MS patients have several functional differences, including increased survival capacity, distinct transcriptomic profiles, and increased avidity for autoantigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bieganowska et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bielekova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hong et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, evaluating how sepsis alters the survival capacity, transcriptomic profile, and auto-antigen avidity of cells may further define/elucidate novel underlying mechanisms associated with the development of autoimmune disease.</p><p>However, many other prominent questions from the sepsis perspective also remain unanswered. Foremost is the durability of sepsis-induced suppression on the development of autoimmunity and whether the causal impairment remains consistent over that time period. The reduced number of MOG-specific CD4 T cell precursors seems to be a factor at a time proximal to sepsis induction. Additionally, this appeared to extend to the later day 25 timepoint in some mice. A potential explanation for the duality in disease development at day 25 may be the severity of the septic event, though this remains unclear. However, previous work has described how some CD4 T cell precursors eventually recover to pre-sepsis numbers with time, whereas others remain numerically decreased or can even be numerically expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabrera-Perez et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, those cells that had numerically expanded had encountered cognate antigen, so the numerical ‘recovery’ may alternately represent an antigen-specific response due to release of antigen during sepsis-induced cell death. This would be consistent with the increase in CD44 expression by MOG-specific cells. Further, T cells that expand via homeostatic proliferation in lymphopenic states, such as the post-septic environment, can gain an antigen-experienced phenotype and effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamilton et al., 2006</xref>). Along with decreased barrier integrity after sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Honig et al., 2016</xref>), the potential of sepsis promoting autoimmune disease development remains an intriguing alternative to a continuation in the impediment of autoimmunity described here. Yet, given that not all mice develop severe disease this may indicate that at this late timepoint additional and potential novel factors may be at play in the suppression of autoimmune disease development.</p><p>Interrogating the impact of sepsis on other autoimmune diseases, in particular those with different effector cells, rather than the CD4 T cells described here, could provide further robust characterization of the sepsis-induced immunoparalysis state. Characterization of how sepsis also influences cells that function to suppress autoimmune disease, such as CD4 T<sub>regs</sub> which are more resistant to sepsis-induced numerical loss than other CD4 T cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavassani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Monneret et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scumpia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>), would also provide an interesting angle for interrogating the immunoparalysis state. In addition, neuro-regulatory CD8 T cells have recently been described to contribute to protection against EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>). While undescribed in the context of sepsis, the influence of sepsis on these cells may have divergent outcomes for the host. If, similar to CD4 T<sub>regs</sub>, these neuro-regulatory CD8 T cells are more resistant to sepsis-induced lymphopenia this may be an additional mechanism by which autoimmune disease could be suppressed. Alternately, if their function is impaired by sepsis, similar to known impacts on effector CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duong et al., 2014</xref>), this could potentiate or exacerbate disease when precursor loss is not the dominant factor. Another factor to consider is that sepsis alters the composition of the host intestinal microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alverdy and Krezalek, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krezalek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaborin et al., 2014</xref>). Environmental factors that the host experiences, such as the microbiome, account for ~70% of MS disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kuusisto et al., 2008</xref>), and there is growing evidence that the host’s intestinal microbiome actively influences MS disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Freedman et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, interrogation into how the sepsis-induced changes in intestinal microbiota correspond with microbiomes associated with MS may elicit further insight into the interaction between these disease states. Finally, the mechanism/timing of the initiation of other autoimmune model systems should also be a strong consideration as it could inform on different aspects of the immunoparalysis state and generate distinctions between newly developed and established autoimmunity.</p><p>The novel characterization of how infection, in the form of a septic insult, can dramatically influence the development of autoimmunity, presented here, reframes the complexity of the immunoparalysis state. By interrogating the impact of sepsis on inflammatory states beyond infection/cancer, additional mechanisms of sepsis-induced impairment may become apparent. Further, by understanding how sepsis influences these diseases, insights into the mechanisms that underlie their pathologies might also be illuminated. Thus, a final pertinent direction for future study would be to understand the interaction between sepsis and autoimmunity in patient cohorts. While it appears that patients with autoimmunity, and MS in particular, have a higher incidence of sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capkun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nelson et al., 2015</xref>), the reverse scenario is still unexamined at this time. The added burden of sepsis in patients with autoimmunity is likely associated with the inflammatory status of the host, similar to the increased susceptibility of ‘dirty’ mice to a septic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huggins et al., 2019</xref>). However, similar to our results, the immunoparalysis state may, in fact, benefit those patients who survive the cytokine storm by reducing the function of the pathogenic autoreactive cells. Such an outcome would be further instructive in understanding the interplay between autoimmunity and the infectious events (e.g. sepsis).</p></sec><sec id="s4"

the animal facilities at the University of Iowa at the appropriate biosafety level. 2D2 (C57BL/6-Tg(Tcra2D2,Tcrb2D2)1Kuch/J) mice on the C57BL6/J background were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and bred with C57BL6/J (Thy1.1/1.1), purchased from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD), to generate heterozygotes for 2D2 and Thy1.1. F<sub>1</sub> mice were bred together to generate 2D2 Thy 1.1/1.1 and 2D2 Thy1.1/1.2 mice. Expression of the 2D2 TCR and Thy1.1/1.1 were confirmed by flow cytometric staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis induction</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (University of Iowa, Office of Animal Resources), the abdomen was shaved and disinfected with Betadine (Purdue Products), and a midline incision was made. The distal third of the cecum was ligated with Perma-Hand Silk (Ethicon), punctured once using a 25-gauge needle, and a small amount of fecal matter extruded. The cecum was returned to abdomen, the peritoneum was closed with 641G Perma-Hand Silk (Ethicon), and skin sealed using surgical Vetbond (3M). Following surgery, 1 mL PBS was administered s.c. to provide post-surgery fluid resuscitation. Lidocaine was administered at the incision site, and flunixin meglumine (Phoenix) was administered for postoperative analgesia. This procedure created a septic state characterized by loss of appetite and body weight, ruffled hair, shivering, diarrhea, and/or periorbital exudates with 0–10% mortality rate. Sham mice underwent identical surgery excluding cecal ligation and puncture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>EAE disease induction and evaluation</title><p>EAE was induced and evaluated as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mangalam et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, mice were immunized s.c. on day 0 on the left and right flank with 100 µg of MOG<sub>35-55</sub> emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant followed by 80 ng of pertussis toxin (PTX) i.p. on days 0 and 2. Disease severity was scored as follows: 0, no clinical symptoms; 1, loss of tail tonicity; 2, hind limb weakness; 3, hind limb paralysis; 4, fore limb weakness; 5, moribund or death.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell isolation</title><p>Single-cell suspensions from lymph nodes and spleens were generated after mashing tissue through 70-μm cell strainer without enzymatic digestion. To isolate CNS leukocytes, mice were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and quickly perfused through the left ventricle with cold PBS. Brains were removed from the skull and spinal cords were flushed through the vertebral canal with cold RPMI media. To isolate immune cells from the CNS, brain and spinal cords were combined, homogenized, and isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation. Following centrifugation, CNS leukocytes were collected from the interface, washed, and prepared appropriately for further use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology</title><p>Mice were euthanized using CO<sub>2</sub> and intravascularly perfused using a gravity fed system with 10% neutral buffered (10% NBF) formalin via intracardiac puncture. Spinal cords were then emersion fixed in 10% NBF for another 24–48 hr. Spinal cords were left in situ, demineralized with 14% EDTA for ~4 days and then embedded in paraffin and routine processed. Sections (4 µm thick) were stained with hemotoxylin and eosin (H and E) and Luxol fast blue (LFB) and analyzed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. Spinal cord sections were scored for cord pathology and meningeal inflammation. The meningeal score was a 0 to 4 scale where 0 = no pathology; 1 = rare, scattered, mild meningeal inflammatory cell infiltrates; 2 = mild, multifocal and obvious meningeal inflammatory cell infiltrates; 3 = multifocal to coalescing meningeal inflammatory cell infiltrates; 4 = marked, diffuse, thick bands of meningeal inflammatory cell infiltrates. The spinal cord score identifies how much of the cord at that level was affected and was also a 0 to 4 scale where 0 = no pathology; 1 = 1–25% of the spinal cord is affected with pathology consistent with EAE; 2 = 30–50% of the spinal cord is affected with pathology consistent with EAE; 3 = 60–90% of the spinal cord is affected with pathology consistent with EAE; 4 = &gt;90% of the spinal cord is affected with pathology consistent with EAE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Flow cytometry and intracellular protein detection</title><p>Flow cytometry data were acquired on a FACSCanto (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). To determine expression of cell surface proteins, mAb were incubated at 4°C for 20–30 min and cells were fixed using Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution (BD Biosciences) and, in some instances followed by mAb incubation to detect intracellular proteins. The following mAb clones were used: CD4 (GK1.5, Biolegend), CD11a (M17/4, Biolegend), IFNγ (XMG1.2; eBioscience), IL-17A (eBio17B7, eBioscience), TNFα (MP6-XT22, eBioscience), CD8a (5H10-1, Biolegend), Ki67 (B56, BD Pharmingen), Thy1.1 (HIS51, eBioscience), Thy1.2 (53–2.1, eBioscience), CD44 (IM7, eBioscience), CD45 (104, eBioscience), F4/80 (BM8, Biolegend), CD11b (M1/70, eBioscience), IA-b (M5/114.15.2, eBioscience), CD3e (145–2 C11, eBioscience), CD19 (MB19-1, eBioscience), FAS (SA367H8, Biolegend), FASL (MFL3, Biolegend), TRAIL (N2B2, Biolegend), RORγT (AFKJS-9, eBioscience), Tbet (eBio4B10, eBioscience), FoxP3 (FJK-16S, Invitrogen), and Dump [CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418), B220 (RA3-6B2), F4/80 (BM8), BioLegend].</p><p>Enrichment and detection of endogenous MOG-specific CD4 T cells: Biotinylated I-A<sup>b</sup> molecules containing the MOG<sub>40-48</sub> epitope covalently linked to the I-A<sup>b</sup> β-chain were produced in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> S2 cell along with the I-A<sup>b</sup> β-chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moon et al., 2007</xref>). The monomers were purified, and then made into tetramers with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SA-PE; Prozyme). To enrich for Ag-specific CD4 T cells, tetramers (10 nM final concentration) were then added to single-cell suspensions in 300 µl tetramer staining buffer (PBS containing 5% FBS, 2 mM EDTA, 1:50 normal mouse serum, and 1:100 anti-CD16/32 mAb). The cells were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 hr, followed by a wash in 10 ml ice cold FACS Buffer. The tetramer-stained cells were then resuspended in 300 µl FACS Buffer, mixed with 25 µl of anti-PE mAb-conjugated magnetic microbeads (StemCell Technologies), and incubated in the dark on ice for 30 min. The cells were washed, resuspended in 3 ml cold FACS Buffer, and passed through an EasySep Magnet (StemCell Technologies) to yield the enriched tetramer positive population. The resulting enriched fractions were stained with a cocktail of fluorochrome-labeled mAb: Thy1.2, CD4, CD8, CD44, ‘dump’ (CD11b, CD11c, B220, F4/80), and tetramer. Cell numbers for each sample were determined using AccuCheck Counting Beads (Invitrogen).

Your revised article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Upon review of your resubmitted manuscript, the reviewers considered the study to be of interest, the experiments solidly performed, and the manuscript well written. However, major issues remain with your conclusion or the major claim, namely that the lower number of naive T cells following CLP leads to reduced EAE. The reviewers thought that the interpretation of the data is not completely correct as the link between the reduced naïve T cell numbers and reduced disease outcome has not been proven and thus the discussion remains too speculative. In the absence of conclusive evidence, other scenarios, which were not considered, should also be discussed. For example, it is likely that following CLP, a strong pro-inflammatory state arose the mice due to a high production of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF. This could have resulted in a reduced level of MOG-specific T cells but more importantly, it could have led to a general tolerogenic state that temporarily prevented an efficient immune response from occurring. The authors should also consider the possibility that alteration in Treg frequency/function in the post-septic mice, or a difference amongst other cell types such as APCs, or other such factors.</p><p>Another likely interpretation is that the CLP and the massive depletion that followed and led to lymphopenia also caused a general state of tolerance. An expansion of Treg cells that can dominantly inhibit priming of MOG-specific T cells could also be considered. Here, the authors show that the massive T cell killing after CLP partially spared Treg cells as their proportion was increased compared to the effector T cells. Another possibility is that there was an expansion of tolerogenic dendritic cells or the efficiency of the DCs was harmed by CLP.</p><p>Therefore, it has been suggested that the Abstract, Discussion, as well as the title of your manuscript be revised. The changes should reflect the fact that you have not demonstrated that the reason for the diminished EAE is indeed the reduction of naive T cells (unless you can, in fact, provide such data, ruling out alternative interpretations).</p><p>There are other specific questions that arose given the interpretation of the current data. The authors show the group of mice that received 2D2 T cells prior to CLP showed a similar disease reduction as mice that are only immunized without receiving any additional T cells (Figure 1). Even if the number of originally transferred 2D2s (5x10<sup>6</sup>) was reduced after CLP compared to the post-CLP transfer (Figure 6—figure supplement 2), one would still expect to have a significantly increased number of MOG-specific T cells in the system compared to mice that did not receive any T cells. This then casts doubt on the fact that the reduced number of naïve T cells in post-septic mice is the reason for the EAE amelioration. The authors alternatively suggest a potential priming deficit as an explanation for their phenotype, however, they do not follow up on this. They indeed see a reduced frequency of MOG-specific T cells in the draining lymph nodes at day 7 post immunization (Figure 4), but do not explain a potential mechanism.</p><p>1) Figure 1A the very first finding to start off the whole story, shows only up to day 13. This is way too short for evaluating EAE and certainly at the suboptimal quality of its experimental setup. Because of it, EAE with CLP may be just simply delayed, and the authors cannot claim the EAE &quot;ablated&quot; and &quot;Reduction in disease severity.&quot;</p><p>2) Why was CD11a used to gate on T cells? Normally one would gate on a T cell marker such as CD90 or just CD4.</p><p>3) In Figure 3, please show a dot plot for each case (Sham and CLP) for IFNγ versus IL-17A and one of the two versus TNFa, or even better, GM-CSF versus TNFa. FMO can be shown in the Supplementary figure showing the data as histograms is not informative.</p><p>4) What is the gate used in Figure 6E?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55800.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Address experimentally if the number of MOG-specific CD4 T cell precursors persist for longer time in CLP mice, under conditions where EAE is initiated on day 20 or 30 post-surgery on CLP survivor.</p></disp-quote><p>This question is important given that sepsis can lead to long-lasting effects on the host’s immune system. We have added new data demonstrating that at 25 days post-sepsis mice still developed less severe disease than sham controls, although the EAE was more pronounced when compared to day 5 CLP counterparts (new Figure 1B-D). This was potentially due to significant variability in EAE development in individual mice – some mice developed severe disease (similar to the control, Sham mice) while others did not develop robust disease (similar to day 5 CLP mice).</p><p>This new data suggested that numerical recovery of naïve MOG-specific CD4 T cell precursors may occur within this 25 day timeframe, at least in some of the mice. Indeed, when we subsequently quantitated the number of naïve precursors at day 25 post-CLP induction in separate cohorts of mice, we observed that numerical recovery of naïve MOG-specific CD4 T cell pool occurred in some, but not all of the mice (new Figure 5D) leading to statistically insignificant changes in the number of naïve CD4 T cell precursors in both groups of mice at this time point after surgery. However, it is tempting to speculate that this variability in numerical recovery is in agreement with observed variability in disease development (new Figure 1B-D), suggesting that numerical impairment may still control the susceptibility to the disease development and progression. Given that it is not possible to assess the CD4 T cell precursor frequency and the capacity to develop disease in the same mouse this remains as an intriguing correlation.</p><p>Interestingly, we also observed that the naïve MOG-specific CD4 T cells present in the CLP hosts are phenotypically distinct and resemble “antigen-experienced” CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells (new Figure 5E,F). It is unclear whether these cells become antigen-experienced through recognition of cognate antigen released during septic insult and/or due to the well-described phenomenon of homeostatic proliferation in sepsis-induced lymphopenic environment. Thus, changes in the function of MOG-specific CD4 T cells present in sepsis survivors might also contribute to the observed differences in EAE induction, an intriguing notion to be pursued in the future.</p><p>Text that include discussion of these data was modified accordingly throughout the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Apart from the results showing the reduction of CD4 T cells and effector cytokines on day 15 post EAE, please show effector cytokines/chemokines (GM-CSF, IL-12, IL-23, IFNγ, G-CSF, IL-17A, IL-10) levels in the serum of day 0 and day 15 EAE mice.</p><p>Is there a difference in infiltrating inflammatory myeloid cell number in the CNS of EAE induced mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the requested cytokine analysis in the serum and demonstrated sham mice had a distinct signature of cytokine expression following disease (day 15 after EAE induction compared to day 0) which was not mirrored within CLP groups of mice (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Of note: While many cytokines/chemokines did not exhibit significant changes between days 0 and 15 after EAE induction this is in agreement with previous reports describing that the majority of inflammation is localized inside CNS (Pierson et al., 2012 Immunol Rev 248(1); Pareek et al., 2011 Sci Rep 1:201). Consequently, we analyzed the inflammatory myeloid cells in the CNS of sham and CLP hosts. The frequency and number of both microglia and infiltrating monocytes and macrophages were notably diminished in CLP hosts (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-E). This change in frequency/number of myeloid cells was further compounded by a decrease in MHC II expression (both a marker of myeloid cell activation and means of antigen presentation to CD4 T cells) on both of these cell populations (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2F-I).</p><p>Cumulatively, these new data further demonstrate that CLP hosts are severely impaired in their capacity to initiate disease in the CNS. This impairment is in agreement with both the ascribed role of encephalitogenic CD4 T cells as critical initiators of EAE and corresponds to our finding of a reduction in CNS-infiltrating, MOG-specific CD4 T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Include Th1, Th17 and Treg frequency and absolute number in pre- and post-transfer groups.</p></disp-quote><p>New experiments that included pre- and post- transfer groups were performed to address this question. Importantly, we observed a significant numerical loss of all effector populations listed (Th1-Tbet, Th17-RORgT, and Treg-FoxP3) in the pre-transfer group and that decline in numbers is significantly diminished in the post-transfer group, indicating recovery of these CD4 T cell subsets (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2). As an important control, a similar decline in endogenous bulk CD4 T cell populations was observed in pre- and post- transfer groups. These data demonstrate that by overcoming the numerical loss of the MOG-specific CD4 T cells the requisite effector populations needed for EAE disease induction can be generated in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Consider a CLP experiment in 2D2 transgenic mice and transfer activated immune cells to a new host for EAE experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s suggestion for the experiment is insightful and seeks to address intrinsic changes in encephalitogenic naïve MOG-specific CD4 T cells that potentially control the observed lack of EAE induction in CLP hosts. In direct response to this suggestion, we performed sham or CLP surgery on Thy1-disparate 2D2 TCR-Tg CD4 T cell mice and transferred the same number of 2D2 cells (1:1 mix) into Thy1.2 recipients prior to EAE induction (new Figure 7A). The survival of Sham or CLP 2D2 CD4 T cells was indistinguishable as well as their capacity to expand in numbers in draining lymph nodes upon EAE induction (new Figure 7B,C).</p><p>Thus, these data suggest sepsis does not lead to measurable cell-intrinsic deficiencies of naive CD4 T cell precursors to respond to auto-antigen and further supports the concept that sepsis-imposed numerical loss of antigen-specific naïve CD4 T cell precursors control the disease development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Show FAS, TRAIL, FasL expression and apoptotic cells (Annexin and 7AAD) of the transferred group (Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers’ question seeks to address whether the septic environment predisposes encephalitogenic CD4 T cells to apoptosis, thereby limiting their expansion and effector potential. Thus, we evaluated the frequency of apoptotic cells (as assessed by active Caspase 3/7 and propidium iodide staining) in the draining lymph nodes in Sham and CLP mice and found no difference in the frequency of apoptotic cells (new Figure 6E). Further, we evaluated the expression the extrinsic apoptosis-related proteins TRAIL, Fas, and FasL, and noted no difference in the expression of these receptors on CD4 T cells in any of the analyzed groups (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1). These new data, thus, further support our conclusion that the numerical loss of the CD4 T cell precursors in sepsis survivors control diminished accumulation of MOG-specific effector CD4 T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Include histopathology results (Figure 1 E, F, G) for non-surgery mice. These data should be added to determine whether differences exist for spinal cord and meningeal disease between non-surgery mice and the other two groups. Again the effect of anesthesia.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize this represents an additional control for the histopathology; however, we had not performed histopathology on non-surgery mice for the following reasons: a) Constraints imposed by the coronavirus pandemic on the research enterprise at the University of Iowa prevented us from repeating these experiments to include naïve non-surgery mice as controls (specifically, we were faced with the prolonged closure of the critical Core Research Facility needed for histopathology analyses); and b) Sham surgery represents the most relevant control for CLP procedure – please see our extended discussions related to utility of Sham controls under point #8 and in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Provide an in-depth discussion on the relationship between your current findings in the context of understanding MS pathogenesis or autoimmunity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers request to broaden the applicability of our research and have incorporated this Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Present data or at least discuss the potential effects of anesthesia (sham vs. non-surgery groups) on T cell responses. Results on no-surgery groups would be critical to assess the effect of anesthesia on the MOG reactive and non-reactive CD4 T cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that numerous factors associated with surgery may influence subsequent disease outcome. This is why, rather than using non-surgical controls, we utilize Sham surgical controls for the majority of experiments. In particular, the reviewer requests discussion of the influence of anesthesia on T cell responses. In our surgical procedures we use ketamine as an anesthesia and indeed the effect of ketamine on T cell response has been evaluated, including in the context of EAE (Lee et al., 2017). In this study the authors found that increasing concentrations of ketamine, administered in vitro, reduced the capacity of autoantigen-specific CD4 T cells to produce effector cytokines and induce disease. However, this in vitro exposure occurred over the course of several days and does not account for the metabolism of ketamine and excretion through the urinary system (Chang and Glazko 1974 Int Anesthesiol Clin 12(2)).</p><p>Since it is our belief that it is important to control for the potential effects of anesthesia and other aspects of surgery, Sham surgery (with the same surgical procedures as CLP, including anesthesia, though performed without cecum ligation and needle puncture) is the most appropriate and preferred control for these experiments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers thought that the interpretation of the data is not completely correct as the link between the reduced naïve T cell numbers and reduced disease outcome has not been proven and thus the discussion remains too speculative.

The authors should also consider the possibility that alteration in Treg frequency/function in the post-septic mice, or a difference amongst other cell types such as APCs, or other such factors.</p><p>Another likely interpretation is that the CLP and the massive depletion that followed and led to lymphopenia also caused a general state of tolerance. An expansion of Treg cells that can dominantly inhibit priming of MOG-specific T cells could also be considered. Here, the authors show that the massive T cell killing after CLP partially spared Treg cells as their proportion was increased compared to the effector T cells. Another possibility is that there was an expansion of tolerogenic dendritic cells or the efficiency of the DCs was harmed by CLP.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s above commentary broadly reflects the multitude of events that contribute to the sepsis-induced immunoparalysis state. Indeed, all of these events likely contribute to some degree. These potential CD4 extrinsic influences on disease were discussed in the Introduction, Results and Discussion though additional commentary has been included to further emphasize this point.</p><p>Moreover, we experimentally addressed whether the CD4 T cell extrinsic factors may be influencing the development of disease. When we transferred naïve 2D2 CD4 T cells (that did not undergo a septic insult) into mice that either underwent Sham or CLP we observed no difference in the capacity of these 2D2 CD4 T cells to survive, respond to antigen, or promote disease (see post-transfer groups in Figures 6 and 8). If extrinsic factors were restricting the priming of CD4 T cells in the lymph node or preventing induction of disease, then these differences should be observed when comparing post-transfer 2D2 CD4 T cells in Figures 6 and 8 (discussion on reviewer concern about cell transfers is below). We are not suggesting the loss of naïve CD4 T cells is the only mechanism of impairment in the post-septic environment. Rather, our data supports the conclusion that the number of naïve autoantigen-specific CD4 T cells is a critical factor in the development of disease in a model where antigen and adjuvant are abundant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, it has been suggested that the Abstract, Discussion, as well as the title of your manuscript be revised. The changes should reflect the fact that you have not demonstrated that the reason for the diminished EAE is indeed the reduction of naive T cells (unless you can, in fact, provide such data, ruling out alternative interpretations).</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above the transfer of naïve 2D2 CD4 T cells into post-septic hosts demonstrates that the post-septic environment is not constraining CD4 T cells in their capacity to survive, respond to antigen, and elicit disease (Figures 6 and 8). Additionally, the competitive expansion in Figure 7 demonstrates that sepsis does not intrinsically impair CD4 T cell expansion. However, given that we cannot completely rule out all other hypotheses we have modified the text to reflect this request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are other specific questions that arose given the interpretation of the current data. The authors show the group of mice that received 2D2 T cells prior to CLP showed a similar disease reduction as mice that are only immunized without receiving any additional T cells (Figure 1). Even if the number of originally transferred 2D2s (5x10<sup>6</sup>) was reduced after CLP compared to the post-CLP transfer (Figure 6—figure supplement 2), one would still expect to have a significantly increased number of MOG-specific T cells in the system compared to mice that did not receive any T cells. This then casts doubt on the fact that the reduced number of naïve T cells in post-septic mice is the reason for the EAE amelioration.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment does not accurately describe the experiment we performed. No mice that were immunized to induce EAE received 5x10<sup>6</sup> cells. The number of naïve 2D2 CD4 T cells that were transferred was 1000-fold less than the reviewer states. We only transferred 5x10<sup>3</sup> naïve 2D2 CD4 T cells into mice that received immunization. The only group of mice receiving 5x10<sup>6</sup> 2D2 CD4 T cells were those that were non-immunized in Figure 7 to assess the relative survival capacity of 2D2 CD4 T cells derived from Sham and CLP hosts.</p><p>Why is 5x10<sup>3</sup> naïve CD4 T cells close to normal physiology?</p><p>Prior work demonstrated there are approximately 1000 naïve MOG-specific cells within a C57BL/6 mouse (Martinez, RJ, et al. Nat. Commun. 2016 7:13848). Further, our years of experience with adoptive transfer of naïve T cells suggests that the majority of cells do not survive these transfers, with a general notion that only 10% of the transferred cells successfully “take” (i.e., engraft) (please refer to our Immunity Resource article 2007 – 26:847 for further explanations of the TCR-Tg T cell adoptive transfer models). Thus, we anticipate approximately 500 naïve 2D2 CD4 T cells to engraft in the hosts given 5x10<sup>3</sup> cells. Therefore, we do not view the transferred 2D2 CD4 T cells as dramatically increasing the number of naïve MOG-specific cells within the host as the reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors alternatively suggest a potential priming deficit as an explanation for their phenotype, however, they do not follow up on this.

Normally one would gate on a T cell marker such as CD90 or just CD4.</p></disp-quote><p>Why use CD11a?</p><p>CD11a is ubiquitously expressed on T cells. Thus, it is superior to CD4 alone in the identification of CD4 T cells, and permits us to exclude CD4-expressing non-T cells.</p><p>Numerous publications have demonstrated that increased CD11a expression can aid in the identification of antigen-experienced CD4 and CD8 T cells (McDermott, DS, et al. J Immunol 2011 187(11), Rai, D, et al. J Immunol 2009 183(12), Butler, NS, et al. Nat Immunol 2011 13(2)). To date, since our initial description of CD11a as a useful discriminator of those T cells that have responded to cognate Ag and those that did not (naïve), more than 50 groups have adopted this idea to track Ag-specific T cells in response to more than 20 different pathogens/immunizations. Therefore, CD11a is superior to CD90, whose expression is not modulated following antigen stimulation. An example of this utility can be observed in Figure 2E where MOG-specific cells have increased expression of CD11a relative to non-MOG-specific CD4 T cells. Thus, increased expression of CD11a on the MOG-specific CD4 T cells served as an internal assurance of bona fide tetramer<sup>+</sup> MOG-specific CD4 T cells that had encountered antigen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3, please show a dot plot for each case (Sham and CLP) for IFNγ versus IL-17A and one of the two versus TNFa, or even better, GM-CSF versus TNFa.
