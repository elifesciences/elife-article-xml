Activation of the P2X7 receptor leads to opening of the characteristic dye-permeable membrane pore for molecules up to ~900 Da. However, it remains controversial what constitutes this peculiar pore and how it opens. Here we show that the panda receptor, when purified and reconstituted into liposomes, forms an intrinsic dye-permeable pore in the absence of other cellular components. Unexpectedly, we found that this pore opens independent of its unique C-terminal domain. We also found that P2X7 channel activity is facilitated by phosphatidylglycerol and sphingomyelin, but dominantly inhibited by cholesterol through direct interactions with the transmembrane domain. In combination with cell-based functional studies, our data suggest that the P2X7 receptor itself constitutes a lipid-composition dependent dye-permeable pore, whose opening is facilitated by palmitoylated cysteines near the pore-lining helix.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>functional reconstitution</kwd><kwd>purified ion channel</kwd><kwd>proteoliposomes</kwd><kwd>dye uptake</kwd><kwd>cell lines</kwd><kwd>giant panda</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM114379</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawate</surname><given-names>Toshimitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional reconstitution of a mammalian P2X7 receptor uncovers an intrinsic and lipid-dependent dye-permeable membrane pore.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The P2X7 receptor is a trimeric, extracellular ATP-gated membrane channel expressed in many different cell types including immune and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sluyter, 2017</xref>). Activation of the P2X7 receptor, like other P2X receptor subtypes (P2X1-6), allows small cations to traverse the plasma membrane, which triggers various intracellular signaling events such as gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">North, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Habermacher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Virgilio et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, the P2X7 receptor exhibits several unique characteristics. In particular, its activation leads to the formation of a membrane pore that allows molecules up to ~900 Da to permeate upon ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steinberg et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Virgilio, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Surprenant et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alves et al., 2014</xref>). This unique characteristic is supported by a number of experiments from multiple labs where heterologously overexpressed P2X7 receptors in various cell-lines take up organic cations such as ethidium and YO-PRO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Surprenant et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chessell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rassendren et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, macrophages derived from a P2X7 knockout mouse fail to take up dyes after ATP application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Solle et al., 2001</xref>), highlighting that the P2X7 receptor is an essential component of the dye-permeable pore. This P2X7 specific pore has been implicated in multiple physiological and pathological events, including proliferation of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monif et al., 2009</xref>), colitic loss of enteric neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gulbransen et al., 2012</xref>), and development of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sorge et al., 2012</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms of the pore formation remain poorly understood.</p><p>There are two prevailing hypotheses about what actually constitutes the dye-permeable pore. The first one postulates that an ATP-release pannexin1 (Panx1) channel constitutes the pore that opens in response to P2X7 activation. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that (1) P2X7 alone is insufficient to form a dye-permeable pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petrou et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klapperstück et al., 2000</xref>), (2) P2X7 receptor expressing cells open two distinct pores for small and large ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nuttle and Dubyak, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Virginio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faria et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>), (3) heterologously expressed P2X7 receptors in the absence of Panx1 fail to open a dye-permeable pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>), (4) Panx1 inhibitors, but not P2X7 antagonists, block dye uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Locovei et al., 2007</xref>), and (5) P2X7 and Panx1 are co-immunoprecipitated in cell lysates derived from multiple cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Silverman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Poornima et al., 2012</xref>). However, this hypothesis has been challenged by other studies demonstrating that (1) macrophages from a Panx1 knockout mouse normally take up YO-PRO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qu et al., 2011</xref>), (2) Panx1 knockdown or Panx1 antagonists do not affect dye uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alberto et al., 2013</xref>), and (3) ATP actually antagonizes Panx1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qiu and Dahl, 2009</xref>). In contrast to this P2X7-Panx1 complex theory, the second hypothesis postulates that the P2X7 transmembrane domain itself constitutes the large pore, which is established by dilating the small-ion permeable pore upon prolonged or repeated application of ATP. Direct permeation of dyes through P2X7 is strongly supported by the tight correlation between the charge and accessibility of the pore-lining residues and permeability of the permeant dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browne et al., 2013</xref>). Dilation of the P2X7 membrane pore is corroborated based on the observation that a larger cation, N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG; Mw:195 Da), becomes more permeable over time during ATP application in whole-cell patch clamp experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Virginio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yan et al., 2008</xref>). This P2X7 pore dilation theory, however, has also been challenged by other studies demonstrating that time-dependent NMDG permeability is most likely due to a consequence of unintended ion accumulation in whole-cell patch clamp experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, studies using single channel recordings provided compelling evidence that the unitary conductance of the P2X7 receptor remains constant over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Riedel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harkat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pippel et al., 2017</xref>). These studies disagree with the pore-dilation model and suggest that the P2X7 receptor immediately opens a pore that is large enough for NMDG to permeate.</p><p>Setting aside the controversial building block of the P2X7 triggered dye-permeable pore, it has been consistently reported that dye-uptake strictly depends on its unique C-terminal domain (CTD), which exists only in the P2X7 subtype (~250 AA). Indeed, cells expressing C-terminally truncated versions of the P2X7 receptor fail to take up large molecules, while small cations (e.g. Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) remain permeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Surprenant et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rassendren et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheewatrakoolpong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adinolfi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cervetto et al., 2013</xref>). While the primary sequence of the CTD is dissimilar to those of any known proteins, it harbors a number of potential binding motifs for molecules such as β-arrestin, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, calmodulin, and kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denlinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa-Junior et al., 2011</xref>). It has also been suggested to be involved in proper assembly and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Denlinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonnord et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradley et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, there is a stretch of 18 amino acid residues rich in cysteine (six cysteines) located at the beginning of the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), right after the second transmembrane helix. This Cys-rich region (CRR) has been proposed to play major roles in lipid raft association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonnord et al., 2009</xref>), cholesterol binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murrell-Lagnado, 2017</xref>), and channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allsopp and Evans, 2015</xref>). However, it remains unclear why the CTD is required for the formation of the P2X7 dependent pore.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31186.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of deletion constructs of pdP2X7.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of pdP2X7.

Using this system, we discovered that P2X7 alone is sufficient to form a dye-permeable pore, and we showed that the activity of P2X7 depends heavily on the lipid composition. Surprisingly, both the CTD and the N-terminal domain (NTD) seemed indispensable for dye-uptake itself in certain lipid compositions.

To unambiguously determine whether the P2X7 receptor is the conduit for large molecules, we set out to establish an <italic>in vitro</italic> dye-uptake system using proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified P2X7 receptors. We took advantage of the panda P2X7 (pdP2X7) that is ~85% identical to the human P2X7 (hP2X7), mediates YO-PRO-1 (Mw: 376 Da without iodide) uptake in HEK293 cells, and has been successfully purified for crystallization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karasawa and Kawate, 2016</xref>). When expressed in HEK293 cells, truncated versions of pdP2X7 at the N-terminus (ΔN; Δ1–22) or at the C-terminus (ΔC; Δ360–600) diminished the YO-PRO-1 uptake by more than 10 fold compared to the full-length receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). When both termini were truncated (ΔNC), there was no detectable YO-PRO-1 uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Surface biotinylation experiments showed that the expression levels of truncated receptors were comparable or even slightly higher for ΔC, suggesting that the diminished ATP-triggered YO-PRO-1 uptake was due to reduced channel activity but not due to lower surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Current densities from whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed a similar pattern, though the degree of current reduction was only ~50% for ΔN, and both ΔC and ΔNC gave rise to currents that were less than ~10% of the full-length channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that the CTD and the NTD (though to a lesser extent) play important roles in both dye-uptake and small ion permeation in HEK293 cells.</p><p>We subsequently investigated the channel activity of pdP2X7 in proteoliposomes. To assess whether either terminus of pdP2X7 is required for the channel activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, we purified and reconstituted pdP2X7 protein that is truncated at both termini (pdP2X7-ΔNC) into liposomes composed of two commonly used synthetic lipids for ion channel reconstitution (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (POPG)). Orientation of the reconstituted pdP2X7-ΔNC was mostly outside-out, as externally applied recombinant EndoH removed the extracellular carbohydrates attached through posttranslational glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We first examined Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability using liposomes containing a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing fluorescent molecule, Fluo-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When pdP2X7-ΔNC containing liposomes were treated with ATP, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal increased in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The apparent low channel activity of pdP2X7-ΔNC in these experiments is likely due to the diminished concentrations of free ATP (ATP<sup>4-</sup>) resulting from the formation of calcium-ATP complexes. Indeed, EC<sub>50</sub> of the calculated free ATP was 29 μM, which was comparable with that obtained for the crystallized version of pdP2X7 (pdP2X7-cryst; EC<sub>50</sub>: 40 μM) in whole-cell recordings without calcium in the extracellular solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karasawa and Kawate, 2016</xref>). This suggests that the P2X7 receptor, like the P2X2 and 4 subtypes, requires free ATP for its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klapperstück et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2013</xref>). The ATP dose-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake indicates that the reconstituted pdP2X7-ΔNC is functional and both the NTD and the CTD are not required for permeation by small cations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31186.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Reconstituted pdP2X7-ΔNC takes up both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and YO-PRO-1 in liposomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake assay.

In particular, we suspected that a specific kind of lipid present in the plasma membrane may antagonize pore formation. To test this idea, we reconstituted pdP2X7-ΔNC into liposomes that contain the major lipids constituting the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells (termed here as ‘HEK lipids’; 28.5% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 16.5% POPE, 18% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS), 2.25% POPG, 9.75% Sphingomyelin (SM), and 25% cholesterol). In those lipids, uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or YO-PRO-1 by pdP2X7-ΔNC was drastically attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), which was in contrast to the robust channel activity in lipids containing only POPE and POPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The reconstitution efficiency was comparable to that of POPE/POPG liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

SDS-PAGE confirmed that the reconstitution efficiency was comparable to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, only weak YO-PRO-1 uptake activity was observed with the control liposomes composed of 50% POPC and 50% POPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Likewise, we observed similarly low levels of YO-PRO-1 uptake activities with the liposomes containing 50% POPC, POPE, or cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Conversely, when the liposomes contained 50% POPG or SM, YO-PRO-1 uptake was substantially enhanced. POPG especially boosted the YO-PRO-1 uptake by ~7 fold compared to the control. These results suggest that POPG and SM facilitate the activity of pdP2X7-ΔNC and that POPE, POPC, and cholesterol counteract the facilitating action of those lipids. However, POPE is unlikely a dominant antagonist of P2X7, as strong dye-uptake was observed with pdP2X7-ΔNC reconstituted in 75% POPE and 25% POPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). POPC is also unlikely to be a dominant antagonist as the liposomes exhibiting higher levels of YO-PRO-1 uptake (i.e. POPE or SM) also contained 25% POPC. Cholesterol therefore seems to be the dominant antagonist of pdP2X7-ΔNC in the HEK lipids. This is consistent with weak dye-uptake in HEK lipids that contain 25% cholesterol, despite also containing a total of 30% of the P2X7 facilitating lipids (i.e. POPG and SM).</p><p>To confirm the dominant and inhibitory role of cholesterol in HEK lipids, we measured YO-PRO-1 uptake from pdP2X7-ΔNC that was reconstituted into HEK mimetic liposomes containing different amounts of cholesterol. The liposomes without cholesterol showed as strong YO-PRO-1 uptake as the POPE/POPG liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), consistent with the idea that POPG and SM facilitate P2X7 channel activity. As we expected, we observed less dye-uptake as the concentration of cholesterol increased until it reached 15% where the inhibitory effect saturated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The same pattern was observed for Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that the inhibitory action of cholesterol can be seen at a concentration as low as 5% and that the inhibitory effect saturates around 15%. Considering that the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells normally includes ~25% cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dawaliby et al., 2016</xref>), it makes sense why pdP2X7-ΔNC channels hardly open in those cells, resulting in low YO-PRO-1 uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) and low current density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Though cholesterol has been suggested to interact with the intracellular juxtamembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>), other mechanisms must also exist as the intracellular domains are absent in pdP2X7-ΔNC. Because cholesterol is a well-known lipid that structures ordered micro-domains and increases membrane rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hancock, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ikonen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Meyer and Smit, 2009</xref>), we first assessed whether cholesterol antagonizes pdP2X7-ΔNC function by increasing the membrane rigidity. To quantify the membrane rigidity in our proteoliposome-based system, we took advantage of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which gives rise to fluorescence anisotropy as membrane rigidity increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dawaliby et al., 2016</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, DPH anisotropy increased as the concentration of cholesterol increased from 0% to 25% in liposomes composed of HEK lipids. This suggests that cholesterol indeed enhances membrane rigidity in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, no significant fluorescence anisotropy was observed when DPH was incubated with the liposomes enriched with POPC, POPE, POPS, or POPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, the SM-enriched liposome increased the level of DPH anisotropy, indicating that SM also enhances the membrane rigidity. Because SM-enriched liposomes facilitate the channel activity of pdP2X7-ΔNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), this result suggests that membrane rigidity per se unlikely regulates the P2X7 receptor activity. Supporting this, linear regression analysis revealed no significant correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.044) between DPH anisotropy and YO-PRO-1 uptake activity in the absence of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

How does the full-length pdP2X7 escape from the inhibitory effect of cholesterol?

To find out those residues, we systematically mutated each cysteine in CRR and measured YO-PRO-1 uptake in the presence of MCD. Consistent with the dye-uptake experiments using the truncation constructs, the cysteine mutants outside of the first nine amino acids in CRR (i.e. C373S, C374S, and C377S) all showed strong channel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In contrast, the C362S or C363S mutants showed ~40% to 60% less activity than P2X7-ΔNC+CRR. Interestingly, the C370S mutant presented a strong channel activity despite that the truncation of the CRR before this residue (CRRd) reduced the dye-uptake by more than 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). When both C362S and C363S were combined, the channel activity was almost completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These results indicate that none of the individual cysteines were essential, but C362 and C363 play dominant roles in facilitating the P2X7 receptor activity. Indeed, when these two cysteine residues were mutated to serines in the full-length pdP2X7 receptor, no YO-PRO-1 activity was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result was consistent with the C363A mutant of hP2X7, which also showed little dye-uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>). Because the surface expression was unaffected by the C362S/C363S mutations, it is likely that these cysteines play roles in enhancing P2X7 channel opening, rather than affecting trafficking or assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Multiple cysteine residues in the CTD, including the ones in CRR, have been suggested to be posttranslationally modified by palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonnord et al., 2009</xref>).

To test this idea, we analyzed the level of palmitoylation on pdP2X7-ΔNC+CRRc that includes the minimal length of the CRR necessary for facilitating the channel activity in the presence of MCD (i.e. the first nine residues in CRR including C362/C363/C370). We metabolically labeled pdP2X7-ΔNC+CRRc with a palmitic-acid analogue, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA), pulled down using FLAG affinity chromatography, and specifically labeled the attached 17-ODYA with Alexa 488 using click chemistry. This technique has been widely used for detecting palmitoylation of many proteins including the RalA G-protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishimura and Linder, 2013</xref>).

Because the pdP2X7-ΔNC, which is only nine amino acids shorter than pdP2X7-ΔNC+CRRc was not modified by 17-ODYA, it is likely that the cysteine residues in CRRc are indeed palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In combination with the cysteine mutagenesis study, these results suggest that palmitoylation of at least one of the C362, C363, C370 plays an important role in enhancing the P2X7 channel activity.

While numerous studies support that the P2X7 specific CTD is essential for the dye-permeable pore, the role of CTD remains poorly understood. What has also been controversial is whether the P2X7 receptor itself constitutes a dye-permeable pore or indirectly opens other large-conductance channels like pannexin1. In this study, we investigated the channel activity of purified pdP2X7 reconstituted into liposomes in the absence of other cellular components. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrated that pdP2X7 forms a pore independent of either the CTD or the NTD. This result also provides strong evidence that the P2X7 receptor on its own constitutes a dye-permeable pore.</p><p>The reason why previous studies did not detect dye uptake from a C-terminally truncated P2X7 receptor is likely because those studies were based on cell-based systems, which normally include high-levels of cholesterol. Under those conditions, channel activity of a C-terminally truncated P2X7 receptor is strongly attenuated by cholesterol. Indeed, our reconstitution study using mimetic components of the HEK293 cell lipids recapitulated that a C-terminally truncated P2X7 receptor fails to form a dye-permeable pore in the presence of a normal amount of cholesterol (i.e. ~25%); however, removal of cholesterol from those lipids fully recovered the channel activity. We also showed that a C-terminally truncated P2X7 receptor normally functions in cholesterol-deficient Sf9 cells, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been used for studying P2X7 receptor function. These results highlight that the P2X7 receptor does not require the CTD for its channel activity itself, but it does depend on the CTD for counteracting the inhibitory effect of cholesterol.</p><p>Our study is not the first to show an inhibitory role of cholesterol on the P2X7 receptor. Robinson et al demonstrated that MCD treatment substantially enhances hP2X7 mediated dye uptake and that both N- and C-terminal residues are required for such facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, they found that CRR facilitates P2X7 mediated dye uptake, which is consistent with our results. However, it was unclear whether cholesterol directly binds to the P2X7 receptor or indirectly affects its channel activity. It was also unclear whether the transmembrane domain of the P2X7 receptor plays any role for cholesterol-dependent inhibition. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay revealed that cholesterol directly interacts with a P2X7 receptor that lacks both N- and C-terminus, indicating that cholesterol likely inhibits channel activity by binding to the transmembrane helices. We also demonstrated that a cholesterol-dependent increase in membrane rigidity is not the primary mechanism of inhibition, as a P2X7 facilitating lipid SM also increases membrane rigidity. Nevertheless, membrane rigidity does go up as the concentration of cholesterol increases, which makes it difficult to inconspicuously separate these two mechanisms. It would be helpful to identify the cholesterol binding residues for better understanding how membrane rigidity would affect P2X7 receptor function.</p><p>Dye uptake activity in the absence of other channels strongly support that the P2X7 receptor itself constitutes a dye-permeable pore. Also, the immediate and monophasic dye uptake supports that the pore of the P2X7 receptor does not dilate. This is consistent with the recent studies demonstrating that NMDG-mediated currents are readily recorded from P2X7 receptor expressing cells without prolonged or repeated application of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harkat et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, those studies demonstrated that other P2X receptor subtypes including P2X2-4 also give rise to NMDG-mediated currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harkat et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that the ability to open a dye-permeable pore may actually be a common characteristic of P2X receptors. This is consistent with our current study demonstrating that the P2X7 specific CTD is not required for opening a dye-permeable pore. Furthermore, this idea is also supported by the currently available crystal structures, which present similar overall architectures of the ATP-binding extracellular region and the transmembrane channel for the P2X3, 4 and 7 subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kawate et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karasawa and Kawate, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, permeability of a large molecule such as NMDG seems much less than that of a small ion like Na<sup>+</sup>, as suggested by Harkat et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harkat et al., 2017</xref>). This ratio may vary among the different P2X subtypes and the permeability of a large molecule through the P2X7 receptor may be the highest, which could be a reason why the dye-permeable pore has been commonly observed for the P2X7 subtype. Unfortunately, it is technically challenging to compare the permeability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and YO-PRO-1 using our reconstitution system because the resulting fluorescent counts depend on many factors such as quantum yields of fluorophores, fluorescence efficiency, and binding properties between the dyes and their substrates.</p><p>We also demonstrated that extending the C-terminus of pdP2X7-ΔNC by just nine residues almost completely recovers the dye-uptake activity in the presence of MCD. Because this construct (pdP2X7-ΔNC+CRRc) was efficiently labeled with a palmitic acid analogue in HEK293 cells, it is likely that the facilitating function of CRR derives from palmitoylation. Indeed, mutation of the first two cysteine residues in CRR (C362 and C363) rendered the full-length pdP2X7 incapable of dye-uptake, even in the presence of the entire CTD. What is the potential mechanism for palmitoylated cysteine residues in P2X7 channel facilitation? Given that C362 and C363 are located near the end of the second transmembrane helix (TM2), we speculate that acylation of these two cysteines could alter the tilting angles of TM2. Alternatively, palmitoylated cysteines may serve as an intracellular anchor, which may facilitate the movement required for P2X7 channel opening. While these types of regulation have been suggested for ion channels in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nyholm et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shipston, 2014</xref>), the effect of palmitoylation may be particularly strong for P2X receptors, whose membrane pore is one of the simplest with only three pore-lining helices. It is also possible that attached fatty acids may interact with cholesterol bound to the transmembrane helices of the P2X7 receptor, which may reduce the inhibitory effect of cholesterol. A similar mechanism has been proposed for the μ-opioid receptor, whose homodimer may be stabilized through direct interaction between cholesterol and palmitate attached to a nearby cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Though it would be informative to use a reconstitution system for probing how palmitoylated cysteines control P2X7 channel activity, isolation of a palmitoylated P2X7 receptor is technically challenging because such a protein is prone to aggregation in detergents.</p><p>Our reconstitution system allowed us to directly investigate how lipid composition affects P2X7 activity. By systematically testing different types of lipids, we discovered that P2X7 channel opening is facilitated by POPG or SM but not by other common lipids in plasma membrane such as POPC or POPS. Though POPG is a minor component (typically less than 2% of total lipids) for most neuronal and blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gottfried, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornwell et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calderon et al., 1995</xref>), this lipid exists at relatively high concentration (~9%) in alveolar macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sahu and Lynn, 1977</xref>). Considering that macrophages only contain ~8% cholesterol in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sahu and Lynn, 1977</xref>), the inhibitory action by cholesterol is probably weaker in these cells. This is consistent with a number of previous studies reporting the formation of dye-permeable pores in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Steinberg et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hickman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Falzoni et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rassendren et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Solle et al., 2001</xref>). Also, POPG has been shown to be up-regulated in lymphoma cells that overexpress the v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eberlin et al., 2014</xref>). While it is uncertain whether up-regulation of POPG is a common phenomenon for other cancer cells, it provides another potential mechanism for P2X7 receptor hyper-activation, which has been implicated in different types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Virgilio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roger and Pelegrin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adinolfi et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to POPG, SM is a major lipid in the plasma membrane; however, SM content highly varies from cell to cell. For example, red blood cells contain 20–30% SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornwell et al., 1968</xref>) but lymphoblasts contain only 4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gottfried, 1967</xref>). Interestingly, activation of P2X7 receptors have been demonstrated to activate acid sphingomyelinase in microglia, which is responsible for degrading SM in the plasma membrane and triggering IL-1β release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianco et al., 2009</xref>). This negative feedback seems to be an excellent mechanism to control P2X7 receptor activity. Notably, deficiency in acid sphingomyelinase leads to the devastating Niemann-Pick disease that is associated with severe cognitive decline and impaired neuromotor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ledesma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rigante et al., 2017</xref>). Though the exact mechanism remains poorly understood, it is possible that accumulation of SM due to the lack of acid sphingomyelinase activity may hyper-activate P2X7 receptors.</p><p>We should point out that the presented reconstitution experiments are limited to the biochemically stable P2X7-ΔNC. Though reconstitution of WT P2X7 would be informative, it was technically challenging because this protein was unstable and purified mostly as aggregates. Nevertheless, the previous studies by the Murrell-Lagnado group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>) and our cell-based studies using MCD demonstrate that cholesterol also diminishes channel activity of the full-length P2X7. These experiments indicate that the inhibitory effect of cholesterol is not limited to P2X7-ΔNC but also present for the WT P2X7.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the P2X7 receptor harbors an intrinsic dye-permeable pore whose activity depends substantially on lipid composition. Because transmembrane helices of the P2X7 receptor are sufficient for the formation of the dye-permeable pore, it is unlikely that the P2X7 specific CTD constitutes a pore or recruits other pore-forming proteins. The CTD instead facilitates its channel activity through palmitoylated cysteines near the end of the pore-lining helix, which contributes to counteract the inhibitory effect of cholesterol. These novel insights imply that activation of P2X7 receptors considerably varies depending on the host cells, which may be a plausible explanation for inconsistent results from previous functional studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of expression plasmids</title><p>Deletion constructs of P2X7 from giant panda (<italic>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</italic>; pdP2X7; XP_002913164.1) were subcloned into pIE2, pIM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karasawa and Kawate, 2016</xref>) or pIE5 vector that harbors a FLAG tag at the N-terminus.

The beads were washed five times with wash buffer and the bound proteins were eluted at 30°C with 50 μl of elution buffer (PBS, 0.2 mg/ml 3X FLAG Peptide (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1% Triton-X100). Eluted protein was treated with sample buffer with 10 mM TCEP prior to SDS-PAGE. Proteins labeled with 17-ODYA were detected by in-gel Alexa fluorescence at 647 nm using Versadoc MP5000 gel imager (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The total protein was detected by western blotting as described above in ‘Cell surface protein biotinylation.’</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank W Greentree, A Nishimura, and M Linder for technical assistance for the palmitoylation assays.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Grutter (Reviewer #2); Mark L Mayer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There has been longstanding confusion about whether the pore of ATP-activated P2X receptor channels can dilate to allow permeation of large cations such as NMDG or fluorophores such as YO-PRO. The idea that P2X receptors progressively dilate in response to continual activation has recently been challenged by demonstrations from multiple groups that the relative permeability of Na to NMDG remains fixed if the concentrations of intracellular ions remains effectively clamped in whole-cell recordings. Whether larger fluorophores can permeate P2X receptor channels remains controversial, with some groups arguing that they permeate through Pannexin hemichannels. This is a remarkable manuscript showing that P2X7 constructs can be purified and reconstituted into liposomes, and that they provide a permeation pathway for small ions such as calcium, but also for large fluorophores such as YO-PRO. With a biochemically well-defined preparation in hand, the authors go on to examine the influence of lipids on P2X7 activity and find that their mainstay deltaNC construct is robustly inhibited by cholesterol. Moreover, they find that the influence of cholesterol on membrane rigidity is unlikely to explain the inhibitory effects, and they demonstrate binding of cholesterol to their P2X7 construct using fluorescence spectroscopy. They then study a C-terminal Cys rich region (CRR) that when re-introduced into their construct partially counteracts the inhibitory influence of cholesterol, and they identify two key Cys residues within the CRR that seem to be most important. Finally, they demonstrate that one or both of these Cys residues are palmitoylated, which may be involved in counteracting the inhibitory influence of cholesterol. Overall this is an exceptionally high quality biochemical study that unequivocally demonstrates that P2X7 provides a permeation pathway for relatively large fluorophores, and that this receptor can be regulated by membrane components. The following are relatively straightforward suggestions for improving an otherwise superb study.</p><p>1) One reviewer felt that the jump from presenting the results for expression of WT P2X7 and its deletion constructs in HEK cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the preceding text, to the study of proteoliposomes for only the NC deletion construct is awkward. This leaves the reader wondering about the behavior of the WT protein in proteoliposomes. If possible it would be worth presenting data on both Ca and YO-PRO-1 uptake for WT P2X7 reconstituted in liposomes in the second paragraph of the subsection “P2X7-ΔNC alone is sufficient for dye-uptake in proteoliposomes”, as a foundation for the surprising result that the NC deletion construct also shows activity. The rationale for using the deletion construct in most of the experiments is clear, but the modulation of WT channels is also (perhaps more so) important.</p><p>2) The following related point was made by another reviewer. The inhibitory influence of cholesterol is largely interrogated in the context of the deltaNC construct. Although the full-length protein may be biochemically poorly behaved, is there any way to demonstrate that cholesterol also inhibits the full-length protein? If not, the authors may want to take a paragraph in the Discussion to flesh this out and at least point out that MCD enhances the activity of the full-length protein in HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that the inhibitory influence of cholesterol is also present for the wt protein, albeit less robustly when compared to their deltaNC construct.</p><p>3) Have the authors considered testing whether the deltaNC+CRR still binds cholesterol using their fluorescence assay? Seeing a clear shift in apparent affinity would add an additional step in understanding how palmitoylation influence the inhibitory actions of cholesterol.</p><p>4) It would be good to have exemplary data for YO-PRO uptake and current density in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Also the authors should either select a better trace for the full-length construct because the quality of voltage-clamp is compromised by the voltage errors encountered at such high expression. If all the recordings for the full-length construct have similar issues, it would be good for the authors to point out to the reader that the current densities were so much higher for full-length with their expression construct that it was not possible to obtain well-clamped recordings except for the deletion constructs.</p><p>5) The actual composition of different membrane preparations is at times hard to follow. The legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is clear, but the associated text is not. I could not find a clear statement on how membrane composition was varied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>6) The authors should discuss the large difference in apparent affinity for calcium and YO-PRO uptake. Li et al., 2013 PNAS showed that P2X2 receptors require free ATP for activation, and earlier studies have shown that divalents shift the concentration-dependence for activation of P2X7, consistent with this subtype also requiring free ATP. We suspect that some or all of the difference in the apparent affinity for ATP mediated calcium and YO-PRO uptake shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is due to the presence or absence of calcium. The methods provide the solution for YO-PRO uptake but not that used for calcium uptake, but the second paragraph of the subsection “P2X7-ΔNC alone is sufficient for dye-uptake in proteoliposomes” implies that 3 mM calcium was present. If free ATP is required for activation of P2X7, the presence of calcium could probably explain some or all of the difference. It would be good to clarify and use the stability constant for calcium binding to ATP to state the predicted shift between the two solutions used in the assays.</p><p>Also in the aforementioned paragraph: If 3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> attenuates currents induced by ATP in pdP2X7-∆NC, why does it not block Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>? If this is related to changes in the concentration of free ATP in the presence of calcium then this sentence should be modified.</p><p>7) I would recommend replacing 'large pore' throughout the text with something like 'permeation pathway for fluorophores or YO-PRO'. At this point we know the relative permeability of large cations like NMDG is much lower than small ions like sodium, and that the relative permeability of YO-PRO is likely to be much lower still. It’s just that it’s easy to measure accumulation of the fluorophore. Although the permeation mechanism is still mysterious to some of us (and the available structures may be non-native), fluorophore permeation is likely to not involve a pore that is physically large.</p><p>8) In the second paragraph of the Introduction it would be good to also cite Pippel et al., 2017 PNAS 114,E2156-65.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>: One might have expected random orientation of pdP2X7-∆NC following reconstitution into liposomes; that is 50% outside-out and 50% inside-out. However, the authors provide evidence for only outside-out configuration. How is it possible? Alternatively, it is possible that remaining activity of EndoH, even following heat treatment, can still deglycosylate the receptor. One way to exclude this possibility is to show a control experiment in which heat-treated EndoH is added to samples just before SDS-PAGE running.</p><p>10) Subsection “P2X7-ΔNC alone is sufficient for dye-uptake in proteoliposomes”, first paragraph: change to:.… diminished ATP triggered YO-PRO-1 uptake.…</p><p>11) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> why is there an instantaneous jump in YO-PRO-1 fluorescence, followed by a slower rise?

However, we found it technically challenging to study WT P2X7 in our system, as the full-length protein purifies mostly as aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>) and reconstitution efficiency is extremely low. Though the poorly reconstituted WT P2X7 did show weak YO-PRO-1 uptake activity, it was questionable whether the CTD remained structurally intact in these samples. Given that the ΔNC is biochemically stable, we suspect that the poor behavior of WT P2X7 derives from the unstable CTD, which probably promotes protein aggregations through unstructured regions and/or highly acylated cysteine residues.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Both the full-length pdP2X7 and pdP2X7-ΔNC+CRR purify mostly as aggregate.</title><p>SEC traces after thrombin digestion of the full-length (<bold>A</bold>) and ΔNC+CRR (<bold>B</bold>) constructs.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31186-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The following related point was made by another reviewer.

While we have tried to remove the attached acyl group with hydroxylamine and DTT, we failed to prevent aggregation. We also tried supplementing the purification buffer with a higher concentration of glycerol or truncating the CRR down to C370 (i.e. CRRc), but failed to obtain stable species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be good to have exemplary data for YO-PRO uptake and current density in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

We have recorded the full-length P2X7 mediated currents from more than 30 cells, all of which showed compromised currents as represented in the figure.

We also calculated the concentrations of free ATP in our experimental condition using Max Chelator (http://maxchelator. stanford.edu/) and put those numbers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. As pointed out by the reviewer, the EC50 value based on the fee ATP concentrations (29 μM) appeared to be similar to that in YO-PRO-1 uptake assay (21 μM), supporting that free ATP is required to activate the P2X7 channel.
