repertoire. Biological condensates are dense and viscoelastic soft matters instead of canonical dilute solutions. To date, numerous different biological condensates have been discovered, but mechanistic understanding of biological condensates remains scarce. In this study, we developed an adaptive single-molecule imaging method that allows simultaneous tracking of individual molecules and their motion trajectories in both condensed and dilute phases of various biological condensates. The method enables quantitative measurements of concentrations, phase boundary, motion behavior, and speed of molecules in both condensed and dilute phases, as well as the scale and speed of molecular exchanges between the two phases. Notably, molecules in the condensed phase do not undergo uniform Brownian motion, but instead constantly switch between a (class of) confined state(s) and a random diffusion-like motion state. Transient confinement is consistent with strong interactions associated with large molecular networks (i.e., percolation) in the condensed phase. In this way, molecules in biological condensates behave distinctly different from those in dilute solutions. The methods and findings described herein should be generally applicable for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly, dynamics, and consequently functional implications of biological condensates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>multivalent interaction</kwd><kwd>molecular network

separation-mediated formation of condensed macro-molecular assemblies is being increasingly recognized as a general mechanism for cells to form a distinct class of cellular organelles with diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lyon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Compared to the classical cellular organelles that are demarcated by lipid membranes, organelles formed via phase separation either do not associate with or are not enclosed by lipid membranes. Such organelles are referred to as biological condensates or membraneless organelles in the literature (we use biological condensates throughout this article). Formation of biological condensates greatly expands the means by which a living cell compartmentalizes its molecular constituents for specific and diverse functions. Since biological condensates are not enclosed by membranes, molecules within biological condensates can be in relatively fast dynamic exchange with their counterparts in dilute solution without energy input. This possibility constitutes an important basis for numerous unique properties of biological condensates, such as how sharp concentration gradient between the condensed and dilute phases is maintained, how molecules are selected to be included or excluded in the organelle compartment, the mechanisms for regulating organelle formation/dispersion and the rates at which these processes can take place, etc., that are distinct from those of membrane-enclosed organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fare et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lyon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shin et al., 2017</xref>). Research into the formation and function of biological condensate has gained extensive interest in recent years. Nonetheless, the burgeoning field is still in its infancy. Even fundamental physicochemical principles for the assembly of biological condensates, including the role of liquid–liquid phase separation, are under active investigations and vigorous debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McSwiggen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Musacchio, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pappu et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Molecules within biological condensates can be massively concentrated. For example, proteins can be concentrated by more than 10,000 folds upon chromatin condensate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gibson et al., 2019</xref>). In cell peripherals such as synapses in neurons, phase separation can concentrate numerous proteins into postsynaptic densities by &gt;1000-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). A fundamental task in biological phase separation research is to understand how molecules in the condensed phase behave and function. The existing biochemistry and biophysics theories that have been guiding our understandings of molecular behaviors and their interactions in living cells for many years in the past are mainly developed for molecules in dilute solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cantor and Schimmel, 1980</xref>). A biological condensate formed via phase separation is more of a condensed soft matter system, thus theories dealing with dilute solutions are not expected to be generally adequate for condensed molecular systems. Due to extreme complexities of molecular constituents (i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids), molecular compositions (i.e., each functional biological condensate often contains hundreds or more different types of molecules), and broad range of interaction modes (e.g., very large dynamic ranges of binding affinities and molecular valency, different levels of cooperativities, etc.) of biological condensates in cells, currently available theories in soft matter physics and polymer chemistry, though extremely useful, are likely not sufficient to be directly adapted to characterize biological condensates in a simplistic manner. Accordingly, extensive efforts are being made to better understand physics principles underlying the formation of biological condensates. Quantitative approaches have been developed to study properties of biological condensate in vitro and in living cells (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abyzov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hubatsch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taylor et al., 2019</xref> for a few examples). Super-resolution and single-molecule tracking-based methods are used to characterize the biophysical properties of biological condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garcia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guilhas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kent et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muñoz-Gil et al., 2022</xref>). Theoretical and computational studies have also provided valuable insights into physical principles governing biopolymer-mediated condensate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertrand and Lee, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bremer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cinar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Espinosa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farag et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou, 2021</xref>), including—but not limited to—approaches addressing how the phase separations of disordered protein regions are governed by their amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Das et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dignon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harmon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Joseph et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McCarty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tesei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wessén et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Against this backdrop of exciting recent advances, here we address several foundational aspects of biological condensates’ assembly and dynamics by developing an adaptive super-resolution imaging-based method that can simultaneously and robustly monitor and quantify motion properties of individual molecules in dilute and condensed phases of biological condensates formed in solution or on lipid membranes. In addition to directly visualizing motion trajectories within and between phases, this method affords direct measurements of diffusion parameters of each molecule in the dilute and condensed phases. Unexpectedly, we observed that molecules in the condensed phase spend a very large fraction of time in transient motion-frozen state. Such temporary motion freeze exists in various biological condensates and is likely a consequence of the presence of specific and multivalent interaction-mediated large molecular network formation (i.e., percolation) in condensed phases. This observation is of fundamental significance because it is intuitively clear that motion property changes due to formation of biological condensates can fundamentally alter action mechanisms and cellular functions of biomolecules.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Localization-based super-resolution imaging of phase separation</title><p>In an earlier study, we introduced a localization-based single-molecule tracking experiment to study motion properties of proteins in the condensed phase of in vitro reconstituted active zone condensates formed on two-dimensional supported lipid bilayer (SLB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2019</xref>).

To overcome this dilemma, we utilized dSTORM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van de Linde et al., 2011</xref>) to obtain a large number of stochastically emitted single-molecule tracks in both condensed and dilute phases by sparse labeling proteins with photo-switchable dyes (in this case by labeling NR2B with 1% Alexa 647). TIRF illumination mode was used to detect protein signals on SLB so that signals from molecules not tethered to the membrane were minimized.</p><p>The PSD mixtures formed noncircular condensed phase on SLB with around or less than 1 μm in size, but conventional TIRF images could only provide fuzzy phase boundaries at this scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>]). The same area was then first photo-bleached by a high laser intensity and then imaged with a moderate laser intensity optimized for the fluorophore lifetime lasting for 3000 frames with an exposure time of 30 ms per frame, resulting in a high-resolution image containing ~100,000 individual localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom). The overall phase boundary did not undergo obvious change during the imaging process as the shapes and boundaries of the condensed droplets in the system remained essentially the same (i.e., the stacked single-molecule images in the lower panel can be nicely superimposed to the TIRF image acquired at the beginning of the imaging session; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Due to the stochastic nature of fluorophore switch on and off, the reconstructed super-resolution image could be treated as static molecular distributions of labeled molecules in both dilute and condensed phases. Based on this super-resolution image, we could define those areas that have higher localization densities as condensed phase regions, and the rest as dilute phase regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The resulting phase boundary could be clearly visualized for each condensed region. Comparing the average localization densities in the condensed and dilute phases, we could estimate the partition coefficient of 60.8 ± 1.6 for NR2B (i.e., NR2B was enriched into the condense phase by ~61-folds). The calculated NR2B enrichment derived from the super-resolution imaging study was close to the value obtained by a bulk fluorescence imaging-based method shown in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). We noted with interest that the distribution of NR2B in the condensed phase is not homogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating possible formation of nanodomain-like clusters within the condensed phase. The existence of nanodomain-like NR2B clusters in the condensed phase is supported by autocorrelation function analysis of NR2B distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Simultaneous single-molecule tracking in different phases</title><p>The localizations obtained from dSTORM images contained information about distributions as well as mobilities of molecules in both phases. However, the diffusion mode and densities of molecules are very different in condensed and dilute phases. A striking feature is that molecules tend to experience transient confinement in the condensed phase (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We developed an adaptive single-molecule tracking algorithm that could automatically and robustly define optimal search ranges for molecules in different phases, and the method could effectively minimize the global assignment errors in tracking molecules in both condensed and dilute phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’ for extended description of the algorithm). Briefly, phase boundaries were determined initially by densities of localizations. A default search range (500 nm) was used to assign all localizations into tracks in both condensed and dilute phases. Diffusion coefficients of NR2B in both dilute and condensed phases were estimated for determining optimized search range for different phases in subsequent analyses. The initial roughly estimated overall diffusion coefficients of NR2B in condensed phase and dilute phase are 0.22 μm<sup>2</sup>/s and 0.57 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively (see analyses below).

With this method, we could directly record events of molecules entering into and escaping from the condensed phase as well as switch motions of molecules converting between a confined state and a mobile state in the condensed phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The number of NR2B molecules entering into and escaping from the condensed phase was equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), a finding that is consistent with the bulk equilibrium state of the PSD condensate. Interestingly, NR2B molecules within the condensed phase spent a large proportion of time in the confined state and molecules could switch between the confined state and the mobile state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). No confined state could be detected when only NR2B was tethered to SLB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The above result indicated that NR2B in the condensed phase did not undergo homogeneous diffusion motions as one might expect for molecules in certain crowded condensed phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Condamin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Höfling and Franosch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Woringer and Darzacq, 2018</xref>). Instead, the motions of NR2B in the condensed phase resemble previously studied crowded and confined systems with transient caging/trapping dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharjee and Datta, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weeks and Weitz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wong et al., 2004</xref>). Comparisons with data from a set of model experimental systems of FUS-Shank3 chimeric proteins (see Figure 4) suggest that the transient kinetic trapping of NR2B (transiently remaining very close to a stationary position, i.e., very slow diffusion) in the PSD condensed phase is likely due to its relatively strong binding to certain parts of a percolated PSD network with slow dynamics. Accordingly, NR2B molecules in the condensed phase are expected to undergo subdiffusive motions. Indeed, our single-molecule tracking data of NR2B motion in the condensed PSD phase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> for an example) fits well with typical behaviors of subdiffusion (see below and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berezhkovskii et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouchaud and Georges, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Condamin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Netz and Dorfmüller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saxton, 2007</xref>). We also imaged motions of NR2B in the PSD condensates formed in 3D solution at single-molecular resolution and found that, in the condensed phase, each NR2B molecule spent a large proportion of time in the confined state in a manner similar to that for the 2D case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The histogram of NR2B displacement tracks in the condensed PSD phase has a dominant peak with very small displacements, corresponding to the large proportion of time NR2B spends in a confined state or an ensemble of confined states. In contrast, a small and relatively flat shoulder tailing the main peak represents the small proportion of time NR2B is in a mobile state or an ensemble of mobile states moving with larger displacements during the same given time interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A1</xref>). Fitting the histogram with a single population of NR2B undergoing Brownian motion could only cover the confined state peak of molecule but not the high-displacement tail of this distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C1</xref>). By comparison, in the dilute phase, the overall displacements of NR2B are much larger as well as broader, and there is no prominent peak at very small displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A2</xref>). Nonetheless, the displacement histogram of NR2B in the dilute PSD phase still cannot be described entirely by simple Brownian diffusion of a homogeneous NR2B population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C2</xref>), though a simple Brownian diffusion is a better approximation in this case, suggesting a likely presence of multiple populations/states of pre-percolated NR2B/PSD protein complexes even in the dilute phase, a feature that would be in line with recent observations that some subsaturated solutions of condensate-forming biomolecules are not featureless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kar et al., 2022</xref>). However, in a control system with only NR2B tethered to SLB (i.e., no addition of any other PSD proteins), the histogram of NR2B displacements can be reasonably fitted by a simple diffusion model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dynamic parameters and a diffusion model for an equilibrium state phase separation system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Displacement distribution of tracks in the (<bold>A1</bold>) condensed and (<bold>A2</bold>) dilute phases.

This initial analysis is motivated fundamentally by the clear observation of a dichotomy between the coexisting relative immobile NR2B and mobile NR2B molecules in the imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In this approach, the model parameters to be extracted include the diffusion coefficients for presumed simple diffusion of NR2B molecules in transiently confined and mobile states (<italic>D</italic><sub>c</sub> and <italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub>) and the switching probabilities between the two states (P<sub>mc</sub> and P<sub>cm</sub>). Maximum likelihood methodology was used to estimate the parameters iteratively, and the parameters converged quickly after several thousand iterations of optimization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). The resulting best-fit diffusion coefficients in the presumed mobile and confined states were, respectively, <italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> = 0.167 ± 0.002 μm<sup>2</sup>/s and <italic>D</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.0127 ± 0.0001 μm<sup>2</sup>/s. The switching probabilities between these presumed states were P<sub>mc</sub> = 82.8% ± 0.3% (mobile to confined states) per frame and P<sub>cm</sub> = 3.8% ± 0.1% (confined to mobile states) per frame. The confinement ratio (P<sub>c</sub>) in this type of models, defined as the percentage of time that a molecule spends in the confined state, could in general be calculated in the model by the two switching probabilities as P<sub>c</sub> = P<sub>mc</sub>/(P<sub>mc</sub> +P<sub>cm</sub>). For NR2B in the present model for PSD condensates, P<sub>c</sub> = 95.6%. The mobile ratio, defined as the percentage of time that a molecule spends in the mobile state, could then be calculated as P<sub>m</sub> = 1-P<sub>c</sub> = 4.4%. Assuming further that molecular motion in the dilute phase may be described as a first approximation by a simple diffusion process, a diffusion coefficient of the molecule in the dilute phase could be estimated by fitting the mean square displacement (MSD) values as a function of time (i.e., using the equation MSD = 4<italic>D</italic>t based on simple diffusion for the fitting). At the same time, an overall generalized diffusion coefficient for NR2B in the condensed phase may also be estimated by fitting the MSD with a subdiffusive model of MSD = 4<italic>D<sub>α</sub></italic>t<sup>α</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Metzler et al., 2014</xref>). The fitted diffusion coefficient of presumed simple diffusion of NR2B in the dilute phase of the present PSD condensate is 0.47 ± 0.12 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, which is close to that of NR2B alone tethered to SLB (0.61 ± 0.04 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The quantitative similarity of these two estimated diffusion coefficients is particularly striking in view of the much lower diffusion rate reflected by the overall generalized diffusion coefficient for subdiffusion of NR2B in the PSD condensed phase (<italic>D<sub>α</sub></italic> = 0.014 ± 0.001 μm<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>0.74</sup> with <italic>α</italic> = 0.74 ± 0.03; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The generalized diffusion coefficient <italic>D<sub>α</sub></italic> contains different contributions from both confined and mobile states of the NR2B molecules in the condensed phase (as manifested by the fact that α ≠ 1). When the confinement ratio is large, this generalized diffusion coefficient will naturally be dominated by slowing-down effects of the confined state and therefore significantly differ from the diffusion coefficient in the mobile state. The expected general trend of variation of overall diffusion speed with confinement ratio on 2D SLB is illustrated by the Monte Carlo simulation results for the simple two-state model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Physical picture and a two-state, two-phase diffusion model for equilibrium and dynamic properties of PSD condensates</title><p>The above model with HMM-estimated parameters is thus based upon three simple diffusion processes, namely, the confined- and mobile-state diffusion processes in the condensed phase and a single simple diffusion process in the dilute phase. To assess whether such a simple model, at least as a first approximation, can provide a reasonably adequate description of our experimental observations, we next developed a corresponding physical model based on multiple simple diffusion processes to describe a phase separation system based on the aforementioned parameters estimated by HMM from our adaptive single-molecule tracking data. Intuitively, in view of the experimental evidence for two vastly different time scales for condensed-phase dynamics as characterized by the motions of NR2B molecules, the energy landscape experienced by an NR2B molecules is expected to exhibit features depicted schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>. In this tentative physical picture, confined states are associated with deep energy wells, whereas mobile-state molecular motions are affected by smaller variations in both attractive and repulsive interactions (range of variations ~2<italic>ε</italic>, with <italic>ε</italic> &lt;&lt; confined-state well depths). Owing to the inherent complexity of condensed phase structure and energetics, these wells are envisioned to have different depths in general, thus the properties of the ‘confined’ and ‘mobile’ states are understood to be ensemble averages. Under appropriate conditions wherein the condensed-phase mobile-state potential energy variations are approximately equally divided between attractive and repulsive interactions relative to the dilute-phase baseline (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), a simple relationship between steady-state equilibrium condensed mobile-state and dilute-phase populations (governed by Boltzmann factors exp( ± <italic>ε</italic>)) and the effective diffusion coefficients in the two populations can be obtained from a correspondence between the Kawasaki acceptance criteria for Monte Carlo moves (~exp( ± <italic>ε</italic>)) and dynamic behaviors governed by the Smoluchowski equation for diffusion on a potential surface with position-dependent interaction energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang and Chan, 2012</xref>).

Since this kinetics-estimated EF is very close to the equilibrium value of ~61 derived independently from experimentally observed localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we regard <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> as empirically validated for the present PSD system, although the relationship between kinetic and thermodynamic properties of diffusive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2018</xref>) can be rather complex in general for rugged energy landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zwanzig, 1988</xref>). It follows that the above physical picture based on three simple diffusion processes with a confined and a mobile state for the condensed phase does provide a viable rationalization for our experimental tracking data. In our analysis below, the simple relation in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> serves to connect the microscopic kinetic variables (diffusion coefficient and mobile ratio) to macroscopic observables (enrichment fold), allowing for the simulation of large differences in molecular density between condensed and dilute phases without explicit consideration of free energy and Boltzmann factors. Consider a small region near the phase boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The dilute phase contains sparse and fast-moving molecules. The condensed phase contains dense and slow-moving molecules that can be further categorized into either in a mobile state or a transiently confined state. Because we did not observe any obvious hindrance against motions when molecules cross the phase boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), the energy barrier at the interface between the condensed and dilute phases is likely not large in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brangwynne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feric et al., 2016</xref>), though diffusion barriers at phase boundaries were reported in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peng and Weber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Strom et al., 2017</xref>). The simple approximate relation in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> then allows us to take the number of molecules crossing the boundary from one side to the other as being proportional to the diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> or <italic>D</italic><sub>d</sub>) and the molecular density (σ<sub>c</sub> or σ<sub>d</sub>) of the initiating side such that the equilibrium density difference across the boundary can be maintained by the steady-state condition that the flux of molecules from the dilute phase to the condensed phase is equal to the flux in the opposite direction.</p><p>To assess the self-consistency of the above-described diffusion model, we conducted simulations of molecular motions from homogeneously mixed state toward a phase-separated equilibrium state by using a 2D simulation box of size 15 × 30 μm<sup>2</sup> with stationary phase boundaries from our experimental observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and periodical boundary conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As described in ‘Materials and methods’ under the heading ‘Equilibrium simulation of coexisting phases and confined/mobile states,’ diffusion coefficients for the simulated molecules in the condensed phase (<italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> for mobile state only, confined-state molecules are assumed to be stationary for simplicity, i.e., <italic>D</italic><sub>c</sub> → 0) and in the dilute phase (<italic>D</italic><sub>d</sub>), the mobile ratio, and the mobile state lifetime (derived from switching probability) of the molecule in the mobile and confined states in the condensed phase were used as simulation input (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A Monte Carlo algorithm was used to simulate the dynamics of a total of 50,000 molecules diffusing in the box for 100 s for each given condition. The EF between condensed and dilute phases along the simulation trajectory was determined accordingly. Every simulated system eventually reached equilibrium. As a test of the pertinent principles, we first considered a set of input parameters with expected EF values (from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) equal to 30, 60, or 120. The resulting steady-state EFs in the final equilibrium state under each simulated condition came very close to the kinetic-estimated value provided by the approximate relation in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> (≤5% difference; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). While the precise reason for the small mismatches between expected and simulated remains to be ascertained, they likely arise from the irregular shapes of the experimental phase boundaries and therefore single Monte Carlo steps may traverse both the dilute and condensed phases even if the starting and end points of a step is in the same phase. When the experiment-based, HMM-estimated <italic>D</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.47 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, <italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> = 0.17 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, P<sub>mc</sub> = 0.828, P<sub>cm</sub> = 0.038 (per 30 ms), and thus P<sub>m</sub> = 4.4% values (see above) were applied to the same Monte Carlo setup, it yielded a simulated EF = 62.2 ± 0.3 (uncertainty based on 10 independent runs with different random seeds), which is practically identical to the EF value of 62.8 estimated by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>.

For example, because mobile-state diffusion in the condensed phase is envisioned to be governed by a more rugged energy landscape than that in the dilute phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), the effective diffusion coefficient for the mobile state in the condensed phase (which in principle can be derived from the underlying energy landscape) is expected to be smaller than that in the dilute phase. This is indeed the case experimentally. Nonetheless, although concentrations of molecules in the condensed phase are much higher than those in the dilute phase, the diffusion coefficient for the mobile fraction of molecules in the condensed phase may not be dramatically different from that in the dilute phase (<italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> = 0.17 μm<sup>2</sup>/s vs. <italic>D</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.47 μm<sup>2</sup>/s), indicating that the landscape governing mobile-state diffusion in the condensed phase is only moderately rugged. In the two-state picture, it is obvious that the fraction of time that a molecule spends in the mobile state vs. the confined state can dramatically influence the macroscopic properties of the molecule in the condensed phase. For instance, in the present perspective based on two simple diffusion processes in the condensed phase, NR2B spends over 95% of the time in the confined state in the PSD condensate. Accordingly, the overall generalized diffusion constant of NR2B in the condensed phase is small at <italic>D<sub>α</sub></italic> = 0.014 μm<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>0.74</sup> instead of 0.17 μm<sup>2</sup>/s estimated for the mobile NR2B fractions in the condensed phase. Additionally, the EF of a molecule into the condensed phase upon phase separation is also dominantly reflected by the fraction of time molecules spent in the mobile state vs. that in the confined state. As we will demonstrate below experimentally, the binding affinity between molecules in the phase separation system and the molecular network complexity in the condensed phase determines the fraction of the time that a molecule spends in the mobile state vs. confined state as well as the enrichment of molecules in the condensed phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Classification of molecular displacements without presuming simple diffusion models</title><p>It should be emphasized that while quantitative aspects of this two-state perspective of condensed-phase NR2B dynamics were initially deduced by using an HMM assuming two simple diffusion processes, the observation of a general separation of time scales into roughly a low-mobility (L) confined state and high-mobility (H) mobile state in the model PSD condensate is intuitive (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) and can be quantified without presuming simple diffusion. This is showcased by a ‘model-independent’ formulation we developed here to classify experimental displacement steps based on a criterion on the correlation of the magnitudes of consecutive displacement steps in each experimental track. As detailed in ‘Materials and methods,’ we found that the magnitudes of displacements d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> of consecutive steps (experimental time frames) in condensed-phase NR2B are correlated, indicating clearly the process is not simple Brownian diffusion. Analysis of conditional displacement distributions (subsets of overall distribution) based on putative demarcation values (d<sub>b</sub>) for d<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> suggests that d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm provides a reasonable classification of displacement steps into two broad classes, namely a low-mobility (L) state and a high-mobility (H) state that correspond roughly to the above HMM-deduced confined and mobile states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The dynamic complexity of the PSD condensed phase is underscored by the observation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D1 and D2</xref> that the displacement distributions of both the L and H states exhibit deviations from simple Brownian diffusion, with the deviation more appreciable for the H states, which are better fitted by a Lévy distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Viswanathan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, as a first approximation, L-state and H-state motion can be reasonably fitted by two separate simple diffusion process to provide a semi-quantitative description of our experimental data. In this simplified framework, the confined (L) state distribution was interpreted as caused by detection error, whereas the mobile (H) state was described approximately by a simple Brownian diffusion process with diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> = 0.044 ± 0.05 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>). As specified in ‘Materials and methods,’ the corresponding confined and mobile ratios and switching probabilities between the two motion states were readily obtained, with the mobile ratio P<sub>m</sub> = 13.5%. Together with the dilute-phase <italic>D</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.47 μm<sup>2</sup>/s estimated above, the EF estimated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> is EF ≈ <italic>D</italic><sub>d</sub>/ P<sub>m</sub><italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> ≈ 79. Applying these parameters (instead of HMM parameters) to the above-described Monte Carlo simulation using experimental phase boundaries yielded an EF value of 76.2 ± 0.6. In view of the aforementioned approximate nature of the fitted simple diffusion process for mobile-state motion and that the <italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> and P<sub>m</sub> values estimated from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> are appreciably different from those estimated by HMM, the EF value of ≈76 from the present model-free, correlation-based consideration is seen as reasonably close to the experimental value of EF ≈ 61, thus attesting to the robustness of the physical picture that NR2B diffusion in the PSD condensates is roughly separable into two dynamic time scales. However, as stated above, the confined state and the mobile state each likely represents a combination of many substates due to complex molecular network formation in the condensed phase. The nature of these substates deserves further experimental investigations and more refined theoretical modeling in future studies.</p><p>In any event, taking all the above experimental data and computational analysis together, we now have a workable physical picture for molecular diffusion in the equilibrium state of a phase separation system. Our conceptual framework explicitly connects a set of measurable microscopic molecular motion properties with the observable macroscopic parameters of molecules in the system. The experimental method and the theoretical models developed above are robust and simple to implement. They should be useful for analyzing biomolecular phase separations in general.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dynamic molecular networks in condensed phases</title><p>Motions of molecules or molecular complexes in many dilute solutions are well described by simple diffusions. In sharp contrast, the present observations indicate that NR2B molecules in the PSD condensates formed on SLB and in 3D solution spend a very large proportion of time in the immobile/confined state, suggesting that PSD condensates form some sort of very large and thus essentially immobile molecular network (a process known as percolation in associative polymers including biopolymers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harmon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Winnik and Yekta, 1997</xref>) capable of trapping NR2B transiently. Since molecular processes such as molecular interactions, chemical reactions, etc., require molecules to be able to collide with each other, phase separation-mediated immobilization of biomolecules in condensed phases can have huge implications on numerous fundamental properties of these molecules (e.g., binding kinetics, catalytic speed and specificity of enzymes, spatial distributions in cellular subcompartments, etc.).</p><p>Therefore, we next asked how such network-like structure might form and what factors determine network stability in the condensed phase of a biological condensate. We hypothesized that a phase-separated system driven by multivalent and strong inter-molecular interactions, such as the PSD condensates studied here, would likely form highly stable and larger molecular network in the condensed phase. Accordingly, molecules bound to the network might be considered as immobile or confined by the network. In contrast, molecular networks in the condensed phase formed by weak but also multivalent molecular interactions (e.g., intrinsic disordered region [IDR]-mediated phase separations) would be more dynamic and the network would also more transient (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for a scheme). One might envision that the molecular networks formed in the condensed phase could locally break or reform as molecules within the network could still undergo binding and unbinding processes. Thus, the molecular networks formed in condensed phases are dynamic and heterogeneous. The fraction of time that a molecule stays on the network is correlated with its binding affinity (i.e., the off-rate of the molecule from the network, a value directly related to the dissociation constant of the binding) and avidity (a combination of the available binding sites in the vicinity of the molecule, a parameter related to valency of the molecular interactions in the system and the binding affinity of each individual binding site) between the molecule and the network.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Immobilization of molecules by the large dynamic molecular network in the condensed phase of phase-separated systems.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrations of the concept of stable molecular networks in the condensed phase formed by strongly favorable specific and multivalent interactions (left, blue) versus dynamic molecular networks in the condensed phase formed by relatively weak multivalent interactions (right, gray).

On SEC column, GB1-tagged PrLD (theoretical M.W. 37.0 kDa) was eluted at a molecular mass corresponding to a monomer when the loading concentrations of the proteins were at as high as 100 μM (blue curve, measured MW 34.3 ± 0.5 kDa) or 300 μM (green curve, measured MW 35.0 ± 0.9 kDa) in panel (<bold>A</bold>). To rule out potential impact of the GB1 tag on FUS PrLD interaction, we cleaved the GB1 tag. We took the advantage that tag-cleaved FUS PrLD was stable and monodispersed in solution for up to ~10 hr before phase separation occurs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), so we performed SEC-SLS assay of FUS PrLD with the GB1 tag freshly cleaved. The theoretical MW of tag-free FUS PrLD is 22.3 kDa. The measured MW for the tag-free FUS PrLD at the loading concentration of 100 μM (blue curve, measured MW 21.8 ± 3.5 kDa) or 300 μM (green curve. measured MW 20.9 ± 1.1 kDa) also corresponds to the monomer state of the protein in panel (<bold>B</bold>). As a control, the PrLD-SAMWT fusion protein (theoretical MW 80.7 kDa) was eluted as an oligomer and its elution volumes were heavily dependent on the loading concentrations (loading concentration at 30 μM, blue curve, measured MW 165.0 ± 0.4 kDa; loading concentration at 150 μM, green curve; measured MW 265.0 ± 0.4 kDa) (panel <bold>C</bold>). We also adopted a thermodynamic-based binding assay using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We titrated 300 μM FUS PrLD (either without or with the GB1 tag cleaved) into 30 μM FUS PrLD in the reaction cell. Again, the ITC-based assay showed that nearly no detectable interactions could be observed between FUS PrLD (panels <bold>D, E</bold>).

The PrLD of FUS is a well-characterized IDR protein capable of phase separation by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). The SAM domain of Shank3 can specifically interact with each other in a head-to-tail manner forming large polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baron et al., 2006</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the PrLD-SAM chimera contains a weak and multivalent interaction domain and a specific and multivalent interaction domain within one protein. The PrLD-SAM chimera could undergo phase separation at very low concentrations (see below), so we ‘caged’ the chimera with highly soluble maltose binding protein (MBP) at its N-terminus and a small, highly soluble protein GB1 at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The resulting ‘caged’ protein could be purified and concentrated to as high as 500 µM. Cleavage of the caging tags of caged PrLD-SAM with HRV-3C protease induced phase separation of the protein. Substitution of Met1718 of the Shank3 SAM domain with Glu dramatically weakens the head-to-tail interaction of the domain and the mutant SAM domain (SAMME) has very weak propensity of forming oligomers in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baron et al., 2006</xref>). We also created a ‘caged’ PrLD-SAMME chimera to investigate the impact of weakening specific interaction on the molecular network formation in the condensed phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Lastly, we used the FUS PrLD only to investigate the property of the molecular network in the condensed phase that is solely formed by an IDR sequence with only weak multivalent interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Again, we ‘caged’ FUS PrLD at both of its termini with GB1, so that the caged PrLD can be purified in its native form and concentrated to very high concentrations without phase separation. We further demonstrated that the binding between FUS PrLD is indeed extremely weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on our conceptual framework discussed above, we predicted that the molecular networks in the condensed phase formed by PrLD-SAMWT would be the largest and most stable followed by PrLD-SAMME, and the molecular network of the PrLD condensed phase should be the most dynamic.</p><p>We first compared the threshold concentrations of the three proteins for phase separation to occur. Phase separation of each protein was induced by mixing 1 µM HRV-3C protease and immediately injecting the digestion mixture into a sealed, home-made chamber incubated at 20°C. All caged proteins were completely digested within ~30 min after addition of HRV-3C protease. However, the phase separation of PrLD or the PrLD-SAMME chimera took up to 12 hr to occur (i.e., with very slow nucleation rates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we compared DIC images of the three cage-cleaved proteins captured at 12 hr after addition of HRV-3C protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The PrLD-SAMWT chimera underwent phase separation at concentration as low as 1 μM. In contrast, the threshold phase separation concentrations for PrLD-SAMME and PrLD were much higher (~150 μM and ~250 μM, respectively). These results demonstrate that specific and multivalent interactions act in concert in the PrLD-SAMWT condensate, and such multivalent interactions can dramatically lower the threshold concentration of phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Espinosa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We then compared the motion properties of the three proteins in the condensed phase by applying the adaptive single-molecule tracking and HMM method developed above. A concentration somewhat higher than the phase separation threshold was used for each protein (i.e., 50, 200, and 300 μM for PrLD-SAMWT, PrLD-SAMME, and PrLD, respectively). Each protein was very sparsely labeled with Alexa 555 (0.02% for PrLD-SAMWT, 0.005% for PrLD-SAMME, and 0.005% for PrLD) to obtain sparse but long lifetime (&gt;1 s) single-molecule tracks. It is clear that in the condensed phase the motion properties of PrLD-SAMWT are dramatically different from those of PrLD-SAMME and PrLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). HMM analyses of experimental data indicate that PrLD-SAMWT molecule spent most of their time (74.0 ± 3.7%) in the transiently confined state, though these molecules were able to switch between the confined and mobile states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, the mobilities of PrLD-SAMME or PrLD in the condensed phase were much higher. PrLD-SAMME spent 98.1 ± 1.8% of time in the mobile state and PrLD spent 99.6 ± 0.4% in the mobile state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These findings indicated that PrLD-SAMWT molecules in the condensed phase likely formed a very large but still dynamic molecular network due to the presence of specific and multivalent SAM-SAM interaction. In contrast, the molecular networks in the condensed phase formed solely by weak and multivalent interactions were probably much smaller and much more dynamic. Interestingly, the HMM-estimated diffusion coefficients of PrLD-SAMWT and PrLD-SAMME in their mobile state were very similar (0.18 ± 0.05 μm<sup>2</sup>/s vs. 0.19 ± 0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), indicating that PrLD-SAMWT and PrLD-SAMME have similar effective molecular sizes in their mobile state. The mobile state of both proteins likely corresponds to each molecule not bound to the large, essentially immobile molecular networks in the condensed phase. The diffusion coefficient of the mobile state of PrLD is estimated by HMM to be 0.36 ± 0.04 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and the molecular weight of PrLD is about half of PrLD-SAMWT and PrLD-SAMME, again suggesting that the mobile state of PrLD likely corresponds to the network-unbound form of PrLD. Taken together, the above single-molecule tracking study of our designed FUS PrLD systems buttressed our general hypothesis that strong multivalent interactions tend to lead to formation of large and more stable molecular networks in the condensed phase, which could dramatically reduce the overall motions of the molecules in the condensed phase. Most prominently, proteins that bind to these large and stable molecular networks no longer conform to free diffusion processes found in dilute solutions. Instead, in such condensed phases, proteins switch between immobile/confined states and more freely diffusive states, corresponding respectively to the network-bound and relatively free forms. By comparison, in condensed phases formed by weakly interacting IDR sequences, the molecular networks in the condensed phase are much more dynamic/transient and likely much smaller in spatial extent, thus resulting in IDR proteins displaying simple diffusion-like behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) in phase separation systems</title><p>FRAP assays are widely used to examine dynamic properties of phase separation systems. Quantitative theory for analyzing FRAP results in phase separation systems based on Flory–Huggins theory have been developed for weak interaction systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hubatsch et al., 2021</xref>). For heterogeneous condensed phase systems, traditional FRAP experiment might not be a good way to test the liquid-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McSwiggen et al., 2019</xref>). As we have shown above, motion properties of molecules in the condensed phase are radically different for systems involving strong and specific multivalent interactions compared to the system with only weak interactions. Seeking a better understanding of the general trend, we simulated FRAP properties of several different model phase separation systems pertinent to our experiments using representative diffusion coefficients (provided in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) in a manner similar to the test runs reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

To address this question by simulation, the diffusion coefficients of the molecules were set to 0.01 μm<sup>2</sup>/s and 1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively, for the condensed and dilute phases. The mobile ratio was set at 100% (i.e., simulating FRAP curves for a phase separation system dominated by weak multivalent interactions). This setting leads to 100 times enrichment of the molecule into the model condensed phase. The ROIs with a radius of 0.5 μm were selected at the center of the three different sized droplets (ROI 1, 2, 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The simulated results showed that the apparent recovery curve for ROI 3 was considerably slower than the first two ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), as all molecules in ROI 3 needed to diffuse from the dilute phase into the entirely bleached condensed phase. This simulation indicates that one should select condensed phases with similar sizes when comparing FRAP curves of related phase separation systems. When possible, always select a small ROI within a large droplet for FRAP analysis.</p><p>We next simulated FRAP curves for the model phase separation systems containing specific interactions. We first set the mobile ratio of simulated molecules in condensed phase at 10%, with average lifetime of the confined state being 10 s. To maintain the same apparent diffusion coefficient and the same enrichment level in the condensed phase as those in the system with no molecular confinement described above, the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in the mobile state within the condensed phase was chosen to be 0.1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s. We simulated the FRAP curves for the same three ROIs as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Although the FRAP recovery speed for ROI 3 was still slower than the other two ROIs, the difference became smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further increasing the lifetime of the confined state to 100 s while keeping other parameters unchanged led to linear-like slow recovery curves and the differences among the three ROIs were further diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In an extreme case where the lifetime of the confined molecules was infinitely long (i.e., extremely strong binding resulting in behaviors similar to those of unrecoverable aggregates), all three recovery curves looked similar with a fast recovery speed toward their maximal recovery level at 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These simulations suggest that the property of the molecular network in the condensed phase can have dramatic impact on its FRAP recovery rate in the system. For example, a slow recovery speed from a FRAP experiment does not necessarily mean that all of the molecules in condensed phase move slowly. Instead, it may mean that a fraction of molecules spend most of the time bound to an essentially immobile molecular network with very slow dynamics. Once switched into the mobile state, molecules can diffuse quite freely and rapidly.</p><p>The above physical picture revealed by our simulation data are supported by experimentally measured FRAP curves of the three-phase separation systems shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. A small ROI with identical radius within a relatively large, condensed droplet was selected for the FRAP experiments in each of the three systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The PrLD system showed the fastest recovery speed, and the PrLD-SAMME system showed a slightly slower recover speed. The PrLD-SAMWT system, with its large and stable molecular network in the condensed phase, displayed a very slow and near linear recovery curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition to the simulations of model systems in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref> with diffusion coefficients and mobile ratios selected a priori, we further simulated the FRAP curves of the three systems using the diffusion coefficients and confinement ratios derived experimentally from the single-molecule tracking data (i.e., the parameters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). The simulated FRAP curves were overall very similar to those obtained experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G vs. F</xref>), notwithstanding a faster recovery rate in the simulated curve vs. the experimental curve for the PrLD-SAMWT system that is likely due to overestimations of the mobile ratio of the protein in the tracking experiment. Taken together, the above theoretical and experimental studies revealed that the FRAP curve of a molecular species in a phase separation system is heavily influenced by the proportion of time of the molecules that are transiently trapped in the confined state, a parameter directly linked to the strong and specific multivalent interactions of the system. Accordingly, a low recovery rate in the FRAP assay does not necessarily mean that a large fraction of molecules in the condensed phase is permanently immobile.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we developed a method that can track single-molecule motions in both condensed phase and dilute phase simultaneously by using photo-switchable dye-labeled proteins. To accommodate the heterogeneity of both the distributions and diffusion modes of molecules in the condensed and dilute phase, an adaptive single-molecule tracking algorithm was developed by setting the optimized search range for molecules with different diffusion coefficients. The method is simple and highly robust. It can be deployed to track single-molecule motions of phase separation systems with very broad dynamic ranges including highly dynamic systems formed by intrinsically disordered proteins or very stable (or highly percolated) systems formed by strong and likely structure-specific multivalent molecular assemblies such as PSDs. With implementations of sparse labeling techniques such as the HaloTag labeling system or photo-convertible fluorescent proteins like mEos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Inavalli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Los et al., 2008</xref>), our method can be applied to track single-molecule motions of biological condensates in living cells.</p><p>Applying this technique to PSD, the most notable direct experimental finding from our study is that molecules in the condensed phase of biological condensates do not exhibit simple diffusion behaviors as those observed in dilute solutions. Instead, molecules appear to constantly switch between a broadly construed transient confined state and a broadly construed mobile state in the condensed phase. The general features of this phenomenon are clear from our raw tracking data. Here, semi-quantitative accounts of this discovery are provided by an HMM as well as an analysis that does not presume a particular model of diffusion and is based only upon the correlation of consecutive displacements. This two-state-like phenomenon of condensed-phase motion is most likely underpinned by phase separation-mediated formation of large and percolated molecular networks. The size and dynamic properties of the molecular network in the condensed phase are necessarily determined by the binding affinity (or affinities) and valence of the interaction(s) of the molecule(s) in the phase separation system, a trend that has been recently predicted by theoretical simulations treating biomolecules as associative polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harmon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pappu et al., 2023</xref>) and illustrated by the model PrLD-SAMWT system examined here. The fraction of time and the time duration that a molecule spends in the confined state is also determined by the binding affinity of the molecule to, the complexity, and the dynamic properties of the network. For biological condensates assembled largely by strong and specific molecular interactions (including condensates formed with combinations of strong molecular interactions with IDR sequence-based weak interactions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2022</xref> for more discussions), molecules in the condensed phase spend most of their time in the confined state. Since the fraction of time and the time duration that a molecule spends in the confined state vs. those in the mobile state are basic defining parameters for the functions of molecules in any reaction systems (e.g., binding/unbinding rates, kinetics of enzyme catalysis, lifetime/dwelling time a molecule in a molecular machinery, etc.), our finding reveals a fundamental aspect of molecular properties created by biological condensates that is distinctly different from that in dilute solutions. In this regard, our study implies further that, in principle, virtually unlimited types of biological condensates with very broad dynamic network properties may form by utilizing existing repertoires of proteins and nucleic acids via different combinations of binding affinities and interaction valences. In this light, phase separation-mediated formation of biological condensates is further revealed to be a very powerful means indeed for cells to form numerous subcellular organelles with a continuum of dynamic and material properties ranging from very dynamic, dilute solution-like assemblies to highly stable, solid-like systems. Confinements of molecules in cellular condensates have been observed by single-molecule tracking experiments recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miné-Hattab et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Niewidok et al., 2018</xref>). However, since the molecular compositions of cellular condensates cannot be easily defined, the mechanistic bases underlying the confined state of molecules in these cellular condensates are difficult to be discerned. Single-molecule tracking experiments using the reconstituted and compositionally defined phase separation systems in the current study allowed delineation of the mechanism underlying the unique motion properties of molecules in the condensed state.</p><p>We have demonstrated that a two-motion-state model can provide a semi-quantitative rationalization of our experimental data and, at the same time, offer a conceptual framework for their physical interpretation. Indeed, such a two-motion-state picture is well motivated by direct experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Nonetheless, given the inherent complexity of biological condensates, it is intuitive to recognize that molecules in the condensed phase corresponding to a biological condensate would most likely have multiple motion states due to the heterogeneity of intra-condensate interactions (cf. schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). With this in mind, the two motion states in our simple two-state model for condensed-phase dynamics should be understood to be consisting of multiple substates. For instance, one might envision that the percolated molecular network in the condensed phase is not uniform (e.g., existence of locally denser or looser local networks) and dynamic (i.e., local network breaking and forming). Therefore, individual proteins binding to different subregions of the network will have different motion properties/states. It follows that molecular motions in the percolated condensed phase likely cover a continuum of mobilities, although the confined- and mobile-state diffusion coefficients deduced from our experimental measurements based on the two-state model do represent two important time scales of intra-condensate dynamics of PSD. In light of this basic understanding, the ‘confined state’ and ‘mobile state’ as well as the derived diffusion coefficients in this work should be understood as reflections of ensemble-averaged properties arising from such an underlying continuum of mobilities. Further development of experimental techniques in conjunction with more refined models of anomalous diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Joo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kuhn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muñoz-Gil et al., 2021</xref>) will be necessary to characterize these more subtle dynamic properties and to ascertain their physical origins. It will also be interesting to explore a possible relationship between our multiple-mobility model and the phenomenon of motility-induced phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cates and Tailleur, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Since the interactions between molecules can be modulated via numerous cellular processes such as posttranslational modifications, protein biogenesis/turnovers, epigenetic modification, cellular milieu alterations, etc., the dynamic network properties and consequently the functions of organelles formed via phase separation may be regulated in ways that are distinctly different from those occurring in dilute solutions. Compared to the rich knowledge and quantitative theories for dilute-solution systems, few satisfying theoretical frameworks have been established for the condensed assemblies formed via phase separation in cells (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref> and refs therein), partly due to our poor understandings of microscopic motion properties of molecules in the condensed phase. The dramatic dynamic and material property differences of condensates formed by weakly associative intrinsically disordered proteins and by biomolecules with strongly favorable specific interactions involving folded domains indicate that biological phase separation research that focuses primarily on IDRs has only touched the tip of the iceberg. Much knowledge awaits discovery by placing more emphasis on the diverse roles of strong, structure-specific interactions and their synergy with relatively weaker IDR interactions in the assembly, dynamics, and ultimately the physiological functions of biological condensates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Constructs for expression of Trx-His-GCN4-NR2B, PSD-95 (UniProt: P78352-1), Shank3 (UniProt: Q4ACU6), GKAP (UniProt: Q4ACU6-1), and Homer3 (UniProt: Q9NSC5-1) were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>).

Traditional single-molecule tracking in high-density systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>) usually set a global search range (step limit) manually to connect molecular tracks. A step limit that is too small will cause lots of missing connection for molecules with fast diffusions, whereas a step limit that is too large will cause lots of false positive connections for molecules with slow diffusions. Such errors cannot be fixed in post-tracking data analysis. A biological condensate system typically contains a condensed phase with slow-diffusing molecules coexisting with a dilute phase with fast-diffusing molecules, and molecules in the condensed phase constantly switch between mobile state and confined state. A single global maximum step limit without any prior knowledge might not be suitable for tracking molecules in a phase separation system. A typical solution for motion switch is to use the HMM to fit a diffusion model that contains diffusion coefficients (<italic>D</italic>) and switching probabilities (P) for different diffusion states (S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Das et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Persson et al., 2013</xref>). Taking all of the above factors into consideration, we developed a new algorithm by adaptively choosing potentially different maximum step limits for different diffusion states to link the localizations into tracks and using HMM to fit a two-state diffusion model in the condensed phase.</p><p>The track assignment errors can be divided into two parts, true negatives (TN) and false positives (FP). A true negative error is defined as an existing track was not linked, which leads to misses of long-distance steps.

We could roughly estimate the diffusion coefficients by displacement distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>) starting with a default search range (500 nm). We then moved on to find an optimized search range and use this optimized search range to complete the final track assignments (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>We have verified the above theoretical formulation for obtaining an optimized <italic>R</italic> (search range) by simulated molecular systems undergoing homogeneous Brownian motions with different diffusion coefficients and densities (details for these simulations are described under different subheadings below). For systems that are similar to our 2D PSD system, simulation showed the same converged optimal <italic>X</italic> at ~2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). We simulated many other conditions with different molecular densities (<italic>N</italic>) and diffusion speeds (RMSD) in both dilute and condensed phases, and all showed a similar optimal <italic>X</italic> of ~2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).

The measured diffusion coefficients for the MBP-GCN4 dimer, trimer, and tetramer are very close to 1/2:1/3:1/4, which are precisely the expected theoretical ratios for the three proteins on SLB. Thus, this test set of experimental data supports that our developed algorithm is robust in adaptively determining the diffusion coefficients without any prior knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Correlation-based classification of high- and low-mobility displacement steps without presuming simple diffusion</title><p>Because presumption of a motion type such as a combination of simple Brownian diffusions may artificially introduce an unwarranted separation of time scales and other possible biases, we developed a model-independent approach to analyze our experimentally determined displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). To gain quantitative physical insights into NR2B molecular motion within the condensed phase, we consider a total of 2522 experimental trajectories that are configured entirely in the condensed phase (i.e., no transition to the dilute phase) and each consists of at least 10 steps (i.e., 11 positions). The total number of displacements d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> in this set of trajectories is 41,854, with an overall distribution P(d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) shown by the black curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>. To probe the extent to which NR2B motion in PSD condensed phase deviates from simple diffusion, we divided the experimental displacement into two classes, namely d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &lt; d<sub>b</sub> and d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &gt; d<sub>b</sub>, using a boundary or demarcation d<sub>b</sub> between small and large displacements (an optimized value of which is to be determined; note that there is no d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> = d<sub>b</sub> for the d<sub>b</sub> values we considered) and then obtained two conditional distributions of displacements P(d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub>|d<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &lt; d<sub>b</sub>) and P(d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub>|d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &gt; d<sub>b</sub>) for d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic><sub>+1</sub> given that the preceding displacement d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is, respectively, less than or larger than d<sub>b</sub> (see, e.g., the blue and orange histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref> for d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm). If overall condensed-phase NR2B motion were a simple diffusion process, the distribution of displacement of a given step should be independent of the displacement of the previous step and thus the two conditional distributions should be identical; but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref> demonstrates that the two conditional distributions are significantly different, indicating once again that condensed-phase NR2B motion cannot be described as a simple diffusion process.</p><p>This observation from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref> suggests that we may, as a first approximation, attempt to classify condensed-phase NR2B motion into a low-mobility (L) and a high-mobility (H) states by using a demarcation d<sub>b</sub> that results in maximal difference between the low- and high-mobility conditional displacement distributions. Here we use the overlap coefficient (denoted OVL) to quantify the L-H difference in conditional displacement distribution. In general, OVL is a measure of how much two distributions overlap, viz., <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thickmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic>P</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) and <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) are the distributions of interest (i.e., OVL is the area of the overlapping region of the two distributions; see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Song et al., 2017</xref>). We computed OVL among the overall displacement distribution, the L and H conditional displacement distributions and found that the OVL between the H and L conditional displacement distributions reaches its minimum (i.e., with maximally difference) at around d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We therefore adopt d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm as a workable demarcation between low- and high-mobility states of NR2B motion in the model PSD condensate. This classification is illustrated by the example provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>. In general, among a set of ~40 randomly selected experimental trajectories we inspected in detail, a classification using d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm appears reasonable although in some cases some of the relatively short displacements are slightly longer than 60 nm. We may then proceed to use d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm to resolve the overall displacement distribution into a low-mobility (L) component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D1</xref>) and a high-mobility (H) component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D2</xref>). As shown in the figure, the L-component distribution may be reasonably fitted (albeit with some deviations, see below) to a simple-diffusion functional form with a parameter <italic>s</italic> = 13.6 ± 3.7 nm, where <italic>s</italic> may be interpreted as a microscope detection error due to imaging limits or alternately expressed as <italic>s</italic> = <italic>D</italic><sub>L</sub>t with <italic>D</italic><sub>L</sub> = 0.006149 μm<sup>2</sup>/s being the fitted confined-state diffusion coefficient and t = 0.03 s is the time interval of the time step between experimental frames. (The HMM-estimated confined-state <italic>D</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.0127 μm<sup>2</sup>/s corresponds to <italic>s</italic> = 19.5 nm.) If we fit the H-component distribution to a simple diffusion process, the best-fitted diffusion coefficient for the mobile state is <italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> = 0.044 ± 0.05 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D2</xref>). Although a Lévy distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Viswanathan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) for displacements in anomalous diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouchaud and Georges, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Joo et al., 2020</xref>) offers a clearly superior fit (orange curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D2</xref>) and should be explored for more detailed analysis of the H- as well as L-component displacement distributions in future studies, it suffice for our present purpose to limit our discussion of condensed-phase motion largely to a combination of simple diffusion processes depicted by the fitted blue curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D1 and D2</xref> . In that case, with the confinement ratio (P<sub>c</sub> = 86.5%) and mobile ratio (P<sub>m</sub> = 13.5%) provided directly by the number of displacements classified as ‘L’ and ‘H’ in accordance with a d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm demarcation, the combination of the two fitted simple diffusion processes is seen to provide a reasonably good approximation to the overall distribution of condensed phase NR2B displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D3</xref>). Switching probabilities from mobile to confined state (P<sub>mc</sub> = 0.59/frame) and from confined to mobile state (P<sub>cm</sub> = 0.09/frame) can also be readily determined from the number of H→L and L→H transition events based on the same confined/mobile (L/H) classification using d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm. Notably, the fit to the overall condensed-phase displacement distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D3</xref> is superior to that provided by the HMM-estimated two-state parameters (quality of the latter fit, with RMSE = 184.9, is comparable to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C1</xref> ). Because the HMM applied above seeks to optimize quantitative description of both displacements and switching probabilities while under the constraints imposed by the presumption of two simple diffusion states, its ability to accurately capture the distribution of displacements is likely limited despite its utility for estimating diffusion parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Generating simulated homogeneous and heterogeneous molecular systems</title><p>Molecules distributed homogeneously both in condensed and dilute phases were generated based on the Monte Carlo method to simulate localizations obtained in single-molecule tracking experiments.

molecules within biomolecular condensates. Consistent with the emerging idea that condensates are not simple, purely viscous, Newtonian fluids, the authors find that the motions of molecules reveal intrinsic inhomogeneities switching between trapped and more mobile states that suggest the existence of at least two – possibly more – states within condensates. The data appear to be consistent with the formation of percolated networks within condensates – a finding that is likely to be general to other systems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81907.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Pappu</surname><given-names>Rohit V</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01yc7t268</institution-id><institution>Washington University in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.20.500769">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500769v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers agree that the observations provide potentially important new information, but three specific concerns have been raised.</p><p>1) Is the parsing into weak, non-specific interactions driven by IDRs and strong, specific interactions driven by folded domains real or a trope? The authors propose that this is their belief. However, the specificity of interactions within IDRs, including the FUS system has been well established via the stickers and spacers framework. Conformational heterogeneity engenders conformational and hence concentration fluctuations. These effects are neither weak nor non-specific. This view is shared by the editor and reviewer 1. Therefore, instead of the artificial partitioning and the unsubstantiated claim that the network is small, it is better to update this perspective based on numerous recent contributions. Please see https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-021-00840-w, and https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.21.492916v2 as examples. The key point is that the canonical expectation is of shear thinning behavior in viscoelastic materials that have terminal viscous behaviors. Therefore, the issue is not about weak non-specific vs. strong, specific interactions, but more about the modes of motions accessible to folded domains vs. IDRs. Motions of the latter have been discussed extensively by the Schuler, Best, and Blackledge groups, and these motions span a spectrum of timescales and length scales, which explains the observations reported here, as opposed to the binary classification offered up by the authors and in the biochemical literature.</p><p>2) Reviewer 1 raises important issues regarding the simplicity of the 2-state model and the apparent cyclic nature of the parameterization, fitting, and analyses. Please respond constructively and completely to all the points raised by reviewer 1. A specific question that comes to mind from the comments of reviewer 1 is why won't a single stretched exponential with at least one less parameter than currently used provide an equivalent description of the data? One can imagine this will be true. And if so, how does something like a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function compare to the current approach?</p><p>3) Reviewer 2) raises several important points about the imposition of diffusive motions on the analysis. What are the criteria used to adjudicate in favor of diffusion and hence two diffusive processes? Further, the review notes that there are numerous accounts of caging that are described in the physical literature that is highly relevant in the current context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Overall, the manuscript should review the relevant literature in the Introduction (at least to some extent) and evaluate the novelty of its own method based on this review. Some specific points are discussed below:</p><p>(p. 3) We need references for the sentence &quot;The existing biochemistry and biophysics theories that have been guiding our understandings of molecular behaviours and their interactions in living cells in the past are mainly developed for molecules in dilute solutions.&quot; Indeed, there are very few references in the Introduction, which I don't think is appropriate.</p><p>(p. 3-4) There are several works trying to quantify the properties of condensates. For example, see 10.1016/j.bpj.2019.08.030 and 10.1038/s41467-020-19476-4; see also a recent review 10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00774.</p><p>(p. 3-4) Also, there have been attempts to use super-resolution microscopy to track individual proteins (especially in vivo). I think that they should be introduced and appreciated. For example, see 10.1126/science.aar4199 and 10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.034.</p><p>2. (p. 6) The authors assume that the phase boundaries are unchanging throughout their measurement. Is it justifiable?</p><p>3. (p. 6) They claim to estimate the diffusion coefficients of NR2B. Can they provide the values?</p><p>4. The two-state model, assuming trapped and mobile states of molecular diffusion, is a simple and powerful model, but I don't think it necessarily reflects real physics. In my opinion, it is equally likely that the molecules have three or four possible states, or even a continuum of mobility, as the distributions (Figure 3) do not show any &quot;distinct&quot; peaks. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>5. Figure 3A1 and 3B: the authors conclude that a simple diffusion model is a &quot;bad&quot; fit for Figure 3A1 while it explains Figure 3B well – but are they really different? R2 is even better for Figure 3A1 (0.97 vs. 0.91).</p><p>6. In their model, they use the &quot;switching probabilities,&quot; which in my opinion is not necessary. In a dynamic equilibrium (as in the plateaus of Figure 3C and 3D), the system should be in a quasi-static state, where we can simply assume two diffusion behaviors even without considering their exchange. Can we simply use a linear combination of two simple diffusion distributions to fit the data?</p><p>7. I am also curious about the performance of the HMM. How much does it improve the fitting? Can the authors provide the fitting results?</p><p>8. (p. 8) The authors claim that the diffusion coefficient of NR2B in a mobile state in the condensed phase and that of NR2B in the dilute phase are &quot;very close,&quot; but the reported values are ~0.47 μm2/s and ~0.61 μm2/s. The authors should clarify in what sense they are very close to each other.</p><p>9. (p. 8) The authors mention that they did not observe any obvious hinderance against motions when molecules cross the phase boundaries (and hence assume that the flux is simply the diffusion coefficient multiplied by molecular density), but there are reports on the diffusion barrier at the boundaries (see 10.1038/nature22989 and 10.3390/ncrna5040050). In my opinion, the barrier makes sense, as the surface tension will break the symmetry between one side and the other side of the boundary. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>10. (p. 9) The theoretical value for the enrichment fold is 62.8 and its experimental value is ~61, which may look astonishing, but the &quot;theoretical&quot; value is not calculated from scratch. It is based on the parameters that fit the data, so I think it is unsurprising that they obtain very similar values. I would be surprised if there was a big discrepancy.</p><p>11. (p. 9) Again, they report the &quot;remarkable&quot; similarity between the diffusion coefficient for the mobile fraction in the condensed phase and that in the dilute phase, but I think the difference (0.17 vs 0.47 μm2/s) can be considered significant, depending on your perspective.</p><p>12. The authors conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the simulated enrichment fold. Is it just for validation of the analytical formula? (If this is the case, I don't think it is necessary to include the simulation results.) Can we obtain any other useful information from the simulation?</p><p>13. In Figure 4A and the corresponding text, the authors seem to claim that &quot;weak&quot; interactions will lead to &quot;small&quot; networks, but I think that this statement can be misleading. It may be true that molecules are involved in small networks at a certain time point, but the interactions are transient and dynamic (as the authors mention), so molecules change their partners rapidly and on average, the molecules are involved in a large (if not system-spanning) network. Hence, the &quot;size&quot; of the network should be discussed with care, and I recommend the authors revise the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>14. (p. 11) The authors say that the fraction of dwell time is &quot;directly proportional&quot; to the binding affinity and avidity, which I don't think is a mathematically precise statement. Did they mean &quot;directly dependent on the two factors&quot;?</p><p>15. If I understand correctly, the FUS experiment was conducted in 3D, unlike the NR2B experiment, where the molecules are attached to the membrane. As the system becomes three-dimensional, the &quot;displacement&quot; is now a 2D-projected value, and we need to devise a way to convert it to a 3D value. Do the authors consider this point? If so, please provide a description of their conversion method.</p><p>16. (p. 12) The authors say that phase separation of FUS PrLD took up to 12 hours to occur but do not show any data.

Is it because they have a smaller number of measurements (3 vs. 10)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The central finding that the molecules tend to experience transiently confined states in the condensed phase is remarkable and important. This finding is reminiscent of transient &quot;caging&quot;/&quot;trapping&quot; dynamics observed in diverse other crowded and confined systems e.g., https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.107.178103, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10115-1, https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.89.095704, https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.92.178101, https://doi.org/10.1529%2Fbiophysj.106.092619, https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpj.2013.12.013. The authors may wish to comment on these conceptual connections to other systems that highlight the broader context of this fascinating finding; it might motivate others to bring theoretical and analytical approaches developed to understand these other systems to bear on condensates, which would be valuable to the field.</p><p>Related to the previous point: it would be interesting to see not just the distribution of displacements, but also the distribution of times spent in the confined state and mobile state. Given the experimental results, the authors likely already have these data. The functional form of this distribution is known to reflect the physics underlying the trapping behavior and transitions between the two states (see e.g., https://doi.org/10.1016/0370-1573(90)90099-N).</p><p>Also related to the previous point: it is very surprising to see the authors interpret the single-molecule motion as being 'normal' diffusion (within the context of a two-state diffusion model), instead of analyzing their data within the context of continuous time random walks or anomalous diffusion, which is generally known to arise from transient trapping in crowded/confined systems (again see e.g., https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.107.178103, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10115-1, https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.89.095704, https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.92.178101, https://doi.org/10.1529%2Fbiophysj.106.092619, https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpj.2013.12.013). It is not clear that interpreting the results within the context of simple diffusion is appropriate, given their general finding of the two confined and mobile states. Such a process of transient trapping/confinement is known to lead to transient subdiffusion at short times and then diffusive behavior at sufficiently long times. There is a hint of this in the inset to Figure 3, but these data need to be shown on log-log axes to be clearly interpreted. I encourage the authors to think more carefully and critically about the nature of the diffusive model to be used to interpret their results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81907.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers agree that the observations provide potentially important new information, but three specific concerns have been raised.</p><p>1) Is the parsing into weak, non-specific interactions driven by IDRs and strong, specific interactions driven by folded domains real or a trope? The authors propose that this is their belief. However, the specificity of interactions within IDRs, including the FUS system has been well established via the stickers and spacers framework. Conformational heterogeneity engenders conformational and hence concentration fluctuations. These effects are neither weak nor non-specific. This view is shared by the editor and reviewer 1. Therefore, instead of the artificial partitioning and the unsubstantiated claim that the network is small, it is better to update this perspective based on numerous recent contributions. Please see https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-021-00840-w, and https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.21.492916v2 as examples. The key point is that the canonical expectation is of shear thinning behavior in viscoelastic materials that have terminal viscous behaviors. Therefore, the issue is not about weak non-specific vs. strong, specific interactions, but more about the modes of motions accessible to folded domains vs. IDRs. Motions of the latter have been discussed extensively by the Schuler, Best, and Blackledge groups, and these motions span a spectrum of timescales and length scales, which explains the observations reported here, as opposed to the binary classification offered up by the authors and in the biochemical literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the comments from the editor and the reviewer 1. Their points are well taken, and the two references mentioned above are now included to broaden the perspectives discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We understand that our hypothesis and description of supporting evidence for binding affinity and specificity of IDRs may be contentious and will likely draw criticisms from many colleagues in the field. We also understand that binding affinity and degree of specificity of biomolecules are relative terms and therefore can be misunderstood if taken out of context (i.e., away from biological settings). Nonetheless, binding affinity of a molecular interaction system can be quantified by measuring the binding constant of the system. There are strong and there are weak interactions and their physical effects are different. On the other hand, quantification of binding specificity, though possible, is much trickier. Binding specificity of an interaction is affected by factors in addition to the binding affinity and protein concentrations in a given reaction system.</p><p>To better address this issue, we have performed additional experiments and reported the new results in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 (under the heading “Dynamic molecular networks in condensed phases” in the revised manuscript).</p><p>In the system described in this additional work, we are comparing a classical IDR protein fragment, the PrLD of FUS, with the molecular interactions between folded proteins/domain and their targets. We measured the binding affinity of FUS PrLD using two different approaches. First, we used analytical size exclusion chromatography coupled with static light scattering (SEC-SLS) to assay the interaction between FUS PrLD. On SEC column, GB1-tagged PrLD (theoretical M.W. 37.0 kDa) was eluted at a molecular mass corresponding to a monomer when the loading concentrations of the proteins were at as high as 100 μM (blue curve, measured MW 34.3±0.5 kDa) or 300 μM (green curve, measured MW 35.0±0.9 kDa) (please see Figure 4–figure supplement 1A). To rule out potential impact of the GB1 tag on the FUS PrLD interaction, we cleaved the GB1 tag. We took the advantage that tag cleaved FUS PrLD was stable and monodispersed in solution for up to ~10 hrs before phase separation occurs (see Figure 4–figure supplement 2), so we performed SEC-SLS assay of FUS PrLD with the GB1 tag freshly cleaved. The theoretical MW of tag-free FUS PrLD is 22.3 kDa. The measured MW for the tag-free FUS PrLD at the loading concentration of 100 μM (blue curve, measured MW 21.8±3.5 kDa) or 300 μM (green curve. measured MW 20.9±1.1 kDa) also corresponds to the monomer state of the protein (Figure 4–figure supplement 1B). As a control, the PrLD-SAMWT fusion protein (theoretical MW 80.7 kDa) was eluted as an oligomer and its elution volumes were heavily dependent on the loading concentrations (loading concentration at 30 μM, blue curve, measured MW 165.0±0.4 kDa); loading concentration at 150 μM, green curve; measured (MW 265.0±0.4 kDa) (Figure 4–figure supplement 1C). The SEC-SLS analysis results shown in the Figure 4–figure supplement 1A-C demonstrate that FUS PrLD displays a VERY weak inter-molecular interaction (i.e., near the detection limit of the assay method). One may argue that the nearly no detectable interaction between FUS PrLD on analytical size exclusion column could arise from unique kinetic behaviours of the disordered protein (e.g., fast off-rates due to high conformational dynamics of the IDR). We next resorted to a thermodynamic-based binding assay using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We titrated 300 μM FUS PrLD (either without or with the GB1 tag cleaved) into 30 μM FUS PrLD in the reaction cell. Again, the ITC-based assay showed that nearly no detectable interactions could be observed between FUS PrLD (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The results presented in the Figure 4—figure supplement 1 demonstrate that the interaction between FUS PrLD is very weak, with a K<sub>d</sub> value larger than a few hundreds μM based on the experimental methods used here. All of the above information about the new experimental measurement is now included as a “Data interpretation” paragraph after Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript. It is thermodynamically challenging to achieve highly specific binding of FUS PrLD to itself than to other proteins existing in the proteome of a living system if the self-association binding constant is extremely low (i.e., the percentage of productive FUS PrLD complex formation at the cellular protein concentration would be very low). Because of the experimental observations (including the above described additional data) and our narrative arguments, intellectual honesty demands us to retain our statement about the relative weak interactions between IDRs. Clearly, with the materials provided by our manuscript, including its supplementary information and review documents, our perspective on this point may attract future research on this important topic. In our estimation, such evidence-based debates and open airing of opinions on a yet-to-be-resolved issue are healthy and can help science to progress. Indeed, in the full-length FUS, its IDRs likely function together with its folded domains (the specific RNA binding RRM domain and the zinc finger) that are possibly involved in stronger and more specific interactions to achieve its cellular functions.</p><p>We certainly recognize that biological systems are complex and have always been giving us surprises that fall outside our common wisdom. Therefore, we have removed the statement “it is our opinion that most cellular condensates belong to such category” from the description “For biological condensates of which their formations are largely driven by specific molecular interactions (it is our opinion that most cellular condensates belong to such category), molecules in the condensed phase spend most of their time in the confined state”. In line with the editor’s comments, we further calibrated our description by removing the term “non-specific” in our description of IDR-based interactions, as we indeed do not have experimental data to characterize the specificity of the interaction between FUS PrLD (and also because of trickiness in defining binding specificity of a biomolecular interaction). Finally, in case a misunderstanding exists, we wish to emphasize that it is not our intention to under appreciate roles of IDRs in phase separation. Instead, we wish to point out that combinations of strong and specific interactions with generally weak and IDR based interactions can lead to formation of biological condensates with very broad and distinct molecular properties. To help put our perspective in a more comprehensive context, we have now included the aforementioned two recent references from the laboratories of Mittag and Pappu in our introductory discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewer 1 raises important issues regarding the simplicity of the 2-state model and the apparent cyclic nature of the parameterization, fitting, and analyses.

Overall, the manuscript should review the relevant literature in the Introduction (at least to some extent) and evaluate the novelty of its own method based on this review. Some specific points are discussed below:</p><p>(p. 3) We need references for the sentence &quot;The existing biochemistry and biophysics theories that have been guiding our understandings of molecular behaviours and their interactions in living cells in the past are mainly developed for molecules in dilute solutions.&quot; Indeed, there are very few references in the Introduction, which I don't think is appropriate.</p><p>(p. 3-4) There are several works trying to quantify the properties of condensates.

We have now included a series of references on the quantitative characterizations of condensates in the revised manuscript with brief descriptions. We have also included a description of super-resolution microscopy-based tracking studies of proteins in living cells with proper citations. The added text reads as “A biological condensate formed via phase separation is more of a condensed soft matter system, thus theories dealing with dilute solutions are not expected to be generally adequate for condensed molecular systems. Several quantified approaches were developed to study the properties of condensate (Abyzov et al., 2022; Song et al., 2020; Taylor et al., 2019). Super-resolution and single molecule tracking based method was also used to characterize the biophysical properties of biological condensates (Cho et al., 2018; Garcia et al., 2021; Guilhas et al., 2020; Kent et al., 2020; Moon et al., 2019; Muñoz-Gil et al., 2022)”.

(p. 6) The authors assume that the phase boundaries are unchanging throughout their measurement. Is it justifiable?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a valid and highly relevant concern. The boundaries of the condensed phases in our experimental system do change, as processes like Oswald ripening and droplet fusions (e.g., very small droplet below our optical detection fusing with a nearby large droplet) must be happening throughout our experimental measurements. In our experiments, we chose a relatively short time period for our measurement (60 seconds). We compared the phase boundaries of the systems before and right after the super-resolution imaging session. The overall phase boundary did not undergo obvious change during the imaging process as the shapes and boundaries of the condensed droplets in the system remained essentially the same (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Thus, we anticipate that the error introduced by assuming the constant phase boundary during the super-resolution imaging process should not be large.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. (p. 6) They claim to estimate the diffusion coefficients of NR2B. Can they provide the values?</p></disp-quote><p>The initial rough estimation of diffusion coefficient of NR2B was based on single molecule tracking results with default search range (500nm) in consecutive frames in both condensed and dilute phases. This procedure is for ascertaining optimal search ranges for subsequent analyses of experimental data. We then fit the displacement distributions in dilute phase with a 2D simple diffusion model and fit the tracks in condensed phase with a hidden Markov model (HMM) to estimate the diffusion coefficients in both phases first. With these rough estimates, we then determined the optimized search range for each phase. For the case in the manuscript, the estimated diffusion coefficients of NR2B in condensed phase and dilute phase are 0.22 μm<sup>2</sup>/s and 0.57 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively. We have included this description in the main text part of the revised manuscript (p.7 of the revised manuscript) to make our procedure clearer: “… determining optimized search range for different phases in subsequent analyses. The initial roughly estimated overall diffusion coefficients of NR2B in condensed phase and dilute phase are 0.22 μm<sup>2</sup>/s and 0.57 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, respectively” as well as referred to the detailed description in Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The two-state model, assuming trapped and mobile states of molecular diffusion, is a simple and powerful model, but I don't think it necessarily reflects real physics. In my opinion, it is equally likely that the molecules have three or four possible states, or even a continuum of mobility, as the distributions (Figure 3) do not show any &quot;distinct&quot; peaks. Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s general tenet on this point. In principle, molecules in the condensed phase could have multiple motion states instead of a simple two-state model described as a first approximation in our manuscript. For instance, one might envision that the percolated molecular network in the condensed phase is not uniform (e.g., existence of locally denser or looser local networks) and dynamic (i.e., local network breaking and forming). Therefore, individual proteins binding to different subregions of the network will have different motion properties/states. To emphasize this understanding and to ensure that our simple two-state model—which is intended (and now stated clearly) as a first approximation—will not be misconstrued as the be-all and end-all physical picture, we have now expanded the pertinent discussion with the addition of a schematic figure for the underlying energy landscape of a phase-separated system (Figure 3G in the revised manuscript). Physically, as the reviewer has correctly pointed out, the motion states of molecules in the percolated condensed phase are most likely a continuum of mobilities. Our described “confined state” in the manuscript represents an ensemble average of such continuum mobilities. We have now emphasized this point at multiple places in the revised manuscript. We thank the reviewer for this very incisive comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 3A1 and 3B: the authors conclude that a simple diffusion model is a &quot;bad&quot; fit for Figure 3A1 while it explains Figure 3B well – but are they really different? R2 is even better for Figure 3A1 (0.97 vs. 0.91).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the observation. Indeed, if one simply looks at the square Perason coefficient value (R2, denoted as <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> in the revised manuscript), fitting the molecular displacements of the condensed phase in Figure 3A1 by a simple diffusion model is apparently good; but comparison of the best fitted curve with the experimental distribution (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C1) reveals significant mismatches for high displacements. Since the great majority of the condensed-phase molecules are in the confined state, the simple diffusion based model fitting is naturally skewed to these confined molecules, leaving fitting (or rather poor fitting) of motions of the small proportion of mobile molecules insignificant to the R2 value of the fitting (i.e., the motions of mobile state molecules are neglected in the fitting, see Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). In this regard, the match between the fitted curve and experimental displacement distribution in Figure 3B is significantly superior by comparison. We have now underscored this observation in the sentence “Fitting the histogram with a single population of NR2B undergoing Brownian motion could only cover the confined state peak of molecule but not the high-displacement tail of this distribution (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C1). By comparison, in the dilute phase, the overall displacements of NR2B are much larger as well as broader and there is no prominent peak at very small displacements (Figure 3A2)” (p.8 of revised manuscript). In other words, R2 per se is insufficient for fully characterizing the quality of the fits in this situation. Indeed, the properties of condensed-phase mobile molecules are key for understanding the molecular behaviours of the condensed phase, and thus motions of this portion of molecules will need to be tackled separately. We have now emphasized this point in our revised manuscript (p.8 of the revised manuscript). Please see also our new model-independent analysis that does not presume simple diffusion processes as detailed below in our response to this reviewer’s point #7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In their model, they use the &quot;switching probabilities,&quot; which in my opinion is not necessary. In a dynamic equilibrium (as in the plateaus of Figure 3C and 3D), the system should be in a quasi-static state, where we can simply assume two diffusion behaviors even without considering their exchange. Can we simply use a linear combination of two simple diffusion distributions to fit the data?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid comment. We agree with the reviewer that if we only consider the equilibrium state (at effectively infinite time), the displacement distribution will be independent of the switching probabilities. However, the switching probabilities do affect the overall displacement distribution at finite time. Regardless, for our present interest, switching probabilities are essential parameters characterizing the kinetic rate of a molecule converting between the confined and mobile states, as there is no good physical reason to believe that a molecule in the confined state or mobile state will, respectively, remain forever confined or mobile. Specifically, these parameters are critically important when we investigate kinetic properties in non-equilibrium processes such as FRAP experiments. As we have shown in Figure 5, molecules with the same enrichment fold and the same mobile/confined state ratio but with different confined state lifetime (i.e., different “switching probabilities”) will have very different recovery kinetics. In our perspective, confined-to-mobile switch probability is correlated with the off-rate of a molecule dissociating from the percolated network. Thus, including switching probabilities is necessary for obtaining information of interest from analysing the single molecule tracking data in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I am also curious about the performance of the HMM. How much does it improve the fitting? Can the authors provide the fitting results?</p></disp-quote><p>The overall displacement distribution improved only slightly using HMM results (R2=0.98 vs R2=0.97 in simple 2D Brownian motion distribution with a small decrease in RMSE, see Figure 3—figure supplement 1C1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). One possible reason behind the apparent inability of HMM to provide a significant better fit of the displacement data is that the HMM model aims not only to optimize fitting with the displacements but also with the relationship between consecutive steps in terms of switching probabilities. In other words, the HMM applied here seeks to optimize quantitative description of both displacements and switching probabilities under the constraints imposed by the presumption of two simple diffusion states. It is likely that these constraints limit the ability of the present HMM to capture the distribution of displacements with high accuracy. Nonetheless, the diffusion rates estimated by HMM are not dramatically different from those estimated from a model-independent approach that achieves a significant better fit for the displacement distribution in the condensed phase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). With these observations in mind, we regard the present HMM construct as an efficient method for yielding approximate diffusion coefficients and employ it in conjunction with our newly developed model-independent approach to offer a semi-quantitative yet useful description of our experimental data. To highlight this rationale and in recognition of the limitation of HMM, we now characterize our analysis as “semi-quantitative” (p.14 of the revised manuscript), and stated explicitly on p.32 of the revised manuscript that “the fit to the overall condensed-phase displacement distribution in Figure 3 —figure supplement 3D3 is superior to that provided by the HMM-estimated two-state parameters (quality of the latter fit, with RMSE = 184.9, is comparable to that in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C1). Because the HMM applied above seeks to optimize quantitative description of both displacements and switching probabilities while under the constraints imposed by the presumption of two simple diffusion states, its ability to accurately capture the distribution of displacements is likely limited despite its utility for estimating diffusion parameters.”</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparing fitting the experimental molecular displacements with a simple Brownian diffusion model (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C1) against fitting with the optimized HMM two-state diffusion model.</title><p>Best fit of the same experimental displacement distribution in condensed phase with a two-state HMM model.

The new results are reported in Figure 3 —figure supplement 3 and corresponding text in the “Results” (p.14-p.15) and “Materials and methods” (p.30p.32) sections of the revised manuscript. In addition to providing a sound basis for the existence of (at least) two significant different time scales in our experimentally observed tracks in the PSD condensed phase (see Figure 3—figure supplement 3), the new treatment also affords a fit of the experimental condensed-phase displacement distribution in terms of two diffusion processes (Figure 3—figure supplement 3D3) that is significantly better than that provided by HMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, as already noted). Because both our HMM and model independent analysis consistently point to the existence of two significantly different time scales in condensed-phase NR2B motion with estimated diffusion coefficients and other motion parameters sharing a similar trend though not identical (see specific information below), we deem our hypothesis that NR2B motion in PSD condensed phase is physically divided into a broadly construed confined state and a broadly construed mobile state is well supported. Nonetheless, we do recognize that there are ample rooms for further development to improve our quantitative analysis (as noted below), an effort that is beyond the scope of this manuscript but should be taken up in future investigations.</p><p>To highlight this perspective and the prospects of future work, the following modified paragraph with three additional references on theoretical/computational analyses of complex diffusion processes is now included in the “Discussion” section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“We have demonstrated that a two-motion-state model can provide a semi-quantitative rationalization of our experimental data and, at the same time, offer a conceptual framework for their physical interpretation. Indeed, such a two-motion-state picture is well motivated by direct experimental observations (Figure 2E, Video 1). Nonetheless, given the inherent complexity of biological condensates, it is intuitive to recognize that molecules in the condensed phase corresponding to a biological condensate would most likely have multiple motion states due to the heterogeneity of intra-condensate interactions (cf. schematics in Figure 3G). With this in mind, the two motion states in our simple two-state model for condensed-phase dynamics should be understood to be consisting of multiple sub-states. For instance, one might envision that the percolated molecular network in the condensed phase is not uniform (e.g., existence of locally denser or looser local networks) and dynamic (i.e., local network breaking and forming). Therefore, individual proteins binding to different sub-regions of the network will have different motion properties/states. It follows that molecular motions in the percolated condensed phase likely cover a continuum of mobilities, although the confined- and mobile-state diffusion coefficients deduced from our experimental measurements based on the two state model do represent two important time scales of intra-condensate dynamics of PSD. In light of this basic understanding, the “confined state” and “mobile state” as well as the derived diffusion coefficients in this work should be understood as reflections of ensemble averaged properties arising from such an underlying continuum of mobilities. Further development of experimental techniques in conjunction with more refined models of anomalous diffusion (Joo et al., 2020; Kuhn et al., 2021; Muñoz-Gil et al., 2021) will be necessary to characterize these more subtle dynamic properties and to ascertain their physical origins.” (p.22-p.23 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>The following subsection describing the main results and implications of the new model independent approach is now added to the “Results” section of the revised manuscript (with two added references on Lévy distribution):</p><p>“Classification of molecular displacements without presuming simple diffusion models</p><p>It should be emphasized that while quantitative aspects of this two-state perspective of condensed-phase NR2B dynamics was initially deduced by using a HMM assuming two simple diffusion processes, the observation of a general separation of time scales into roughly a low-mobility (L) confined state and high-mobility (H) mobile state in the model PSD condensate is intuitive (Movie 1-supplemental movie) and can be quantified without presuming simple diffusion. This is showcased by a “model-independent” formulation we developed here to classify experimental displacement steps based on a criterion on the correlation of the magnitudes of consecutive displacement steps in each experimental track. As detailed in Materials and methods, we found that the magnitudes of displacements d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> of consecutive steps (experimental time frames) in condensed-phase NR2B are correlated, indicating clearly the process is not simple Brownian diffusion. Analysis of conditional displacement distributions (subsets of overall distribution) based on putative demarcation values (d<sub>b</sub>) for d<sub>i</sub> suggests that d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm provides a reasonable classification of displacement steps into two broad classes, namely a low-mobility (L) state and a high mobility (H) state that correspond roughly to the above HMM-deduced confined and mobile states (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). The dynamic complexity of the PSD condensed phase is underscored by the observation in Figure 3—figure supplement 3D1,D2 that the displacement distributions of both the L and H states exhibit deviations from simple Brownian diffusion, with the deviation more appreciable for the H states, which are better fitted by a Lévy distribution (Viswanathan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2020). Nonetheless, as a first approximation, L-state and H-state motion can be reasonably fitted by two separate simple diffusion process to provide a semi-quantitative description of our experimental data. In this simplified framework, the confined (L) state distribution was interpreted as caused by detection error whereas the mobile (H) state was described approximately by a simple Brownian diffusion process with diffusion coefficient <italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub>=0.044 ± 0.05 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (Figure 3—figure supplement 3D). As specified in Materials and methods, the corresponding confined and mobile ratios and switching probabilities between the two motion states were readily obtained, with the mobile ratio P<sub>m</sub> = 13.5%. Together with the dilute-phase <italic>D</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.47 μm<sup>2</sup>/s estimated above, the enrichment fold estimated using eq.1 is EF ≈ <italic>D</italic><sub>d</sub>/ P<sub>m</sub><italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> ≈ 79.</p><p>Applying these parameters (instead of HMM parameters) to the above-described Monte Carlo simulation using experimental phase boundaries yielded an EF value of 76.2±0.6. In view of the aforementioned approximate nature of the fitted simple diffusion process for mobile-state motion and that the <italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> and P<sub>m</sub> values estimated from Figure 3—figure supplement 3 are appreciably different from those estimated by HMM, the EF value of ≈76 from the present model-free, correlation-based consideration is seen as reasonably close to the experimental value of EF ≈ 61, thus attesting to the robustness of the physical picture that NR2B diffusion in the PSD condensates is roughly separable into two dynamic time scales. However, as stated above, the confined state and the mobile state each likely represents a combination of many sub-states due to complex molecular network formation in the condensed phase. The nature of these sub-states deserves further experimental investigations and more refined theoretical modeling in future studies.</p><p>In any event, taking all the above experimental data and computational analysis together, we now have a workable physical picture for molecular diffusion in the equilibrium state of a phase separation system. Our conceptual framework explicitly connects a set of measurable microscopic molecular motion properties with the observable macroscopic parameters of molecules in the system. The experimental method and the theoretical models developed above are robust and simple to implement. They should be useful for analyzing biomolecular phase separations in general.” (p.14-p.15 of the revised manuscript; verbatim quote except “Figure 3 —figure supplement 3” in the revised manuscript).</p><p>The following subsection providing technical details of the new model-independent approach is now added to the “Materials and methods” section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Correlation-based classification of high- and low-mobility displacement steps without presuming simple diffusion.</p><p>Because presumption of a motion type such as a combination of simple Brownian diffusions may artificially introduce an unwarranted separation of time scales and other possible biases, we developed a model-independent approach to analyse our experimentally determined displacements (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). To gain quantitative physical insights into NR2B molecular motion within the condensed phase, we consider a total of 2,522 experimental trajectories that are configured entirely in the condensed phase (i.e., no transition to the dilute phase) and each consists of at least 10 steps (i.e. 11 positions). The total number of displacements d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> in this set of trajectories is 41,854, with an overall distribution P(d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) shown by the black curve in Figure 3—figure supplement 3A. To probe the extent to which NR2B motion in PSD condensed phase deviates from simple diffusion, we divided the experimental displacement into two classes, namely d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &lt; d<sub>b</sub> and d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &gt; d<sub>b</sub>, using a boundary or demarcation d<sub>b</sub> between small and large displacements (an optimized value of which is to be determined; note that there is no d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> = d<sub>b</sub> for the d<sub>b</sub> values we considered) and then obtained two conditional distributions of displacements P(d<sub><italic>i</italic>+1</sub>|d<sub>i</sub> &lt; d<sub>b</sub>) and P(d<sub><italic>i</italic>+1</sub>|d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &gt; d<sub>b</sub>) for d<sub><italic>i</italic>+1</sub> given that the preceding displacement d<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is, respectively, less than or larger than d<sub>b</sub> (see, e.g., the blue and orange histograms in Figure 3—figure supplement 3A for d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm). If overall condensed-phase NR2B motion were a simple diffusion process, the distribution of displacement of a given step should be independent of the displacement of the previous step and thus the two conditional distributions should be identical; but Figure 3—figure supplement 3A demonstrates that the two conditional distributions are significantly different, indicating once again that condensed-phase NR2B motion cannot be described as a simple diffusion process.</p><p>This observation from Figure 3—figure supplement 3A suggests that we may, as a first approximation, attempt to classify condensed-phase NR2B motion into a low-mobility (L) and a high mobility (H) states by using a demarcation d<sub>b</sub> that results in maximal difference between the low- and high-mobility conditional displacement distributions. Here we use the overlap coefficient (denoted OVL) to quantify the L-H difference in conditional displacement distribution. In general, OVL is a measure of how much two distributions overlap, viz. OVL = ∫ d<italic>x</italic> min[<italic>P</italic>(<italic>x</italic>), <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>x</italic>)], where <italic>P</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) and <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) are the distributions of interest (i.e., OVL is the area of the overlapping region of the two distributions; see, e.g., (Song et al., 2017)). We computed OVL among the overall displacement distribution, the L and H conditional displacement distributions and found that the OVL between the H and L conditional displacement distributions reaches its minimum (i.e., with maximally difference) at around d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B). We therefore adopt d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm as a workable demarcation between low- and high-mobility states of NR2B motion in the model PSD condensate. This classification is illustrated by the example provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 3C. In general, among a set of ~40 randomly selected experimental trajectories we inspected in detail, a classification using d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm appears reasonable although in some cases some of the relatively short displacements are slightly longer than 60 nm. We may then proceed to use d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm to resolve the overall displacement distribution into a low-mobility (L) component (Figure 3—figure supplement 3D1) and a high-mobility (H) component (Figure 3—figure supplement 3D2). As shown in the figure, the L-component distribution may be reasonably fitted (albeit with some deviations) to a simple-diffusion functional form with a parameter <italic>s</italic> = 13.6 ± 3.7 nm, where <italic>s</italic> may be interpreted simply as a detection error or alternately expressed as <italic>s</italic> = <italic>D</italic><sub>L</sub>t with <italic>D</italic><sub>L</sub> = 0.006149 μm<sup>2</sup>/s being the fitted confined-state diffusion coefficient and t = 0.03s is the time interval of the time step between experimental frames.</p><p>If we fit the H-component distribution to a simple diffusion process, the best fitted diffusion coefficient for the mobile state is <italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub>=0.044 ± 0.05 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (blue curve in Figure 3—figure supplement 3D2). Although a Lévy distribution (Viswanathan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2020) for displacements in anomalous diffusion (Bouchaud and Georges, 1990; Joo et al., 2020) offers a clearly superior fit (orange curve in Figure 3—figure supplement 3D2) and should be explored for more detailed analysis of the H- as well as L-component displacement distributions in future studies, it suffice for our present purpose to limit our discussion of condensed-phase motion largely to a combination of simple diffusion processes depicted by the fitted blue curves in Figure 3—figure supplement 3D1,D2. In that case, with the confinement ratio (P<sub>c</sub> = 86.5%) and mobile ratio (P<sub>m</sub> = 13.5%) provided directly by the number of displacements classified as “L” and “H” in accordance with a d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm demarcation, the combination of the two fitted simple diffusion processes is seen to provide a reasonably good approximation to the overall distribution of condensed phase NR2B displacements (Figure 3—figure supplement 3D3). Switching probabilities from mobile to confined state (P<sub>mc</sub> = 0.59 / frame) and from confined to mobile state (P<sub>cm</sub> = 0.09 / frame) can also be readily determined from the number of H→L and L→H transition events based on the same confined/mobile (L/H) classification using d<sub>b</sub> = 60 nm. …”(p.30-p.32 of the revised manuscript; verbatim quote except “Figure 3 —figure supplement 3” in the revised manuscript is replaced by “Figure 3—figure supplement 3”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. (p. 8) The authors claim that the diffusion coefficient of NR2B in a mobile state in the condensed phase and that of NR2B in the dilute phase are &quot;very close,&quot; but the reported values are ~0.47 μm2/s and ~0.61 μm2/s. The authors should clarify in what sense they are very close to each other.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. The essential message we intend to convey is that NR2B diffusion in the dilute phase is significantly closer to that of the mobile state in the condensed phase than that of the condensed phase as a whole (which is dominated by the confined state). In view of the complex (anomalous) nature of the diffusion processes in question and the additional model-independent analysis we describe above, we also recognize that values for condensed-phase mobile-state diffusion coefficient are model-dependent estimates. Nonetheless, the observation of significantly different concomitant time scales in the condensed phase is robust. Taking all these nuanced conceptual and quantitative considerations into account, we have now rephrased the pertinent statements as: “The fitted diffusion coefficient of presumed simple diffusion of NR2B in the dilute phase of the present PSD condensate is 0.47±0.12 μm<sup>2</sup>/s, which is close to that of NR2B alone tethered to SLB (0.61±0.04 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) (Figure 3E). The quantitative similarity of these two estimated diffusion coefficients is particularly striking in view of the much lower apparent overall diffusion coefficient for subdiffusion of NR2B in the PSD condensed phase (<italic>D</italic> = 0.014±0.001 μm<sup>2</sup>/s with α = 0.74±0.03; see Figure 3E)” (p.9 of the revised manuscript) and “the diffusion coefficient for the mobile fraction of molecules in the condensed phase may not be dramatically different from that in the dilute phase (<italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> = 0.17 μm<sup>2</sup>/s vs <italic>D</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.47 μm<sup>2</sup>/s), indicating that the landscape governing mobile-state diffusion in the condensed phase is only moderately rugged” (p.13 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. (p. 8) The authors mention that they did not observe any obvious hinderance against motions when molecules cross the phase boundaries (and hence assume that the flux is simply the diffusion coefficient multiplied by molecular density), but there are reports on the diffusion barrier at the boundaries (see 10.1038/nature22989 and 10.3390/ncrna5040050). In my opinion, the barrier makes sense, as the surface tension will break the symmetry between one side and the other side of the boundary. Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We recognize that boundary barrier widely exists in phase separation systems. We analysed potential barrier functions of droplet boundaries by monitoring whether motions of individual molecules are obviously speeded up or slowed down when crossing the phase boundaries. We reckon that any obvious speeded up or slowed down upon crossing would lead to accumulation or depletion of molecules at the phase boundaries. Accordingly, we have performed new measurements to address this question for our system. As indicated in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2, we did not detect obvious level of molecule enrichment or depletion near the boundary of each condensed patch (i.e., there is a sharp and smooth decrease in the boundary between the condensed phase and dilute phase; see the line plot analysis shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2B1-B3). Nonetheless, the reviewer’s comment is well taken. The boundary between the dilute and condensed phase in biological condensates is indeed an important research question, which we intend to look into in the future. We have now included the following statement now included in the revised text: “Because we did not observe any obvious hindrance against motions when molecules cross the phase boundaries (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), the energy barrier at the interface between the condensed and dilute phases is likely not large in this system (Brangwynne et al., 2011; Feric et al., 2016), though diffusion barriers at phase boundaries were reported in other systems (Peng and Weber, 2019; Strom et al., 2017)”(p.11 of the revised manuscript) [the latter two references are those mentioned by the reviewer under point #9].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. (p. 9) The theoretical value for the enrichment fold is 62.8 and its experimental value is ~61, which may look astonishing, but the &quot;theoretical&quot; value is not calculated from scratch. It is based on the parameters that fit the data, so I think it is unsurprising that they obtain very similar values. I would be surprised if there was a big discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. The experimental value was calculated with the localization density ratio of stochastically emitted fluorescent molecules in condensed phase region and dilute phase region. It can therefore be view as distributions of molecules over the time duration of the imaging process. In contrast, the theoretical value of the enrichment fold was calculated from the <italic>kinetic</italic> parameters extract from the single molecule tracking algorithm with a diffusion model with the approximate relation given in eq.1. Thus, these two values were derived independently. We have now clarified the situation by including the following sentence on p.11 of the revised manuscript: “It follows that the enrichment fold of NR2B in the condensed phase estimated via the approximate relation in eq. 1 by using these experimental kinetic parameters is <italic>D</italic>d/Pm<italic>D</italic>m = 62.8. Since this kinetics-estimated EF is very close to the equilibrium value of ~61 derived independently from experimentally observed localizations (Figure 1B), we regard eq. 1 as empirically validated for the present PSD system, although the relationship between kinetic and thermodynamic properties of diffusive systems (Berry et al., 2018) can be rather complex in general for rugged energy landscapes (Banerjee et al., 2014; Zwanzig, 1988).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. (p. 9) Again, they report the &quot;remarkable&quot; similarity between the diffusion coefficient for the mobile fraction in the condensed phase and that in the dilute phase, but I think the difference (0.17 vs 0.47 μm2/s) can be considered significant, depending on your perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. We should indeed be more cautious in using exaggeratory adjectives like “remarkable”. We have removed it in the revised manuscript. In addition, we have added that we compared the diffusion coefficient for the mobile fraction in the condensed phase and that in the dilute phase (0.17 vs 0.47 μm<sup>2</sup>/s) with the background of the measured apparent diffusion coefficient ~0.014 μm<sup>2</sup>/s. As partially quoted above in our response to this reviewer’s point #8: “although concentrations of molecules in the condensed phase are much higher than those in the dilute phase, the diffusion coefficient for the mobile fraction of molecules in the condensed phase may not be dramatically different from that in the dilute phase (<italic>D</italic><sub>m</sub> = 0.17 μm<sup>2</sup>/s vs <italic>D</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.47 μm<sup>2</sup>/s), indicating that the landscape governing mobile-state diffusion in the condensed phase is only moderately rugged … the apparent overall diffusion constant of NR2B in the condensed phase is small at <italic>D</italic> = 0.014 μm<sup>2</sup>/s instead of 0.17 μm<sup>2</sup>/s estimated for the mobile NR2B fractions in the condensed phase” (p.13 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the simulated enrichment fold. Is it just for validation of the analytical formula? (If this is the case, I don't think it is necessary to include the simulation results.) Can we obtain any other useful information from the simulation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. The Monte Carlo simulation also show us the simulated system reaches a diffusion equilibrium state that matches the theoretical prediction. In this regard, it is a self-consistency check necessary for building a foundation for the parameter setting in FRAP simulation in the last section of the manuscript. Moreover, the simulation results also exhibit minor deviations that likely arise from the peculiar shapes of some of the phase boundaries, which we have now noted in the text as an interesting aspect for future investigations into possible model refinements in the interpretation of tracking data. Please see discussion on p.11-p.12 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. In Figure 4A and the corresponding text, the authors seem to claim that &quot;weak&quot; interactions will lead to &quot;small&quot; networks, but I think that this statement can be misleading. It may be true that molecules are involved in small networks at a certain time point, but the interactions are transient and dynamic (as the authors mention), so molecules change their partners rapidly and on average, the molecules are involved in a large (if not system-spanning) network. Hence, the &quot;size&quot; of the network should be discussed with care, and I recommend the authors revise the manuscript accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. Molecular networks in the condensed phase formed by weak interactions are more transient and dynamic compared to networks formed by strong interactions. It is ambiguous to describe the network complexity and dynamics with size. We have revised the description of percolated molecular networks accordingly by eliminating references to size in Figure 4A and related text (p.15-p.16) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. (p. 11) The authors say that the fraction of dwell time is &quot;directly proportional&quot; to the binding affinity and avidity, which I don't think is a mathematically precise statement. Did they mean &quot;directly dependent on the two factors&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for drawing this to our attention. We have now revised the sentence to (p.16 of the revised manuscript): “The fraction of time that a molecule stays on the network is correlated with its binding affinity (i.e., the off-rate of the molecule from the network, a value directly related to the dissociation constant of the binding) and avidity (a combination of the available binding sites in the vicinity of the molecule, a parameter related to valency of the molecular interactions in the system and the binding affinity of each individual binding site) between the molecule and the network”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. If I understand correctly, the FUS experiment was conducted in 3D, unlike the NR2B experiment, where the molecules are attached to the membrane. As the system becomes three-dimensional, the &quot;displacement&quot; is now a 2D-projected value, and we need to devise a way to convert it to a 3D value. Do the authors consider this point? If so, please provide a description of their conversion method.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment. The PrLD experiments were indeed performed in 3D condensates and molecules diffused in 3D space. For our experiments, we simply recorded and measured diffusion in 2D projections in each given imaging focal plane. One possible way to convert it back to 3D diffusion is to consider the diffusion is isotropic and independent in each direction in 3D. According to the principle of random walk, the mean square displacement is related to the diffusion coefficient:</p><p>〈<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>〉 = 2<italic>nDt</italic></p><p>where <italic>n</italic> is the number of spatial dimensions of the displacements. If diffusion is isotropic and independent of direction, the value of the diffusion coefficient in 3D deduced from this relation would be identical to that measured in 2D projection. The reason that we didn’t expand this 2D result into 3D is that we only recorded the lateral (x and y direction) positions of each single molecule. We could not measure the motion on the z direction as the molecules rapidly moved out of the focal plane of our imaging system. In other words, the efficiency of tracking single molecular motion in a 3D system is much lower than that on a 2D supported membrane system, as only those molecules with their motions stayed within the thin focal plane could be successfully tracked. Addition of a detailed discussion of these aspects of 2D vs 3D diffusion is beyond the scope of the present work. The reviewer’s point is well taken nonetheless. To clarify how we analysed data from our FUS experiment, we have now added the following sentence to the caption for Figure 4D: “Our analysis of diffusion data from the experiments depicted in this figure was based on 2D projections of 3D diffusion tracks”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. (p. 12) The authors say that phase separation of FUS PrLD took up to 12 hours to occur but do not show any data. Please include the data (microscope images or turbidity data).</p></disp-quote><p>We imaged the same PrLD sample in different time point after GB1 tag cleavage as shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2.

(p. 15) Can the authors comment on why they have greater error bars for simulated FRAP curves in Figure 5G? Is it because they have a smaller number of measurements (3 vs. 10)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. The larger statistical uncertainties seen in Figure 5G of our originally submitted manuscript was caused by the smaller number of repeated simulations used for the results. Now, to be consistent with the analogous simulations in the same figure, we have replaced Figure 5G by a new result with 10 repeated simulations instead of 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The central finding that the molecules tend to experience transiently confined states in the condensed phase is remarkable and important. This finding is reminiscent of transient &quot;caging&quot;/&quot;trapping&quot; dynamics observed in diverse other crowded and confined systems e.g., https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.107.178103, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10115-1, https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.89.095704, https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.92.178101, https://doi.org/10.1529%2Fbiophysj.106.092619, https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpj.2013.12.013. The authors may wish to comment on these conceptual connections to other systems that highlight the broader context of this fascinating finding; it might motivate others to bring theoretical and analytical approaches developed to understand these other systems to bear on condensates, which would be valuable to the field.</p><p>Related to the previous point: it would be interesting to see not just the distribution of displacements, but also the distribution of times spent in the confined state and mobile state. Given the experimental results, the authors likely already have these data. The functional form of this distribution is known to reflect the physics underlying the trapping behavior and transitions between the two states (see e.g., https://doi.org/10.1016/0370-1573(90)90099-N).</p><p>Also related to the previous point: it is very surprising to see the authors interpret the single-molecule motion as being 'normal' diffusion (within the context of a two-state diffusion model), instead of analyzing their data within the context of continuous time random walks or anomalous diffusion, which is generally known to arise from transient trapping in crowded/confined systems (again see e.g., https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.107.178103, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10115-1, https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.89.095704, https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.92.178101, https://doi.org/10.1529%2Fbiophysj.106.092619, https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpj.2013.12.013). It is not clear that interpreting the results within the context of simple diffusion is appropriate, given their general finding of the two confined and mobile states. Such a process of transient trapping/confinement is known to lead to transient subdiffusion at short times and then diffusive behavior at sufficiently long times. There is a hint of this in the inset to Figure 3, but these data need to be shown on log-log axes to be clearly interpreted. I encourage the authors to think more carefully and critically about the nature of the diffusive model to be used to interpret their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the references and comments. As stated throughout this response letter, especially in our specific replies to this reviewer (reviewer 2)’s points 1, 2, 3 and reviewer 1’s point 7 above, we have conducted extensive new analyses during revision and have modified the manuscript to put the models that we applied in appropriate scientific context of prior efforts on anomalous diffusion. As stated above, we are of the view that the semi-quantitative analysis that we provided in the revised manuscript is adequate for our present purposes, and that insights offered by more refined modeling approaches will be useful for future extension of our investigations.</p><p>All the references mentioned above by this reviewer (Akimoto et al., 2011; Berezhkovskii et al., 2014; Bhattacharjee and Datta, 2019; Bouchaud and Georges, 1990; Saxton, 2007; Weeks and Weitz, 2002; Wong et al., 2004) are now cited in the revised manuscript and used in our extended discussion as they are indeed useful for providing a proper context of our work to the <italic>eLife</italic> readership. These additions are listed in our reply to comments from both reviewers. For instance, the following passage citing some of these references is now included in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“The above result indicated that NR2B in the condensed phase did not undergo homogeneous diffusion motions as one might expect for molecules in certain crowded condensed phases (Condamin et al., 2008; Höfling and Franosch, 2013; Saxton, 2007; Woringer and Darzacq, 2018). Instead, the motions of NR2B in the condensed phase resemble previously studied crowded and confined systems with transient caging/trapping dynamics (Akimoto et al., 2011; Bhattacharjee and Datta, 2019; Weeks and Weitz, 2002; Wong et al., 2004). Comparisons with data from a set of model experimental systems of FUS-Shank3 chimeric proteins (see Figure 4) suggest that the transient kinetic trapping of NR2B (transiently remaining very close to a stationary position, i.e., very slow diffusion) in the PSD condensed phase is likely due to its relatively strong binding to certain parts of a percolated PSD network with slow dynamics. Accordingly, NR2B molecules in the condensed phase are expected to undergo subdiffusive motions. Indeed, our single molecule tracking data of NR2B motion in the condensed PSD phase (see Figure 2E for an example) fits well with typical behaviors of subdiffusion (Bouchaud and Georges, 1990; Condamin et al., 2008; Netz and Dorfmüller, 1995; Saxton, 2007)” (p.7-p.8 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>References:</p><p>Abyzov, A., Blackledge, M., and Zweckstetter, M.
