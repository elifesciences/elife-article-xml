ophthalmic medication. A common, sight-threatening adverse event of glucocorticoid usage is ocular hypertension, caused by dysfunction of the conventional outflow pathway. We report that netarsudil, a rho-kinase inhibitor, decreased glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension in patients whose intraocular pressures were poorly controlled by standard medications. Mechanistic studies in our established mouse model of glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension show that netarsudil both prevented and reduced intraocular pressure elevation. Further, netarsudil attenuated characteristic steroid-induced pathologies as assessed by quantification of outflow function and tissue stiffness, and morphological and immunohistochemical indicators of tissue fibrosis. Thus, rho-kinase inhibitors act directly on conventional outflow cells to prevent or attenuate fibrotic disease processes in glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension in an immune-privileged environment. Moreover, these data motivate the need for a randomized prospective clinical study to determine whether netarsudil is indeed superior to first-line anti-glaucoma drugs in lowering steroid-induced ocular hypertension.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>steroid glaucoma</kwd><kwd>glaucoma medications</kwd><kwd>trabecular meshwork</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>contractility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY030124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farsiu</surname><given-names>Sina</given-names></name><name><surname>Stamer</surname><given-names>W Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY031710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ethier</surname><given-names>C Ross</given-names></name><name><surname>Stamer</surname><given-names>W Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY005722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stamer</surname><given-names>W Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006312</institution-id><institution>BrightFocus Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Guorong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stamer</surname><given-names>W Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008065</institution-id><institution>Georgia Research Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ethier</surname><given-names>C Ross</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aerie Pharmaceuticals</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stamer</surname><given-names>W Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An FDA-approved, rho-associated kinase inhibitor reverses fibrosis in the conventional outflow pathway of a mouse model of glaucoma and reverses ocular hypertension in patients with steroid glaucoma.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Topical glucocorticoids (GCs) are routinely used after ocular surgery and to treat common ocular disorders such as uveitis and macular edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noble and Goa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haeck et al., 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, ocular hypertension (OHT, i.e. elevated intraocular pressure [IOP]) is a common adverse event of such treatment, which can progress to a form of secondary glaucoma known as steroid-induced glaucoma. Interestingly, 90% of people with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common type of glaucoma, develop OHT after GC treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker, 1965</xref>). This is more than double the rate of the general population, likely because GCs increase extracellular matrixÂ (ECM) material, cellÂ contractility, and stiffness in an already dysfunctional conventional outflow pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>), as is found in POAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">RÃ¶nkkÃ¶ et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tamm and Fuchshofer, 2007</xref>). The conventional outflow pathway drains the majority of the aqueous humor, and its hydrodynamic resistance is the primary determinant and homeostatic regulator of IOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tamm, 2009</xref>). Thus, pro-fibrotic changes in this outflow pathway, such as occurring with GC treatment, frequently lead to significantly elevated IOPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) is a major cytoskeletal regulator in health and disease. Indeed, ROCK mediates pro-fibrotic processes in many tissues and pathological conditions, including fibrotic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Musso et al., 2017</xref>), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MarinkoviÄ et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knipe et al., 2015</xref>), cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haudek et al., 2009</xref>), liver fibrosis, intestinal fibrotic strictures associated with Crohnâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crespi et al., 2020</xref>), vitreoretinal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamaguchi et al., 2017</xref>), and lens capsule opacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korol et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, rho-kinase inhibitors (ROCKi) have been evaluated as anti-fibrotic therapeutics in multiple contexts. However, the mechanisms underlying their anti-fibrotic activity are complex and multifactorial due to the central involvement of ROCK in many cellular processes. Thus, tissue/pathology-specific studies are essential to evaluate the efficacy of ROCKis as anti-fibrotic agents.</p><p>Mechanistic studies evaluating anti-fibrotic activity of ROCKi in the eye are particularly interesting in view of the eyeâs immune-privileged status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Streilein, 2003</xref>), which minimizes the role of macrophages and monocytes as compared to other organ systems. In fact, OHT in glaucoma patients is the only approved indication for ROCKi in humans thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roskoski, 2020</xref>). Specifically, two ROCKi, ripasudil and netarsudil (NT), have been approved for clinical use to treat OHT in glaucoma patients because of their safety profile and IOP-lowering ability and ultimately their unique mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garnock-Jones, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Isobe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanihara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kopczynski and Heah, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Serle et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, ROCKi are the only available glaucoma drug class that directly targets and improves conventional outflow function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schehlein and Robin, 2019</xref>). However, their use is currently limited to patients whose IOPs are inadequately controlled by medications that target otherÂ ocular sites. We here show that local delivery of the ROCKi, NT, significantly lowers IOP in two cohorts of steroid-induced glaucoma patients refractory to conventional medications. Moreover, we help define NTâs mechanism of restorative, anti-fibrotic action in treating steroid-induced OHT using our established mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NT lowered IOP in steroid-induced glaucoma patients whose OHT was poorly controlled by standard glaucoma medications</title><p>Based on changes to the trabecular meshwork (TM) previously observed in studies of steroid glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Overby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>), we tested NTâs efficacy at lowering IOP in steroid-induced ocular hypertensive patients who did not respond well to standard first-line treatments. We retrospectively reviewed patient records, forming two cohorts of subjects from three treatment locations. The first cohort was created by an unbiased retrospective search of the Duke Eye Centerâs electronic medical records using the key words, âsteroidÂ responder/glaucomaâ and ânetarsudilâ. Our search identified 21 eyes of 19 patients (mean age 66.8 years), treated with GCs for a variety of ocular conditions and who demonstrated OHT secondary to GC treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, cohort 1). In accordance with current standard of treatment, these steroid-responsive patients were initially treated with aqueous humor suppressants (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and/or adrenergics, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We note that prostaglandin analogues were typically used as second-line therapies (or not at all) in this patient cohort, due to concerns about the possible pro-inflammatory effects of these agents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Unfortunately, these first- and second-line medications did not adequately control IOP in these patients, who presented with an average IOP of 24.3Â Â±Â 6.6 mmHg before NT treatment (mean Â± SD). Thus, NT treatment was initiated, resulting in a clinically significant lowering of IOP in all patients within 1 month, presenting an average IOP decrease of 7.9 mmHg (p=1.2Ã10<sup>â7</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this cohort, IOP was reduced to an average of 16.4Â Â±Â 4.9 mmHg, which is within the normal range. IOPs over aÂ 3-month course of treatment for each patient are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>. It is important to note that none of the patients were âtaperedâ from their steroid during the first month of treatment, and thus the observed IOP lowering cannot be due to a removal of steroid.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Netarsudil (NT) efficaciously lowered intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with steroid-induced elevated IOP poorly controlled with standard glaucoma medications.</title><p>IOPs were measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry in patients who demonstrated ocular hypertensionÂ (OHT) after steroid treatment for a variety of ocular conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

This cohort included patients with a single diagnosis of steroid-induced glaucoma that was uncontrolled on standard glaucoma medications, and who subsequently received NT. We identified 11 eyes from eight patients, with an average age of 58.4 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, Cohort 2). The IOP in these eyes prior to NT treatment was similar to the first cohort at 26.5Â Â±Â 7.7 mmHg (mean Â± SD). As well, NT significantly lowered IOP in this second cohort by an average of 7.0 mmHg (p=0.0003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), leading to an IOP of 19.5Â Â±Â 5.8 mmHg (mean Â± SD).

It is known that daily treatment with NT significantly decreases IOP in naÃ¯ve mouse eyes by improving conventional outflow function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we studied the efficacy of NT treatment in mice, focusing specifically on NTâs effect on conventional aqueous outflow dynamics and TM structure and function. Our experimental studies were designed to address two clinically important questions in this mouse model: (1) Can NT prevent steroid-induced OHT? and (2) can NT reverse steroid-induced OHT?</p><p>To test for prevention, mice were treated unilaterally with either NT or placebo (PL) starting 1 day prior to bilateral delivery of dexamethasone (DEX)-loaded nanoparticles (NPs), with NT or PL treatment continuing for the 4-week duration of DEX-NP exposure. Baseline IOPs in both NT and PL groups were similar (19.4Â Â±Â 0.4 and 19.6Â Â±Â 1.1 mmHg, respectively, p=0.60). One day after NT or PL treatment, but before DEX treatment, IOP was 20.1Â Â±Â 0.9 mmHg in PL-treated eyes and significantly lower (16.1Â Â±Â 1.4 mmHg) in NT-treated eyes (p=0.0009, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). IOPs were followed for 4 weeks, and average IOP elevation in PL-treated eyes was 5.94Â Â±Â 0.57 mmHg, while IOP in NT-treated eyes was significantly lower than IOP in PL eyes (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), returning close to baseline levels (average IOP elevation compared to baseline of 0.23Â Â±Â 0.45 mmHg, p=0.71). Outflow facility, the primary determinant of IOP, was 84% greater in NT eyes compared to PL (4.87Â Â±Â 1.09 vs. 2.64Â Â±Â 0.44 nl/min/mmHg, p=0.08, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Long-term treatment with NT appeared to impact outflow facility in both treated and contralateral eyes (4.87 vs. 4.39 nl/min/mmHg, respectively), likely due to contralateral effects as observed previously with DEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Netarsudil (NT) prevented and reversed steroid-induced ocular hypertension by improving outflow function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the prevention study, intraocular pressureÂ (IOP) was measured in two groups of age- and gender-matched wild-type C57BL/6 mice receiving NT or placebo (PL) unilaterally by subconjunctival injections.

The baseline IOPs before DEX treatment in both NT and PL groups were similar (18.5Â Â±Â 1.76 vs. 19.2Â Â±Â 1.28 mmHg, respectively, p=0.21). After 3 days of DEX-NP administration, IOP was significantly elevated in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). After 3 weeks of DEX-NP treatment, average IOP elevation (days 3â21) compared to baseline in PL and NT cohorts was similar (6.77Â Â±Â 0.67 vs. 7.74Â Â±Â 0.384 mmHg, respectively, p=0.45, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Commencement of NT treatment resulted in rapid IOP lowering (within 1 day) followed by a continued decrease. After 4 days of treatment, the change in IOP from baseline in PL-treated eyes was 8.19Â Â±Â 0.46 vs. 2.69Â Â±Â 0.47 mmHg for NT-treated eyes (p&lt;10<sup>â4</sup>). In fact, NT almost completely reversed steroid-induced OHT, returning IOP to near baseline levels (18.5Â Â±Â 1.76 vs. 21.4Â Â±Â 1.30 mmHg). NT increased outflow facility by 33% compared to PL (5.18Â Â±Â 0.57 vs. 3.48Â Â±Â 0.51 nl/min/mmHg, p=0.038, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and increased outflow by 37% compared to contralateral eyes (3.27Â Â±Â 0.49 nl/min/mmHg, p=0.025). Assuming no effect of NT on aqueous inflow rate, these measured facility differences can mathematically account for 93â102% of the observed IOP differences between NT- and PL-treated eyes, both here and in the prevention study. If a 10â15% reduction of aqueous inflow is accounted for, the measured facility differences account for 85â95% of the observed IOP changes. We conclude that NTâs IOP-lowering effect in this steroid glaucoma model can be largely explained by increased outflow facility.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Reduction of steroid-induced TM stiffening by NT</title><p>Mechanical stiffness of the TM, a key tissue in the conventional outflow pathway, was shown to be increased by GC treatment, negatively correlating with outflow facility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

Since ROCKi such as NT decrease cellular contractility and act as anti-fibrotic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2018</xref>), we hypothesized that NT would reverse steroid-induced conventional outflow tissue stiffening and lead to more SC collapse at elevated IOPs. To test this hypothesis, we used our reversal protocol as above. On day 5 after the last NT/PL treatment, mice were anesthetized and secured on a custom imaging platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boussommier-Calleja et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The anterior chamber of the NT- or PL-treated eye was cannulated with a single needle connected to a fluid reservoir, allowing IOP to be controlled. The conventional outflow tissues were imaged using optical coherence tomographyÂ (OCT) as IOP was clamped at five different levels. With increasing IOP, the SC lumen became smaller in both NT- and PL-treated eyes, but to different extents. In PL-treated eyes, the SC lumen was still patent at an IOP of 20 mmHg, while the SC lumen in NT-treated eyes was almost completely collapsed. In fact, the SC luminal cross-sectional areas differed significantly between NT- and PL-treated groups at each pressure level (p=0.0024, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Netarsudil (NT) reduced steroid-induced trabecular meshwork (TM) stiffening visualized in living mice by spectral domain-optical coherence tomographyÂ (SD-OCT) and estimated by inverse finite element modelingÂ (iFEM) and measured directly by atomic force microscopyÂ (AFM).</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6 mice received dexamethasone-loaded nanoparticles (DEX-NPs) bilaterally for 4 weeks.

This clinical observation was mechanistically studied in a reliable, established mouse model of steroid-induced OHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>). As in patients, NT decreased long-term steroid-induced OHT in mice and also prevented the onset of steroid-induced OHT. NT-mediated rescue of OHT in mice was accompanied by restoration of normal outflow facility and conventional outflow tissue stiffness, as well as significant morphological alterations in the TM. Calculations suggest that the IOP effect seen in NT-treated mice was mostly or entirely explainable by changes in outflow facility, which together with our direct and indirect measurements of TM stiffness implicate the TM as the tissue mediating the effects of NT on IOP. Thus, this is the first demonstration of prevention and rescue from steroid-induced OHT by a âTM-activeâ FDA-approved glaucoma medication and suggests that ROCKi compounds have effective anti-fibrotic activity in the TM.</p><p>Our results extend findings from an earlier report showing that a ROCKi lowered IOP in a transgenic mouse locally overexpressing connective tissue growth factorÂ (CTGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Junglas et al., 2012</xref>), to a clinicallyÂ relevant disease context by demonstrating NT activity in the conventional outflow pathway. Importantly, two significant phenotypic changes were observed in NT-treated eyes with OHT. The first was a rapid reversal of IOP elevation (within 1â2 days). The second was a significant decrease in accumulated ECM materials, namely FN and basal lamina material underlying the inner wall of SC. Both cellular contractility changes and ECM changes likely contribute to the observed decrease of TM tissue stiffness by NT. In addition to NT-mediated changes in ECM turnover, the observed changes in ECM composition and amount may also be due to NT-mediated opening of flow pathways and consequential removal of ECM.

For example, alterations in the biomechanical properties (i.e., stiffening) of the TM are observed in glaucomatous human donor eyes, which were hypothesized to be associated with dysregulation of the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LÃ¼tjen-Drecoll et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yue, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tamm and Fuchshofer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tektas and LÃ¼tjen-Drecoll, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Last et al., 2011</xref>).

We consider it noteworthy that NT appears to have restored normal TM biomechanical properties in our steroid-induced OHT model after only 4 days of treatment, and that this restoration was accompanied by significant morphological changes in the ECM of the TM. These in vivo observations in a relevant disease model confirm the importance of the rho-kinase pathway, and more generally the importance of cellular biomechanical tension as mediated through actomyosin cytoskeletal tension, on ECM synthesis, assembly, and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakajima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pattabiraman and Rao, 2010</xref>). The rapid timescale of the observed ECM changes is consistent with observations from postmortem human eye preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keller et al., 2009</xref>). The time course of structural changes in the TM was also consistent with the observed rapid (within 24 hr) pharmacodynamics of NT on IOP, significantly decreasing 1 and 3 months of OHT due to DEX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, respectively).

In view of the eyeâs immune-privileged status and local delivery of NT in the present study, it seems likely that resident cells of the conventional outflow pathway primarily mediate NT effects.

Importantly, downstream targets of MRTFs include CTGF and YAP/TAZ, and TGF-Î²-mediated signaling through p38 and NF-ÎºB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raghunathan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braunger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue-Mochita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tamm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montecchi-Palmer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernandez et al., 2020</xref>), all of which participate in the regulation of TM contractility, mechanotransduction, and IOP homeostasis. Thus, our DEX-induced OHT model represents a tool for further interrogation of these pathways in the context of an immune-privileged environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>We used two complementary methods to estimate conventional outflow tissue stiffness, and each has advantages and disadvantages.

However, AFM measurements of stiffness could only be conducted ex vivo on âdeadâ tissues using a cryosectioning technique coupled with AFM. Thus, these measurements likely reflect the stiffness of the ECM, not cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2017b</xref>). In contrast, tensile stiffness estimates of conventional outflow tissues were derived from changes in area of SC lumen in living mouse eyes exposed to sequential IOP challenges. TM behavior was captured using spectral domainÂ (SD)-OCT, and stiffness was then quantified by iFEM as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The disadvantage with OCT is that eyes are imaged at only one location. Regardless, both methods showed consistent results, thatÂ is, that NT significantly reduced steroid-induced conventional outflow tissue stiffness. While desirable, technical concerns prevented OCT, AFM, and outflow facility measurements in the same eye.</p><p>Before the approval of NT in December 2017, four classes of glaucoma drugs (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, alpha-adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and/or prostaglandin analogues) were used to treat steroid-induced OHT. Unfortunately, none of these drugs directly target tissues responsible for homeostatic regulation of IOP in healthy eyes nor for the dysregulation of IOP in steroid-induced glaucoma. Instead, these drugs either decrease aqueous humor formation or divert aqueous humor from the conventional outflow pathway by increasing unconventional outflow drainage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bucolo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmidl et al., 2015</xref>). Despite modest effects on conventional outflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brubaker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahler et al., 2008</xref>), prostaglandins are not often used to treat steroid-induced OHT due to concern about their effects on the blood-retinal barrier in vulnerable retinas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moroi et al., 1999</xref>). NT was the first agent to selectively target and modify conventional outflow morphology and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ren et al., 2016</xref>). However, the current standard of care is for patients to be first treated with glaucoma medications that do not target the conventional outflow pathway, with NT being used only when these drugs are ineffective at IOP lowering. In two independent patient populations, we found 27 patients that had steroid-induced OHT and were treated with NT. Despite being first treated with multiple first- and second-line glaucoma medications (mean of 2.7 and 2.4), NT lowered IOP by an average of 7.9 mmHg in the first cohort and 6.0 mmHg in the second. These observations are consistent with mechanistic data from our mouse model, supporting the concept that the TM is the location of pathology in steroid-induced OHT, and emphasizing the importance of targeting the conventional outflow pathway in this well-recognized condition.</p><p>While patient data were encouraging, there were limitations to our approach. We used a retrospective chart review involving few patients that were treated with NT as a last resort by some, but not all physicians. Thus there was not a control group to determine how many patients were effectively managed on first- and/or second-line medications. These limitations along with the new data presented herein motivate the need for a randomized prospective clinical study to compare NT with first-line anti-glaucoma drugs in lowering steroid-induced OHT.</p><p>Steroid-induced OHT in mice was generated using nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrahari et al., 2017</xref>), resulting in a model that closely matched steroid-induced observations in the human condition (decreased outflow facility, increased accumulation of ECM in the TM, and elevated IOP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson and Knepper, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2001</xref>). The present study suggests the utility of our mouse model of steroid-induced OHT and its translational relevance to the human clinical condition, where there is a high incidence of OHT in patients receiving intravitreal GCÂ delivery implants to treat uveitis or macular edema. Our data indicate that human steroid-induced OHT patients who are refractory to standard glaucoma medications respond very well to NT. This retrospective study encourages a prospective study testing NT as a first-line drug for steroid-induced OHT. Further, our study utilizes methodology for non-contact, non-invasive estimation of conventional outflow function/health using OCT and iFEM. Our results confirm that this technology may have the resolution to detect changes in conventional outflow dysfunction due to GC treatment and restoration of function after drug treatment. In clinical practice, we suggest that this technology may have potential utility in staging glaucoma status and in monitoring treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Schlemm3_2</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30651311">30651311</ext-link></td><td>Version 3.0</td><td>Schlemmâs canal segmentation</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>FEBio</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://febio.org/">https://febio.org/</ext-link></td><td>Version 3.0</td><td>Finite element modeling</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Î±SMA (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam, Cambridge, MA</td><td>ab5694</td><td>IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-FN (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX</td><td>sc8422</td><td>IF (1:50)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of conventional outflow function caused by GCs can be mitigated by NT treatment.

Briefly, at the end of the 4Â daysÂ of NT/PL treatment period in the reversal study and after 4 weeks of NT/PL treatment in the prevention study, mice were euthanized using isoflurane, and eyes were carefully enucleated and rapidly mounted on a stabilization platform located in the center of a perfusion chamber using a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue (Loctite, Westlake, OH). The perfusion chamber was filled with pre-warmed Dulbeccoâs phosphate-buffered saline with added 5.5 mM D-glucose (DBG), submerging the eyes and regulating temperature at 35Â°C. Two glass microneedles, backfilled with filtered DBG, were connected to the system. Using micromanipulators, one microneedle was inserted into each anterior chamber of paired eyes without contacting the irises. Both eyes were perfused at 9 mmHg for 30 min to allow acclimatization and stabilization, followed by perfusion at nine sequential pressure steps of 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5, 12, 15, 18, and 21 mmHg.

While mice were secured in a custom-made platform, a single pulled glass microneedle filled with PBS was inserted into the anterior chamber of one eye. The microneedle was connected to both a manometric column to adjust IOP and a pressure transducer (Honeywell Corp., Morristown, NJ) to continuously monitor IOP levels using PowerLab software. The OCT imaging probe was aimed at the nasal or temporal limbus and the image was centered and focused on the SC lumen. While collecting images, mouse eyes were subjected to a series of IOP steps (10, 12, 15, 17, and 20 mmHg) by adjusting the height of the fluid reservoir. At each IOP step, a sequence of repeated OCT B-scans (each with 1000 A-scans spanning 0.5 mm in lateral length) from spatially close positions was captured, registered, and averaged to create a high signal-to-noise-ratio image from the iridocorneal angle region of each animal.

In our iFEM approach, the stiffness of the TM was parametrically varied until computed SC deformations matched experimental observations, at which point we concluded that the TM stiffness specified in the FEM approach matched the actual (in vivo) value, while masked to treatment group. A pseudo-2D FEM geometry generated in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>) was used to calculate TM tissue stiffness based on OCT images. We have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2017a</xref>) that such a pseudo-3D approach does not yield results significantly different from a true 3D model, at a fraction of the workload. The model includes the TM, sclera/cornea, and the uvea, and is meshed with four-noded tetrahedral elements. Tissues are treated as incompressible, isotropic, and nonlinearly hyperelastic (incompressible Mooney-Rivlin material model). The TM is assigned a range of stiffnesses (20â240 kPa), and for each stiffness value, we simulate the deformation of irideocorneal angle tissues, thus determining the cross-sectional area of SC vs. IOP. The computed SC area is compared with experimental measurements, and the estimated TM stiffness is taken as the value that minimizes the least squares difference between the experimental and predicted normalized SC areas over the IOP range 10â20 mmHg.

Briefly, de-identified eyes coated with optimal cutting temperature compound (O.C.T.; Tissue-Tek) were cryo-sectioned from three different quadrants on a Microm Cryostar NX70 cryostat (Dreieich, Germany). For each quadrant, a few 10-Âµm-thick sagittal cryosections were collected on adhesive slides (Plus Gold Slide, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and stored for up to 30 min in ice-cold PBS prior to AFM analysis.</p><p>Samples were then transferred to an MFP-3D-Bio AFM (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA) and kept continuously immersed in PBS during measurements at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). TM stiffnesses were measured following the same protocol we used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2017b</xref>). Specifically, cantilever probes were modified by attaching a spherical indenter of diameter 10 Âµm to smooth nanoscale variations in tissue mechanics. For each indentation, the indentation depth was 0.5â1 Âµm, with a maximum applied force of 7 nN and approach velocity of 8 Âµm/s. A Hertzian model was used to extract a Youngâs modulus stiffness value from the force vs. indentation curves. For each cryosection, the TM was first localized as the region between the pigmented ciliary body and the inner wall endothelium of SC. Multiple locations in the TM region (typically 3â9) were probed by the cantilever and three repeated measurements were conducted at each location. The average from the three measurements was taken as the TM stiffness at that location. TM stiffnesses from all locations within a cryosection were then averaged to obtain the TM stiffness of that cryosection, and values for cryosections within a quadrant were averaged to obtain the TM stiffness in that quadrant. The mean stiffness of all quadrants was taken as the TM stiffness of the eye. Typically, there were 135 force curves acquired per eye (three force curves per location, typically five locations per cryosection, and typically nine cryosections per eye). A small number of measured TM stiffness values were excluded in a post hoc analysis if there was disagreement from a second reviewer as to whether the measurement location lay within the TM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Histology, immunohistochemistry, and TEM</title><p>After OCT imaging, mice were decapitated under anesthesia, and eyes were collected and immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4Â°C overnight. The eyes were then bisected, and the posterior segments and lenses were removed. The anterior segments were cut into four quadrants. For immunostaining, each quadrant was embedded into LR-White resin, and 1 Âµm sections were cut and immunostained with antibodies that specifically recognized either Î±SMA (1:100 dilution, rabbit polyclonal, ab5694, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or FN (1:50 dilution, mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX). The secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated AnffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit or mouse IgG H and L (Alexa Fluor 488; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 1:500 dilution. All sections were processed at the same time. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse 90i confocal laserÂ scanning microscope (Melville, NY). Images from NT- and PL-treated eyes were collected at identical intensity and gain settings on the same day (z stacks of nine 0.5 Î¼m optical sections for each image) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>). For electron microscopy studies, one quadrantÂ perÂ eye of the anterior segment was fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and embedded in Epon resin and 65 nm sagittal thin sections were cut through iridocorneal tissues using an ultramicrotome (LEICA EM UC6, Leica Mikrosysteme GmbH, A-1170, Wien, Austria). Sections were stained with uranyl acetate/lead citrate and examined with a JEM-1400 electron microscope (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantitative analysis of FN and Î±-SMA</title><p>Using ImageJ software, the TM from each image was manually segmented (region of interest, ROI) in a masked fashion by one co-author (MK), and fluorescence intensity (mean grayscale value) within each ROI was determined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref> for example). The inner wall of SC provided the outer boundary of the ROI, while pigment from ciliary body structures served as the interior boundary. Only the filtering region of the TM (i.e., the region below SC) was analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Quantification of ECM content in JCT</title><p>To quantify ECM in the JCT under the inner wall of SC, images were captured at 8000Ã magnification and masked as to the identity of the treatment group. Images were quantified in two ways. First, they were scored using a pre-established semi-quantitative scoring system by two individuals (WDS and CRE) with extensive experience in viewing TEM images of the conventional outflow pathway. Specifically, the density and extent of the ECM in the JCT region, in particular below the inner wall of SC, was scored on a scale of 0â2, with 0 representing ânormalâ appearing basal lamina, 2 representing continuous basement membrane materials (BMM) such as observed in the mouse steroid OHT model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Overby et al., 2014</xref>), and 1 representing conditions between the two extremes. Thus, images were included whereby the inner wall of SC was clearly visible, and images were of sufficient quality to examine its basal lamina.</p><p>The second quantification method followed an existing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Overby et al., 2014</xref>) wherein coverage of BMM immediately underlying the inner wall of SC was measured. In brief, the lengths of the continuous BMM in contact with the inner wall of SC and the total length of the inner wall were measured using ImageJ software as described previously in 97 TEM images from 50 mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref> for an example). Then, the sum of the continuous BMM length was divided by the total inner wall length to compute a ratio representing the percentage of the inner wall underlain by BMM. Only continuous BMM in contact with the inner wall was included in the BMM measurements, thatÂ is, regions where continuous BMM showed an optically clear offset from the inner wall were excluded. Ratio values from multiple images from the same eyes were averaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Due to the fact that IOPs are normally distributed and the expected directional (lowering only) effect of NT on IOP, we analyzed patient IOP data using a paired t-test with one tail, assuming equal variance. To analyze IOP measurements in mice, the time points from 3 to 28 days in the prevention study, or the time points from 1 to 4 days post-NT/PL delivery in the reversal study, were averaged from each eye to produce a single average IOP value per eye for subsequent data analysis. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for analyzing significant difference between groups for IOP and OCT images. To analyze outflow facility measurements, we used the well-established fact that the underlying distribution of outflow facility in mice is log-normally distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sherwood et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, a weighted paired or unpaired (two-way) t-test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sherwood et al., 2016</xref>) was applied to the log-transformed facilities. To analyze data quantifying fluorescence intensity, an F-test of difference among means from ANOVA was used, with a GEE (generalized estimating equations) approach applied to account for multiple observations per mouse. To analyze BMM in mice, we used two different methods: a parametric approach and a non-parametric approach. In the parametric approach, an F-test of difference among means was used as part of an ANOVA, followed by pair-wise comparisons based on t-tests of differences between means. In the non-parametric analysis, a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used to test for difference among medians, followed by pair-wise comparisons based on Wilcoxon rank sum tests for differences between medians. Data in box and whisker plots show median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile (boxes), as well as minimum and maximum values (whiskers). Data in other plot formats are presented in the form of mean and 95% confidence interval or mean and standard error of the mean (SEM), as noted. A value of pâ¤0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ying Hao (Duke Eye Center Core Facility), who prepared histology sections and helped with TEM.

diseases. Li et al. report that in a small retrospective study netarsudil, a rho-kinase inhibitor, rapidly reversed glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension in patients whose intraocular pressures were not controlled by standard medications. The authors show in mechanistic studies in a mouse model of glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension that netarsudil both prevented and reversed intraocular pressure elevation. A prospective clinical trial evaluating rho kinase inhibitors versus standard intraocular pressure-lowering agents in steroid-induced ocular hypertension is warranted.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Antifibrotic activity of a rho-kinase inhibitor restores outflow function and intraocular pressure homeostasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Colleen McDowell (Reviewer #1); Ernst Tamm (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper showed the Rho-kinase inhibitor netarsudil reverses glucocorticoid-induced ocular hypertension in patients, and also investigated the potential mechanism behind this using steroid-induced ocular hypertension mouse model. The authors showed that netarsudil increased outflow facility, decreased mechanical stiffness of the TM, as well as reduced expression of Î± smooth muscle actin and fibronectin with IHC. The implications of the work have great clinical significance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is an important study that addresses a fundamental problem in glaucoma. In this manuscript the authors provide convincing evidence that a Rho-kinase inhibitor substantially lowers IOP in patients with steroid-induced glaucoma that was uncontrolled by other medications. In addition, they show that this is also the case in a mouse model of steroid-induced glaucoma, with some prior publications in the field. However, there are some major issues that should be addressed</p><p>Since this is about a commercially available drug and partially funded by the company that markets it, the results need to be watertight which they are currently not. It is important that claims not be exaggerated.</p><p>The claim that netarsudil &quot;reverses&quot; glaucoma is not justified in the absence of visual field testing and other functional assessments of the presence, and then absence, of glaucoma. The authors don't show that the mice or the humans are cured and all signs of their disease erased, which is what &quot;reversal&quot; would necessitate. The same principle applies to the word &quot;rescue.&quot; The term &quot;remarkable&quot; should also be removed.</p><p>To claim the antifibrotic potential of netarsudil, the authors need more quantified data to support the &quot;antifibrotic&quot; conclusions.</p><p>Since mouse and human steroid-induced glaucoma is a form of glaucoma with a substantial increase in a specific form of extracellular matrix (basal lamina-like deposits), it is tempting to speculate that those deposits cause stiffness, low outflow facility and high IOP. It would be a major breakthrough, if it could be shown convincingly that the removal of those deposits by rho kinase inhibitors restores TM function. Critical for this point (the &quot;antifibrotic activity&quot;) though is to provide convincing and quantified data. Clearly, structural analysis is the gold standard to show fibrosis or the lack thereof.</p><p>The authors do this by a combination of immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. It appears though that those studies do not account for the considerable intra-individual differences that the trabecular meshwork outflow pathways show in an individual mouse eye. There are regions of high flow and low flow, and there is a substantial amount of published data showing that these differences are based on structural variations in the outflow pathways. Even in a normal mouse eye, there are regions with less or more fibronectin, Î± SM-actin etc. The authors are strongly recommended to perform additional molecular analyses. Western blotting or RT-PCR using protein/RNA obtained from corneoscleral rings is what scientists usually do to support data obtained by immunohistochemistry, and to address the problem of regional differences. Since the main ultrastructural finding in steroid-induced glaucoma, also in the mouse eye, are &quot;basal lamina deposits&quot;. Immunostaining for basal lamina molecules such as laminin, nidogen, type IV collagen needs to be done support the TEM data.</p><p>For transmission electron microscopy, one quadrant was processed. It appears that several ultrathin sections were cut from this quadrant. Taking into account the thickness of ultrathin sections (40 â 80 nm) even the analysis of multiple consecutive sections would only have visualized a very tiny portion of TM circumference. Those regional differences need to be taken into account. Clearly there are also quite substantial regional differences when it comes to basal lamina deposits and other forms of fibrillar extracellular matrix in the TM. This is not only true for the circumference, but also for the TM in anterior-posterior direction. For the human patient, the authors quote the work by Johnson, Gottanka et al. which is still important after more than 20 years because of its thorough quantitative analysis. The bars should not be lower in the mouse eye, especially when it comes to the possible identification of a major mechanism. Other less time intensive methods may be available to quantify deposits in all regions, as long as the results represent the variability seen in the mouse eye so the conclusions are reliable.</p><p>If using TEM, the authors need to perform a power analysis in the normal mouse TM that shows how many sectors etc., need to be investigated to quantify basal lamina deposits, open spaces and ruffling of inner wall cells taking into account regional differences and regions with high and low flow. Based on those results quantification needs to be done. This is time consuming, but definitely feasible and the only way to support the statement of &quot;antifibrotic activity&quot;. A semiquantitative analysis without knowing for certain the variability in the system is not recommended.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60831.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is an important study that addresses a fundamental problem in glaucoma.

Taking into account the thickness of ultrathin sections (40 â 80 nm) even the analysis of multiple consecutive sections would only have visualized a very tiny portion of TM circumference. Those regional differences need to be taken into account. Clearly there are also quite substantial regional differences when it comes to basal lamina deposits and other forms of fibrillar extracellular matrix in the TM. This is not only true for the circumference, but also for the TM in anterior-posterior direction. For the human patient, the authors quote the work by Johnson, Gottanka et al. which is still important after more than 20 years because of its thorough quantitative analysis. The bars should not be lower in the mouse eye, especially when it comes to the possible identification of a major mechanism. Other less time intensive methods may be available to quantify deposits in all regions, as long as the results represent the variability seen in the mouse eye so the conclusions are reliable.</p><p>If using TEM, the authors need to perform a power analysis in the normal mouse TM that shows how many sectors etc., need to be investigated to quantify basal lamina deposits, open spaces and ruffling of inner wall cells taking into account regional differences and regions with high and low flow. Based on those results quantification needs to be done. This is time consuming, but definitely feasible and the only way to support the statement of &quot;antifibrotic activity&quot;. A semiquantitative analysis without knowing for certain the variability in the system is not recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers make multiple excellent points.</p><p>Regarding cohort size/power analysis: We originally chose cohort sizes based upon our previous study (PMID: 25028360), where Prof. LÃ¼tjen-Drecoll performed the quantitative analysis of ECM coverage under the inner wall of SC. In that study, significant differences due to dexamethasone treatment were observed using cohorts of 5 control and 7 treated animals (1-3 sections analyzed/eye). In the present study, our cohort sizes (11 placebo and 9 netarsudil-treated mice, 1-3 sections analyzed/eye) were larger than our previous study, and thus we suggest that our sampling is sufficiently representative.</p><p>Regarding segmental variability: the reviewers of course are correct that there is significant segmental variability in the mouse outflow tract. Ideally, one would perfuse flow tracer to label high- and low-flow regions, and quantify ECM in each region. Due to experimental constraints, we were unable to do such experiments as part of this study, although this work is planned. Instead, we have taken the approach of sampling more eyes and more widely spaced sections per eye (see details below) in a masked manner. By so doing, we account for regional variation through appropriate statistical analysis.</p><p>Regarding immunostaining for basal lamina molecules: We agree with the reviewers that these data would complement the TEM study. However, there are several practical considerations that mitigate against this. First, in our experience, the available antibodies to extracellular matrix proteins often take extensive testing and optimization from multiple sources. Second, we are uncertain which components are being altered by DEX, and thus would have to screen different candidates. Since the paper already has 7 supplemental figures, 2 tables and 6 figures (most of which have multiple subpanels), we instead focused our time on improving the TEM analysis, as suggested by the reviewers. Importantly, TEM quantitation in the Overby et al. study (Overby et al., 2014) observed similar changes in BMM from <italic>both</italic> mouse and human eyes exposed to corticosteroids.</p><p>Regarding quantitative scoring of fibrosis: While our semi-quantitative assessment of morphological changes in the conventional outflow pathway at the EM level was scored by two experts in this area, we agree that the paper would be enhanced by quantitative data. In direct response to the reviewerâs request, we have therefore conducted a quantitative analysis of our immunolabelling images and of our TEM images. In the TEM data set, images came from two opposite quadrants of each eye; in several cases, eyes were underrepresented (due to poor quality sections that could not be scored previously), so we cut additional sections from those eyes, as well as cutting sections from additional eyes in the reversal cohort that were not analyzed in the initial semi-quantitative scoring scheme. Using this enlarged image set (97 images from 50 eyes), we went on to quantify basement membrane material following the LÃ¼tjen-Drecoll approach (PMID: 25028360). This new quantitative data has been added to Figure 5. As the reviewers can see, the quantification of basement membrane material beneath inner wall produced results that are very similar to our previous semi-quantitative analysis of JCT, and which are quantitatively consistent with the previous report of Overby and colleagues (PMID: 25028360). Importantly, this quantitative data, which was gathered in a fully masked manner, shows statistically significant differences that confirm that treatment with netarsudil partially restored normalcy to the ultrastructure of the subendothelial region. We have added text to the Results as follows:</p><p>âWhen examined at the electron microscopic level, we observed two major effects of NT treatment on steroid-induced OHT eyes (Figure 5). The first was a significant reduction in the amount and density of basement membrane materials (BMM) underlying the inner wall of SC. The second was an apparent increase in the number of âopen spacesâ in the TM of NT-treated eyes, particularly in the JCT region. These two changes were scored on a semi-quantitative scale, confirming observational impressions of NT treatment (Figure 5F, p=0.02). In addition, we quantified the amount of BMM below the inner wall of SC in each treatment group following the LÃ¼tjen-Drecoll approach (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1) (Overby et al., 2014). Similar to results reported in Overby et al., we found that length of BMM underlying SC was significantly increased in mice after DEX treatment (Figure 5G, p&lt;0.001). Indeed, our BMM ratio measurements in control and DEX-treated mice were quantitatively similar to those reported by Overby and colleagues. Most important, these data confirm significant differences between PL- and NT-treated eyes (Figure 5G, p=0.001), whereby NT appears to partially restore the ultrastructure of the subendothelial region (Figure 5).â</p><p>An example methodological image has been provided in the supplemental materials (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1), and the methodology for quantitation was added to Materials and methods, as follows:</p><p>âQuantification of extracellular matrix content in JCT</p><p>To quantify ECM in the JCT under the inner wall of SC, images were captured at 8000Ã magnification and masked as to the identity of the treatment group. Images were quantified in two ways. [â¦] Only continuous BMM in contact with the inner wall was included in the BMM measurements, i.e. regions where continuous BMM showed an optically clear offset from the inner wall were excluded. Ratio values from multiple images from the same eyes were averaged.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
