However, whether the more close friends the better, and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are unknown. Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmental study, we identified nonlinear associations between the number of close friends, mental health, cognition, and brain structure. Although few close friends were associated with poor mental health, low cognitive functions, and small areas of the social brain (e.g., the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the anterior insula, and the temporoparietal junction), increasing the number of close friends beyond a level (around 5) was no longer associated with better mental health and larger cortical areas, and was even related to lower cognition. In children having no more than five close friends, the cortical areas related to the number of close friends revealed correlations with the density of μ-opioid receptors and the expression of OPRM1 and OPRK1 genes, and could partly mediate the association between the number of close friends, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and crystalized intelligence. Longitudinal analyses showed that both too few and too many close friends at baseline were associated with more ADHD symptoms and lower crystalized intelligence 2 y later. Additionally, we found that friendship network size was nonlinearly associated with well-being and academic performance in an independent social network dataset of middle-school students. These findings challenge the traditional idea of ‘the more, the better,’ and provide insights into potential brain and molecular mechanisms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Close friendships are crucial during the transition from late childhood to adolescence as children become more independent from their parents and influenced by their peers.

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Late childhood and its transition toward adolescence is a period marked by decreasing parental influence alongside increasing peer influence. It is a period critical for social interaction, during which friendships are especially important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blakemore and Mills, 2014</xref>). During this period, the social brain is still undergoing significant development, in parallel with changes in social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mills et al., 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, evidence suggests that psychiatric disorders often have an onset in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>), which may be partly influenced by the concurrent changes in the social environment and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paus et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, understanding the relationship between friendship, mental health, and cognition during this period, and the underlying brain mechanisms, is of considerable clinical and public health importance.</p><p>It has been well established that positive social relationships such as close friendships are essential for mental health and cognition in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marion et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Narr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wentzel et al., 2018</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether having more close friends is necessarily better. Cognitive constraints and time resources limit the number of close social ties that an individual can maintain simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunbar, 2018</xref>). The innermost layer of the friendship group with the highest emotional closeness is around five close friends (the so-called Dunbar’s number) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>). For now, only a few empirical studies have examined the nonlinear association between social relationships, mental health, and cognition in children and adolescents. For instance, a large study of a nationally representative sample in the United States reported that adolescents with either too many or too few friends had higher levels of depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Falci and McNeely, 2009</xref>). Two large-scale studies reported that the benefits of social interactions for well-being were nearly negligible once the quantity reached a moderate level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kushlev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ren et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, a significant U-shaped effect was detected between positive relations with others and cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, the assumption of linearity still dominates studies of social relationships, and the effect of the friendship network size at the high end remains largely unexplored.</p><p>Despite a large body of evidence linking friendships to mental health and cognition, we know relatively little about the underlying mechanisms involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pfeifer and Allen, 2021</xref>). The social brain hypothesis proposes that the evolution of brain size is driven by complex social selection pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunbar and Shultz, 2007</xref>). Animal studies have shown that social network size can predict the volume of the mid-superior temporal sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sallet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Testard et al., 2022</xref>), a region in which neurons respond to socially relevant stimuli such as face expression and head movement to make or break social contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hasselmo et al., 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hasselmo et al., 1989b</xref>). In human neuroimaging studies, several key brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, i.e. orbitofrontal [OFC] and anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]), the cortex in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), amygdala, and the anterior insula, have been implicated in social cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frith and Frith, 2007</xref>). Moreover, there has been an increasing number of studies dedicated to investigating the social brain in children and adolescents over the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrews et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burnett et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>At the molecular level, the μ-opioid receptor is widely distributed in the brain, particularly in regions associated with social pain such as the ACC and anterior insula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgärtner et al., 2006</xref>). Recent studies have identified the crucial role of μ-opioid receptors in forming and maintaining friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunbar, 2018</xref>), and variations in the μ-opioid receptor gene have been related to individual differences in rejection sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Way et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, other neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and noradrenaline, may interact with the opioids, and are involved in social affiliation and social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Machin and Dunbar, 2011</xref>). Dysregulation of the social brain and neurotransmitter systems is also implicated in the pathophysiology of major psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Porcelli et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, it is suggested that changes in the social brain might explain the relationship between social connections and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lamblin et al., 2017</xref>). However, the empirical evidence on this topic is limited in late childhood and adolescence.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the number of close friends, mental health, and cognitive outcomes, with a focus on potential nonlinear associations. We used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Developmental (ABCD) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karcher and Barch, 2021</xref>) and an independent social network dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paluck et al., 2016</xref>). These datasets provided reliable measures of close friend quantity, mental health, and cognition, and included a combined total of more than 23,000 participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To evaluate the potential nonlinear relation between friendship quantity (predictor) and mental health and cognition (outcome), two different analytic approaches were utilized. Specifically, we examined the presence of a significant quadratic term as an indicator of nonlinearity, and subsequently conducted a two-lines test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simonsohn, 2018</xref>) to estimate an interrupted regression and identify the breakpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). To explore the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, we further tested the nonlinear association between the number of close friends and brain structure. We then correlated the related brain differences with the density of eight neurotransmitter systems, as well as the expression of the μ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) and the κ-opioid receptor gene (OPRK1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Finally, longitudinal and mediation analyses were conducted to uncover the direction and direct association between the number of close friends, mental health, cognition, and brain structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Based on the existing literature, we hypothesized that the number of close friends was nonlinearly related to mental health, cognition, and the social brain; and that this relationship could potentially be explained by brain differences and molecular mechanisms.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The study workflow.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Study datasets and key measures used in the present study.

The results also support the hypothesis that a quadratic association exists between the number of close friends and the areas of social brain regions such as the OFC, the ACC, insula, the anterior temporal cortex, and the TPJ. These regions mediated the nonlinear association between close friendship quantity and behavior. Furthermore, the brain differences related to the number of close friends were correlated with measures of the endogenous opioid involvement of the brain regions.</p><p>Social relationships play a double-edged role for mental health. Previous research has primarily focused on the positive aspects of social relationships, while the negative effects have received comparatively less attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, we identified a robust nonlinear association of close friend quantity with various mental health and cognitive outcomes in the ABCD study at baseline and 2-year follow-up, and an independent social network dataset. This result demonstrates the persistence of the findings. The findings are in line with past studies, which showed that too large a social network size or too frequent social contacts were not positively correlated with well-being in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kushlev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stavrova and Ren, 2021</xref>) and were even negatively correlated with mental health in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Falci and McNeely, 2009</xref>). One explanation is that an individual’s cognitive capacity and time limit the size of the social network that an individual can effectively maintain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunbar, 2018</xref>). People devote about 40% of their total social efforts (e.g., time and emotional capital) to just their five most important people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bzdok and Dunbar, 2020</xref>). In a phone-call dataset of almost 35 million users and 6 billion calls, a layered structure was found with the innermost layer having an average of 4.1 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mac Carron et al., 2016</xref>). There is a trade-off between the quantity and quality of friendships, with an increased number of close friends potentially leading to less intimacy. Meanwhile, spending too much time on social activities may lead to insufficient time for study and thereby to lower academic performance. Second, adolescents are particularly susceptible to peer influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berndt, 1979</xref>). Researchers have found that the presence of a peer may increase risk-taking behaviors that can be detrimental to mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chein et al., 2011</xref>) and reduce cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). Having more close friends may increase the possibility of this kind of influence.</p><p>Our study revealed a significant link between the number of close friends and the cortical areas of social brain regions in the largest sample of children to date. Studies suggest that two major systems in the brain related to social behavior include the affective system of the ACC, the anterior insula, and the OFC, and the mentalizing system typically involving the TPJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Güroğlu, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schmälzle et al., 2017</xref>). The dorsal ACC and anterior insula play an important role in social pain (i.e., painful feelings associated with social disconnection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eisenberger, 2012</xref>). The OFC receives information about socially relevant stimuli such as face expression and gesture from the cortex in the superior temporal sulcus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hasselmo et al., 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pitcher and Ungerleider, 2021</xref>), and is involved in social behavior by representing social stimuli in terms of their reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rolls, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rolls, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rolls et al., 2006</xref>). The volume of the OFC is associated with social network size, partly mediated by mentalizing competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Powell et al., 2012</xref>). Previous meta-analysis studies report an overlap in brain activation between all mentalizing tasks in the mPFC and posterior TPJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schurz et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, in our study, the positive relationship at the brain level only held for the children with no more than approximately five close friends, which is consistent with the behavioral findings. Furthermore, in these children, the areas of social brain regions partly mediated the relationship of the close friend quantity with ADHD symptoms and crystalized intelligence. Research also indicates that the brain regions regulating social behavior undergo structural development during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blakemore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lamblin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mills et al., 2014</xref>). Animal studies provide evidence for the causal effect of social relationships on brain development. For instance, adolescent rodents with deprivation of peer contacts showed brain level changes including reduced synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orben et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the brain associative pattern of close friend quantity in children with no more than five close friends was correlated with the density of the μ-opioid receptor, as well as the expression of OPRM1 and OPRK1 genes. It is known that the endogenous opioid system has a vital role in social affiliative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Machin and Dunbar, 2011</xref>). Positron emission tomography studies in human revealed that μ-opioid receptor regulation in brain regions such as the amygdala, anterior insula, and the ACC may preserve and promote emotional well-being in the social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>). Variation in the OPRM1 gene was associated with individual differences in rejection sensitivity, which was mediated by dorsal ACC activity in social rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Way et al., 2009</xref>). OPRM1 variation was also related to social hedonic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Troisi et al., 2011</xref>). Pain tolerance, which is associated with activation of the μ-opioid receptor, was correlated with social network size in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson and Dunbar, 2016</xref>). Social behaviors like social laughter and social touch increase pleasurable sensations and triggered endogenous opioid release to maintain social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunbar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manninen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nummenmaa et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the opioid system has found to be associated with major psychiatric disorders especially depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peciña et al., 2019</xref>), which may help explain the association between social relationships and mental health problems.</p><p>Several issues should be taken into account when considering our findings. First, as an association study, no causal conclusion should be made in this study. It is unclear whether the number of close friends drives the social brain development or whether children with larger social brains tend to have more close friends. A bidirectional relationship has been reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunbar and Shultz, 2007</xref>). Second, it is worth noting that the measures used in the ABCD study and the social network dataset differed, and the breakpoints identified in each dataset were not equivalent. However, relative to the optimal number of close friends, the primary objective of the current study was to examine the nonlinear relationship between the number of close friend and different behavioral outcomes and brain structure. In this sense, the findings from both datasets were similar, and the social network dataset provided valuable information regarding friendship measures and objective cognitive index that extended the results obtained from the ABCD study. Third, the quality of close friendships was not considered in the ABCD study. However, reciprocal degree is an indirect measure of friendship quality, which was found to be linearly associated with well-being and nonlinearly related to the GPA in the social network dataset. It has been reported that the relationship between having more friends and fewer depressive symptoms in adolescence is mediated by a sense of belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ueno, 2005</xref>). Although current findings on the relative importance of friendship quantity and quality are inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruine de Bruin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Platt et al., 2014</xref>), it is essential for future studies to incorporate measures of close friendship quality and to test the potential interaction between quantity and quality. Finally, the interpretation of this study should be limited to the particular age range of late childhood and early adolescence, as well as Western culture. Further research is needed to explore whether the nonlinear relationship between the number of close friends and mental health and cognition, and the idea of having around five close friends as a breakpoint, can be generalized to other age ranges and cultures.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides new evidence going beyond previous research that a larger number of close friends up to a moderate level in late childhood is associated with better mental health and higher cognitive functions, and that this can be partly explained by the size of the social brain including the OFC and TPJ, and the endogenous opioid system. This study may have implications for targeted friendship interventions in the transition from late childhood to early adolescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants and behavioral measures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>The ABCD study</title><p>The ABCD study is tracking the brain development and health of a nationally representative sample of children aged 9–11 y from 21 centers throughout the United States (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://abcdstudy.org">https://abcdstudy.org</ext-link>).

At baseline, 8835 individuals from 7512 families (6225 [82.9%] with a child, 1252 [16.7%] with two children, 34 [0.5%] with three children, and 1 [0.01%] with four children) had complete behavioral and structural MRI data. To avoid the influence of family relatedness, we randomly picked only one child in each family, finally resulting in 7512 children, of whom 4290 had 2-year follow-up data.</p><p>Close friendships are characterized by enjoying spending time together, having fun, and trust. Participants were asked how many close friends that are boys and girls they have, respectively. Mental health problems were rated by the parent using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), which contains 20 empirically based subscales spanning emotional, social and behavioral domains in subjects aged 6–18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001</xref>). The CBCL has high inter-interviewer reliability, test–retest reliability, internal consistency, and criterion validity, and therefore is widely utilized by child psychiatrists, developmental psychologists, and other mental health professionals for clinical and research purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achenbach et al., 1987</xref>). Raw scores were used in analyses, higher scores indicating more severe problems. Cognitive functions were assessed by the NIH Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luciana et al., 2018</xref>), which has good reliability and validity in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akshoomoff et al., 2013</xref>). The toolbox consists of seven different tasks covering episodic memory, executive function, attention, working memory, processing speed, and language abilities, and also provides three composites of crystalized, fluid, and total intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weintraub et al., 2013</xref>). Uncorrected standard scores were used in analyses. All 10 cognitive scores were available at baseline, but only crystalized intelligence was collected 2 y later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Social network dataset</title><p>In order to extend the findings in the ABCD study, we utilized a publicly available dataset of a social network experiment, conducted among students in 56 middle schools in New Jersey, USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paluck et al., 2016</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/civicleads/studies/37070">https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/civicleads/studies/37070</ext-link>). All parents and students provided informed consent for the survey, and the research protocol was approved by the Princeton University Institutional Review Board. Participants were asked to report which other students (up to 10) in their school they chose to spend time with in the last few weeks, allowing us to generate a directed friendship network. Three kinds of network measures were created for each participant: (1) outdegree is a measure of sociability and refers to the number of friendship nominations that a participant made to other participants, (2) indegree is a measure of popularity and refers to the number of friendship nominations received from others, and (3) reciprocal degree refers to the number of outward nominations that are reciprocated by an inward nomination from the same person and to some extent reflects the quality of friendship. Well-being was assessed by three questions: ‘I feel like I belong at this school,’ ‘I have stayed home from school because of problems with other students,’ and ‘During the past month, I have often been bothered by feeling sad and down’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ren et al., 2022</xref>). Cognitive function was indirectly measured by the GPA on a 4.0 scale, obtained from school administrative records.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Structural MRI data</title><p>In the ABCD study, 3D T1- and T2-weighted structural images were collected using 3T scanners at 21 data collecting sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casey et al., 2018</xref>). The detailed preprocessing pipeline has been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gong et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, we used FreeSurfer v6.0 to preprocess the minimal preprocessed T1- and T2-weighted images downloaded from the ABCD study, including cortical surface reconstruction, subcortical segmentation, smoothed by a Gaussian kernel (FWHM = 10 mm), and estimation of morphometric measures (i.e., cortical area, thickness, and volume). Then, the cortical surface of each subject was registered to a standard fsaverage space and parcellated into 180 cortical regions per hemisphere as defined in the Human Connectome Project multimodal parcellation (HCP-MMP) atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>). Volumetric reconstructions of subcortical structures were also obtained based on the Aseg atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischl et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Neurochemical data</title><p>Fourteen receptors and transporters across eight different neurotransmitter systems (serotonin: 5HT1a, 5HT1b, 5HT2a, 5HT4, and 5HTT; dopamine: D1, D2, and DAT; GABA: GABAa; glutamate: mGluR5; norepinephrine: NAT; cannabinoid: CB1; opioid: MOR; acetylcholine: VAChT) were investigated. Density estimates were derived from average group maps of healthy volunteers scanned in prior PET and SPECT studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All density maps were downloaded online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/juryxy/JuSpace/tree/JuSpace_v1.3/JuSpace_v1.3/PETatlas">https://github.com/juryxy/JuSpace/tree/JuSpace_v1.3/JuSpace_v1.3/PETatlas</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dukart et al., 2021</xref>), which had been registered and normalized into the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and linearly rescaled to 0–100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dukart et al., 2021</xref>). For comparability, the HCP atlas in fsaverage space was converted to individual surface space (‘mri_surf2surf’) of the MNI brain template ch2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rorden and Brett, 2000</xref>) which was preprocessed by Freesurfer (‘recon-all’), and then was projected to volume (‘mri_label2vol’). The density maps were parcellated into the 360 cortical regions as the structural MRI data according to the volume-based HCP-MMP atlas. Specifically, for the μ-opioid receptor, occipital cortex served as the reference region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kantonen et al., 2020</xref>) and was therefore excluded in analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Transcriptomic data</title><p>Gene expression data was from six neurotypical adult brains in the Allen Human Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hawrylycz et al., 2012</xref>). We focused on the opioid receptor genes (i.e., OPRM1 and OPRK1). The preprocessed transcriptomic data were imported from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnatkeviciute et al., 2019</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6852911">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6852911</ext-link>), including probe-to-gene re-annotation, intensity-based data filtering, and probe selection using RNA-seq data as a reference. Then, samples were assigned to brain regions according to the volume-based HCP-MMP atlas, and expression values were averaged within each region. Since right hemisphere data were only available for two donors, analyses were conducted on the left hemisphere only, finally resulting in 177 brain regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Nonlinear association analysis</title><p>The nonlinear associations of close friendship quantity with mental health, cognition, and brain structure were investigated. The quantity of close friendship was log-transformed [log<sub>10</sub>(x + 1)] in analyses as it has a skewed distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hobbs et al., 2016</xref>). Two different analytic approaches were used to robustly evaluate the nonlinear relationships. First, we fitted a quadratic regression model (y = bx<sup>2</sup>+ ax + c) with close friendship quantity as the independent variable. Close friendship quantity was mean-centered to ensure that the linear (a) and quadratic (b) terms were orthogonal. Three statistical parameters were of interest: a total <italic>F</italic>-value of linear and quadratic terms, reflecting the association between close friendship quantity and the measure of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2022</xref>); the quadratic term, indicating the presence of a nonlinear association; and the linear term. The effect size of the quadratic term was calculated by the change in the overall proportion of variance (adjusted R<sup>2</sup>) between the quadratic model and the corresponding linear model, and the effect size of the linear term was the ΔR<sup>2</sup> between the linear model and the model with only covariates. The model fits of quadratic and linear models were compared by ANOVA. Although quadratic regression is widely used in psychosocial studies to detect the presence of nonlinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nook et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ren et al., 2022</xref>), simulation studies showed that this approach for testing a U-shaped effect has a high false positive rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simonsohn, 2018</xref>). Therefore, we conducted a two-lines test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simonsohn, 2018</xref>) once a significant quadratic term was found, which could estimate a data-driven breakpoint. We then split the data accordingly to fit two linear models, respectively. If the segment slopes have opposite signs and both of them are significant, a U-shaped relation exists. Same analytic approaches were used in behavioral and neuroimaging analyses. In the ABCD study, sex, age, parent education level, household income, ethnicity, puberty, body mass index (BMI), and site were used as covariates of no interest for the behavioral analyses. For the neuroimaging analyses, we additionally controlled for handedness, head motion, and MRI manufacturer. In the social network dataset, we controlled for sex, age, grade, whether the subject was or was not new to the school, and whether or not most friends went to this school. Bonferroni correction was used in behavioral analyses, and FDR correction was used in neuroimaging analyses.</p><p>Several sensitivity analyses were performed. To examine the potential sex influence, we conducted nonlinear association analyses in male and female, respectively. The effect of the sex of close friends was tested by separating close friends into same-sex and opposite-sex ones. To validate the findings from data at baseline and to test the hypothesis of stationarity for cross-lagged panel models (CLPM), we replicated the same analyses using the cross-sectional data collected at 2 y later. For neuroimaging analyses, if significant nonlinear associations were detected, we also conducted linear regression models in two groups split by the average breakpoint, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Spatial correlation with neurotransmitter density and gene expression</title><p>Unthresholded <italic>t</italic>-statistic maps of brain structure associated with close friendship quantity in two groups (i.e., split by the average breakpoint) were used to correlate with neurotransmitter density and gene expression level by Spearman’s rank correlation. Bootstrapping was performed to ensure the robustness, and the significance was tested by 5000 times permutation, in which the correlation was re-computed using null <italic>t</italic>-statistic maps obtained by label shuffling for close friendship quantity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Cross-lagged panel analysis</title><p>Longitudinal relationships of close friendship quantity with ADHD symptoms (i.e., cbcl_scr_syn_attention) and crystalized intelligence were investigated using classic two-wave CLPMs implemented by Mplus 7.0. Firstly, we conducted CLPMs using the absolute value of the difference between close friendship quantity and the breakpoint, and then established CLPMs for participants with the quantity of close friendship ≤breakpoint and &gt;breakpoint at baseline, respectively. We controlled for several stable (i.e., sex, parent education level, ethnicity, and site) and time-variant variables (i.e., age, household income, and puberty) in these models. The CLPMs met important assumptions such as synchronicity and stationarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baribeau et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kenny, 1975</xref>). The model parameters were estimated by the full information maximum likelihood method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muthén et al., 1987</xref>). The model fit was evaluated by the Tucker–Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR), and interpreted using common thresholds of good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu and Bentler, 1999</xref>). All CLPMs reported in the current study have a good model fit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Mediation analysis</title><p>We used the baseline data in the ABCD study to test the associations between close friendship quantity, ADHD symptoms, crystalized intelligence, and brain structure. The total area of the significant brain regions was used as the mediator. Variables were normalized and then entered into the model. Sex, age, parent education level, household income, ethnicity, pubertal status, BMI, handedness, head motion, MRI manufacturer, and site were used as covariates of no interest. In addition to the total area, the mediation effect of individual significant regions was also evaluated, the p-values of the mediation effect corrected by FDR correction. Total, direct, and indirect associations were estimated by bootstrapping 10,000 times, and the 95% bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval (CI) was reported. Analyses were performed using the R mediation package.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>In the ABCD study, parents' full written informed consent and all children's assent were obtained by each center.

More information would be helpful for the reader. Could you give a breakdown on all variables for the 2 groups (on the breakpoint of over and under 5 friends)? Are other, potentially relevant, variables available for the two groups? For example, position in family, family size, urban vs. rural dwelling etc. Perhaps rural dwellers have fewer opportunities to have a large circle of close friends, and perhaps rural dwellers are systematically different in other ways (e.g., diet, mental health).</p><p>I have little expertise with cross-lagged panel models; can you confirm that the statistical assumptions needed for CLPMs have been met?</p><p>I didn't find the inclusion of the second dataset especially convincing. I appreciate that ABCD is unique (and therefore finding a replication sample is very challenging), but the social network dataset was quite different in the measures used. After reading the manuscript I was left with the impression that calling the social network dataset results a 'validation' was somewhat of a stretch. The results of two datasets were broadly similar (breakpoint at 5 in ABCD, ~8 outward nomination in the social network dataset) rather than a validation per se.</p><p>In places, the phrasing is such that the reader could infer a direction of the effect in the cross-sectional results (e.g., line 173: &quot;The ideal number of close friends was 5 and the closer to that number, the better *for* participants' mental health.&quot; [my emphasis]).</p><p>This is not a limitation of your study but, as I mentioned in the public review, the effect sizes are very small.

In the present study, we used the most basic CLPM which includes two constructs measured at two time points. Several important assumptions need to be met for CLPM (Baribeau et al., 2022; Kenny, 1975).</p><p>1) The synchronicity assumption requires that all measurements at each time point occurred at the same time, which is met for the data collection in the ABCD study.</p><p>2) Stationarity requires variables and relationships stay the same across time. We have confirmed that ADHD symptoms and crystalized intelligence were nonlinearly related to the number of close friends, with a breakpoint of around 5 close friends, at both baseline and 2-year follow-up (see the Results section).</p><p>3) Measurement error: The variables are assumed to be measured without error. However, it is difficult to assess measurement error directly. The assessments of ADHD symptoms and crystalized intelligence in the ABCD study are reliable and valid, which is helpful to minimize the measurement error.</p><p>4) Linearity: Relations between variables of interest are linear. We fitted CLPMs using the absolute difference of close friend quantity and the breakpoint, and CLPMs in participants with ≤5 and &gt;5 close friends, respectively. Although we found nonlinear relationships of the number of close friends with ADHD symptoms and crystalized intelligence, the associations within groups by the breakpoint is linear.</p><p>5) A sufficient sample size of 200 participants has been proposed for CLPMs with two waves.

For the maximum likelihood method, a cutoff value close to 0.95 for TFI and CFI, a cutoff value close to 0.06 for RMSEA and 0.08 for SRMR indicate a good fit (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999).

The model fit was evaluated by the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR), and interpreted using common thresholds of good fit (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999).

Indeed, it is impossible to infer a direction of the effect from cross-sectional data, as such data do not allow for the assessment of temporal precedence between variables. Further revisions shown in the paper:</p><p>“Both mental health and cognition were positively associated with close friend quantity, with an ideal number of around 5.” (see Lines 171-173, Page 9)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Can you put effect sizes more into context for the reader (i.e., what do results of these magnitudes mean in the real world)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the large sample size derives low P-values for even small effect sizes. Therefore, we reported effect sizes of the quadratic and linear terms calculated by the change in the adjusted R<sup>2</sup>. For example, at baseline, the greatest effect sizes of quadratic terms were observed for social problems and total intelligence. The results showed that the quadratic term of close friend quantity additionally explained 0.43% and 0.50% of the variability, respectively, compared with the corresponding linear models. Complex psychological factors are typically determined by a multitude of causes, and any individual cause is likely to have only a small effect (Götz et al., 2022). Although the effect size is small, our primary aim is to investigate the nonlinear links between the number of close friend, mental health, and cognition, as the effect of the friendship network size at the high end remains largely unexplored in children and adolescent. We utilized two independent datasets of large sample sizes and different statistical approaches to show that the nonlinear associations are reliable and solid to various confounders. As the friendship quantity is a modifiable factor, a small but reliable effect size can be valuable.</p><p>To further contextualize the effect sizes, we have included the following in the Results:</p><p>“For mental health, the greatest effect sizes of the quadratic terms were observed for social problems (β = 0.08, t = 5.92, p = 3.3⨉10<sup>-9</sup>, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.43%) and attention problems (β = 0.12, t = 5.83, p = 5.8⨉10<sup>-9</sup>, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.42%), suggesting that the quadratic term of close friend quantity additionally explained 0.43% and 0.50% of the variability compared with the corresponding linear model.” (Lines 159-164, Pages 8-9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Provide a rationale for 5 friends as the breakpoint when the curve appears u-shaped. Looking at Figure 2, there is a grouping of close friend size between ~2 to ~10 (i.e., the bottom of the u is quite flat there). Although the breakpoint is 5 close friends, could one argue that poorer outcomes tend to occur at a higher number of close friends? That is, problems start when the slope of the upward curve starts to steepen (this would also suggest a result more closely aligned with the social network dataset, albeit the measures are different)?</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we conducted two-lines tests to detect U-shaped relationships, which involves a sign change, to complement the estimation of quadratic regression models. The Robin Hood algorithm is used to set a breakpoint to maximize the statistical power for U-shape testing instead of fitting the data as well as possible. Thus, the algorithm determines a breakpoint that will increase the statistical strength of the weaker of the two lines by allocating more observations to that segment without overly attenuating its slope (Simonsohn, 2018). We found the breakpoints for mental health and cognition ranged from 4 to 6 close friends, with an average of 4.89 ± 0.68 (Figure 2h).</p><p>However, we acknowledge the Reviewer's concern that poorer outcomes may occur at higher numbers of close friends. As we have clarified, the primary objective of our study is to examine the nonlinear relationships between the number of close friends, mental health, and cognition rather than determining the optimal number of close friends. Therefore, we have now revised our statement of the breakpoint to &quot;around 5&quot; or “approximately 5” in the manuscript, and provided additional explanations in the Discussion.</p><p>“Second, it is worth noting that the measures used in the ABCD study and the social network dataset differed, and the breakpoints identified in each dataset were not equivalent. However, relative to the optimal number of close friends, the primary objective of the current study was to examine the nonlinear relationship between the number of close friend and different behavioral outcomes and brain structure.” (Lines 364-369, Page 18)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Include some more information on the specific age-range that you are interested in for the study in the introduction/discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive comment. We have revised the Introduction to make it more focused on the specific age-range of interest by updating the reference and adding the specific age-range when citing it. Additionally, we have clarified the theoretical framework by explaining the rationale behind assessing the social brain.</p><p>“For now, only a few empirical studies have examined the nonlinear association between social relationships, mental health, and cognition in children and adolescents. For instance, a large study of a nationally representative sample in the United States reported that adolescents with either too many or too few friends had higher levels of depressive symptoms (Falci &amp; McNeely, 2009).” (Lines 77-81, Pages 4-5)</p><p>“Despite a large body of evidence linking friendships to mental health and cognition, we know relatively little about the underlying mechanisms involved (Pfeifer &amp; Allen, 2021). The social brain hypothesis proposes that the evolution of brain size is driven by complex social selection pressures (Dunbar &amp; Shultz, 2007). Animal studies have shown that social network size can predict the volume of the mid-superior temporal sulcus (Sallet et al., 2011; Testard et al., 2022), a region in which neurons respond to socially relevant stimuli such as face expression and head movement to make or break social contact (Hasselmo, Rolls, &amp; Baylis, 1989; Hasselmo, Rolls, Baylis, et al., 1989). In human neuroimaging studies, several key brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, i.e. orbitofrontal [OFC] and anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]), the cortex in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), amygdala, and the anterior insula, have been implicated in social cognitive processes (Frith &amp; Frith, 2007). Moreover, there has been an increasing number of studies dedicated to investigating the social brain in children and adolescents over the past decade (Andrews et al., 2021; Burnett et al., 2011).</p><p>At the molecular level, the μ-opioid receptor is widely distributed in the brain, particularly in regions associated with social pain such as the ACC and anterior insula (Baumgärtner et al., 2006). Recent studies have identified the crucial role of μ-opioid receptors in forming and maintaining friendships (Dunbar, 2018), and variations in the μ-opioid receptor gene have been related to individual differences in rejection sensitivity (Way et al., 2009). In addition, other neurotransmitters including dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and noradrenaline may interact with the opioids, and are involved in social affiliation and social behavior (Machin &amp; Dunbar, 2011). Dysregulation of the social brain and neurotransmitter systems is also implicated in the pathophysiology of major psychiatric disorders (Porcelli et al., 2019). Taken together, it is suggested that changes in the social brain might explain the relationship between social connections and mental health (Lamblin et al., 2017). However, the empirical evidence on this topic is limited in late childhood and adolescence.” (Lines 89-117, Pages 5-6)</p><p>We have also rewritten the Discussion to make the main messages in each paragraph clear.</p><p>“Social relationships play a double-edged role for mental health. Previous research has primarily focused on the positive aspects of social relationships, while the negative effects have received comparatively less attention (Song et al., 2021). In our study, we identified a robust nonlinear association of close friend quantity with various mental health and cognitive outcomes in the ABCD study at baseline and 2-year follow-up, and an independent social network dataset. This result demonstrates the persistence of the findings. The findings are in line with past studies, which showed that too large a social network size or too frequent social contacts were not positively correlated with well-being in adults (Kushlev et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2022; Stavrova &amp; Ren, 2021) and were even negatively correlated with mental health in adolescents (Falci &amp; McNeely, 2009). One explanation is that an individual’s cognitive capacity and time limit the size of the social network that an individual can effectively maintain (Dunbar, 2018). People devote about 40% of their total social efforts (e.g., time and emotional capital) to just their 5 most important people (Bzdok &amp; Dunbar, 2020). In a phone-call dataset of almost 35 million users and 6 billion calls, a layered structure was found with the innermost layer having an average of 4.1 people (Mac Carron et al., 2016). There is a trade-off between the quantity and quality of friendships, with an increased number of close friends potentially leading to less intimacy. Meanwhile, spending too much time on social activities may lead to insufficient time for study and thereby to lower academic performance. Second, adolescents are particularly susceptible to peer influence (Berndt, 1979). Researchers have found that the presence of a peer may increase risk-taking behaviors which can be detrimental to mental health (Chein et al., 2011), and reduce cognitive performance (Wolf et al., 2015). Having more close friends may increase the possibility of this kind of influence.</p><p>Our study revealed a significant link between the number of close friends and the cortical areas of social brain regions in the largest sample of children to date. Studies suggest that two major systems in the brain related to social behavior include the affective system of the ACC, the anterior insula, and the OFC, and the mentalizing system typically involving the TPJ (Güroğlu, 2022; Schmälzle et al., 2017). The dorsal ACC and anterior insula play an important role in social pain (i.e., painful feelings associated with social disconnection) (Eisenberger, 2012). The OFC receives information about socially relevant stimuli such as face expression and gesture from the cortex in the superior temporal sulcus (Hasselmo, Rolls, &amp; Baylis, 1989; Pitcher &amp; Ungerleider, 2021), and is involved in social behavior by representing social stimuli in terms of their reward value (Rolls, 2019a, 2019b; Rolls et al., 2006). The volume of the OFC is associated with social network size, partly mediated by mentalizing competence (Powell et al., 2012). Previous meta-analysis studies report an overlap in brain activation between all mentalizing tasks in the mPFC and posterior TPJ (Schurz et al., 2014). Notably, in our study, the positive relationship at the brain level only held for the children with no more than approximately 5 close friends, which is consistent with the behavioral findings. Furthermore, in these children, the areas of social brain regions partly mediated the relationship of the close friend quantity with ADHD symptoms and crystalized intelligence. Research also indicates that the brain regions regulating social behavior undergo structural development during adolescence (Blakemore, 2008; Lamblin et al., 2017; Mills et al., 2014). Animal studies provide evidence for the causal effect of social relationships on brain development. For instance, adolescent rodents with deprivation of peer contacts showed brain level changes including reduced synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orben et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the brain associative pattern of close friend quantity in children with no more than five close friends was correlated with the density of the μ-opioid receptor, as well as the expression of OPRM1 and OPRK1 genes. It is known that the endogenous opioid system has a vital role in social affiliative processes (Machin &amp; Dunbar, 2011). Positron emission tomography studies in human revealed that μ-opioid receptor regulation in brain regions such as the amygdala, anterior insula, and the ACC may preserve and promote emotional well-being in the social environment (Hsu et al., 2013). Variation in the OPRM1 gene was associated with individual differences in rejection sensitivity, which was mediated by dorsal ACC activity in social rejection (Way et al., 2009). OPRM1 variation was also related to social hedonic capacity (Troisi et al., 2011). Pain tolerance, which is associated with activation of the μ-opioid receptor, was correlated with social network size in humans (Johnson &amp; Dunbar, 2016). Social behaviors like social laughter and social touch increase pleasurable sensations and triggered endogenous opioid release to maintain social relationships (Dunbar, 2010; Manninen et al., 2017; Nummenmaa et al., 2016). Additionally, the opioid system has found to be associated with major psychiatric disorders especially depression (Peciña et al., 2019), which may help explain the association between social relationships and mental health problems.” (Lines 291-358, Pages 15-18)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

In the social network dataset, as no well-documented mental health questionnaire was available, we used three binary questions as Ren et al.’s study (Ren et al., 2022) to measure well-being.

Cognitive functions were assessed by the NIH Toolbox (Luciana et al., 2018), which has good reliability and validity in children (Akshoomoff et al., 2013).

More information would be helpful for the reader. Could you give a breakdown on all variables for the 2 groups (on the breakpoint of over and under 5 friends)? Are other, potentially relevant, variables available for the two groups? For example, position in family, family size, urban vs. rural dwelling etc. Perhaps rural dwellers have fewer opportunities to have a large circle of close friends, and perhaps rural dwellers are systematically different in other ways (e.g., diet, mental health).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the helpful comment. We have now revised Table 1 to show detailed demographic characteristics at baseline in terms of the breakpoint of 5 close friends and the statistical differences between two groups (please see Table 1 below). According to the Reviewer’s suggestion, we also provided information of family size reported by the parent (question: “How many people are living at your address? INCLUDE everyone who is living or staying at your address for more than 2 months.”), and urbanicity by externally linked to census data. The Census Bureau identifies two types of urban areas, including urbanized areas of 50,000 or more people and urban clusters of at least 2500, but less than 50,000 people. In the ABCD study, we found children with no more than 5 close friends have slightly larger family while no difference of urbanicity compared with children with more than 5 close friends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have little expertise with cross-lagged panel models; can you confirm that the statistical assumptions needed for CLPMs have been met?</p></disp-quote><p>This suggestion has been addressed in the first question in Essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I didn't find the inclusion of the second dataset especially convincing. I appreciate that ABCD is unique (and therefore finding a replication sample is very challenging), but the social network dataset was quite different in the measures used. After reading the manuscript I was left with the impression that calling the social network dataset results a 'validation' was somewhat of a stretch. The results of two datasets were broadly similar (breakpoint at 5 in ABCD, ~8 outward nomination in the social network dataset) rather than a validation per se.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the social network dataset is not a direct out-of-sample validation as the measures of mental health and cognition are not identical to those in the ABCD due to the data limitation. However, as we stated before, the primary aim of the present study is to investigate the potential nonlinear relationship between close friend quantity and various mental health and cognitive outcomes. In this sense, we think the findings in these two independent datasets were similar. Moreover, the friendship measures obtained from a directed friendship network in the social network datasets are informative and could be a complementary to the one question of close friend quantity used in the ABCD study. Therefore, we think utilizing the social network dataset extends findings in the ABCD study. We have now avoided to use the term of validation and discussed this limitation in the manuscript.</p><p>“Second, it is worth noting that the measures used in the ABCD study and the social network dataset differed, and the breakpoints identified in each dataset were not equivalent. However, relative to the optimal number of close friends, the primary objective of the current study was to examine the nonlinear relationship between the number of close friend and different behavioral outcomes and brain structure.

That is, problems start when the slope of the upward curve starts to steepen (this would also suggest a result more closely aligned with the social network dataset, albeit the measures are different)?
