These interactions produce unique compounds, increase virulence and augment antibiotic resistance. One community associated with negative healthcare outcomes consists of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. When co-cultured, virulence factors secreted by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> reduce metabolism and growth in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. When grown in vitro, this allows <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to drive <italic>S. aureus</italic> toward extinction. However, when found in vivo, both species can co-exist. Previous work has noted that this may be due to altered gene expression or mutations. However, little is known about how the growth environment could influence the co-existence of both species. Using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation, we show that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine the final population composition. We found that changing the carbon source in growth media affects the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, a metric we call absolute growth. We found that as a growth environment increases the absolute growth for one species, that species will increasingly dominate the co-culture. This is due to interactions between growth, metabolism, and metabolism-altering virulence factors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Finally, we show that the relationship between absolute growth and the final population composition can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. Our results demonstrate that differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species in the literature, provides support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, and may offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Infections caused by multiple types of bacteria are tough to treat.

It is more common to find them as part of diverse polymicrobial communities comprised of multiple microbial species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peters et al., 2012</xref>). Interactions within these communities can be synergistic or antagonistic. While cooperation can augment the stability of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavaliere et al., 2017</xref>), competition amongst community members can stimulate the expression of gene products in an effort to drive competitors toward extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 1999</xref>). In both cases, these interactions can produce novel behaviors that are not otherwise observed when community members are grown in isolation. On the one hand, they can have beneficial functions; they can produce useful products, such as biofuels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mittermeier et al., 2023</xref>), and degrade harmful environmental pollutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brune and Bayer, 2012</xref>). On the other hand, they can produce behaviors detrimental to human welfare, including augmented virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stacy et al., 2014</xref>) and increased antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perez et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, understanding the general principles that shape the interactions and co-existence of members within a polymicrobial community has wide-ranging implications, such as enhancing the production of beneficial products, and strategies to attenuate antibiotic resistance.</p><p>One polymicrobial community that is commonly observed in the clinic and is of increasing concern owing to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains is composed of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. These bacteria co-colonize burns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Norbury et al., 2016</xref>), individuals with cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sagel et al., 2009</xref>), and chronic infection sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Serra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pastar et al., 2013</xref>). Their co-occurrence leads to significantly worse healthcare outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hotterbeekx et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maliniak et al., 2016</xref>), including increased inflammation during pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sagel et al., 2009</xref>) and increased wound healing time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pastar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dalton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Seth et al., 2012</xref>). The interactions between <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are well understood and, at a fundamental level, influence the growth and metabolism of both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Their co-culture induces interspecies competition, which enhances antibiotic resistance and virulence. In the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic> upregulates the expression of virulence factors, including staphylococcal protein A, α-hemolysis and Panton-Valentine leucocidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pastar et al., 2013</xref>). While <italic>S. aureus</italic> can initially aid in the establishment of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2018</xref>), production of N-acetylglucosamine from <italic>S. aureus</italic> augments the virulence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by upregulating expression of multiple secreted virulence factors. Many of these are regulated by quorum sensing and include pyocyanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korgaonkar and Whiteley, 2011</xref>), pyoverdine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orazi et al., 2019</xref>), 2-Heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Machan et al., 1992</xref>), and 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Déziel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nadal Jimenez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Korgaonkar et al., 2013</xref>). Some of these virulence factors reduce metabolism in <italic>S. aureus</italic> through multiple mechanisms. Pyocyanin induces the production of reactive oxygen species in <italic>S. aureus</italic> by reacting with menadione, which results in oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noto et al., 2017</xref>). Pyocyanin has been found to interfere with electron transport, reducing respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2009</xref>). The siderophores pyoverdine and pyochelin drive <italic>S. aureus</italic> into fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filkins et al., 2015</xref>). While exposure to HQNO can initially promote biofilm formation in <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fugère et al., 2014</xref>), it eventually interferes with the activity of cytochrome b, which reduces ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen and Oglesby-Sherrouse, 2016</xref>). N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3OC12HSL) produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> for the purposes of quorum sensing has been shown to reduce the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qazi et al., 2006</xref>). Overall, multiple virulence factors interfere with growth and metabolism in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, ultimately leading to facultative respiration and increased antibiotic tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeLeon et al., 2014</xref>). Without a fast-growing competitor, and with additional nutrients released by <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mashburn et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can increase its growth and density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Overall, co-occurrence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> alters growth and metabolism, which ultimately results in a highly virulent and antibiotic-resistant infection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Carbon source in the growth medium affects growth and metabolism in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>; together this determines absolute growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Core interactions that affect growth and metabolism of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (red) and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (yellow) when in co-culture.

However, during adolescence and into adulthood, the frequency of <italic>S. aureus</italic> decreases, while the frequency of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filkins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajan and Saiman, 2002</xref>). One leading hypothesis to explain this trend is that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> outcompetes <italic>S. aureus</italic> through the production of HQNO and siderophores. Indeed, when co-cultured in vitro, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has been shown to competitively exclude <italic>S. aureus</italic> over 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filkins et al., 2015</xref>). However, long-term co-existence of these species has been observed in infected hosts, which has prompted investigations into mechanisms that can account for these conflicting observations. For example, overproduction of alginate by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Limoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Price et al., 2020</xref>), upregulation of super-oxide dismutase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Treffon et al., 2018</xref>), decreased production of HQNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frydenlund Michelsen et al., 2016</xref>), and spatial segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeLeon et al., 2014</xref>) are expected to facilitate co-existence. Differences in growth environments have also been suggested to play a role in facilitating co-existence. These include differences in environmental albumin concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Smith et al., 2017</xref>) and the production of proteins by the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wakeman et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, previous work has demonstrated that differences in nutrient availability in the growth environment can affect growth and metabolism of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pereira and Berry, 2017</xref>). Indeed, the presence of different nutrients and metabolites in host microenvironment has been previously shown to impact metabolism and growth of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maslowski, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjarnsholt et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, it is possible that differences in nutrients that define the growth environment can affect the co-existence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. A growth environment that provides for a high metabolic rate in <italic>S. aureus</italic> could potentially buffer it against virulence factors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that reduce metabolism and growth. In turn, this could facilitate co-existence and perhaps allow <italic>S. aureus</italic> to outcompete <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Alternatively, growth environments that reduce growth and metabolism of <italic>S. aureus</italic> could make that population more sensitive to these virulence factors, thus allowing dominance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and reducing co-existence. While these hypotheses are plausible, they have yet to be investigated. Thus, we ask whether growth environment-driven changes in growth rate and metabolism affect the co-existence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> in co-culture. Addressing the role of growth environment on species interactions has implications in the bottom-up design of polymicrobial communities and may lead to novel treatment strategies in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Carbon source defined growth environments affects the final ratio of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>S. aureus</italic></title><p>First, we used a microplate reader to produce growth curves that allowed us to separately quantify growth rate of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the presence of 12 different carbon sources. We chose to use different carbon sources to perturb growth and metabolism in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> as each species has different carbon source preferences. For example, glucose is a preferred carbon source for <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which results in fast growth and high metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halsey et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> prefers organic acids or amino acids and grows slower in glucose coinciding with a reduction in metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rojo, 2010</xref>). We observed that in almost all cases, with the exception of α-ketoglutarate, lactic acid, glycerol, and succinate, <italic>S. aureus</italic> had a significantly faster maximum growth rate as compared to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we quantified the concentration of ATP produced during mid-log phase and in the presence of different carbon sources using a bioluminescent assay. We note that ATP has been previously shown to be a strong correlate of other measures of metabolism, including oxygen consumption rate and the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopatkin et al., 2019</xref>). We observed a range of concentrations of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For example, when grown in medium containing glucose, glycerol, lactic acid, mannose, ribose, and sucrose, <italic>S. aureus</italic> had a significantly higher concentration of ATP compared to <italic>P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa</italic> had a significantly higher concentration of ATP when grown in the presence of acetate and α-ketoglutarate. For carbon sources of pyruvate, galactose, succinate, lactose, and sorbitol there was not a significant difference in the amount of ATP between the species.</p><p>To examine the combined influence of both growth and metabolism on the co-existence of both species we developed a metric called absolute growth, which we define as the ratio of [ATP] (μM) to growth rate (/hr). Examining the combined influence of both growth and metabolism is important as together they may impact the co-existence of both bacteria. For example, consider a carbon source that provides high metabolism and slow growth to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Here, <italic>S. aureus</italic> may be buffered against the effects of HQNO, pyoverdine and pyochelin, but may be outcompeted by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> owing to its slow growth. Alternatively, if a carbon source provides both fast metabolism and growth to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, it is likely to outcompete <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Importantly, previous work has demonstrated that growth and metabolism are not linearly correlated and that nutrient availability can alter the relationship between these two variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopatkin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manzoni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lahtvee et al., 2011</xref>). We found that, when provided with sucrose or mannose in the growth medium, <italic>S. aureus</italic> had a significantly greater absolute growth relative to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Conversely, when acetate, α-ketoglutarate, ribose, or pyruvate were provided in the growth medium, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> had a significantly greater absolute growth. Providing galactose, glucose, glycerol, lactic acid, lactose, succinate, or sorbitol did not result in a statistically significant difference in absolute growth between both species.</p><p>To directly compare absolute growth for a given carbon source and between both species, we determined the ratio of absolute growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Ratios &gt;1 indicate that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has a greater absolute growth, whereas ratios &lt;1 indicate that <italic>S. aureus</italic> has a greater absolute growth. We observed a range of absolute growth ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> had significantly higher absolute growth when sucrose or mannose was supplied in the growth medium. Alternatively, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> had significantly higher absolute growth when ribose, acetate, α-ketoglutarate, or pyruvate was included in the growth medium. Finally, we observed no significant difference in this ratio when galactose, glucose, glycerol, lactic acid, lactose, succinate, or sorbitol was included in the growth medium. Overall, changes in carbon source provided in the growth medium alter both growth rate and metabolism leading to differences in absolute growth between both bacterial species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Differences in absolute growth affect the final population composition of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title><p>To investigate how absolute growth impacts the co-existence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we chose seven representative carbon sources that spanned the range of observed absolute growth values. Thus, we chose carbon sources that favored <italic>S. aureus</italic> (sucrose), <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (pyruvate, ribose, α-ketoglutarate) or neither (lactic acid, glucose, succinate). We initiated a co-culture of both bacterial species with equal initial densities and grew them for 24 hours without shaking at 37 °C. Final bacterial density in colony forming units CFU/mL was measured using selective plating; cetrimide plates were used to select for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and mannitol salt agar plates were used to select for <italic>S. aureus</italic>. We then determined the final density ratio of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>S. aureus</italic>; values greater than one would indicate dominance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the growth environment. Conversely, values less than one would indicate dominance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the growth environment. We observed that differences in the absolute growth ratio determined the final population composition; as the ratio of absolute growth increased, thus increasingly favoring <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the final ratio of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>S. aureus</italic> significantly increased (p&lt;0.0001, R<sup>2</sup>=0.97, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This finding was consistent when we used a weighted least squares regression (WLS), which considers error along the y-axis when performing a regression (p&lt;0.0001). We also found significant differences amongst the final density ratio (p=0.0291 (Kruskal-Wallis, Shapiro-Wilk for normality, p&lt;0.0001)). We did not find a significant relationship between the final density ratio of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>S. aureus</italic> and [ATP] or growth rate of either species when plotted independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

When knockout strains lacking <italic>pqsL</italic> were co-cultured with <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the presence of glucose as the carbon source, there was a significant decrease (p≤0.0309 [Dunn’s test with control for joint ranks, Shapiro-Wilk; p&lt;0.0001]) in the final density ratio as compared to co-culture with wildtype <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Overall, this indicated that the production of HQNO, but not necessarily pyoverdine or pyochelin, plays a pivotal role in determining the interactions between <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in our experimental setup.</p><p>Toward understanding why differences in absolute growth affected the co-existence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we created a simple mathematical model consisting of three ordinary differential equations. The model considers the production of virulence factors (<italic>vir</italic>) by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that reduce growth and metabolism, and the growth and death of both species independently (see <italic>Methods</italic> for equations, model development and parameter estimation; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for parameters). Production of virulence factors is modeled as a modified Hill Equation that is scaled based on the density of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The growth of both bacterial species follows a modified logistic growth equation where growth is a product of basal growth rate, <italic>μ</italic>, and metabolism, <italic>ε</italic>. In general, <italic>ε</italic> approximates a maintenance coefficient, which refers to the amount of ATP that is not directly involved in generating biomass. The equation governing the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> is modified to account for the effect of virulence factors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Here, <italic>ε</italic> is scaled by the amount of virulence factors (<italic>vir</italic>) in the system; higher concentrations of virulence factors reduce the value of <italic>ε</italic>. This serves to reduce the entire growth term, thus reducing the rate at which <italic>S. aureus</italic> grows. Consistent with our experimental definition, absolute growth for each species can be determined by calculating <italic>ε</italic>/<italic>μ</italic>. Our model predicts that, over a wide range of value of <italic>μ</italic> and <italic>ε,</italic> increasing the ratio of absolute growth leads to an increase in the density of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> relative to <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The ratio of absolute growth predicts population composition in additional growth media</title><p>To determine if the relationship between the absolute growth ratio and the final density ratio held true in additional growth medium, we co-cultured <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> in modified synthetic minimal medium (AMM).

As above, we measured growth rate and the concentration of ATP in SCFM containing the seven representative carbon sources used in TSB. However, reliable quantification of growth rate for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> grown in SCFM with either succinate or α-ketoglutarate could not be achieved in our experimental setup. Thus, we focused our analysis on the five remaining carbon sources (glucose, sucrose, ribose, pyruvate, lactic acid). We found significant differences between both species in terms of their growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and the concentration of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). While only the use of ribose or sucrose as a carbon source led to a statistically significant difference in absolute growth between both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I</xref>), we continued to find a significant linear relationship between the final density ratio and the ratio of absolute growth (p=0.030, R<sup>2</sup>=0.83, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).

Previous work has indicated that the initial population composition can impact the long-term co-existence and composition of microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wright et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the ability to predict the formation of microbial communities based on early conditions can allow the prediction of long-term composition of microbial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meroz et al., 2021</xref>), which has implications in the rationale design of such communities and in infectious disease.</p><p>First, we used our mathematical model to simulate the effect of altering the initial ratio of both species. Our model predicts that, for a given absolute growth ratio, as the initial fraction of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> increases, the final population density of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> also increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Our model also predicts that, for a given initial density of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, increasing the absolute growth ratio increases the final density of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Interestingly, for a given absolute growth ratio, our model predicts an initial fraction of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that serves as a tipping point; if the initial fraction of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> exceeds this tipping point, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> will dominate the final population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Otherwise, if the initial fraction of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is below this tipping point, <italic>S. aureus</italic> will dominate the final population. The initial fraction of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that leads to this tipping point is determined by the absolute growth ratio; as this ratio increases, the initial fraction of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at the tipping point decreases. In other words, as the absolute growth ratio increases, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> will dominate the final population when initiated at lower initial fractions. We note that our model predicts that the amount of <italic>vir</italic> synthesized by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> increases based on both increasing initial density and an increasing absolute growth ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, inset).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Absolute growth determines tipping point of co-existence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> in co-culture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simulations showing the effect of changing the initial fraction of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic>) and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<italic>C<sub>s</sub></italic>) on the final density ratio.

For a given absolute growth ratio (e.g. 1), if the initial fraction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<italic>C<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.9) is much greater than <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> = 0.1), the amount of virulence factors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is insufficient to reduce the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, top left panel). Coupled with a higher initial starting density, this allows <italic>S. aureus</italic> to outcompete <italic>P. aeruginosa; S. aureus</italic> dominates the final population. As the initial fraction of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is increased, additional virulence factors are produced. Once <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> = 0.5) reaches an initial fraction that is sufficiently high to produce enough virulence factors to reduce the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<italic>C<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.5), <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> dominates the population after 24 hr of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, top center panel). Finally, if the initial fraction of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> = 0.9) is much greater than <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<italic>C<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.1) the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> is sufficiently hampered such that <italic>S. aureus</italic> does not grow appreciably and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> dominates the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, top right panel).</p><p>Our model predicts that, for a given initial density ratio (<italic>C<sub>p</sub></italic> = <italic>C<sub>s</sub></italic> = 0.5), increasing the absolute growth ratio benefits the growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. If the absolute growth ratio is sufficiently small (0.5), <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is unable to synthesize a high amount of virulence factors and grows slower than <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Slow growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> coupled with a low amount of virulence factors synthesized allows <italic>S. aureus</italic> to dominate the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom left panel). As the absolute growth ratio increases, it serves to benefit <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. At an intermediate absolute growth ratio (1), the amount of virulence factors produced is sufficient to reduce the growth rate of <italic>S. aureus</italic> while enhancing the growth rate of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Combined, this allows <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to dominate the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom center panel). Finally, when the absolute growth ratio is large (1.5), a high amount of virulence factors is produced, which substantially reduces the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The increase in absolute growth ratio serves to further increase the growth rate of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Together, this allows <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to significantly outcompete <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom right panel).</p><p>To confirm these modeling predictions, we grew <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> in co-culture as described above. We varied the initial percentage between both species and used five of the same carbon sources as used previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed that our experimental results match the qualitative predictions made by our model. First, we observed that, for all absolute growth ratios tested, as the initial percentage of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> increased, the final population density was increasingly dominated by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which resulted in a greater final density ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). If the initial percentage of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was sufficiently small, <italic>S. aureus</italic> could dominate the population, leading to a smaller final density ratio. Moreover, as predicted by our model, we found that, as the ratio of absolute growth increased, the greatest initial percentage of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> measured where neither <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> nor <italic>S. aureus</italic> dominated the population after 24 hr (or the tipping point) decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). For example, when grown in the presence of sucrose, of which <italic>S. aureus</italic> has a higher absolute growth, the greatest initial percentage of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> required such that its final density was not different than <italic>S. aureus</italic> after 24 hr of growth was 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Conversely, when grown in ribose, where <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has a higher absolute growth, the greatest initial percentage required for the density of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to be no different than <italic>S. aureus</italic> after 24 hr of growth was 20%, considerably smaller than sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Overall, both our model and experimental analysis indicate that interactions between initial population composition, the synthesis of virulence factors and absolute growth determined population composition after 24 hr of growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Spatial overlap and absolute growth affect co-existence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic></title><p>Previous work has shown that the relative distribution of bacteria that interact through small diffusible molecules or proteins, such as HQNO, can influence population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darch et al., 2018</xref>). In a stationary environment, if bacteria are positioned close together, the effective concentration of a small diffusible molecule sensed by the bacteria will be higher than if bacteria are positioned farther apart. Conversely, if the distribution of bacteria in the environment is homogenous, such as in a continuously shaken condition, the concentration of small diffusible molecules sensed will be roughly equal across the population. Furthermore, it has been previously shown that periodically disturbing the spatial structure of a bacterial population using a physical force not only serves to disrupt the distribution of bacteria but can also disrupt access to small diffusible molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Quinn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barraza et al., 2023</xref>). Given that diffusible virulence factors HQNO, pyoverdine and pyochelin influence the interactions between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we sought to determine how the distribution of bacteria, coupled with differences in absolute growth, determined the final population composition.</p><p>To understand the relationship between the distribution of bacteria, differences in absolute growth, and their impact on population composition, we modified our series of ODEs to include a spatial overlap term, <italic>δ</italic>, which scales the amount of virulence factor (<italic>vir</italic>) sensed by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. High values of <italic>δ</italic> indicate a high degree of spatial overlap between the two populations; decreasing <italic>δ</italic> indicates reduced overlap, which diminishes the amount of virulence factors sensed by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Experimentally, estimating <italic>δ</italic> would require the tracking of the positioning of multiple bacteria over both space and time whereupon a spatial overlap value could be extracted. Moreover, any movement of the plate for examination via microscopy would serve to disrupt the distribution of the cells, thus obscuring the results. Due to these challenges, we took a modeling approach to estimate trends in <italic>δ</italic>.</p><p>We used an agent-based model (ABM, see <italic>Methods</italic>) to estimate the extent of overlap of the two bacterial species. The simplified ABM consists of two populations of agents that are randomly placed in a world. The agents grow and die according to logistic growth. The agents also undergo a displacement event where the spatial positioning of the agents is perturbed at a given distance (called distance traveled). Increasing the number of displacement events per hour increases the degree to which the spatial positions of the agents are perturbed each hour of the simulation. In the absence of any disturbance events, the populations of bacteria do not move, which represents a stationary condition. When the number of disturbance events is very high, the population becomes well-mixed, which approximates a continuously shaken culture. An intermediate value of disturbance events would represent a population whose spatial overlap is perturbed periodically. After every hour of in silico simulation time using the ABM, we measure the extent of spatial overlap of the population frequency of cohabited patches minus the expected frequency of cohabited patches (frequency of patches inhabited by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> agents x frequency of patches inhabited by <italic>S. aureus</italic> agents). We call this metric ‘cohabitation’. A negative cohabitation value means that the populations spatially overlap less than expected based on random chance; a positive cohabitation value means that the populations overlap more than expected. The cohabitation variable is calculated every hour, which is then averaged across the 24 hr in silico time period.</p><p>We observed that, over a wide range of initial population densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and distances traveled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), cohabitation followed a biphasic trend; this value first decreases with increasing disturbance events whereupon it begins to increase with increasing disturbance events. When the number of disturbance events is low (0 /hr) or very high (50 /hr), cohabitation is high. Toward the former, this is owing to the slow relative breakdown of their initial high degree of overlap. Toward the latter, this is due to the well-mixed nature of the population where there is significant overlap between the agents. In between these two extremes the value of cohabitation is lower. This is owing to disturbance spreading-out populations and distributing cells to unoccupied areas to grow faster in the relative absence of competitors. As disturbance is infrequent, each agent spends more time in an unoccupied area over the course of the simulation, which reduces the value of cohabitation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Periodically disturbing co-cultured populations of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> determines their co-existence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simulation using our ABM showing the ‘cohabitation’ variable as a function of the number of disturbance events.

For simplicity, we kept the absolute growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> constant. We observed that at low values of absolute growth for <italic>P. aeruginosa, δ</italic> has little effect as <italic>S. aureus</italic> dominates the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, at higher values of absolute growth for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the value of <italic>δ</italic> affects the final population composition. If <italic>δ</italic> is sufficiently large, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> dominates the population. Otherwise, if <italic>δ</italic> is sufficiently small, such as observed at environments that are disturbed at intermediate frequencies, <italic>S. aureus</italic> dominates the population.</p><p>To understand these modeling predictions, we simulated temporal changes in cell density for both species independently and at three values of <italic>δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). When <italic>δ</italic> is small (0.1), which represents a co-culture disturbed at an intermediate frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), <italic>S. aureus</italic> grows quickly reaching a high density after 24 hr. This high growth rate is owing to a reduction in the amount of virulence factors that are sensed by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. At intermediate values of <italic>δ</italic> (0.5), which continues to represent a co-culture disturbed at an intermediate frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), the amount of virulence factors sensed by <italic>S. aureus</italic> increases, which reduces its overall growth rate. However, because the growth rate of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is sufficiently small owing to low absolute growth, <italic>S. aureus</italic> continues to dominate the population after 24 hr of growth. Finally, when <italic>δ</italic> is large (1), which represents a co-culture that is undisturbed (stationary) or very frequently disturbed (continuous shaking) the amount of virulence factors sensed by <italic>S. aureus</italic> is high. This significantly reduces its overall growth rate, allowing <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to outcompete it. Accordingly, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> dominates the population after 24 hr under this condition. Importantly, under each of these simulated conditions the total amount of virulence factor synthesized is not altered ([<italic>vir</italic>]=1.77 μM); only the concentration sensed by <italic>S. aureus</italic> is altered owing to changes in <italic>δ</italic>.</p><p>To test these predictions, we periodically disturbed co-cultured populations of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> using the linear shaking function of a microplate reader. We previously demonstrated that using this function could alter the spatial distribution of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Quinn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>). We grew both bacterial species using glucose as the carbon source as it represented an intermediate ratio of absolute growth. As above, when both bacteria species were initiated at equal percentages, the use of glucose allowed <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to dominate the population in the stationary condition. However, as predicted by our model, <italic>S. aureus</italic> dominated the final population composition over a range of intermediate disturbance frequencies (3 /hr-18/hr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). At disturbance frequencies of 1 /hr and 20 /hr, there was no significant difference in the density of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Finally, when co-cultures were perturbed continuously or not all (0 /hr), the final density of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was significantly greater than that of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. We note that <italic>S. aureus</italic> was observed to dominate the population at a disturbance frequency of 6 /hr at lower initial dilutions of the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, we also found that disturbance at 6 /hr shifted the tipping point of the population to a higher initial percentage of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as compared to the stationary condition (0 /hr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This finding was consistent both in silico (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, left panel) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, right panel). Consistent with the results observed in TSB medium, we found that disturbance at 6 /hr in SCFM allowed <italic>S. aureus</italic> to increase in density relative to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. This resulted in a reduction in the final density ratio. Continuous disturbance of co-cultures in SCFM allowed <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to dominate once again as evidenced by an increase in the final density ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated how changing absolute growth through the use of different carbon sources might impact the ability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to dominate at intermediate, but not high, disturbance frequencies, such as a continuously mixed population. Accordingly, we grew co-cultured populations of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in four additional carbon sources that spanned the range of absolute growths and disturbed these populations at a disturbance frequency of 6 /hr or continuously. As predicted by our model, at a disturbance frequency of 6 /hr, <italic>S. aureus</italic> dominated the population after 24 hr of growth regardless of the absolute growth ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, top panel). Under continuous shaking, we observed that as the ratio of absolute growth increased, the final density ratio increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, bottom panel). We note that we did not find a significant relationship between the final density ratio of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to <italic>S. aureus</italic> (at both 6 /hr and continuous disturbance) and the ratio of growth rates (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> growth rate/<italic>S. aureus</italic> growth rate or the ratio of [ATP]) (P. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> [ATP]/<italic>S. aureus</italic> [ATP]).</p><p>In both the 6 /hr and continuous disturbance conditions, metabolism altering virulence factors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> continues to have a predominant role in mediating the interaction between both bacterial species. When <italic>S. aureus</italic> was co-cultured with knockout strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Δ<italic>pqsL</italic>; Δ<italic>pvdA</italic>/Δ<italic>pchE</italic>; Δ<italic>pqsL</italic>/Δ<italic>pvdA</italic>/Δ<italic>pchE</italic>), growth with Δ<italic>pqsL</italic>/Δ<italic>pvdA</italic>/Δ<italic>pchE</italic> resulted in a significant decrease in the final density ratio when disturbed at 6 /hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, top panel). When disturbed continuously, co-culture with either Δ<italic>pqsL</italic> or Δ<italic>pqsL</italic>/Δ<italic>pvdA</italic>/Δ<italic>pchE</italic> led to a significant decrease in the final density ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, bottom panel). In both cases, the decrease in the final density ratio was owing to a relative increase in the density of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Consistent with our findings when co-cultured in the stationary condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), these findings generally implicate the production of HQNO in driving the dynamics between <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Overall, our simulations and experiments suggest that access to metabolite altering virulence factors driven by spatial organization and absolute growth can determine the final population composition of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Through a series of empirical and analytical investigations, we have shown that differences in absolute growth, a combined metric that encompasses the relationship between growth rate and metabolism, can determine the population composition of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. In a stationary environment, as the absolute growth ratio increases, the final density ratio of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> increases. The absolute growth ratio also determines the tipping point of the co-cultured population. Importantly, many virulence factors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (e.g., HQNO, pyocyanin) that impact growth and metabolism in <italic>S. aureus</italic> are regulated by quorum sensing. Quorum sensing involves the production and exchange of small diffusible molecules, called autoinducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Waters and Bassler, 2005</xref>). Since each <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacterium produces autoinducers, the concentration of autoinducer increases as a function of cell density. At a sufficiently high concentration, the autoinducer will activate expression of multiple virulence factors in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which begin to impact growth and metabolism in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Given this density-dependent activation of virulence factors, it is likely that the tipping point in our systems is being determined by quorum sensing, although we did not explicitly investigate this hypothesis in this manuscript.</p><p>While the ability of the absolute growth ratio to predict final population composition is also true in a continually disturbed environment, this relationship falls apart in a periodically disturbed environment. Our model and experiments suggest that this is owing to changes in access to metabolism altering virulence factors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>; in stationary or continuously disturbed environments, the spatial overlap of both bacteria is predicted to be high, which facilitates interactions between these virulence factors and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. However, in periodically disturbed environments, the overlap between bacteria is reduced; this limits interactions between <italic>S. aureus</italic> and virulence factors. <italic>S. aureus</italic> then dominates the population. Absolute growth appears to be the most accurate metric within the scope of our study to quantify the changes in the final ratio between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. While we did find a significant relationship between the final ratio of both species and the ratio of [ATP] of both species when grown in the stationary condition and in TSB medium, the relationship was not as strong as the absolute growth ratio (R<sup>2</sup>=0.97 (absolute growth ratio) vs. 0.79 ([ATP] ratio)). Moreover, we did not find a significant relationship between the final ratio of both species and the ratio of [ATP] when grown in TSB medium in the continuously disturbed condition, and in either AMM medium or SCFM in the stationary condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Given the clinical importance of co-infection with both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, multiple previous studies have identified mechanisms of co-existence. Indeed, long-term co-existence of both species can result in physiological changes that reduce their competitive interactions. Strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolated from patients that enter into a mucoid state show reduced production of siderophores, pyocyanin, rhamnolipids, and HQNO, which facilitates the survival of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Limoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frydenlund Michelsen et al., 2016</xref>). These strains can also overproduce the polysaccharide alginate, which in itself is sufficient to decrease the production of these virulence factors. Moreover, exogenously supplied alginate can reduce the production of pyoverdine and expression from the PQS quorum sensing system, which is responsible for the production of HQNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Price et al., 2020</xref>). Changes in the physiology of <italic>S. aureus</italic> can also facilitate co-existence. Strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis show multiple changes in the abundance of proteins including super oxide dismutase, the GroEL chaperone protein, and multiple surface-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Treffon et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of proteins that show changes in abundance in <italic>S. aureus</italic> are related to central metabolism, which is consistent with our findings demonstrating that metabolism can influence the co-existence of both species. While it is unclear as to how long-term co-culture would affect the ratio of absolute growth, our findings provide an additional mechanism that can determine the co-existence of these bacterial species.</p><p>Previous work has shown that niches in the human body, which can vary in environmental conditions, can promote bacterial growth and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fung et al., 2019</xref>). Spatiotemporal differences in nutrient availability within these niches can promote the growth of different bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pereira and Berry, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffman et al., 2010</xref>). Even within the same niche, such as sputum isolated from individuals with cystic fibrosis, the concentration of critical nutrients, such as amino acids and carbon sources, can differ from host to host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>). Variations in nutrient availability within or between niches may alter growth and metabolism of the resident bacteria, and may serve to perturb interactions within polymicrobial communities. In the case of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, differences in nutrient availability in sputum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>) or the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) may alter growth, metabolism and the interactions between these species. This could alter their co-existence dynamics leading to host and/or niche specific colonization dynamics. We note that our findings may be relevant to infections occurring in both high and low O<sub>2</sub> environments. While <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is limited in its ability to perform fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glasser et al., 2014</xref>), we have provided evidence that the absolute growth ratio can affect community composition in both aerobic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and more anaerobic environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The limited ability of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to grow in anaerobic environments was apparent in SCFM as we could not obtain reliable or robustly quantifiable growth of this bacteria when succinate or α-ketoglutarate was provided as a carbon source. One drawback of our approach in using different carbon sources to manipulate absolute growth is that some carbon sources are osmotically active, whereas others are not, which could have additional physiological effects on the bacteria outside of changing growth and metabolism. Moreover, both species of bacteria have different carbon source preferences; as above <italic>S. aureus</italic> tends to prefer carbon sources such as glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halsey et al., 2017</xref>), whereas <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> prefers organic and amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rojo, 2010</xref>). Given the carbon source preferences of each species, in complex medium such as TSB, there is the potential that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> consumes amino acids prior to consuming the supplied carbon source. This is perhaps less of a concern in AMM medium or SCFM where the concentration of amino acids and additional nutrient components is reduced as compared to TSB medium. Along this line, it is certainly worth investigating how each nutrient component and its ordered utilization by both species contributes to changes in absolute growth. Minor or transient changes in absolute growth owing to preferential nutrient consumption may provide windows of opportunity for one species to increase its relative density to the other. Nevertheless, differences between in vitro and in vivo growth and metabolism owing to the nutritional composition of the growth environment may also help account for differences in the co-existence dynamics reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filkins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rajan and Saiman, 2002</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously recognized that spatial organization facilitated by an undisturbed growth environment can facilitate the co-existence of bacteria, including <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barraza and Whiteley, 2021</xref>). Importantly, the production of HQNO from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can impact the pattern of spatial organization of this co-cultured population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barraza and Whiteley, 2021</xref>). While we did not explicitly quantify spatial organization experimentally owing to technical limitations of our microplate reader and microscope setups, in theory, co-culture in an undisturbed condition should facilitate the creation of spatial organization. We note that the use of microscopy would be a superior approach as compared to our ABM. We are currently working toward developing a system that would allow us to monitor the effect of disturbance on the spatial positioning of bacteria in real time. Nevertheless, we found that, in an undisturbed growth environment, the absolute growth ratio could predict the final population composition; increasing the absolute growth ratio increased the final density of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> relative to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. When disturbed periodically using a physical force, <italic>S. aureus</italic> dominated the final population composition. However, a clear trend between the absolute growth ratio and the final population composition was not observed when using a linear regression or WLS regression analysis. Our model suggests that these disturbances decrease the spatial overlap of both populations, and limit the amount of virulence factors that are sensed by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Importantly, physical forces that are encountered where bacteria can infect hosts, including luminal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thomas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lipowsky et al., 1978</xref>), can fluctuate, which could serve to periodically alter the spatial positions, or overlap, between both populations. Thus, the degree to which a population of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is disturbed may influence their ability to interact; this would impact the population composition. Importantly, we cannot rule out that increasing the amount of disturbances might have also impacted oxygenation of the medium, or caused unknown transcriptional responses in the bacteria. However, our model, and experiments using knockout strains, suggest that co-existence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in periodically disturbed environments is largely due to interactions governed by HQNO, and to a lesser extent, pyoverdine and pyochelin. While these disturbances have been previously shown to impact bacteria cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>) and the production of virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Quinn et al., 2021</xref>), to our knowledge, this is the study reporting that such disturbances can alter the population composition in a polymicrobial community. Thus, these disturbances represent a new method by which the composition, and potentially the functionality, of a polymicrobial community might be perturbed.</p><p>From an ecological perspective, our findings provide support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that the diversity of competing species is maximized at intermediate disturbance frequencies or intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connell, 1978</xref>). While the intermediate disturbance hypothesis has faced criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox, 2013</xref>), evidence of its influence on biodiversity has been observed multiple times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roxburgh et al., 2004</xref>), has helped to guide conservation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olff and Ritchie, 1998</xref>), and can help explain the establishment of invasive species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Catford et al., 2012</xref>). Herein, our results provide evidence that further supports the intermediate disturbance hypothesis; disturbance at intermediate frequencies facilitates the co-existence of both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus,</italic> whereas in continually and undisturbed environments <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> dominated the co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This observation was found in both TSB medium and SCFM suggesting that it is robust in multiple environments. While previous work has also found that intermediate disturbance can influence the biodiversity of bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brockhurst et al., 2007</xref>), our work provides additional support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis using two clinically important bacterial pathogens.</p><p>Co-culture of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> leads to changes in antibiotic susceptibility. For example, HQNO produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> interferes with ATP production in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This causes a reduction in the metabolism of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and increases its resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Importantly, a reduction in metabolism has been previously noted to decrease antibiotic efficacy across a wide range of bactericidal antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopatkin et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, HQNO can also increase membrane permeability of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which increases the efficacy of antimicrobials such as chloroxylenol and fluoroquinolones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orazi et al., 2019</xref>). Manipulation of absolute growth using different carbon sources may serve to rationally increase the efficacy of antibiotics. For example, carbon sources that cause <italic>S. aureus</italic> to have a significantly greater absolute growth relative to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> would limit the growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and thus reduce the total concentration of HQNO produced. This would allow the metabolism of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to remain relatively high, thus promoting the efficacy of antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides. Conversely, promoting the production of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by using carbon sources that increase its absolute growth relative to <italic>S. aureus</italic> would augment the production of HQNO. This could increase the membrane permeability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> found in biofilms, thus augmenting sensitivity to certain antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones. Thus, rational manipulation of absolute growth in polymicrobial interactions may serve to differentially alter susceptibility to existing antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain<break/>(<italic>S. aureus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RN4220</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BEI resources</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wildtype strain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain<break/>(<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PA14</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lingchong You</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wildtype strain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain<break/>(<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PA14 (Δ<italic>pqsL</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth (Hanover, NH); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orazi et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Knockout strain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PA14 (Δ<italic>pvdA/</italic> Δ<italic>pchE</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth (Hanover, NH); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orazi et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Knockout strain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PA14 (Δ<italic>pqsL</italic> /Δ<italic>pvdA/</italic> Δ<italic>pchE</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth (Hanover, NH); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orazi et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Knockout strain</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit (ATP assays)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BacTiter-Glo Microbial Cell Viability Assay</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Promega</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. # G8230</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Used to measure ATP</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm (MATLAB)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB with curve fitting and optimization toolboxes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MathWorks Inc.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Used to measure maximum growth rate</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm (JMP Pro 16)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JMP Pro 16</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SAS Institute Inc.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Used for statistical analysis</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm (Netlogo)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Netlogo</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tisue and Wilensky, 2004</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Used to measure spatial distribution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other (Aeraseal film)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Aeraseal sealing membranes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #A9224</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Used to cover 6 well plates</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain RN4220 were used in this study. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> mutants Δ<italic>pqsL</italic>, Δ<italic>pvdA/</italic>Δ<italic>pchE</italic> and Δ<italic>pqsL/</italic>Δ<italic>pvdA/</italic>Δ<italic>pchE</italic> were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orazi et al., 2019</xref>.

For the stationary (undisturbed) and continuously disturbed conditions, the plates were either placed in a stationary incubator at 37 <sup>o</sup>C or shaken at 110 RPM at 37 <sup>o</sup>C, respectively, for 24 hr. The plates that were periodically shaken were placed in a Victor X4 plate reader pre-set to 37 °C (slow setting, frequency, 10 sr per shaking event, orbital shaking feature, radius = 5 mm) at the indicated frequency. For experiments performed in an anaerobic environment, we overlaid the cultures in the cultures in the 96-well plate with 3 mL of mineral oil and we did not add AeraSeal membranes.

We also ensured that the growth rate of <italic>S. aureus</italic> was greater than that of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which was consistent with the general trends in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The range of values of <italic>ε</italic> were estimated using previously published maintenance coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wallace and Holms, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sauer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stouthamer and Bettenhaussen, 1975</xref>). The value of <italic>k<sub>p</sub></italic> was estimated as it represents a lumped term that captures the synthesis of three different virulence factors; pyoverdine, HQNO, and pyochelin. The average amount of pyoverdine synthesized by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has been reported to be approximately 0.3 μM/hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Julou et al., 2013</xref>). The approximate amount of HQNO synthesized by a population of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is approximately 3500 μM/hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Déziel et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, the amount of pyochelin synthesized is approximately 0.002–0.02 μM/hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serino et al., 1997</xref>). Given the wide range of synthesis values, and the simplification of our <italic>k<sub>p</sub></italic> term, we approximated <italic>k<sub>p</sub></italic> of 1 μM/hr. Increasing or decreasing this value tenfold maintains the qualitative trends in our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To estimate the value of <italic>d<sub>v</sub></italic>, we considered previously reported degradation rates of pyoverdine (dilution rate of approximately 0.5 /hr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin et al., 2018</xref>) and HQNO (decay of approximately 2 mg/mL over 10 hr, or ~0.01 /hr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lépine et al., 2003</xref>). As above, given the wide range of dilution/decay rates, we estimated a central value of 0.1 /hr; increasing or decreasing this value 10-fold does not change the qualitative nature of our predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We estimated the order of magnitude of the cell death (<italic>d<sub>c</sub></italic>) using previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).

Values of <italic>δ</italic> were benchmarked to a value of 1, which indicates near complete spatial overlap between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Reducing the value of <italic>δ</italic> served to decrease the spatial overlap of both species, thus reducing the effect of these virulence factors. Trends in <italic>δ</italic> were approximated using agent-based modeling (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Simulations were performed for <italic>t</italic>=24 hr, which is the same amount of time over which our experiments occurred. The general trend of our simulations remains the same when parameters are increased or decreased 10-fold from the base set of parameter values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mathematical modeling – agent-based model</title><p>We constructed an agent-based model (ABM) in the program Netlogo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tisue and Wilensky, 2004</xref>) to better understand the amount of spatial overlap of two bacterial populations under various disturbance conditions. To coincide with our experimental approach, the model begins with equal-sized populations of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells (agents) placed in completely overlapping distributions at the center of the virtual world and spread-out based on a normal distribution. The virtual world is a two-dimensional grid comprised of 10,201 patches (101 patches vertically x 101 patches horizontally). In each round, individual agents reproduce to gradually grow the population logistically (<italic>r</italic>=0.5) from its initial size to reach the final carry capacity of 200,000 agents. While there are no antagonistic interactions between the populations, growth is still limited by local density as each patch has a carrying capacity (of overall carrying capacity divided by number of patches). Therefore, reproduction is diminished in crowded patches and more favorable in less occupied patches. To mimic periodic spatial disturbances, each time step all cells are displaced (called ‘distance travelled’) in random directions at a percentage distance of the virtual world (base case is 1% or one patch). These disturbances were varied from occurring once each round, to up to 50-times each round, or not at all. Simulations were iterated under given disturbance conditions for 24-rounds, to resemble 24 hr laboratory experiments. The purpose of these simulations was to observe the extent that disturbance alone influences the extent of overlap of competing populations. The amount of overlap was represented by the variable, cohabitation, which is the observed frequency of patches hosting agents from both populations minus expected random frequency of co-habitation. Specifically, this was calculated as the number of observed co-occupied/total occupied patches, subtracted by the product of frequency of patches occupied by <italic>S. aureus</italic> agents and frequency of patches occupied by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Therefore, a positive value indicates that the two populations cohabit patches at a frequency greater than expected randomly, and a negative value indicates that individuals are less likely to co-occupy patches than expected randomly. For each simulation, this value was averaged across all 24-rounds.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Software, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Statisical analysis for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</title><p>(a) P values for data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. <italic>n</italic> represents the number of biological replicates.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The correlation between ATP levels and relative growth rates for Staph is interesting and informative, but the relatively flat growth responses and ATP concentration responses of Pa are because they are primarily eating the amino acids in the TSB. This becomes a major limiter for understanding carbon source impacts on Pa, while still potentially valid for Staph in an environment where Pa is mostly growing on amino acids.</p><p>The predictive premise of the model derived from the TSB-based experiments should be tested in two different (non-TSB, non-LB, non-BHI) media formulations and the relative relationship between absolute growth observed.

E.g a threshold cell density. This should be discussed in the context of the relevant data here and in the discussion. many of the virulence factors assessed here are also QS dependent. A way to test this experimentally may be to use a dual carbon source of casamino acids and those selected previously to control an initial density or tipping point (for future studies, Darch 2012 PNAS).</p><p>- Virulence mutants of Pa should be grown in each media condition to determine if there is a growth deficit to mutation compared to wt. If this is already in the text it was not clear and should be highlighted in the text as a control.</p><p>- Each of the virulence mutants should be complemented and the experiments performed again to show the phenotype is lost in co-culture with SA.</p><p>- Overall the paper is very well written and the figures are presented nicely. There are some spots where italics are needed for organism names etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have no additional major comments other than those described in the Public Review. If this study had been conducted within the SCFM2 media background via constituent substitution it could have been groundbreaking and immediately relevant to the field. Occurring, as it does, in TSB, it is subject to too many caveats to enhance or supplant existing work demonstrating situational contributions to co-culture.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83664.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The correlation between ATP levels and relative growth rates for Staph is interesting and informative, but the relatively flat growth responses and ATP concentration responses of Pa are because they are primarily eating the amino acids in the TSB.

In both cases, we continue to find strong and significant linear relationships between the final population composition and the ratio of absolute growth.

This new data is presented in Figure 3.</p><p>In addition, we also confirmed that periodically disturbing co-cultured populations grown in SCFM allows <italic>S. aureus</italic> to gain a competitive advantage at intermediately, but not infrequent or frequently, disturbed environments.

Thus, a reduction in growth rate cannot account for the differences in final density ratio when using the knockout strains.

In addition, a large literature exploring interactions between these species is cited but under-discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>1)We have made mention of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis in the revised abstract. We have also discussed the implications of our finding for this hypothesis in the discussion where we write:</p><p>“From an ecological perspective, our findings provide support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that the diversity of competing species is maximized at intermediate disturbance frequencies or intensities [1]. While the intermediate disturbance hypothesis has faced criticism [2], evidence of its influence on biodiversity has been observed multiple times [3], has helped to guide conservation programs [4], and can help explain the establishment of invasive species [5]. Herein, our results provide evidence that further supports the intermediate disturbance hypothesis; disturbance at intermediate frequencies facilitates the co-existence of both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> whereas in continually and undisturbed environments <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> dominated the co-culture (Figure 5). This observation was found in both TSB medium and SCFM suggesting that it is robust in multiple environments. While previous work has also found that intermediate disturbance can influence the biodiversity of bacterial populations [6], our work provides additional support for the intermediate disturbance hypothesis using two clinically important bacterial pathogens.”</p><p>2) We have expanded the information provided on the interactions between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus.</italic> In the introduction, we have expanded on the mechanisms by which both species interact and its impact on growth and metabolism. This section now reads:</p><p>“…Their co-culture induces interspecies competition, which enhances antibiotic resistance and virulence. In the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic> upregulates the expression of virulence factors including staphylococcal protein A, α-hemolysis and Panton-Valentine leucocidin [7]. While <italic>S. aureus</italic> can initially aid in the establishment of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> population [8], production of N-acetylglucosamine from <italic>S. aureus</italic> augments the virulence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by upregulating expression of multiple secreted virulence factors. Many of these are regulated by quorum sensing and include pyocyanin [9], pyoverdine [10], 2-Heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide [11], and 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline N-oxide (HQNO)[12-15]. Some of these virulence factors reduce metabolism in <italic>S. aureus</italic> through multiple mechanisms. Pyocyanin induces the production of reactive oxygen species in <italic>S. aureus</italic> by reacting with menadione, which results in oxidative damage [16]. Pyocyanin has been found to interfere with electron transport, reducing respiration [17]. The siderophores pyoverdine and pyochelin drive <italic>S. aureus</italic> into fermentation [18]. While exposure to HQNO can initially promote biofilm formation in <italic>S. aureus</italic> [19], it eventually interferes with the activity of cytochrome b, which reduces ATP production [20]. N-3-oxo-dodecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3OC12HSL) produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> for the purposes of quorum sensing has been shown to reduce growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> [21]. Overall, multiple virulence factors interfere with growth and metabolism in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, ultimately leading to facultative respiration and increased antibiotic tolerance [22]...”</p><p>In the Discussion section, and in response to a comment by reviewer 3 (below), we have also expanded on the interactions that facilitate co-existence of both species. Specifically, we write:</p><p>“Given the clinical importance of co-infection with both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, multiple previous studies have identified mechanisms of co-existence. Indeed, long term co-existence of both species can result in physiological changes that reduce their competitive interactions. Strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolated from patients that enter into a mucoid state show reduced production of siderophores, pyocyanin, rhamnolipids and HQNO, which facilitates the survival of <italic>S. aureus</italic> [23, 24]. These strains can also overproduce the polysaccharide alginate, which in itself is sufficient to decrease the production of these virulence factors. Moreover, exogenously supplied alginate can reduce the production of pyoverdine and expression from the PQS quorum sensing system, which is responsible for the production of HQNO [25]. Changes in the physiology of <italic>S. aureus</italic> can also facilitate co-existence. Strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis show multiple changes in the abundance of proteins including super oxide dismutase, the GroEL chaperone protein, and multiple surface associated proteins [26]. Interestingly, the majority of proteins that show changes in abundance in <italic>S. aureus</italic> are related to central metabolism, which is consistent with our findings demonstrating that metabolism can influence the co-existence of both species. While it is unclear as to how long-term co-culture would affect the ratio of absolute growth, our findings provide an additional mechanism that can determine the co-existence of these bacterial species.”</p><p>Overall, we hope that all three Reviewers agree that we have satisfactorily addressed the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The analysis of virulence factors is somewhat less thorough given that their induction is often tied to many factors beyond nutrition, but it is remarkable how well fueling explains who wins and loses. Additional discussion of the wide range of inducers of virulence factors is worthwhile.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we have included information of how quorum sensing also leads to the induction of virulence factor expression (which also helped to address a comment made by Reviewer 2). We have made this modification in both the introduction and the Discussion sections.</p><p>Introduction: “While <italic>S. aureus</italic> can initially aid in the establishment of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> population [8], production of N-acetylglucosamine from <italic>S. aureus</italic> augments the virulence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by upregulating expression of multiple secreted virulence factors.

Importantly, many virulence factors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (e.g., HQNO, pyocyanin) that impact growth and metabolism in <italic>S. aureus</italic> are regulated by quorum sensing. Quorum sensing involves the production and exchange of small diffusible molecules, called autoinducers [27]. Since each <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacterium produces autoinducers, the concentration of autoinducer increases as a function of cell density.

E.g a threshold cell density. This should be discussed in the context of the relevant data here and in the discussion. many of the virulence factors assessed here are also QS dependent. A way to test this experimentally may be to use a dual carbon source of casamino acids and those selected previously to control an initial density or tipping point (for future studies, Darch 2012 PNAS).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the suggestion for future work.</p><p>We have also modified the Discussion section to acknowledge that quorum sensing is likely playing a role in the tipping point analysis as follows:</p><p>“The absolute growth ratio also determines the tipping point of the co-cultured population. Importantly, many virulence factors produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (e.g., HQNO, pyocyanin) that impact growth and metabolism in <italic>S. aureus</italic> are regulated by quorum sensing. Quorum sensing involves the production and exchange of small diffusible molecules, called autoinducers [27]. Since each <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacterium produces autoinducers, the concentration of autoinducer increases as a function of cell density. At a sufficiently high concentration, the autoinducer will activate expression of multiple virulence factors in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which begin to impact growth and metabolism in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Given this density-dependent activation of virulence factors, it is likely that the tipping point in our systems is being determined by quorum sensing, although we did not explicitly investigate this hypothesis in this manuscript. ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Virulence mutants of Pa should be grown in each media condition to determine if there is a growth deficit to mutation compared to wt. If this is already in the text it was not clear and should be highlighted in the text as a control.</p></disp-quote><p>This was something that we initially overlooked in our original manuscript. However, as noted in response to the ‘essential revisions’, we have indeed performed this analysis. We found that there was not a significant difference in growth rates between all three knockout strains and the wildtype strain. This is noted in the Results section and this new data is presented in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Each of the virulence mutants should be complemented and the experiments performed again to show the phenotype is lost in co-culture with SA.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion by the reviewer. We chose not to perform these experiments as there was no difference in growth rate between the knockout strains and the wildtype strains. Moreover, multiple previous studies have demonstrated that the removal of these virulence factors from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> allows <italic>S. aureus</italic> to grow to higher cell densities when in co-culture. Specifically, O’Toole et al. (2015) demonstrated that <italic>S. aureus</italic> killing is significantly reduced in co-culture with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Δ<italic>pqsL</italic> compared to wildtype <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14[18]. This was also consistent when <italic>S. aureus</italic> was co-cultured with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> knockout strains <italic>ΔpvdA/ΔpchE</italic> and Δ<italic>pqsL</italic> /Δ<italic>pvdA/</italic>Δ<italic>pchE.</italic> These findings were also echoed by Barraza and Whiteley (2021) who demonstrated that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain <italic>ΔpqsL</italic> mutant lysed <italic>S. aureus</italic> to a lesser degree than wildtype <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> under well-mixed conditions in co-culture [28]. Overall, these studies support the conclusion that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is dependent upon the HQNO pathway and its major siderophores to suppress <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth in co-culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Overall the paper is very well written and the figures are presented nicely. There are some spots where italics are needed for organism names etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your kind words and we apologize for this oversight. We have triple checked that all species names in the text are italicized. However, abbreviated genus names that serve as general identifiers in the figures remain unitalicized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have no additional major comments other than those described in the Public Review. If this study had been conducted within the SCFM2 media background via constituent substitution it could have been groundbreaking and immediately relevant to the field. Occurring, as it does, in TSB, it is subject to too many caveats to enhance or supplant existing work demonstrating situational contributions to co-culture.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that our use of SCFM, along with the additional modifications to our manuscript described here, has increased the relevance of our work in the field.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
