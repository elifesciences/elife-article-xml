lifespan in diverse species. Age and nutrient-related changes in the abundance of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their processing factors have been linked to organismal longevity. However, the mechanisms by which they modulate lifespan and the tissue-specific role of miRNA-mediated networks in DR-dependent enhancement of lifespan remains largely unexplored. We show that two neuronally enriched and highly conserved microRNAs, <italic>miR-125</italic> and <italic>let-7</italic> mediate the DR response in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Functional characterization of <italic>miR-125</italic> demonstrates its role in neurons while its target <italic>chinmo</italic> acts both in neurons and the fat body to modulate fat metabolism and longevity. Proteomic analysis revealed that Chinmo exerts its DR effects by regulating the expression of <italic>FATP, CG2017, CG9577, CG17554, CG5009, CG8778, CG9527</italic>, and <italic>FASN1</italic>. Our findings identify <italic>miR-125</italic> as a conserved effector of the DR pathway and open the avenue for this small RNA molecule and its downstream effectors to be considered as potential drug candidates for the treatment of late-onset diseases and biomarkers for healthy aging in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microRNAs</kwd><kwd>dietary restriction</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>miR-125</kwd><kwd>fat metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome-Trust DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/I(S)/17/1/503085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chawla</surname><given-names>Geetanjali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>miR-125 functions as a potential dietary restriction mimetic by promoting longevity through regulation of fat metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is characterized by a progressive decline in physiological function, which leads to an increased risk of chronic degenerative diseases and disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harman, 2003</xref>). Deregulated nutrient signaling is one of the key hallmarks of aging, and restricting nutrient intake or dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to enhance health and longevity in most species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fontana and Partridge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kapahi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klass, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCay et al., 1989</xref>). More significantly, DR delays age-related pathologies such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klebanov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maswood et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mattison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mattson and Wan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Emerging evidence from diverse model systems has implicated micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) as critical components of signaling pathways that modulate lifespan by regulating mRNA turnover and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boehm and Slack, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chawla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Verma et al., 2015</xref>). These 19–24 nucleotides long, single-stranded RNAs function by directing effector complexes to target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartel, 2018</xref>). This recruitment of the miRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) is facilitated by interactions between the miRNA and its target and results in silencing of the target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim, 2005</xref>). Since the interaction of a miRNA and its target occurs by imperfect base-pairing interactions, a single miRNA can target several mRNAs in a given context. Thus, these evolutionary conserved and dosage-sensitive effectors possess the key attributes to facilitate the complex metabolic reprogramming that occurs during DR. While studies in the <italic>C. elegans</italic>, mammalian cell culture, mouse, and primate model systems have reported regulation of miRNAs and their targets upon DR, there is no evidence to indicate whether the DR-mediated expression changes of the miRNAs and their downstream targets occur in the same tissue and whether modulating miRNA and their target mRNAs can result in lifespan extension by DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mercken et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pandit et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schneider et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our small RNAseq analysis of wild-type flies that were fed an AL and DR diet for 40 days identified <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>miR-125</italic> to be upregulated by DR (to be published elsewhere).

Furthermore, <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>miR-125</italic> loss-of-function mutations dampen the DR-dependent lifespan extension. The DR phenotype associated with loss of <italic>miR-125</italic> is due to the derepression of its target, <italic><underline>Ch</underline>ronologically <underline>In</underline>appropriate <underline>Mo</underline>rphogenesis (chinmo)</italic>. Our analysis reveals that <italic>chinmo</italic> codes for a nutrient-regulated transcription factor and its upregulation in the nervous system results in altered fat metabolism. Our analysis has also uncovered a previously unknown mechanism of nutrient-dependent post-translational control of Chinmo that may be linked to a novel nutrient-dependent non-nuclear role for this protein. Consistent with the <italic>miR-125</italic> loss of function DR phenotype, increasing the dosage of human <italic>miR-125</italic> in the fat body increased longevity. In summary, we have identified a conserved miRNA that mediates the effects of DR by promoting tissue-tissue communication demonstrating its potential as a DR mimetic agent.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DR-dependent upregulation of <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>miR-125</italic> increases lifespan</title><p>To examine whether <italic>let-7-Complex</italic> miRNAs mediate the effects of DR, we investigated whether DR affects the expression of these miRNAs in wild type (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) and <italic>let-7-C</italic> hypomorphic (<italic>let-7-C<sup>hyp</sup></italic>) mutant.

Flies that were analyzed (F14) were trans-heterozygous for two different <italic>let-7-C</italic> null alleles (dark pink and yellow), ensuring that phenotypes were not due to recessive mutations on either <italic>let-7-C</italic> mutant chromosome. In addition, third chromosomes that contained differing rescuing transgenes (light pink) were derived in parallel from the same population of flies. Finally, all flies had a common X-chromosome (green), derived from an isogenized stock. (S1-1) All rescuing transgenes, including the wildtype rescuing transgene as well as <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>miR-125</italic> deleted versions, were injected into embryos from the same population of BL#25710. Resulting progeny were backcrossed twice to BL#32261 in order to select and balance <italic>vermillion+</italic> transformants (F1 and F2). Single transformants were subsequently backcrossed to an isogenized version of BL#3703 three times (F3-F5) in order to make balanced stocks with isogenized X chromosomes (F6). (S1-2) Stocks with differing rescuing transgenes were crossed to the same population of a stock that contained the <italic>let-7-C<sup>KO2</sup></italic> chromosome, an isogenized X chromosome, and two 3rd chromosome balancers. The <italic>let-7-C<sup>KO2</sup></italic> stock used in F7 was generated in a similar fashion as the rescuing transgenes stocks, by backcrossing three times to an isogenized version of BL#3703. Resulting stocks (F8) had common X (green), 2nd (yellow) and 3rd (light pink) chromosomes and were used in F13 to generate the experimental strains. (S1-3) A second <italic>let-7-C</italic> allele, <italic>let-7-C<sup>GKI</sup></italic>, was prepared by outcrossing twice to an isogenized stock, and then crossed to an isogenized stock containing a T (2:3) Cyo-TM6b compound chromosome. The <italic>let-7-C</italic> allele was selected based on mini-white, and the T (2:3) Cyo-TM6b balancer was selected based on the dominant Humoral marker. The resulting stock with a fixed second and third chromosome was amplified and used as the source for all virgins in the crosses that yielded the flies for analysis. (S1-4). Flies for analysis were generated by crossing virgins of the stock generated in F12 with males of stocks generated in F8 that harbored differing rescuing transgenes.

Lysine is the most common residue at which protein acetylation and deacetylation occur and one major family of enzymes that regulate lysine deacetylation in a nutrient-dependent manner are Sirtuin enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao and Sack, 2010</xref>). Sir2/SIRT1 is a conserved nuclear-localized, NAD+-dependent deacetylase that senses energy status and protects cells against metabolic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Guarente, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). dSir2 is regulated by diet and environmental stress and regulates the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we tested whether increasing the levels of the nuclear-localized Sirt1/dSir2 led to relocalization of GFP::Chinmo to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Kc167 cells were co-transfected with Tubulin-Gal4, UAS GFP-Chinmo, and Flag-dSir2, and cells were fixed 48 hr after transfection and immunostained with anti-GFP to detect Chinmo, anti-flag antibody to detect dSir2 and Dapi to detect nuclear DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Overexpression of Flag-dSir2 led to export of Chinmo into the cytoplasm under fed conditions. In absence of dSir2, 84.9 ± 4.69% of the cells had Chinmo localized to the nucleus and in presence of dSir2, 24.4 ± 0.83% of the cells had Chinmo localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These data indicated that dSir2 was required for the export of Chinmo to the cytoplasm. We then examined the acetylation status of Flag-tagged Chinmo in control and starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). Cellular starvation caused a 40 ± 25% decrease in acetylated Chinmo as determined by western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated Flag-Chinmo in control and starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). Consistent with the requirement of dSir2 for the deacetylation of Chinmo during starvation conditions, we found that starvation induced interaction of Myc-dSir2 with Flag-Chinmo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, dSir2-mediated deacetylation of Chinmo is required for the nuclear export of Chinmo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>To identify the specific lysine residues in Chinmo that are the potential sites of Acetylation, we utilized the GPS-PAIL (Prediction of Acetylation on Internal Lysines) online tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). A total of 11 acetylation sites were predicted by the online tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). The validity of the predicted acetylation sites was assessed by generating Chinmo mutants in which each of the Lysine (K) sites were mutated to Glutamine (Q) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). GFP-tagged Chinmo mutants were co-transfected with Tubulin Gal4 and the subcellular localization of each of the mutants was examined under control and starvation conditions by immunostaining with anti-GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Double mutants were also generated and tested for Lysines that were nearby (K47Q and K55Q). We predicted that mutating the acetylation-specific lysines to Glutamines would result in loss of nuclear export of Chinmo. While the K47Q and K55Q single mutants were able to relocalize to the cytoplasm upon starvation, combining the two mutations in K47QK55Q double mutant as well as the K348Q single mutation led to a significantly diminished nuclear export of Chinmo upon starvation. While only 26 ± 5% of the cells had Chinmo wild type protein localized to the nucleus upon starvation, 72 ± 4% of the cells transfected with K47QK55Q mutant and 76 ± 4% of the cells transfected with K348Q mutant retained the protein in the nucleus upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–J,K</xref>). We then tested whether the identified lysine residues were critical for dSir2-mediated relocalization of Chinmo to the cytoplasm. The K47QK55Q and K348Q mutants were co-transfected with Tubulin-Gal4 and Flag dSir2 and cellular localization of Chinmo was analyzed by immunostaining of fixed cells with anti-GFP antibody to detect Chinmo, anti-flag antibody to detect dSir2 and Dapi to detect DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). Our prediction was that if deacetylation sites were mutated, cells would retain Chinmo in the nucleus even upon dSir2 transfection. For K47QK55Q mutant 51 ± 13% of transfected cells retained Chinmo in the nucleus upon co-transfection of dSir2, while only 20 ± 3% of the cells retained Chinmo in the nucleus upon co-transfection of K348Q with dSir2. Since, both the mutants (K47QK55Q and K348Q) were exported to the cytoplasm upon dSir2 overexpression, we generated a Chinmo triple mutant (K47QK55QK348Q) construct by combining the three mutations and analyzed the subcellular localization upon starvation and upon co-transfection with Flag-dSir2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,M,L,P</xref>). 76 ± 3% of the cells retained Chinmo triple mutant (K47QK55QK348Q) in the nucleus upon starvation and 86 ± 2% of the cells retained Chinmo K47QK55QK348Q mutant in the nucleus upon co-transfection with dSir2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L–P</xref>). These data confirmed that dSir2-mediated deacetylation at all three residues (K47, K55, and K348) was required for redistribution of Chinmo to the cytoplasm upon nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>).</p><p>Since our data showed that nutrient deprivation by starvation was responsible for cellular relocalization of Chinmo, we tested whether Chinmo protein and <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA were regulated by starvation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Immunostaining of dissected abdominal fat tissue was performed with anti-Chinmo antibody to detect Chinmo, anti-Woc antibody as an immunostaining control, and Dapi for DNA. Fat body was dissected from adult flies and 2nd instar larvae as 2nd instar larvae express Chinmo in their fat body and we predicted that starvation induced Chinmo relocalization maybe utilized for its role during non-feeding larval states. A significantly increased intensity of Chinmo staining was observed in the nuclei of adult (Nuclear Ctrl: 15.3 ± 5.14 AU; Nuclear Stv: 19.13 ± 6.26 AU) and 2nd instar larval fat body (Nuclear Ctrl: 1835.33.19 ± 469.64 AU; Nuclear Stv: 3525.38 ± 904.48 AU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B and C–D</xref>). In adult fat tissue, peripheral Chinmo intensity was higher than that of the nuclear region and displayed a statistically significant increase upon starvation (Non-nuclear Ctrl: 282.05 ± 96.45 AU; Non-nuclear Stv: 432.36 ± 129.8 AU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>). In 2nd instar larvae a predominant increase in Chinmo intensity was observed in the nuclear region but not in the peripheral region (Non-nuclear Ctrl: 1114.18 ± 249.63 AU; Non-nuclear Stv: 832.69 ± 292.6 AU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and F</xref>). One possible explanation for this difference could be the differences in the levels of dSir2 in the fat tissue of second instar larvae versus adult fat tissue and also due to the duration of starvation and a stronger transcriptional induction in the larval fat tissue. A significant increase in <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA levels was detected by Q-RTPCR of total RNA extracted from 2nd instar larvae (3.98 ± 0.83 fold increase relative to control) and adult flies (3.98 ± 1.66 fold increase relative to control) that were exposed to starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G–H</xref>). We also examined the effect of starvation in the head tissue versus the decapitated head tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Our analysis revealed that the magnitude of induction of <italic>chinmo</italic> in decapitated tissue (3.13 ± 0.59 fold increase relative to control) was much higher than the magnitude of induction in head tissue (1.39 ± 0.14 fold increase relative to control), even though <italic>chinmo</italic> is expressed at higher levels in the head tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G–H</xref>).

These extracellular vesicles are produced by almost all cell types and serve as intercellular messengers and carriers of various signals and molecules and modify the functioning of recipient cells in different contexts. Our data indicate that the deacetylation of Chinmo results in its nuclear export upon starvation. To test whether the long-range non-autonomous effects of Chinmo were associated with its loading onto exosomes, we examined the composition of purified exosomes upon nutrient deprivation. To facilitate biochemical purification and detection of Chinmo by western blot analysis, we generated a Flag-tagged Chinmo construct (<italic>UAS flag-chinmo</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Consistent with the GFP-tagged Chinmo data, starved Kc167 cells expressing Flag-tagged Chinmo also showed a cytoplasmic redistribution of Chinmo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–H</xref>). Moreover, this cytoplasmic redistribution of Chinmo was reversible, and shifting the cells back to normal medium (16 hr) resulted in the reappearance of nuclear-localized Chinmo and disappearance of cytoplasmic protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–N</xref>). To examine whether non-autonomous expression occurs due to intercellular transfer of exosomes, we examined the protein composition of exosomes derived from Kc167 cells that were exposed to either fed or starvation conditions. Kc167 cells were transfected with Tubulin Gal4 and Flag Chinmo constructs. Seventy-two hr post-transfection, one-half of the cells were shifted to starvation medium for 8 hr and the other half was maintained in fresh complete medium (CCM3) for 8 hr. Exosomes were purified from a concentrated medium from both conditions using gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Western blot analysis was performed with the cell lysate, concentrated medium, and purified exosomes.

In addition, <italic>chinmo mRNA</italic> levels also increased by 8.5 ± 1.79 fold in AL conditions and by 7.6 ± 1.36 fold in DR conditions in the dissected fat tissue upon addition of the ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). These data suggested that <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA was being induced non-autonomously to a similar magnitude in the abdominal fat tissue in <italic>3X ElavGS &gt;UAS chinmo</italic> flies. In <italic>FBGS &gt;UAS chinmo</italic> flies, <italic>chinmo</italic> levels increased by 48 ± 6.7 fold in AL conditions and by 83.9 ± 12.7 fold in DR conditions in the fat tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). However, a much smaller increase in <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA levels was detected in the head tissue of <italic>FBGS &gt;UAS chinmo</italic> with a 2.38 ± 0.8 fold increase in AL and 2.69 ± 0.8 fold increase in DR conditions upon addition of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). To confirm whether the increase in mRNA also resulted in a non-autonomous increase in Chinmo protein levels, we performed immunostaining of dissected brain and abdominal fat tissue of <italic>3X ElavGS &gt;UAS chinmo</italic> and <italic>FBGS &gt;UAS chinmo</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In parallel, we drove the expression of GFP using the <italic>3X Elav GS</italic> and <italic>FB GS</italic> drivers to verify the specificity of the GeneSwitch drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–H and A'-H'</xref>). Immunohistochemistry with GFP antibody confirmed the specificity of both the gene switch GAL4 drivers. GFP protein was detected in the adult brain and neurons innervating the abdominal wall of <italic>3X ElavGS &gt;UAS GFP</italic> flies that were fed an AL + RU or DR +RU diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–H</xref>). GFP was only detected in the fat body of <italic>FB GS &gt;UAS GFP</italic> flies upon RU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A'–H'</xref>). Then we performed immunostaining with anti-Chinmo antibody to detect Chinmo in dissected brain and fat body of <italic>3X Elav GS &gt;UAS chinmo</italic> and <italic>FB GS &gt;UAS chinmo</italic> flies that were fed an AL or DR diet in the presence and absence of RU-486 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2I–P and I'-P'</xref>). Consistent with the <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA analysis, <italic>3X Elav GS &gt;UAS chinmo</italic> flies that were fed RU-486 containing food displayed expression of Chinmo in the adult brain and adult fat body. However, <italic>FB GS &gt;UAS chinmo</italic> flies that were fed RU-486 containing food displayed expression of Chinmo specifically in the fat body and no signal was detected in dissected brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2I'–P'</xref>). These data were recapitulated using 3X ElavGS &gt;UAS Flag chinmo flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A–E</xref>). Immunostaining was performed with anti-Chinmo and anti-Flag antibody to detect Chinmo in dissected brain, and fat body of <italic>3X Elav GS &gt;UAS Flag chinmo</italic> flies that were fed an AL or DR diet for 10 days in presence or absence of RU-486. As expected Chinmo was detected with both antibodies in the dissected brains of <italic>3X Elav GS &gt;UAS Flag chinmo</italic> flies upon induction. However, a more intense Chinmo signal was detected in DR diet. Chinmo was also detectable with both antibodies in the fat body of <italic>3X Elav GS &gt;UAS Flag chinmo</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>). Quantitation of the signal intensity indicated a much higher levels of Chinmo in DR +RU-486 conditions (Chinmo AL-: 0.17 ± 0.06; Chinmo AL+: 0.59 ± 0.39; Chinmo DR-: 0.22 ± 0.10; Chinmo DR+: 2.04 ± 0.75; Flag AL-: 0.11 ± 0.06; Flag AL+:0.5 ± 0.35; Flag DR-: 0.09 ± 0.025; Flag DR+:1.5 ± 0.74) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D–E</xref>).These data indicated that Chinmo protein and/or mRNA is either capable of loading onto exosomes to facilitate communication with other peripheral tissues or a feed-forward mechanism exists by which upregulation of <italic>chinmo</italic> in the adult neurons promotes its expression in the fat tissue <italic>via</italic> an as yet unidentified signal. This non-autonomous expression of Chinmo is required for mediating its effects on fat metabolism and lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Chinmo downregulates expression of genes involved in fat metabolism</title><p>To identify potential targets of Chinmo that were responsible for the DR-dependent phenotypes of <italic>miR-125</italic> mutant, we performed semi-quantitative proteomic analysis of extracts prepared from adult flies (whole animals) overexpressing <italic>chinmo</italic> specifically in adult neurons using the 3X <italic>Elav GS</italic> Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>). Since the role of Chinmo as a repressor of gene expression is well established, we examined the downregulated biological processes to identify relevant direct downstream targets of Chinmo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Proteins that were identified to be significantly downregulated were predominantly genes that were involved in metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We successfully validated the expression of eight fat metabolism genes (<italic>FATP, CG2017, CG9577, CG17554, CG5009, CG8778, CG9527</italic>, and <italic>FASN1</italic>) that were identified through this proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>) using RNA extracted from head tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) or decapitated fly tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>) of <italic>3XElavGS &gt; UAS chinmo</italic> flies that were fed a solvent (Ethanol) or RU-486 containing diet for 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>) or 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). The rationale for examining the expression of the genes in head tissue <italic>versus</italic> decapitated fly tissue was to compare the magnitude of repression of the genes in a tissue where Chinmo was overexpressed with the peripheral tissues. Consistent with the proteomics data, the mRNAs of all the fat metabolism genes were significantly downregulated in the head tissue (51–78% relative to control) and in the decapitated fly tissue (27–50% relative to control) of flies that ectopically expressed <italic>chinmo</italic> in adult neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>). These data revealed that neuronal upregulation of <italic>chinmo</italic> led to a repression of genes involved in fat metabolic processes in an autonomous (head) and non-autonomous manner (-head). To verify whether overexpression of <italic>chinmo</italic> in adult neurons led to a decrease in protein levels of the endogenous proteins involved in fat metabolism, we performed western blot analysis of whole fly lysates prepared from 3X <italic>ElavGS &gt;UAS flag chinmo</italic> flies that were fed either an AL + RU-486 or AL + solvent/ethanol diet for 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Since, most of the downstream targets identified are not that well-characterized (<italic>CG2107, CG9527, CG17544, CG5009, CG8778</italic>, and <italic>CG9577</italic>), we tested the expression of endogenous Fatp for which antibodies were available. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-flag antibody to detect Chinmo, anti-Fatp antibody to detect endogenous Fatp and anti-tubulin as a normalization control. Consistent with the proteomics data, a reduction in Fatp levels was seen upon upregulation of Flag Chinmo in adult neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To test whether downregulation of the candidate fat metabolism genes in the adult fat tissue was responsible for modulating lifespan, we measured survival of flies that expressed transgenes to knockdown <italic>fasn1</italic> and <italic>fatp</italic> specifically in the adult fat body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I,J</xref>). We predicted that if increased expression of one of these genes was sufficient to cause increased lipid turnover and consequentially DR-mediated lifespan extension, then knockdown of this gene would result in a reduction in lifespan upon DR. RT-PCR analysis of total RNA extracted from abdominal fat tissue of <italic>FBGS/+; UAS fasn<sup>RNAi</sup>/+</italic> flies exposed to AL or DR conditions was performed to verify the knockdown of <italic>fasn1</italic>. Induction of the <italic>UAS fasn1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> led to a 67.1 ± 1.9% decrease in <italic>fasn1</italic> mRNA under AL conditions and a 52.87 ± 3.7% decrease in DR conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>fasn1</italic> resulted in an 18.7% decrease in median lifespan of flies that were fed an AL diet and a 3.22% decrease in median lifespan on DR diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Thus, indicating that knocking down of <italic>fasn1</italic> alone was not sufficient to mediate the DR effect on longevity. Induction of the <italic>UAS fatp<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> led to a 41.9 ± 5.3% decrease in <italic>fatp</italic> mRNA under AL conditions and a 51.23 ± 2% decrease in <italic>fatp</italic> mRNA under DR conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>fatp</italic> resulted in a 14.8% decrease in median lifespan upon DR and no change under AL conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>). Since knockdown of <italic>fatp</italic> resulted in a decrease in the lifespan of flies that were fed a DR diet, we tested whether increasing the levels of <italic>fatp</italic> in the adult fat tissue led to an increase in the lifespan of flies under AL conditions. Western blot analysis of whole fly lysates prepared from <italic>FBGS &gt;UAS Flag fatp</italic> flies that were fed an AL or DR diet in the presence and absence of RU-486 for 10 days revealed that Flag Fatp was expressed in an inducible manner, however, much lower levels of the flag-tagged protein was detected under AL conditions as compared to that in DR conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Overexpressing <italic>UAS-Flag-FATP</italic> specifically in the adult fat tissue increased median life span by 14.2% under AL conditions and by 25% under DR conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata3">Figure 7—source data 3</xref>). The smaller increase in median lifespan in AL conditions is likely due to the lower induction of the protein, nevertheless, an increase in lifespan in both diets indicates that Fatp functions as a pro-longevity factor and that DR-dependent increase in lifespan occurs due to an increase in the expression of two or more genes that are regulated by Chinmo. To test whether the changes in survival were not due to an effect of RU-486, control experiments were performed with <italic>+/+, fasn1<sup>RNAi</sup>, +/+; fatp<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> and <italic>+/+; UAS Flag fatp</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3E–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata3">3</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that ectopic expression of <italic>chinmo</italic> in the adult neurons causes decreased expression of fat metabolism genes in the fat tissue that resulted in a decreased lifespan.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Ectopic expression of <italic>chinmo</italic> in adult neurons represses transcription of genes involved in fat metabolic processes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantitation of <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA levels in RNA extracted from <italic>3X ElavGS &gt;UAS chinmo</italic> flies that were fed a solvent (light blue bars) or RU-486 (pink bars) diet for 5 and 10 days.

Hence, we tested whether artificially increasing the levels of <italic>miR-125</italic> specifically in the fat tissue would lead to silencing of <italic>chinmo</italic> and consequentially lead to an increase in lifespan under AL conditions. Given the multi-targeting ability of miRNAs, it would be reasonable to expect that other potential mRNA targets of <italic>miR-125</italic> would also be repressed upon overexpression.

The adipose tissue has also been linked to metabolic dysfunction and age-related diseases such as heart attacks, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tchkonia et al., 2010</xref>). The fat body exerts some of its effects by storage and release of fat under different contexts. A non-autonomous regulatory role for this tissue in aging by regulation of the miRNA biogenesis machinery was reported in the mouse model. This study showed that aging-associated decline in the levels of the miRNA biogenesis factor, Dicer results in the downregulation of several miRNAs including <italic>miR-125b</italic> in the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mori et al., 2012</xref>). The authors further showed that knockout of Dicer specifically in the adipose tissue rendered the mice hypersensitive to oxidative stress. More importantly, this decline in multiple miRNAs in the adipose tissue was prevented by caloric restriction (CR).

This BTB-ZF protein has been shown to play a critical role in the temporal fate specification of mushroom body neurons during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>). However, more recent studies have highlighted a new role for this protein in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway that regulates stem-cell renewal in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flaherty et al., 2010</xref>).

However, the molecular mechanism or the non-autonomous signal that mediates these effects is currently not known. Our analysis indicates that in addition to previously documented transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, Chinmo may be reversibly modified post-translationally to play a role in the cytoplasm. Proteomic analysis of flies that ectopically expressed <italic>chinmo</italic> in the adult neurons identified several downregulated biological processes including fat metabolism. In addition, this analysis also identified upregulated processes such as cytoplasmic translation, macromolecule localization, retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, and intra Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, that may aid researchers to assign new cytoplasmic functional roles for this dosage-sensitive factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we show that <italic>chinmo</italic> is transcriptionally regulated by nutrition deprivation. A significant increase in <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA levels was observed in flies that were exposed to DR or starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

More importantly, in this study, we show that reducing <italic>chinmo</italic> in the the adult fat body increases lifespan under AL conditions. Additionally, our results indicate that Chinmo may play a role in fat metabolism through its ability to circulate by loading onto exosomes. Lastly, another plausible hypothesis is that Chinmo exerts a feed-forward effect by inducing a signal that is relayed to the fat tissue to increase its expression in a non-autonomous manner. Future studies focused on the analysis of Chinmo and its interacting partners will likely uncover newer non-nuclear functional roles for Chinmo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of <italic>miR-125</italic> in aging and late-onset diseases</title><p>We previously showed that <italic>miR-125</italic> plays a role in regulating lifespan and maintenance of neuronal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chawla et al., 2016</xref>).

Fresh fly food was prepared every 3 days to prevent desiccation. For steroid-mediated UAS-transgene control using the Gene-Switch driver, flies were fed a diet containing 200 μM RU-486 (Mifepristone, Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor MI). Unless otherwise noted, adult female flies of indicated ages were used for experiments. All experiments were performed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> chamber Model DR-36VL (Percival Scientific, Inc, IA, USA). Detailed genotypes of all strains as well as the sources of the genetic mutations and transgenes used in the study are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, respectively. Transgenesis was performed by the Fly Facility at Bangalore Life Science Cluster (CCAMP, Bengaluru, India). Stocks with multiple genetic elements were obtained by genetic recombination and/or crosses. The <italic>let-7-C<sup>GKI</sup></italic> mutation contains a 991-base-pair deletion that removes the <italic>miR-100</italic>, <italic>let-7</italic>, and <italic>miR-125</italic>. Additionally, the <italic>let-7-C<sup>GKI</sup></italic> mutation (<italic>let-7-C <bold>G</bold>AL4 <bold>K</bold>nock-<bold>I</bold>n</italic>) contains the GAL-4 and <italic>white</italic> coding sequence driven by the <italic>let-7-C</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sokol et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>let-7-C<sup>KO2</sup></italic> is identical except that the endogenous <italic>let-7-C</italic> locus was replaced with <italic>white</italic> rather than <italic>white</italic> and <italic>gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). All UAS lines used in the study were backcrossed four times. The scheme for the generation of strains used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. The genetic scheme ensured that experimental and control lines had identical genetic backgrounds. Flies that were analyzed were trans-heterozygous for two different <italic>let-7-C</italic> null alleles, ensuring that phenotypes were not due to recessive mutations on either <italic>let-7-C</italic> mutant chromosome. In addition, third chromosomes that contained differing rescuing transgenes were derived in parallel from the same population of flies. Finally, all flies had a common X-chromosome, derived from an isogenized stock. All rescuing transgenes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, including the wild-type rescuing transgene as well as, <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>miR-125</italic> deleted versions, were injected into embryos from the same population of BL#25710. The resulting progeny were backcrossed twice to BL#32261 to select and balance <italic>vermillion+</italic> transformants. Single transformants were subsequently backcrossed to an isogenized version of BL#3703 three times to make balanced stocks with isogenized X chromosomes. Stocks with differing rescuing transgenes were crossed to the same population of a stock that contained the <italic>let-7-C<sup>KO2</sup></italic> chromosome, an isogenized X chromosome, and two 3rd chromosome balancers. The <italic>let-7-C<sup>KO2</sup></italic> stock was generated in a similar fashion as the rescuing transgenes stocks, by backcrossing three times to an isogenized version of BL#3703. The resulting stocks had common X, 2nd, and 3rd chromosomes and were used to generate the experimental strains. A second <italic>let-7-C</italic> allele, <italic>let-7-C<sup>GKI</sup></italic>, was prepared by outcrossing twice to an isogenized stock, and then crossed to an isogenized stock containing a T (2:3) Cyo-TM6b compound chromosome. The <italic>let-7-C</italic> allele was selected based on mini-white, and the T (2:3) Cyo-TM6b balancer was selected based on the dominant Humoral marker. The resulting stock with a fixed second and third chromosome was amplified and used as the source for all virgins in the crosses that yielded the flies for analysis. For the generation of the <italic>let-7-C</italic> hypomorphic rescue and mutant line, the <italic>let-7-C<sup>Hyp</sup></italic> transgenic was combined with <italic>let-7-C<sup>KO2</sup></italic> stock. The remaining steps were similar to the scheme described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In order to avoid misidentifications, most common contaminants such as human keratin and porcine trypsin were also included in the database FASTA file. The MS/MS peak list data files were analyzed by Mascot ion search engine version 2.3.02, with one fixed modification; carbamidomethylation of cysteine (monoisotopic mass of 57.0215 Da), two variable modifications; methionine oxidation (monoisotopic mass of 15.9949 Da), deamidation (monoisotopic mass of 0.984 Da) and a peptide and MS/MS fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.1 Da. Up to two missed cleavages were allowed along with Mascot automatic decoy database search.

Protein identification validation was performed by Scaffold parameters including Mascot ion scores of 30 or higher (for +2, +3, and +4 charges), a minimum of two identified peptides, 100 ppm of parent mass tolerance, 95% peptide identification probability and 95% protein identification probability, (using the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm), resulting in a 0.0% decoy-based FDR. Protein fold change values were calculated on the basis of Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (NSAF), calculated for each protein. Proteins with fold change values less than or equal to 0.5 were down-regulated and the proteins with fold change values more than or equal to two were up-regulated. Quantitative differences were statistically analysed by a t-test and volcano plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), where differences with p-values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A two-tailed t test with equal variance between samples was performed to calculate the p-value.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;miR-125-chinmo pathway regulates dietary restriction dependent enhancement of lifespan in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Adam Dobson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Your work investigates the role of regulatory miRNAs and their targets in mediating the effects of dietary restriction on lifespan, proposing a model where neuronal miR125 represses chinmo expression in both neurons and (somehow) peripheral tissues. Unfortunately, all reviewers raised several issues on the way the experiments were conducted, on the analyses and on the conclusions. It appears that the conclusions and the model are not entirely supported by the data presented. For instance, despite the claim in figure 5, there seems to be no clear causality in the action of chinmo in the fat bodies to regulate lifespan via lipid metabolism. Methodologically, this work would have benefited from more explaining and controls. For instance, the mutant/transgenic lines do not appear to have been back-crossed and there are missing controls (e.g. GAL4- and UAS-alone). The GeneSwitch drivers seem to have ubiquitous expression. Very importantly, Chinmo regulation by miR-125 is not demonstrated in this work, but it is rather assumed to occur based on cited work. Lifespan comparisons are not sufficiently analysed statistically (Cox proportional hazards should be computed). Some of the results seem to contradict the main model, rather than supporting it (see reviewer 2, point 4).</p><p>Together, there are too many issues that need to be addressed to make this</p><p>manuscript acceptable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Pandey et al., examines the role for microRNAs in the fruit fly's response to dietary restriction. This is a very interesting topic. The authors propose that miR-125 and let-7 mediate the lifespan and metabolic response to DR in the fruit fly. Based on further functional characterization, the authors believe that miR-125 acts though its known target, Chinmo, with effects on both fat metabolism and aging.</p><p>While the study is on a very interesting topic, I do not think it's performed to a sufficiently high standard to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. My key objections (noted below) concern the way the experiments were conducted, as well as their interpretation and presentation. I believe these are too extensive to be addressed by the authors in a timely manner.</p><p>1) The key experimental tool used is fly genetics. Unfortunately, based on the information available in the manuscript I do not have the confidence that the genetic analysis was conducted to a sufficiently good level, and this impacts most if not all of the results presented. It appears that none of the mutants/transgenes were backcrossed, and this is very important for studies of aging in flies. Because the genotypes used would have been derived from multiple strains and backgrounds, I am not persuaded that the effects observed are not due to variation in the background. This is specifically relevant for all experiments where flies of different genotypes are compared (not so much for GeneSwitch experiments). Additionally, the genotypes of the experimental flies are very poorly described in the figures/captions and text.</p><p>2) I believe there is a number of essential controls missing. Examples include: Figure 2A – here the DR response appears compared to a response in a complexly different experiment – a control should always be run in parallel. Additionally, GAL4-alone and the UAS-alone controls appear not presented (was a GAL4 used to drive the RNAi line in Figure 2 – it's not clear from Sup Table 7 – if not, how is it being driven?). These are essential. Similarly, driver-alone and UAS-alone controls (with/without RU486) should also be run at least once for each GeneSwitch experiment – it's now well established that RU486 alone can sometimes trigger changes in physiology causing artefacts. As these RU486-induced artifacts appear to be context dependent, the controls need to be run by the authors in their experimental system.</p><p>3) GeneSwitch drivers are described as having one tissue specificity but then shown to be expressed in other tissues. This is confusing. References for articles describing the drivers are missing for some of the drivers.</p><p>4) The regulation of Chinmo by miR-125 is inferred from previous experiments. I could not find any data showing that it occurs in the context of DR in the submitted manuscript.</p><p>5) Figure 3 – the ectopic expression of Chinmo is essentially making the flies very sick – how much the lack of DR response in such flies can be interpreted is questionable.</p><p>6) Figure 1G – the p value is noted as not significant but the value in Sup Table 1B is, in two experiments for let-7. For miR-125 it's significant 1 out of 2 times.</p><p>7) Is the AL regime used by the authors essentially a cholesterol deficient diet (see Q Wu et al., 2020 Aging cell 19 (3), e13120)? If so, how broadly relevant will it be to DR in other organisms?</p><p>8) The authors propose that Chinmo can diffuse from one tissue to another – as a transcription factor I think it's very unlikely to do this. I think such a claim should be substantiated with more evidence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript investigates how dietary restriction extends lifespan in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and specifically the role of regulatory RNAs and the BTB transcription factor chinmo. The roles of specific tissues and lipid metabolism are also investigated.</p><p>There are some good data here and some interesting findings. However these findings are held back by dubious analyses, datasets which appear to contradict the conclusions, and some unjustified logical leaps.</p><p>1) The physiological relevance of chinmo is unclear. A leap to studying chinmo is made based on a claim (unsubstantiated by either reference to literature or data) that chinmo is a direct target of the let7C complex. The model is that chinmo repression is required for DR to extend lifespan, and loss of the miRNAs stops this repression. But to really know this, we need to see chinmo levels in WT and miRNA mutants, subjected to AL and DR. And if the miRNAs regulate chinmo at post-translational level, we need to see protein levels by Western blot and IF (using the antibody used in Figure 4?). It would also be nice to have this information specifically in the tissues studied. Currently we have only (A) mRNA levels of chinmo in whole DR flies (in which DR increases chinmo expression, contrary to the concluding model), and (B) IFs in figure 4 which don't appear to show any effect of DR on chinmo levels. A much more convincing case for studying chinmo needs to be made. The genetics in the lifespans might do this (subject to genetics, below), but they follow way later in the paper.</p><p>2) Statistical analysis requires considerable work. The model proposed requires evidence from relatively complex epistasis experiments. Some of these data are present, but it is insufficient to say that the magnitude of lifespan extension in one condition is less than another – is it significantly so? More rigorous analysis exploring interactions of experimental factors (e.g. Cox proportional hazards) is required.</p><p>3) Numerous conclusions are unsupported. To conclude the epistasis claimed, we'd need to see statistical interactions (i.e. without A, there is no effect of B), but a number of effects look additive (i.e. A affects this thing, and in parallel so does B). E.g. Figure 3F, it looks like chinmo affects mean TAG by a set amount against a baseline set by DR. To really conclude that chinmo was mediating DR, the effect of DR should be blocked (or strongly diminished) when chinmo is manipulated transgenically. We see this in Figure 5, but rarely elsewhere. I encourage the authors to apply proper statistical modelling, testing for interaction effects and specifying pairwise comparisons, for ALL experiments testing epistatic or gene:diet effects.</p><p>4) Some figures in fact show results which are contrary to the concluding model. E.g. in Figure 6J: if there is an effect of FATP-RNAi in both AL and DR, does it not argue that FATP is in fact irrelevant for the DR effect? Similarly, the hypothesis tested in 6K is that elevated expression of lipid metabolism genes should create a DR-like state, in which case we expect overexpression to increase AL lifespan but not DR lifespan. However, we see the opposite: FATP expression extends DR lifespan, but not AL lifespan. Altogether, this actually argues against the model that fat metabolism genes in the FB mediate DR's effects.</p><p>5) The manuscript would also be more penetrable without jumping so much between tissues, and a more clear explanation of where chinmo and the miRNAs are normally expressed. Probably the most convincing data are in Figure 5, where we have a manipulation of physiological expression patterns (i.e. chinmo RNAi) yielding the sort of interaction patterns we need to conclude epistasis. But then figure 6 jumps back to over-expressing chinmo in neurons. Flyatlas has the expression of chinmo high in neurons and negligible in fat body, and the miRNAs high in the nervous system. No convincing case is made for expressing a neuronal miRNA in the fat body (Figure 7). I am also very cautious in interpreting protein overexpression with a pan-neuronal driver such as ElavGS – brains are complex and this manipulation will force chinmo expression in a lot of neurons where it may never normally be expressed, causing potentially odd effects. This brings the physiological relevance of a number of manipulations into question.</p><p>6) The way non-autonomous effects of chinmo are shown is quite nice. But some statements in this section are quite surprising, especially that mRNA can diffuse between tissues. This statement would require quite a lot more data to substantiate. A more parsimonious explanation is a feed-forward loop in which chinmo expression in one tissue promotes its expression elsewhere through a secondary signal.</p><p>7) Insufficient genetic information. This is notoriously important when looking at epistasis in lifespan. Number of rounds of backcrossing must be given. The data are not useful if mutants were not freshly backcrossed before recombination. We also are not told whether mutants were heterozygous or homozygous. The Figure 1B qRT-PCR data also don't strongly support the claim that the Let7C mutant is actually a hypomorph – expression levels are not dramatically altered?</p><p>8) number of key points are made without reference to literature or data e.g. chinmo is a target of Let7C, Let7C miRNAs are normally expressed in the nervous system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Pandey and colleagues are studying how miRNAs and their targets regulate the extension of lifespan upon dietary restriction (reduced protein content in diet, termed DR). Previous work from the lab of one of the authors has shown that lifespan extension under DR can be prevented when triglyceride synthesis or breakdown is inhibited (Katewa, 2012, 2016). These observations have led to the current model in the field that the enhanced turnover of fatty acids is the critical metabolic adaptation for lifespan extension under DR. In the current study, the authors use established stocks containing deletions and rescue constructs of the let-7-C locus, which contains 3 miRNAs (miR100, miR125 and let-7) and examine lifespan and lipid droplets (fatty acids) in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Ultimately, their data lead them to propose a model in which neuronal miR125 represses chinmo expression in both neurons and (somehow) peripheral tissues; the reduction of chinmo in peripheral tissue leads to increased expression of genes encoding fatty acid metabolism, and this leads to DR-induced lifespan extension. Unfortunately, the current manuscript is lacking critical data to support the model. Additionally, controls are missing and key Gal4 drivers are not lineage-traced, increasing the confusion about the cell autonomy of miR125 and chinmo. The text of the manuscript is lacking sufficient rationale for many experiments, and important introductory facts (let-C-7 locus biology, chinmo biology, DR model and biology and how DR compared to caloric restriction) are either relegated to the discussion or entirely lacking from the manuscript. The unclear and confusing autotomy of chinmo activity greatly reduce enthusiasm. This manuscript could be improved by a large number of new experiments and an editorial overhaul.</p><p>Dr. Chawla previously showed that adult flies lacking an upstream regulatory region in the let-7-C locus but containing all three miRNAs (called let-7-Chyp) had a significantly shorter lifespan (Chawla, 2016). In the current study, they find that the shorter lifespan of these flies cannot be extended by DR, in contrast to flies possessing the regulatory let-7-C sequences. This observation forms the foundation for the study. Flies lacking miR125 or let-7 similarly do not extend lifespan under DR. They authors decide to follow up on the miR125 observation. The Sokol lab has previously shown that both miR125 and let-7 degrade transcripts for chinmo, which encodes a putative transcriptional repressor that has only been observed in the nucleus of cells that express it. Indeed, miR125 null flies that are heterozygous for a null chinmo allele now display extended lifespan upon DR and have enlarged LDs. [The experiments using the let-7-C-Gal4 to deplete chinmo in Figure 2 are difficult to interpret because the Gal4 is not regulated by RU486 and is active through the life of the fly, leading to depletion of chinmo throughout development with consequences of defective neuronal patterning (Zhu, Cell 2006 and many other papers from Tzumin Lee and other groups)]. These data suggest that the maintenance of chinmo in miR125 null flies underlies the lack of life extension under DR. In Figure 3, they try to determine in which tissue ectopic expression of chinmo decreases lifespan under DR. They used the gene switch inducible system for these experiments, only to find that ectopic expression of chinmo under Da, 5966 or FB leads to early mortality. In fact, even with the Elav neuronal driver, lifespan is shorter than the AL, no-RU-468 control. I find it difficult to logically connect the relatively early death caused by Chinmo mis-expression with a suppression of lifespan extension under DR. The authors need to find another way to test their hypothesis. In Figure 3, they show that Elav&gt;chinmo under RU-486 leads to a decrease in the size of lipid droplets, which they conclude connects neuronal chinmo to fat body metabolism in peripheral tissues. In Figure 4, they show the expression patterns of the GS Gal4 drivers, and because they see chinmo protein in tissues where the driver is supposedly not expressed, they conclude that chinmo RNA or protein is able to diffuse from neuronal cells to other tissues to induce metabolic changes. This is potentially an interesting model, but there are absolutely no data to support it. First, they need perform both real-time and lineage tracing of these drivers using G-trace. [G-trace should also be used for let-7-C-Gal4]. If these experiments support their hypothesis, then they would need to test how the movement of chinmo RNA or protein between tissues could occur – for example, by exosomes? In Figure 5, they deplete chinmo from fat body using FB GS driver. What is the hypothesis being tested here? It was not clear to me. If neuronal chinmo RNA or protein travels from neurons to fat body, then how would depletion of chinmo from fat body alter this movement? These needs to be explained in the text. Let us assume that the chinmo transcripts being depleted in Figure 5 are produced by fat body cells (and not neurons), what is the prediction of this on lifespan extension under DR, TAG levels and lipid droplet size? In my mind, the upregulation of miR125 upon DR leads to the downregulation of chinmo message and protein in neuronal cells. This effect is somehow transmitted to fat body cells, which alter lipid metabolism to promote lifespan extension. If chinmo levels in fat body were depleted, there should be no effect on DR-induced lifespan extension and no change in TAG levels and no reduction in LD size. Indeed, my predictions are borne out by the data. There is no further increase in lifespan extension under DR when chinmo is depleted from fat body (Figure 5B blue solid and dashed lines); there is no difference in TAG levels (Figure 5C, blue solid and hashed bars) and LD size is not reduced (Figure 5E, light and dark blue dots). Yet the authors write in the title to Figure 5 and in lines 280-290 something to the effect that reducing chinmo levels in the adult fat body increases lifespan and enhances lipid metabolism. Would the authors please explain in the text the predictions for this experiment and the results? Their interpretation and mine are not congruous. In Figure 6, they perform mass spec on adult females in which chinmo has been inducibly mis-expressed in neurons. They find 40 proteins differentially expressed between the induced and uninduced samples, 7 upregulated and 33 downregulated. Of the latter, 7 proteins are involved in fat metabolism and their mRNAs decrease 10 days after induction of chinmo. Do the authors have an earlier time point? If chinmo does directly repress these 7 genes, it presumably would do so in a shorter time frame, for example 1-2 days after induction. 10 days is a long time-frame for gene expression and may represent indirect regulation, and if the authors saw an effect after 2 days, this would be a more meaningful result. Do these genes have chinmo binding sites in regulatory regions? It would also be helpful to validate decreased expression of proteins using antibodies or enhancer traps to characterized genes, for example, FATP for which both antibodies and enhancer traps exist. They then test the functional role for FASN1 and FATP in DR-dependent lifespan extension. Once again, it would be helpful for the authors to explain in the text the predictions for this experiment. To my mind, if downregulation of chinmo in the fat body is important for DR-induced lifespan extension and if chinmo represses the fasn1 and fatp genes, then loss of chinmo should in increase FASN1 and FATP expression and this should aid in fatty acid turnover. Depletion of fasn1 and fatp should then decrease DR-induced lifespan extension, which is confirmed by the results (Figure 6I and J), and mis-expression of these factors should increase this extension, which again is supported by the results (Figure 6L). These are important results for the paper but are insufficiently explained in the text by the authors. In Figure 7, they express human miR125 in fat body and examine lifespan extension. Once again, the rationale for these experiments is totally unclear to me. The model introduced earlier in the paper is that neuronal (not fat body) miR125 extends lifespan under DR. Why did they perform the experiments in Figure 7? How do these results add to the paper? To me, they detract from the paper. The authors need to definitely establish in which cells miR125 is acting and in which cells chinmo is being regulated. Figure 8 is a model of the result, but it does not clarify any of the confusion about the autonomy of chinmo activity.</p><p>Figure 1B are missing the appropriate control, which is the &quot;rescue&quot; genotype. <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> is not the right control for this experiment because it does not contain the let-7-C alleles and the attP-inserted transgene. This is important because it forms the foundation for the entire study.</p><p>Figure 2A,B are missing controls (δ miR125 alone and chinmo1/+ alone). Furthermore, the driver in Figure 2A is let-7-CGal4, which is not a GS gal4 and therefore is active through development. The correct experiment here would be elavGS. This should be remedied.</p><p>Figure 2C and D – the AD and DR TAG profiles should be displayed on the same graph. Why are they separated? Why are is the Y-axis scale so different (0-7 on the AD and 0-50 on the DR) between AL and DR? I can't determine what happens to TAG levels under DR in the various genotypes. This is a significant issue for me. This experiment needs to be performed again and plotted on the same graph.</p><p>Figure 2G-J – why is the chinmo protein not monitored here? Why is dilp6 being monitored? The authors do not discuss the rationale for examining dilp6 or foxo; they need to tell the reader why they are doing this experiment. In panel H, what do the third and fourth pair of bars represent? In other words, why are + head and -head being shown twice? In panel J, why is starvation (absence of protein) introduce here? What is the rationale for this experiment and why is it being shown?</p><p>Figure 3A: DaGS&gt;UAS-Chinmo flies with RU-486 all day within ~12 days of adulthood, much earlier ectopic flies without drug treatment. These data indicate that there is toxicity/lethality associated with ectopic chinmo, which obviates any possible connection to lifespan extension.</p><p>Figure 4 – please supply monochrome (white on black) all of these. It is very difficult for the human brain to appreciate green on black.</p><p>The authors need to better explain the various let-7-C reagents that they use both in the legend to Fig, 1 and in the Materials and Method. In particular, the let-C-7GKI allele is not on Flybase and I had to look up three prior pages to figure this out.

Unfortunately, based on the information available in the manuscript I do not have the confidence that the genetic analysis was conducted to a sufficiently good level, and this impacts most if not all of the results presented. It appears that none of the mutants/transgenes were backcrossed, and this is very important for studies of aging in flies. Because the genotypes used would have been derived from multiple strains and backgrounds, I am not persuaded that the effects observed are not due to variation in the background. This is specifically relevant for all experiments where flies of different genotypes are compared (not so much for GeneSwitch experiments). Additionally, the genotypes of the experimental flies are very poorly described in the figures/captions and text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that controlled genetic background is essential for genetic research and our approach ensured such a controlled genetic background. Moreover, since the genetic approach was previously published by us (Chawla et al., 2016), we did not include the crossing scheme in this submission but noted the reference in the text. To make our approach as transparent as possible, we have included our entire genetic scheme in the revised version as Figure 1—figure supplement 1. As the scheme indicates, our approach relies on the comparison between strains with two different rescuing transgenes in a background as close to identical as possible. This procedure and the strategy should clarify that the strains we have analyzed have a common genetic background. The attached scheme also includes a description of the balancer strains used. The same isogenized balancer stock was used in multiple crosses, thereby ensuring that there was no genetic variability introduced as part of the strain construction.</p><p>The use of such rescuing transgenes is a &quot;gold standard&quot; in genetic research and all our rescuing transgenes were generated by injecting them into the same population of flies and once recovered, resulting strains were treated identically and in parallel. In addition, it is not clear whether the recommendation of backcrossing the transgenes/mutants will solve the issue: after backcrossing the strains, we would still need to follow the 8- generation scheme (F1 to F8) in Figure 1 figure supplement-1 to generate the final strains and spontaneous background mutations could be introduced and fixed in the population at any of these steps. As an example of a study with a similar genetic strategy as ours, please see Verma et al., Nature Neuroscience 2015. Additionally, the same scheme was used by us and published earlier (Chawla et al., 2016).</p><p>We have included the genotypes of the experimental flies in the revised figure legends and text.

We have removed data pertaining to <italic>DaGS</italic> and <italic>5966</italic> GeneSwitch drivers to add clarity. The specificity of the two GeneSwitch drivers used in the revised manuscript (<italic>FBGS</italic> and <italic>3X ElavGS</italic>) was validated by setting up crosses with UAS GFP and analyzing GFP expression in the brain and abdominal fat body of the progeny (Figure 6—figure supplement 2 A-H and 2A’-H’).

This is expected for proteins that play dosage-sensitive essential roles like Chinmo. We believe that it was important to analyze the consequences of ectopic expression of <italic>chinmo</italic> to assess whether its derepression in adult brain mimicked <italic>miR-125</italic> mutant phenotypes and to confirm that <italic>chinmo</italic> was the functionally relevant target that was mediating the DR phenotype. Moreover, it was important to identify the tissues where this silencing of <italic>chinmo</italic> was critical for DR-mediated lifespan extension and hence an inducible GeneSwitch Gal4 system seems most appropriate. The other approach that we utilized was to examine whether reducing chinmo dosage by c<italic>hinmo<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> or genetic mutation (<italic>chinmo<sup>1</sup></italic>) in <italic>miR-125</italic> mutants was able to rescue <italic>miR-125</italic> mutant DR phenotype (presented in Figure 2). We have edited figure 3 (current Figure 6 of the revised manuscript) and removed the analysis done with <italic>DaGS</italic> and <italic>5966</italic> GeneSwitch drivers for clarity. The figure now includes an analysis of ectopic expression of <italic>chinmo</italic> and <italic>flag chinmo</italic> in adult neurons (<italic>3X ElavGS</italic>) and in adult fat tissue (<italic>S<sub>1</sub>106</italic>).

The p-values and Χ<sup>2</sup> values indicate that there is a significant difference between survival curves in AL and DR conditions. These experiments confirm that deregulation of <italic>chinmo</italic> is the cause of <italic>miR-125</italic> mutant DR phenotypes.

If so, how broadly relevant will it be to DR in other organisms?</p></disp-quote><p>The AL regimen that we used in this study is a cholesterol-deficient diet and the AL and DR diets essentially vary in the yeast extract (protein source). Protein restriction and more specifically amino acid restriction have been reported to significantly enhance lifespan in yeast and flies (Mirisola et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2008; Mair et al., 2005; Minor et al., 2010). In rodents, restriction of protein intake or of specific amino acids is associated with improved healthspan and increased lifespan (Mirzaei et al., 2014; Fontana et al., 2010; Brandhorst and Longo., 2019; Lopez-Torres and Barja., 2008). In humans, ongoing and future nutritional studies are required for the definition of what constitutes a healthy diet with pro-longevity benefits, however, short-term clinical trials and epidemiological studies indicate that protein restriction leads to reduced activity of the GH/IGF-1 regulatory axis, thus leading to a delay in age-related pathologies (Levine et al., 2014). From all these studies it is reasonable to conclude that healthspan effects observed with calorie restriction can at least partially be explained by the restriction of protein or more specifically amino acids. However, we thank Reviewer 1 for referring Wu et al., 2020, and agree that including cholesterol in the dietary regimen might yield additional conserved miRNA-mediated DR pathways that we would like to investigate in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors propose that Chinmo can diffuse from one tissue to another – as a transcription factor I think it's very unlikely to do this. I think such a claim should be substantiated with more evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 1 that more evidence is required to demonstrate that Chinmo is not predominantly functioning as a transcription factor in the nucleus. Cytoplasmic translocation of Chinmo would be a prerequisite for any model that claims a nonautonomous role for this protein. We agree with the need for a better explanation in support of experiments performed. Hence, we would like to highlight some new data that we have included in the revised manuscript as new figures (Figure 4 and Figure 5) and other panels that strengthen the hypothesis for non-autonomous effects of Chinmo and other non-nuclear roles for this protein.</p><p>i. Chinmo redistributes to the cytoplasm upon nutrient deprivation.</p><p>To ascertain whether Chinmo translocates to the cytoplasm upon nutritional deprivation we made use of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell line and tagged versions of Chinmo (GFP and Flag). Kc167 is an embryonic cell line that expresses very low levels of Chinmo (modEncode data). GFP-tagged Chinmo translocates to the cytoplasm in starved Kc167 cells that are transfected with Tubulin Gal4 and UAS Chinmo::GFP (Figure 4A). Consistent with the GFP-tagged Chinmo data, starved Kc167 cells expressing Flag-tagged Chinmo also show cytoplasmic redistribution of Chinmo (Figure 5C-H). Moreover, this cytoplasmic redistribution of Chinmo upon starvation was reversible, and shifting the cells back to normal medium (16h) resulted in reappearance of nuclear-localized Chinmo and disappearance of cytoplasmic protein (Figure 5I-N). Since, UAS-chinmo constructs were used in these experiments, we could conclude that nutrient-dependent post-translational modification of the protein was the mechanism involved in redistribution of the protein to the cytoplasm upon nutrient deprivation.</p><p>ii. Deacetylation of Chinmo by dSir2 is required for its nuclear export upon nutrient deprivation.</p><p>Increasing the cellular levels of dSir2 led to redistribution of the exogenous GFP-tagged Chinmo to the cytoplasm in fed conditions (Figure 4B). Thus, indicating that nutrient dependent post-translational modification of Chinmo by dSir2 is required for its export from the nucleus. Since, dSir2 is a nutrient-dependent deacetylase, we performed mutational analysis of Chinmo and identified three Lysine (K47, K55, and K348) residues that were critical for relocalization of Chinmo by dSir2 upon nutrient deprivation. This analysis is represented in Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript. These data confirm that dSir2 mediated deacetylation of Chinmo is required for its nuclear export.</p><p>iii. Chinmo fractionates with exosomes upon starvation.</p><p>Since exosomes are well-known players in intercellular communication and have been shown to carry protein, mRNAs and miRNAs, we examined whether Chinmo is loaded onto these extracellular vesicles in response to nutrient deprivation. To test whether Chinmo protein is loaded onto exosomes, we purified exosomes from Kc167 cells expressing flag-tagged Chinmo by size exclusion chromatography. Kc167 cells expressing Flag-Chinmo were starved for 8h (2mg/ml glucose in PBS) and exosomes were purified from cell culture medium and starvation medium. Western blot analysis was performed with the cell lysate, concentrated medium, and purified exosomes from Kc167 cells expressing Flag Chinmo for detection of exosomal proteins and Flag-Chinmo. Flag-Chinmo was detected in medium and exosome fraction of starved Kc167 cells but not in the concentrated medium and exosomal fraction of cells that were in normal medium (Figure 5O). Together these data provide evidence that Chinmo translocates to the cytoplasm and is loaded onto exosomes upon nutrient deprivation, and this might be a plausible mechanism for its non-autonomous expression (Figure 5P). A similar nutrient dependent translocation has been previously shown for the predominantly nuclear localized protein LC3/Atg8a (Huang et al., 2014).</p><p>iv. DR induces c<italic>hinmo</italic> mRNA levels in the hemolymph.</p><p>Hemolymph is responsible for circulating nutrients and exosomes. <italic>Chinmo</italic> mRNA levels increased by 2.6 ± 0.19-fold in the hemolymph of <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> adult flies that were fed a DR diet for 10 days (Figure 3E). A DR-dependent increase in the levels of circulating <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA hints at a possible mechanism by which <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA could exert nonautonomous effects.</p><p>v. Nutrient deprivation leads to an increase in the non-nuclear Chinmo in the fat tissue of <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>.</p><p>Quantitation of Chinmo protein levels in fat tissue of adult <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> flies exposed to AL and DR flies indicates that Chinmo protein levels increased in the non-nuclear region of the cells in flies that were fed a DR diet (Figure 3A-C and Figure 3—figure supplement1A-E). These data provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for nutrient-dependent relocalization of Chinmo.</p><p>vi. Neuronal Chinmo upregulation induces Chinmo expression non-autonomously in the fat tissue.</p><p>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of <italic>chinmo</italic> RNA in the head and dissected abdominal fat tissue of <italic>3X ElavGS&gt; UAS chinmo</italic> flies and <italic>FBGS&gt; UAS chinmo</italic> flies that were exposed to RU-486 for 10 days was performed. In the brain tissue of <italic>3X ElavGS&gt; UAS chinmo</italic> flies, <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA levels increased by 4.25 ± 0.8-fold under AL conditions and by 11 ± 1.96-fold in DR conditions upon addition of the ligand (Figure 6J). In addition, <italic>chinmo mRNA</italic> levels also increased by 8.5 ± 1.79-fold in AL conditions and by 7.6 ± 1.36-fold in DR conditions in the dissected fat tissue upon addition of the ligand (Figure 6K). These data suggested that <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA was being induced non-autonomously to a similar magnitude in the abdominal fat tissue in <italic>3X ElavGS&gt; UAS chinmo</italic> flies. To confirm whether the increase in mRNA also resulted in a non-autonomous increase in Chinmo protein levels, we performed immunostaining of dissected brain and abdominal fat tissue of <italic>3X ElavGS&gt; UAS chinmo</italic> and <italic>FBGS&gt;UAS chinmo</italic> flies (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Consistent with the <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA analysis, <italic>3X Elav GS &gt; UAS chinmo</italic> flies that were fed RU-486 containing food displayed expression of Chinmo in the adult brain and adult fat body. However, <italic>FB GS &gt; UAS chinmo</italic> flies that were fed RU-486 containing food displayed expression of Chinmo specifically in the fat body and no signal was detected in dissected brains (Figure 6—figure supplement 2I’-P’). These data were recapitulated in <italic>3X ElavGS &gt; UAS Flag chinmo</italic> flies by quantitating the Chinmo protein expression (Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-E). Together these data highlight the existence of mechanisms for the non-autonomous effects of Chinmo. We hypothesize that Chinmo protein and/or mRNA is either capable of loading onto exosomes to facilitate communication with other peripheral tissues or a feed-forward mechanism exists by which upregulation of <italic>chinmo</italic> in the adult neurons promotes its expression in the fat tissue <italic>via</italic> an unidentified signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript investigates how dietary restriction extends lifespan in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and specifically the role of regulatory RNAs and the BTB transcription factor chinmo. The roles of specific tissues and lipid metabolism are also investigated.</p><p>There are some good data here and some interesting findings. However these findings are held back by dubious analyses, datasets which appear to contradict the conclusions, and some unjustified logical leaps.</p><p>1) The physiological relevance of chinmo is unclear. A leap to studying chinmo is made based on a claim (unsubstantiated by either reference to literature or data) that chinmo is a direct target of the let7C complex. The model is that chinmo repression is required for DR to extend lifespan, and loss of the miRNAs stops this repression. But to really know this, we need to see chinmo levels in WT and miRNA mutants, subjected to AL and DR. And if the miRNAs regulate chinmo at post-translational level, we need to see protein levels by Western blot and IF (using the antibody used in Figure 4?). It would also be nice to have this information specifically in the tissues studied. Currently we have only (A) mRNA levels of chinmo in whole DR flies (in which DR increases chinmo expression, contrary to the concluding model), and (B) IFs in figure 4 which don't appear to show any effect of DR on chinmo levels. A much more convincing case for studying chinmo needs to be made. The genetics in the lifespans might do this (subject to genetics, below), but they follow way later in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not in complete agreement with the reviewer regarding the unsubstantiated claims and had referenced our previously published study where we showed that <italic>chinmo</italic> is differentially regulated by <italic>miR-125</italic> and <italic>let-7</italic> along with three other references in Lines 126-127 of the previously submitted manuscript (Chawla et al., 2016; Wu, Chawla, and Sokol, 2020; Wu, Chen, Mercer, and Sokol, 2012; Zhu et al., 2006). To further increase clarity regarding the targeting of c<italic>hinmo</italic> by <italic>miR-125</italic>, we have included a panel (Figure 2A) representing a schematic of the previously published study (Chawla et al., 2016). In addition, we show the immunostaining of Chinmo in the rescue and <italic>miR-125</italic> mutant dissected brain and fat body under AL and DR conditions (Figure 2B). The antibody used does not recognize denatured Chinmo protein and hence we and other labs that have used this antibody have not had success with this antibody in detecting Chinmo by western blot analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Statistical analysis requires considerable work. The model proposed requires evidence from relatively complex epistasis experiments. Some of these data are present, but it is insufficient to say that the magnitude of lifespan extension in one condition is less than another – is it significantly so? More rigorous analysis exploring interactions of experimental factors (e.g. Cox proportional hazards) is required.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical analysis for all the lifespan data has been repeated by performing Log Rank analysis using OASIS and GraphPad Prism. In addition to the p-values, we have included the Χ<sup>2</sup> values to aid in the direct comparisons between different conditions. Both p values as well Χ<sup>2</sup> values are represented in the Figure panels and Figure supplement tables for all the lifespan curves in the revised manuscript. Cox proportional analysis has been performed for experiments where diet and ligand interactions were tested and the p values are noted in the Figure table supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Numerous conclusions are unsupported. To conclude the epistasis claimed, we'd need to see statistical interactions (i.e. without A, there is no effect of B), but a number of effects look additive (i.e. A affects this thing, and in parallel so does B). E.g. Figure 3F, it looks like chinmo affects mean TAG by a set amount against a baseline set by DR. To really conclude that chinmo was mediating DR, the effect of DR should be blocked (or strongly diminished) when chinmo is manipulated transgenically. We see this in Figure 5, but rarely elsewhere. I encourage the authors to apply proper statistical modelling, testing for interaction effects and specifying pairwise comparisons, for ALL experiments testing epistatic or gene:diet effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the effects of overexpression of <italic>chinmo</italic> can be seen in both AL and DR. However, this is not unexpected and may be due to other DR-mediated effector mechanisms operating in parallel. The complex metabolic reprogramming that occurs because of Dietary restriction is mediated by several effectors including mTOR, Sirtuins, AMPK, FOXO, and circadian regulators. Our study adds non-coding RNAs to the list of effectors of the DR pathway. Hence, it is not surprising that due to other operating mechanisms, DR is not completely blocked. However, our TAG analysis indicates a greater reduction in TAG levels upon DR as compared to that in AL, upon overexpression of <italic>chinmo</italic> and <italic>flag chinmo</italic> (Figure 6F-G)(compare p-values between AL- vs DR- with AL+ vs DR+). As pointed by Reviewer 2, Figure 5 (Figure 3 in the revised manuscript) is the only experiment where DR response is blocked—in this experiment <italic>chinmo</italic> is knocked down in the fat body. Consistent with RNAi analysis, we would predict a stronger reduction in TAG levels in <italic>FBGS&gt;UAS chinmo</italic>. As predicted a stronger effect on survival is seen in <italic>FBGS&gt;UASchinmo</italic> flies as compared to the <italic>ElavGS&gt;UAS chinmo</italic> flies (Figure 6B-E). TAG analysis of <italic>FBGS&gt;UAS chinmo</italic> was not done in AL and DR diets but on normal food, a much stronger reduction in TAG levels was observed as compared to <italic>3XElavGS&gt; UASchinmo</italic> flies (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E).</p><p>Pairwise comparisons have been specified in each of the graphs and the p-values are depicted in the figure panels for all graphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some figures in fact show results which are contrary to the concluding model. E.g. in Figure 6J: if there is an effect of FATP-RNAi in both AL and DR, does it not argue that FATP is in fact irrelevant for the DR effect? Similarly, the hypothesis tested in 6K is that elevated expression of lipid metabolism genes should create a DR-like state, in which case we expect overexpression to increase AL lifespan but not DR lifespan. However, we see the opposite: FATP expression extends DR lifespan, but not AL lifespan. Altogether, this actually argues against the model that fat metabolism genes in the FB mediate DR's effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the concluding model in the previous submission did not accurately reflect the results. We have edited the proposed model (Figure 9) and have provided an explanation in the Results section in the revised manuscript. Based on the proposed model, <italic>miR-125</italic> dependent regulation of <italic>chinmo</italic> in the adult brain, as well as DR-mediated post-translational regulation of Chinmo in the fat tissue are required for extension of lifespan upon DR. The proposed model summarizes the mechanism by which <italic>chinmo</italic> regulates lifespan extension by dietary restriction. <italic>miR-125</italic> targets <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA in the brain under AL and DR conditions. In the adult fat tissue, Chinmo transcriptionally represses genes involved in fat metabolism. Dietary restriction mediated cytoplasmic relocalization of Chinmo in the fat tissue relieves transcriptional repression of genes involved in fat metabolism, thus increasing lifespan. Thus, regulation of chinmo at the transcriptional (nutrition-dependent), post-transcriptional (miR-125-dependent) and post-translational (dSir2-dependent) ensures DR-mediated extension of lifespan.</p><p>We do not agree with Reviewer 2 regarding the conclusions drawn from the results in Figure 6J and Figure 6K of the previous submission (currently Figure 7J and Figure 7K). The proteomic analysis of <italic>3X ElavGS &gt; UAS chinmo</italic> flies identified 8 genes and it is likely that modulation of more than one gene would be required to alter fat metabolism. We predicted that if increased expression of one of these genes was sufficient to cause increased lipid turnover and consequentially DR-mediated lifespan extension, then knockdown of this gene would result in a reduction in lifespan upon DR. Knockdown of <italic>fatp</italic> resulted in a 14.8% decrease in median lifespan upon DR and no change under AL conditions (Figure 7J and Figure 7-source data 2). Since knockdown of <italic>fatp</italic> resulted in a decrease in the lifespan of flies that were fed a DR diet, we tested whether increasing the levels of <italic>fatp</italic> in the adult fat tissue led to an increase in the lifespan of flies under AL conditions. Western blot analysis of whole fly lysates prepared from <italic>FBGS &gt; UAS Flag fatp</italic> flies that were fed an AL or DR diet in the presence and absence of RU-486 for 10 days revealed that Flag Fatp was expressed in an inducible manner, however, much lower levels of the flag-tagged protein was detected under AL conditions as compared to that in DR conditions (Figure 7—figure supplement 3D). Overexpressing <italic>UAS-Flag-FATP</italic> specifically in the adult fat tissue increased median life span by 14.2% under AL conditions and by 25% under DR conditions (Figure 7K). The smaller increase in median lifespan in AL conditions is likely due to the lower induction of the protein, nevertheless, an increase in lifespan in both diets indicates that Fatp functions as a pro-longevity factor and that DR dependent increase in lifespan occurs due to an increase in the expression of two or more genes that are regulated by Chinmo. We believe that these data do not argue against the proposed model but indicate that a combination of two more genes likely function together to mediate the effects and a combination of genes would need to be tested to attain the predicted increase in longevity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The manuscript would also be more penetrable without jumping so much between tissues, and a more clear explanation of where chinmo and the miRNAs are normally expressed. Probably the most convincing data are in Figure 5, where we have a manipulation of physiological expression patterns (i.e. chinmo RNAi) yielding the sort of interaction patterns we need to conclude epistasis. But then figure 6 jumps back to over-expressing chinmo in neurons. Flyatlas has the expression of chinmo high in neurons and negligible in fat body, and the miRNAs high in the nervous system. No convincing case is made for expressing a neuronal miRNA in the fat body (Figure 7). I am also very cautious in interpreting protein overexpression with a pan-neuronal driver such as ElavGS – brains are complex and this manipulation will force chinmo expression in a lot of neurons where it may never normally be expressed, causing potentially odd effects. This brings the physiological relevance of a number of manipulations into question.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to restrict the analysis to the relevant tissues and to improve clarity and retain focus, we have removed the lifespan data and expression analysis of <italic>DaGS&gt; UAS chinmo</italic> and <italic>5966&gt; UAS chinmo</italic> flies. We have examined the expression of <italic>miR-125</italic> and <italic>chinmo</italic> in the brain and fat tissue under AL and DR conditions and our data indicated that DR induces both <italic>miR-125</italic> and <italic>chinmo</italic> in the fat tissue (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G and Figure 8B, compare -AL and -DR bars). However, the lower expression levels of <italic>miR-125</italic> in the fat body as well as higher induction of <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA limit <italic>miR-125</italic>-mediated downregulation of Chinmo in this tissue. We have also examined and quantitated tissue-specific and sub-cellular localization of Chinmo protein in the <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> adult fat body and brain (Figure 3A-C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-E, H). We thank Reviewer 2 for appreciating the analysis done with <italic>FBGS&gt;UAS chinmo<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> flies and would like to highlight other experiments that also depict convincing data. In figure 1 we show that a <italic>let-7-C<sup>hyp</sup></italic> strain has a dampened DR-mediated lifespan extension and go onto identifying <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>miR-125</italic> to be responsible for the phenotype. In figure 2, we show that reducing the dosage of <italic>chinmo</italic> completely rescues the DR phenotype of <italic>miR-125</italic> mutants. We also believe that examining the effect of overexpression of <italic>chinmo</italic> was important to pinpoint the tissue where <italic>chinmo</italic> functions to cause DR-mediated lifespan extension.</p><p>We believe that it was important to analyze the consequences of ectopic expression of <italic>chinmo</italic> to assess whether its upregulation in the adult brain mimicked <italic>miR-125</italic> mutant phenotypes. This experiment was complementary to the experiments where we show that knockdown of <italic>chinmo</italic> in the fat body promotes a DR-like state under AL conditions (current Figure 3F-J). Moreover, since a given miRNA can target several mRNAs, this experiment was important for confirming that <italic>chinmo</italic> was the functionally relevant target that was mediating the DR phenotype. It was important to identify the tissues where this silencing of <italic>chinmo</italic> was critical for DR-mediated lifespan extension and hence an inducible GeneSwitch Gal4 system seems most appropriate. The FlyAtlas reports expression of genes under normal dietary conditions and hence, we don’t think any conclusions can be drawn regarding expression of genes under AL and DR diets which are significantly different from the normal food used for rearing flies in those experiments. We have examined expression of <italic>miR-125</italic> and <italic>chinmo</italic> in the brain and fat tissue under AL and DR conditions and our data indicated that DR induces both <italic>miR-125</italic> and <italic>chinmo</italic> in the fat tissue (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G and Figure 8B, compare -AL and -DR bars). However, the lower expression levels of <italic>miR-125</italic> in the fat body as well as higher induction of <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA limit <italic>miR-125</italic>-mediated downregulation of Chinmo in this tissue. By expressing human <italic>miR-125</italic> in the adult fat body, we addressed four questions: (i) Is the role of <italic>miR-125</italic> in fat tissue conserved i.e., can human primary <italic>miR-125</italic> substitute for <italic>Drosophila miR-125</italic>; (ii) <italic>Can miR-125</italic> function as a DR-mimetic i.e., can modulating its level provide benefits of DR, irrespective of diet (i.e., in both AL and DR). (iii) Can increasing levels of the miRNA silence <italic>chinmo</italic> more efficiently and provide additional benefits. (iv) Can increasing the levels of a miRNA in a tissue where it is expressed at low levels be used as a strategy to redirect the role of its downstream targets. Consistent with our expression analysis of <italic>miR-125</italic>, a previous study in the mouse model identified <italic>miR-125b</italic> as one of the miRNAs that increase in the subcutaneous white fat tissue upon caloric restriction (Mori et al., 2012). However, the beneficial effects of increasing <italic>miR-125b</italic> in the fat tissue were not examined in the mouse model. Hence, we tested whether artificially increasing the levels of <italic>miR-125</italic> specifically in the fat tissue would lead to silencing of <italic>chinmo</italic> and consequentially lead to an increase in lifespan. Our results revealed that overexpression of <italic>miR-125</italic> in fat tissue does increase lifespan of flies that are fed an AL diet but more so in DR. Since, only one dose/condition of induction was utilized, further optimization of induction duration or RU486 would likely lead to a greater enhancement in lifespan upon AL. Nevertheless, these initial results are promising because the data indicates that the modulation of this miRNA in the fat tissue is beneficial at an organismal level. In addition, this analysis also shows that the functional role of <italic>miR-125</italic> as a pro-longevity factor is conserved and that human <italic>pri miR-125</italic> can extend lifespan. In the revised manuscript, we have edited the text to clarify that both <italic>miR-125</italic>-dependent and nutrition-dependent post-translational control of Chinmo mediate the DR-mediated increase in lifespan.</p><p>We believe that it was important to analyze the consequences of ectopic expression of <italic>chinmo</italic> to assess whether its upregulation in the adult brain mimicked <italic>miR-125</italic> mutant phenotypes.

This is notoriously important when looking at epistasis in lifespan. Number of rounds of backcrossing must be given. The data are not useful if mutants were not freshly backcrossed before recombination. We also are not told whether mutants were heterozygous or homozygous. The Figure 1B qRT-PCR data also don't strongly support the claim that the Let7C mutant is actually a hypomorph – expression levels are not dramatically altered?</p></disp-quote><p>The genetic scheme for generation of strains used in Figure 1 and 2 is included as Figure 1—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript. The same scheme was previously used in our previously published study (Chawla et al., 2016). Our approach relies on the comparison between strains with two different rescuing transgenes in a background as close to identical as possible. This procedure and the strategy should clarify that the strains we have analyzed have a common genetic background. It is not clear whether the recommendation of backcrossing the transgenes/mutants will solve the issue: after backcrossing the strains, we would still need to follow the 8- generation scheme (F1 to F8) in Figure 1 figure supplement-1 to generate the final strains and spontaneous background mutations could be introduced and fixed in the population at any of these steps. The rescue and the mutant lines were generated by expressing a single copy of the wild type, Δ<italic>miR-100</italic>, <italic>let-7</italic> or Δ<italic>miR-125</italic> transgene in a transheterozygous <italic>let-7-C<sup>null</sup></italic> mutant background (<italic>let-7-C<sup>KO2</sup>/let-7-C<sup>GKI</sup></italic>). The <italic>let-7-C</italic> rescuing (wild type) transgene encodes a 17983 base-pair genomic fragment containing the <italic>let-7-C</italic> locus. The Δ<italic>miR100</italic>, Δ<italic>let-7</italic> and Δ<italic>miR-125</italic> are derivatives of the <italic>let-7-C</italic> transgenes that lack the mature <italic>miR-100</italic>, <italic>let-7,</italic> and <italic>miR-125</italic> sequences, respectively (Lines 174-179).

Previous work from the lab of one of the authors has shown that lifespan extension under DR can be prevented when triglyceride synthesis or breakdown is inhibited (Katewa, 2012, 2016). These observations have led to the current model in the field that the enhanced turnover of fatty acids is the critical metabolic adaptation for lifespan extension under DR. In the current study, the authors use established stocks containing deletions and rescue constructs of the let-7-C locus, which contains 3 miRNAs (miR100, miR125 and let-7) and examine lifespan and lipid droplets (fatty acids) in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Ultimately, their data lead them to propose a model in which neuronal miR125 represses chinmo expression in both neurons and (somehow) peripheral tissues; the reduction of chinmo in peripheral tissue leads to increased expression of genes encoding fatty acid metabolism, and this leads to DR-induced lifespan extension. Unfortunately, the current manuscript is lacking critical data to support the model. Additionally, controls are missing and key Gal4 drivers are not lineage-traced, increasing the confusion about the cell autonomy of miR125 and chinmo. The text of the manuscript is lacking sufficient rationale for many experiments, and important introductory facts (let-C-7 locus biology, chinmo biology, DR model and biology and how DR compared to caloric restriction) are either relegated to the discussion or entirely lacking from the manuscript. The unclear and confusing autotomy of chinmo activity greatly reduce enthusiasm. This manuscript could be improved by a large number of new experiments and an editorial overhaul.</p><p>1) Dr. Chawla previously showed that adult flies lacking an upstream regulatory region in the let-7-C locus but containing all three miRNAs (called let-7-Chyp) had a significantly shorter lifespan (Chawla, 2016). In the current study, they find that the shorter lifespan of these flies cannot be extended by DR, in contrast to flies possessing the regulatory let-7-C sequences. This observation forms the foundation for the study. Flies lacking miR125 or let-7 similarly do not extend lifespan under DR. They authors decide to follow up on the miR125 observation. The Sokol lab has previously shown that both miR125 and let-7 degrade transcripts for chinmo, which encodes a putative transcriptional repressor that has only been observed in the nucleus of cells that express it. Indeed, miR125 null flies that are heterozygous for a null chinmo allele now display extended lifespan upon DR and have enlarged LDs. [The experiments using the let-7-C-Gal4 to deplete chinmo in Figure 2 are difficult to interpret because the Gal4 is not regulated by RU486 and is active through the life of the fly, leading to depletion of chinmo throughout development with consequences of defective neuronal patterning (Zhu, Cell 2006 and many other papers from Tzumin Lee and other groups)]. These data suggest that the maintenance of chinmo in miR125 null flies underlies the lack of life extension under DR.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer 3 for a very thorough feedback of the data in the manuscript, however, we do not agree with the reviewer regarding the interpretation of <italic>let-7-C</italic> Gal4 for the analysis in Figure 2C-D. <italic>let-7-C</italic> Gal4 is not active throughout development, and its activity coincides with the expression of <italic>let-7-C</italic> primary transcript.

The 3’UTR of chinmo has multiple miRNA binding sites for both let-7 and miR-125 and the Chinmo gradient (downregulation) that is required for neuronal transitions during metamorphosis is mediated predominantly by let-7.

In fact, even with the Elav neuronal driver, lifespan is shorter than the AL, no-RU-468 control.

This is expected for proteins like Chinmo, which play dosage-sensitive essential roles. These experiments were not aimed at connecting overexpression of <italic>chinmo</italic> with an extension of lifespan by DR but we expected to observe a reduction in the DR-mediated extension of lifespan. We believe that it was important to analyze the consequences of ectopic expression of <italic>chinmo</italic> to assess whether its upregulation in the adult brain mimicked <italic>miR-125</italic> mutant phenotypes.

We believe that the statistical comparisons (p-values and Χ<sup>2</sup> values) indicate that there is a significant difference between survival curves in AL and DR conditions and these should help the readers in connecting reduction in c<italic>hinmo</italic> with extension of lifespan upon DR.

What is the hypothesis being tested here? It was not clear to me. If neuronal chinmo RNA or protein travels from neurons to fat body, then how would depletion of chinmo from fat body alter this movement? These needs to be explained in the text. Let us assume that the chinmo transcripts being depleted in Figure 5 are produced by fat body cells (and not neurons), what is the prediction of this on lifespan extension under DR, TAG levels and lipid droplet size? In my mind, the upregulation of miR125 upon DR leads to the downregulation of chinmo message and protein in neuronal cells. This effect is somehow transmitted to fat body cells, which alter lipid metabolism to promote lifespan extension. If chinmo levels in fat body were depleted, there should be no effect on DR-induced lifespan extension and no change in TAG levels and no reduction in LD size. Indeed, my predictions are borne out by the data. There is no further increase in lifespan extension under DR when chinmo is depleted from fat body (Figure 5B blue solid and dashed lines); there is no difference in TAG levels (Figure 5C, blue solid and hashed bars) and LD size is not reduced (Figure 5E, light and dark blue dots). Yet the authors write in the title to Figure 5 and in lines 280-290 something to the effect that reducing chinmo levels in the adult fat body increases lifespan and enhances lipid metabolism. Would the authors please explain in the text the predictions for this experiment and the results? Their interpretation and mine are not congruous.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 3, that more explanation should be provided to explain the premise for doing this experiment. We have included additional data in support of the hypothesis and have made edits in the manuscript that we explain here. Immunostaining of adult brains and fat tissue with Chinmo antibody indicates that <italic>miR-125</italic> mutant flies express higher levels of Chinmo in the brain and fat tissue as compared to the control/rescue flies. These data indicate that Chinmo is derepressed in the adult brain and to some extent in the fat body in the <italic>miR-125</italic> mutants (Figure 2B). We predicted that silencing of <italic>chinmo</italic> by <italic>miR-125</italic> in either brain tissue and/or fat tissue is required for DR- mediated lifespan extension in wild-type flies. Since highly expressed <italic>miR-125</italic> ensures that c<italic>hinmo</italic> is repressed in adult brain in wild type flies/rescue (Figure 2B), we tested the effect of reducing <italic>chinmo</italic> in the fat tissue on lifespan extension by DR. The hypothesis being tested was that reduction in c<italic>hinmo</italic> levels in the fat tissue is required for DR=mediated lifespan extension. Our prediction was that knockdown of <italic>chinmo</italic> in adult fat tissue would lead to extension of lifespan, increase in TAG levels and increase in lipid droplet size in AL conditions but no further increase of lifespan, no increase in TAG and no increase in lipid droplet diameter under DR conditions. Indeed, the data obtained from these experiments matched our prediction. These results indicate that knockdown of <italic>chinmo</italic> in the adult fat body is a prerequisite for DR-mediated lifespan extension and hence, a further knockdown of <italic>chinmo</italic> in DR conditions does not increase the lifespan further. However, knocking down <italic>chinmo</italic> in AL conditions recapitulates a DR like state and leads to an increase in lifespan.</p><p>We thank Reviewer 3 for pointing out the incorrectness in the title. We have edited the title to reflect that knockdown of <italic>chinmo</italic> in fat tissue leads to an increase in lifespan and enhances lipid metabolism in AL conditions. These data are now represented as Figure 2F-J of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 6, they perform mass spec on adult females in which chinmo has been inducibly mis-expressed in neurons. They find 40 proteins differentially expressed between the induced and uninduced samples, 7 upregulated and 33 downregulated. Of the latter, 7 proteins are involved in fat metabolism and their mRNAs decrease 10 days after induction of chinmo. Do the authors have an earlier time point? If chinmo does directly repress these 7 genes, it presumably would do so in a shorter time frame, for example 1-2 days after induction. 10 days is a long time-frame for gene expression and may represent indirect regulation, and if the authors saw an effect after 2 days, this would be a more meaningful result.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 3 for the suggestion to analyze expression at an earlier time point to determine whether the effects are direct. We analyzed the expression of the 8 genes identified after inducing expression of chinmo for 2 days in <italic>3X ElavGS&gt;UAS chinmo</italic> flies and the data from this analysis is represented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Induction of <italic>UASchinmo</italic> for 2 days was sufficient to lead to a statistically significant reduction of 7 of the 8 genes analyzed in the head tissue. 3 out of 8 genes analyzed also displayed a statistically significant albeit lower reduction in the decapitated body tissue. These data confirmed that Chinmo represses these genes directly in the head tissue and longer induction (10d) of <italic>uas chinmo</italic> in the adult neurons is required for the genes to be repressed in the peripheral tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Do these genes have chinmo binding sites in regulatory regions? It would also be helpful to validate decreased expression of proteins using antibodies or enhancer traps to characterized genes, for example, FATP for which both antibodies and enhancer traps exist.</p></disp-quote><p>A recently published study by Grmai et al., 2021 describes the transcriptomic analysis of <italic>chinmo</italic>-deficient cells from <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis. This study reports the following consensus Chinmo binding site (G/A)ATGCAC(T/C)(T/N)NN. We examined the noncoding regions (1500 bp upstream of the transcription start site, introns and 1500bp downstream of the termination site) of the 8 genes involved in fat metabolism that we validated to be Chinmo targets. Two binding sites were identified in <italic>CG9527</italic> and one each in <italic>CG9577</italic> and <italic>CG5009</italic>. We also searched the reverse complement sequence of the genes for the consensus binding and found that 7 of the 8 genes had 1 site and the remaining 1 (<italic>CG17544)</italic> had 3 sites.</p><p>As a second approach to identify motifs in the promoter sequences of the 8 genes that were validated to be transcriptionally repressed by Chinmo, we performed MEME analysis. The promoter sequences (50 base pairs) were downloaded from the Eukaryotic promoter database (EPD) and used for analysis. The MEME Suite (Bailey et al., 2009; Bailey et al., 2015) is a motif-based sequence analysis tool that can fetch motifs hidden in biological sequences – DNA, RNA, or proteins. We searched the promoter sequences of the genes, that we validated to be downregulated. The MEME tool (Version 5.3.3) from the MEME Suite web server (https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/meme) was used with the default parameters. MEME was instructed to report the top ten motifs from the search. No motifs could be identified with this approach.</p><p>As suggested by reviewer 3, we have verified that overexpression of Flag-tagged chinmo in adult neurons using a <italic>3X ElavGS</italic> driver (<italic>3X ElavGS&gt; UAS Flag chinmo</italic>) reduced endogenous Fatp protein levels under AL conditions. The western blot analysis was performed on whole fly lysates and is currently represented as Figure 7—figure supplement 3A and following explanation has been included in the Results section:</p><p>“To verify whether overexpression of <italic>chinmo</italic> in adult neurons led to a decrease in protein levels of the endogenous proteins involved in fat metabolism, we performed western blot analysis of whole fly lysates prepared from 3x <italic>Elavgs&gt;UAS flag chinmo</italic> flies that were fed either an AL+ RU-486 or AL+ solvent/ethanol diet for 10 days. Since, most of the downstream targets identified are not that well-characterized (<italic>CG2107, CG9527, CG17544, CG5009, CG8778,</italic> and <italic>CG9577</italic>), we tested the expression of endogenous Fatp for which antibodies were available. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-flag antibody to detect Chinmo, anti-Fatp antibody to detect endogenous Fatp, and antitubulin as normalization control. Consistent with the proteomics data, a reduction in Fatp levels was seen upon upregulation of Flag Chinmo in adult neurons (Figure 7—figure supplement 3A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) They then test the functional role for FASN1 and FATP in DR-dependent lifespan extension. Once again, it would be helpful for the authors to explain in the text the predictions for this experiment. To my mind, if downregulation of chinmo in the fat body is important for DR-induced lifespan extension and if chinmo represses the fasn1 and fatp genes, then loss of chinmo should in increase FASN1 and FATP expression and this should aid in fatty acid turnover. Depletion of fasn1 and fatp should then decrease DR-induced lifespan extension, which is confirmed by the results (Figure 6I and J), and mis-expression of these factors should increase this extension, which again is supported by the results (Figure 6L). These are important results for the paper but are insufficiently explained in the text by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 3 and thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The text in the Results section of the revised manuscript has been edited to explain the predictions for these experiments. To test whether downregulation of the candidate fat metabolism genes in the adult fat tissue was responsible for modulating lifespan, we measured survival of flies that expressed transgenes to knockdown <italic>fasn1</italic> and <italic>fatp</italic> specifically in the adult fat body (Figure 7I, J). We predicted that if overexpression of one of these genes was sufficient to cause increased lipid turnover and consequentially DR-mediated lifespan extension, then knockdown of these genes would result in a reduction in lifespan upon DR. Knockdown of <italic>fasn1</italic> resulted in an 18.7% decrease in median lifespan of flies that were fed an AL diet and a 3.22% decrease in median lifespan on DR diet (Figure 7I and Figure 7-source data 1). Knockdown of <italic>fatp</italic> resulted in a 14.8% decrease in median lifespan upon DR and no change under AL conditions (Figure 7J and Figure 7-source data 2). Since knockdown of <italic>fatp</italic> resulted in a decrease in the lifespan of flies that were fed a DR diet, we tested whether increasing the levels of <italic>fatp</italic> in the adult fat tissue led to an increase in the lifespan of flies under AL conditions. Western blot analysis of whole fly lysates prepared from <italic>FBGS &gt; UAS Flag fatp</italic> flies that were fed an AL or DR diet in the presence and absence of RU-486 for 10 days revealed that Flag Fatp was expressed in an inducible manner, however, much lower levels of the flag-tagged protein was detected under AL conditions as compared to that in DR conditions (Figure 7—figure supplement 3D). Overexpressing <italic>UAS-Flag-FATP</italic> specifically in the adult fat tissue increased median life span by 14.2% under AL conditions and by 25% under DR conditions (Figure 7K). The smaller increase in median lifespan in AL conditions is likely due to the lower induction of the protein, nevertheless, an increase in lifespan in both diets indicates that Fatp functions as a pro-longevity factor and that DR dependent increase in lifespan occurs due to an increase in the expression of two or more genes that are regulated by Chinmo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 7, they express human miR125 in fat body and examine lifespan extension. Once again, the rationale for these experiments is totally unclear to me. The model introduced earlier in the paper is that neuronal (not fat body) miR125 extends lifespan under DR. Why did they perform the experiments in Figure 7? How do these results add to the paper? To me, they detract from the paper. The authors need to definitely establish in which cells miR125 is acting and in which cells chinmo is being regulated.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in the Results section of Figure 8 (Figure 7 in the previously submitted version). We have edited the Results section to include a rationale for performing the experiments in Figure 8. We have examined the expression of <italic>miR-125</italic> and <italic>chinmo</italic> in the brain and fat tissue under AL and DR conditions and our data indicated that DR induces both <italic>miR-125</italic> and <italic>chinmo</italic> in the fat tissue (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G and Figure 8B, compare -AL and -DR bars). However, the lower expression levels of <italic>miR-125</italic> in the fat body as well as higher induction of <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA limit <italic>miR-125</italic>mediated downregulation of Chinmo in this tissue. By expressing human <italic>miR-125</italic> in the adult fat body, we addressed four questions: (i) Is the role of <italic>miR-125</italic> in fat tissue conserved i.e., can human primary <italic>miR-125</italic> substitute for <italic>Drosophila miR-125</italic>; (ii) <italic>Can miR-125</italic> function as a DR-mimetic i.e., can modulating its level provide benefits of DR, irrespective of diet (i.e., in both AL and DR). (iii) Can increasing levels of the miRNA silence <italic>chinmo</italic> more efficiently and provide additional benefits. (iv) Can increasing the levels of a miRNA in a tissue that it is not expressed/expressed at low levels be used as a strategy to redirect the role of its downstream targets. Consistent with our expression analysis of <italic>miR-125</italic>, a previous study in the mouse model reported <italic>miR-125b</italic> as one of the miRNAs that increase in the subcutaneous white fat tissue upon caloric restriction (Mori et al., 2012). However, the beneficial effects of increasing <italic>miR-125b</italic> in the fat tissue were not examined in the mouse model. Hence, we tested whether artificially increasing the levels of <italic>miR-125</italic> specifically in the fat tissue would lead to silencing of <italic>chinmo</italic> and consequentially lead to an increase in lifespan. Our results revealed that overexpression of <italic>miR-125</italic> in fat tissue does increase lifespan of flies that are fed an AL diet but more so in DR. Since, only one dose/condition of induction was utilized, further optimization of induction duration or RU-486 would likely lead to a greater enhancement in lifespan upon AL. Nevertheless, these initial results are promising because the data indicates that the modulation of this miRNA in the fat tissue is beneficial at an organismal level. In addition, this analysis also shows that the functional role of miR-125 as a pro-longevity factor is conserved and that human <italic>pri miR-125</italic> can extend lifespan. In the revised manuscript, we have edited the text to clarify that both <italic>miR-125</italic>-dependent and nutrition-dependent post-translational control of Chinmo mediate the DR-mediated increase in lifespan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 8 is a model of the result, but it does not clarify any of the confusion about the autonomy of chinmo activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the model (Figure 9) to clarify that both <italic>miR-125</italic> dependent regulation of <italic>chinmo</italic> in the adult brain, as well as DR-mediated post-translational regulation of Chinmo in the fat tissue, are required for extension of lifespan upon DR. The proposed model summarizes the mechanism by which <italic>chinmo</italic> regulates lifespan extension by dietary restriction. <italic>miR-125</italic> targets <italic>chinmo</italic> mRNA in the brain under AL and DR conditions. In the adult fat tissue, Chinmo transcriptionally represses genes involved in fat metabolism. Dietary restriction mediated cytoplasmic relocalization of Chinmo in the fat tissue relieves transcriptional repression of genes involved in fat metabolism, thus increasing lifespan. Thus, regulation of <italic>chinmo</italic> at the transcriptional (nutrition-dependent), post-transcriptional (<italic>miR-125</italic>-dependent) and post-translational (dSir2-dependent) ensures DR-mediated extension of lifespan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 1B are missing the appropriate control, which is the &quot;rescue&quot; genotype.

Chinmo is regulated by <italic>let-7</italic> and <italic>miR-125</italic> and wild type <italic>let-7</italic> in the <italic>miR-125</italic> mutants ensures that <italic>chinmo</italic> is repressed during development. In the Figure 2C and D panels (Previous Figure 2A) we are trying to assess whether knockdown of <italic>chinmo</italic> in <italic>miR-125</italic> expressing cells rescues the <italic>miR-125</italic> mutant phenotype. Our previous analysis (Chawla et al., 2016) of Chinmo protein levels in adult brains indicates that Chinmo is predominantly repressed by <italic>miR-125</italic> in adult fly brains and as a consequence, <italic>miR-125</italic> mutants display upregulated Chinmo protein in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). <italic>Let-7</italic> miRNA ensures that <italic>chinmo</italic> is repressed during development (late third instar onwards). Since, both the control and experimental strains in Figure 2C-D have wildtype <italic>let-7</italic> miRNA, <italic>chinmo</italic> is repressed during development even when <italic>let-7-C Gal4</italic> is driving <italic>chinmo<sup>RNA</sup></italic><sup>i</sup>.

We have included additional data to support our preliminary analysis. <italic>Chinmo</italic> mRNA and protein are transcriptionally and post-translationally regulated upon starvation. In the revised manuscript we show that dSir2 deacetylates Chinmo and facilitates its distribution to the cytoplasm upon starvation.

These data further support our model that silencing of <italic>chinmo</italic> by <italic>miR-125</italic> is critical for DR. Our model proposes that repression of <italic>chinmo</italic> in the brain and fat tissue is required for DR mediated lifespan extension and hence, we would expect that increasing mRNA or protein levels of this dosage-sensitive factor would be deleterious. We believe that <italic>chinmo</italic> is an example in support of the Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis that proposes that a gene that controls multiple traits, where at least one of the traits is beneficial to the organism’s fitness early on in life and at least one is detrimental to the organism’s fitness later-on (during aging).
