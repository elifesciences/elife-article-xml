pathways into sub-cellular domains, but the role of inter-organelle contacts in organizing metabolic reactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in response to acute glucose restriction (AGR) yeast undergo metabolic remodeling of their mevalonate pathway that is spatially coordinated at nucleus-vacuole junctions (NVJs). The NVJ serves as a metabolic platform by selectively retaining HMG-CoA Reductases (HMGCRs), driving mevalonate pathway flux in an Upc2-dependent manner. Both spatial retention of HMGCRs and increased mevalonate pathway flux during AGR is dependent on NVJ tether Nvj1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HMGCRs associate into high-molecular-weight assemblies during AGR in an Nvj1-dependent manner. Loss of Nvj1-mediated HMGCR partitioning can be bypassed by artificially multimerizing HMGCRs, indicating NVJ compartmentalization enhances mevalonate pathway flux by promoting the association of HMGCRs in high molecular weight assemblies. Loss of HMGCR compartmentalization perturbs yeast growth following glucose starvation, indicating it promotes adaptive metabolic remodeling. Collectively, we propose a non-canonical mechanism regulating mevalonate metabolism via the spatial compartmentalization of rate-limiting HMGCR enzymes at an inter-organelle contact site.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lipid droplet</kwd><kwd>mevalonate</kwd><kwd>nucleus-vacuole junction</kwd><kwd>sterol-ester</kwd><kwd>HMG-CoA Reductase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henne</surname><given-names>W Mike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM119768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henne</surname><given-names>W Mike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM008297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>Sean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK126887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henne</surname><given-names>W Mike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and biochemical analyses, coupled with fluorescence imaging, reveal that spatial compartmentalization of HMG-CoA Reductases at yeast ER-lysosome contacts modulates mevalonate pathway flux during glucose restriction, enabling metabolic adaptation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The complexity of eukaryotic metabolism requires spatial organization, so membrane-bound and membraneless organelles compartmentalize enzymes into distinct sub-cellular regions. Enzyme partitioning into spatially defined domains is a cellular organizational principle observed in cytoplasmic assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chan et al., 2015</xref>), enzyme homo-polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meredith and Lane, 1978</xref>) and biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). Such enzymatic assemblies, or metabolons, enhance or fine-tune metabolic flux, locally sequester toxic intermediates, or limit product shunting to competing pathways. Enzyme partitioning has also been exploited in synthetic bioengineering to artificially force enzymes into close proximity to drive local reactions or metabolic channeling through enzymatic cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dueber et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Inter-organelle contact sites also serve as platforms for enzymatic organization and lipid synthesis reactions. In particular, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) partitions lipogenic processes like non-vesicular lipid transport and organelle biogenesis at inter-organelle junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lev, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hariri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>). In yeast and humans, mitochondrial-associated membranes with the ER (MAMs) harbor enhanced metabolic activity to support reactions such as the biosynthesis and transport of phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vance, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gaigg et al., 1995</xref>). More recent work has highlighted the role of ER-mitochondrial contacts defining distinct sub-domains within mitochondria that support the formation of multi-enzyme complexes that drive Coenzyme Q synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Subramanian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2019</xref>). In yeast, the nuclear envelope (continuous with the ER network) also makes extensive contact with the vacuole (equivalent to the lysosome), forming a nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ). Formed through hetero-dimerization of nuclear envelope protein Nvj1 and vacuole-associated protein Vac8, the NVJ is a disc-shaped inter-organelle contact that acts as a multi-functional platform to organize lipid transport, fatty acid synthesis, and lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis, particularly during metabolic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hariri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Murley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kvam et al., 2005</xref>). Despite these insights, few studies mechanistically dissect how metabolic cues regulate enzyme recruitment and compartmentalization at inter-organelle contacts. Furthermore, how inter-organelle junctions enable enzyme spatial organization to fine-tune or enhance metabolic flux remains poorly described. Such inter-organelle crosstalk is particularly pertinent to understanding adaptive responses to stresses such as glucose starvation, which is characterized by drastic decreases in cellular ATP as well as changes in cytoplasmic pH and fluidity that alter macromolecular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Munder et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use budding yeast as a genetically enabling model system to dissect the role of ER-lysosome contacts (e.g. the NVJ) as organizational platforms in mevalonate metabolism. We find that in response to acute glucose restriction (AGR), yeast actively partition and selectively retain HMG-CoA Reductase (HMGCR) enzymes at the NVJ in a Nvj1 and Upc2-dependent manner. This enzyme sub-compartmentalization enhances mevalonate pathway flux and promotes mevalonate and ultimately sterol-ester biosynthesis during AGR-induced metabolic remodeling. Furthermore, we find loss of HMGCR NVJ partitioning impacts metabolic remodeling following glucose starvation; failure to compartmentalize HMGCRs affects resumption of yeast growth following re-introduction to glucose containing media, but can be rescued by addition of exogenous mevalonate. We also find that NVJ compartmentalization of HMGCRs is accompanied by an Nvj1-dependent association of HMGCRs into high-molecular-weight complexes. Interestingly, both the growth resumption delay and mevalonate production phenotypes observed in Nvj1 knock-out cells can be rescued by the artificial multimerization of HMGCRs via a tetramerizing tag.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Yeast Hmg-CoA reductases (HMGCRs) inducibly partition at the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ) in response to acute glucose restriction (AGR)</title><p>Given that ER-mediated contact sites in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> act as lipogenic domains, we visually screened GFP-tagged neutral lipid metabolism enzymes for signs of compartmentalization at ER inter-organelle contact sites in yeast exposed to AGR. Note that AGR is operationally defined here as culturing yeast in synthetic complete (SC) media containing 2% glucose, then briefly centrifuging them and placing them into SC media containing 0.001% glucose. Screening revealed that endogenously GFP-tagged HMG-CoA Reductases (HMGCR) Hmg1 and Hmg2, which localize throughout ER network and particularly on the nuclear envelope (NE), enriched at the regions where the nuclear surface was in contact with the vacuole following AGR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This nucleus-vacuole interface was confirmed to be the NVJ as Hmg1-GFP co-localized with NVJ tether Nvj1-mRuby3 following AGR treatment for 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As Hmg1 and Hmg2 are functionally redundant in mevalonate synthesis, a central metabolite that supplies diverse cellular pathways including sterol biogenesis, we chose to dissect the mechanisms underlying Hmg1 NVJ partitioning. To investigate whether the NVJ was required for Hmg1 partitioning, we imaged Hmg1-GFP in the absence of NVJ tethers Nvj1 and Vac8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pan et al., 2000</xref>), and found they were required for Hmg1-GFP partitioning during AGR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, time-lapse imaging revealed that Hmg1-GFP NVJ partitioning peaked after ~4 hr of introducing yeast to AGR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). During this period, Hmg1-GFP was ~15 times enriched at the NVJ relative to other NE regions. Collectively, this suggests that AGR induces the time-dependent compartmentalization of Hmg1/2 at the NVJ in a Nvj1 and Vac8 dependent manner.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The HMG-CoA Reductases, Hmg1 and Hmg2, enrich at the NVJ in an Nvj1-dependent manner during AGR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal microscopy images of yeast expressing endogenously tagged Hmg1-GFP or Hmg2-GFP (green) grown in SC media with 2% glucose to an OD of 0.5 (Log), or in 0.001% glucose for 4 hr (AGR). Vacuoles (magenta) were visualized by staining with FM4-64.

The HMGCRs are the rate-limiting enzymes of the mevalonate pathway that generates ergosterol, the cholesterol analog of yeast. To dissect whether other proteins along the mevalonate pathway also partition at the NVJ during AGR, we imaged 20 endogenously mNeonGreen (mNG)-tagged proteins involved in ergosterol biosynthesis under ambient and AGR stress, but surprisingly none detectably enriched at the NVJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As the NVJ has also been proposed to function in sterol transport between the vacuole and ER network, we also examined whether loss of the NVJ-resident proteins Osh1 and Lam6/Ltc1, implicated in the inter-organelle trafficking of lipids and/or sterols, would impact Hmg1-GFP NVJ recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Murley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kvam and Goldfarb, 2004</xref>).

We began by interrogating whether the NVJ-partitioned and non-partitioned Hmg1-GFP pools were physically segregated along the NE. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we determined that the non-partitioned Hmg1-GFP pool can enter the NVJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>); therefore, there is likely no diffusion barrier at the NVJ allowing selective entry of only specific pools of Hmg1-GFP protein. Next we interrogated whether Hmg1-GFP was selectively retained after entry into the NVJ region. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) revealed the average lifetime of NVJ-partitioned Hmg1-GFP was &gt;100 s, compared to only ~25 s for Hmg1-GFP along the rest of the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Given that most of the Hmg1-GFP signal within the NVJ-partitioned population was not photobleached to completion, calculated halftimes may underestimate the actual halftime. Collectively, this indicates that upon AGR, Hmg1-GFP is recruited and selectively retained at the NVJ. Surprisingly, the halftime of Hmg1-GFP was also significantly increased during AGR in <italic>nvj1</italic>Δ cells. This may be connected to a change in cytoplasmic viscosity which has been examined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>); however, further analysis is required to determine if this reduced mobility is specific to Hmg1-GFP or a general consequence of AGR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Hmg1 is selectively retained at the NVJ and requires a luminal domain of Nvj1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spinning disk confocal microscopy images from FRAP movies of yeast expressing endogenously tagged Hmg1-GFP and stained with FM4-64 (magenta). Portions of the NE corresponding to the NVJ were photobleached (white arrows) and recovery was monitored in both WT and <italic>nvj1</italic>Δ cells grown to log phase or after 4 hr of AGR.

We generated truncated versions of GFP-tagged Hmg1 containing only its integral transmembrane (TM) region and lacking its cytoplasm-exposed catalytic domain. This Hmg1<sub>1-525</sub>-GFP truncation was sufficient to localize to the NVJ during AGR, indicating the integral membrane region of Hmg1 was sufficient for NVJ recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). To dissect the Nvj1 regions required for Hmg1-GFP recruitment, we expressed mNg-tagged Nvj1 fragments in yeast co-expressing Hmg1-mRuby3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). A Nvj1-mNG chimera lacking its cytoplasm-exposed region and containing a vacuole-binding PX domain in place of its Vac8-binding domain (Nvj1-PX) was sufficient to tether between the nucleus and vacuole, and was sufficient to partition Hmg1-mRuby3 at the NVJ during AGR, indicating the Nvj1 cytoplasmic domain is not required for Hmg1 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, a Nvj1-mNG chimera with its TM region replaced with the TM of Nvj2 (Nvj1<sub>Nvj2TM</sub>) also partitioned Hmg1-mRuby3 at the NVJ, indicating the TM and cytoplasmic regions are not required for Hmg1-mRuby3 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, expression of a full length Nvj1-mNG lacking residues 15–30 (Nvj1<sub>Δ15-30</sub>) of its luminal region formed an NVJ contact but failed to recruit Hmg1-mRuby3. Re-addition of six residues to this construct (Nvj1<sub>Δ15-24</sub>) rescued Hmg1-mRuby3 recruitment. Furthermore, mutation of arginine and lysine residues at positions 28/29 to alanines (Nvj1<sub>RK→AA</sub>) also ablated AGR-induced recruitment of Hmg1 to the NVJ, suggesting residues 25–30 of the Nvj1 luminal domain play a key role in Hmg1-mRuby3 NVJ partitioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the ER embedded region of Hmg1 is recruited to the NVJ in a manner requiring the ER-luminal Nvj1 region, and that Hmg1 partitioning is not dependent on the Hmg1 cytoplasmic catalytic domain nor the Nvj1 cytoplasmic/vacuole binding region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NVJ partitioning of Hmg1 is Upc2 dependent and correlates with sterol-ester biosynthesis</title><p>The NVJ was previously identified as a site for starvation-induced microautophagy of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Roberts et al., 2003</xref>), where NVJ-associated proteins accumulate and are subsequently engulfed by the vacuole.

To determine if NVJ partitioning of Hmg1-GFP regulated Hmg1 protein abundance or turnover, we performed immunoblot analysis of Hmg1-GFP in log-phase and 4 hr AGR-treated cells.

In contrast, treatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide during AGR returned Hmg1-GFP protein abundance to levels comparable with log-phase cells.

We found that neither Nvj1 localization, Nvj1 expression, nor NVJ size was affected in the absence of Upc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>); therefore, loss of Hmg1 NVJ partitioning in <italic>upc2</italic>Δ cells occurs independently of Nvj1.

Co-treatment with the HMGCR inhibitor lovastatin during AGR suppressed this SE elevation, indicating the elevated SE pool originated from de novo SE synthesis rather than esterification of pre-existing ergosterol.

Both Hmg1-mRuby3 and Hmg1-DsRed2-tagged strains manifested similar increases in Hmg1 abundance in AGR, suggesting this tagging did not affect AGR-induced Hmg1 protein increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, Hmg1-DsRed2 protein migrated at higher than expected molecular weight even in SDS-PAGE gels compared to Hmg1-mRuby3, suggesting the DsRed2 tag promoted self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Hmg1-DsRed2 foci were also noted on the NE during AGR, consistent with stabilized Hmg1 multimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>As expected, <italic>nvj1</italic>Δ cells tagged with mRuby3 still manifested elevated <sup>14</sup>C-labeled HMG-CoA and reduced squalene, ergosterol, and SE labeling associated with NVJ loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–G</xref>).

How cells spatially and temporally coordinate this remodeling remains poorly characterized, yet critical to our understanding to cell adaptation and survival. Changes in nutrient availability can drive the subcellular re-distribution of enzymes within cells, as well as the formation of enzyme assemblies or complexes that promote or fine-tune metabolic pathways. Here, we present evidence that AGR in yeast enhances mevalonate pathway flux, and propose the mechanism underlying this requires the spatial compartmentalization of the rate-limiting HMGCR enzymes at the yeast NVJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).</p><p>Through time-lapse and FRAP/FLIP-based imaging, we find that Hmg1 is recruited and selectively retained at the NVJ in a manner requiring basic residues within the Nvj1 luminal domain. We also demonstrate that Hmg1 partitioning at the NVJ can be uncoupled from Nvj1 binding of Vac8, which further supports a model where Hmg1 partitioning is being controlled predominantly from the ER. One model is that Hmg1 is selectively recruited as an enzyme ‘client’ to the Nvj1 ‘scaffold’ during AGR, but we cannot rule out the possibility that other factors may be involved together with Nvj1 in Hmg1 selective retention at the NVJ. Indeed, Upc2, a sterol-sensing transcription factor required for Hmg1 NVJ partitioning, appears to influence Hmg1 independent of either Nvj1 expression or localization, which may suggest additional factors required for Hmg1 partitioning at the NVJ. Both the requirement of Upc2 and the sufficiency of the Erg1 inhibitor terbinafine to induce Hmg1 NVJ partitioning is consistent with AGR stress producing a cellular demand for mevalonate. In line with this, we observe an increase in de novo SE synthesis during AGR; however, we cannot rule out that other mevalonate-derived metabolites may play important roles during AGR. In fact, we would expect AGR to promote a metabolic switch to mitochondrial respiration, which in part utilizes at least one mevalonate-derived metabolite, coenzyme Q, to function as an electron carrier. In support of this, we do not observe significant decline of steady-state SE levels in <italic>nvj1</italic>Δ cells, suggesting that mevalonate may be shunted into several pathways during AGR. Remarkably, <italic>nvj1</italic>Δ yeast manifest alterations in mevalonate pathway flux and growth defects when faced with glucose starvation, which can be rescued by the addition of exogenous mevalonate (the HMGCR enzymatic product).</p><p>We have additionally uncovered that mevalonate pathway flux can be rescued in <italic>nvj1</italic>Δ cells by artificially multimerizing Hmg1 using a tetrameric fluorophore. In line with this, we have observed that Hmg1 has a propensity to assemble into HMW species &gt; 720 kDa during AGR in a Nvj1-dependent manner. Thus, mevalonate pathway flux during AGR appears tightly correlated with the ability to form HMW Hmg1 species at the NVJ, rather than the total Hmg1 protein level in the cell. To more fully dissect the role of HMGCR spatial compartmentalization on mevalonate metabolism, we generated an artificial yeast strain that maintains more constant Hmg1 protein levels and inducibly accumulates at the NVJ, thus functionally uncoupling Hmg1 protein abundance from NVJ spatial compartmentalization. Remarkably, this strain exhibits defects in mevalonate pathway flux when Hmg1 cannot be NVJ partitioned, again underscoring the role of Hmg1 spatial compartmentalization in fine-tuning mevalonate metabolism. Collectively, we present a model where AGR-induced metabolic remodeling of mevalonate metabolism is spatially coordinated at the NVJ via selective retention of HMGCRs and their subsequent incorporation into HMW species. An intriguing possibility is that, in general, inter-organelle contact sites act as platforms that slow the diffusion of proteins that enter them via their interactions with resident tether ‘scaffolds’, thus increasing the local concentrations of proteins and enzymes sufficient to fine-tune metabolic flux.</p><p>Glucose and other nutrient limitations can induce autophagy and have previously been shown to induce micro-lipophagy, where lipid droplets are engulfed by the yeast vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Seo et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, we have observed that LDs accumulate in close proximity to the NVJ during periods of glucose limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hariri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hariri et al., 2019</xref>). The relationship between LD biogenesis and HMGCR partitioning at the NVJ is not fully resolved here and requires further study. An intriguing possibility is that the spatial re-organization of HMGCRs may contribute to LD biogenesis or compositional remodeling during the general metabolic remodeling required during glucose restriction.</p><p>In addition to inducing the compartmentalization of HMGCRs at the NVJ, yeast glucose starvation has also been shown to induce the formation of several cytoplasmic enzyme assemblies involved in nucleotide (Ura7), amino acid (Gly1), and lipid (Acs1) metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). These cytoplasmic assemblies are thought to reduce enzymatic activity and promote the transition into cellular dormancy. In contrast, other protein assemblies promote enzymatic activity. In the liver, the protein Mig12 binds to cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylases (Acc) and promotes their polymerization and catalytic activity, which elevates fatty acid synthesis and eventual triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Our work provides evidence that HMGCRs form similar spatial assemblies at yeast ER-lysosome contact sites, implicating a role for inter-organelle junctions in the spatial coordination of metabolically-induced enzymatic assembly formation. With this, we have added to a long, and growing, list for roles fulfilled by inter-organelle contact sites in metabolic regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cervisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">W303</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">W303</td><td valign="top">See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for all yeast strains</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Saccharomyces cervisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pRS305 vector backbone (Leu selection)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">pRS305</td><td valign="top">See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for all yeast expression plasmids</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-GFP <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat# abcam290</td><td valign="top">WB (1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-mRuby3 <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# R10367</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-DsRed2 <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Origene</td><td valign="top">Cat#: TA180005</td><td valign="top">WB: (1:1,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-tubulin <break/>(rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ab6160</td><td valign="top">WB: (1:15,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Sec61 <break/>(rabbit poly)</td><td valign="top">J.

Photobleaching movies were taken on an Andor spinning disk confocal microscope through a 63x oil objective (NA = 1.4). The microscope is equipped with an Andor Ultra EMCCD and Metamorph software. For FRAP measurements, a single circular ROI of 0.77 μm<sup>2</sup> that corresponds to the NVJ was selected and bleached with a 408 nm laser at 100% power and 100 ms dwell time. One image was taken before the bleach, and subsequent images were taken every 500 ms for a total movie length of 25 s. For FLIP measurements, single circular ROIs of 0.77 μm<sup>2</sup> were selected, taking care to select an area of the NE that was furthest from the NVJ. Each bleaching cycle consisted of a pre-bleach image, a single bleach with a 408 nm laser with a 100 ms dwell time, and four post-bleach images taken 500 ms apart.

Images are taken every 6 min. Prior to loading into the microfluidics chamber, cells were sonicated and mixed with 50 μL SCD media to achieve an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.1. In the chamber, cells are first grown for 2 hr in SCD. Next, they are exposed to acute glucose restriction (AGR) by switching to SC for 10 hr which is followed by glucose replenishment by 4 hr SCD. To determine time of growth resumption, cells are segmented and tracked as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Doncic et al., 2013</xref>). Next, the time of resumption is annotated semi-automatically using a custom MATLAB software by determining the time of bud growth or new bud emergence during the 4-hr glucose replenishment following AGR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Approximately 50OD units of cells were collected for protein extraction. Prior to protein extraction, cell pellet wet weights were normalized. Protein extraction was accomplished by precipitating proteins with 20% TCA for 30 min on ice, followed by three washes of the pellet with cold 100% acetone. The protein pellet was dried for fifteen minutes in a speed-vac to remove residual acetone, and all pellets were resuspended in 2x SDS sample buffer (65.8 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% SDS; 25% glycerol; 10% 2-mercaptoethanol; 0.01% bromophenol blue). Resuspended protein samples were heated at 70°C for 10 min prior to being loaded onto a homemade 4–15% polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane in Towbin SDS transfer buffer using a Criterion tank blotter with plate electrodes (BioRad 1704070). Immediately following transfer, membranes were stained with PonceauS and cut using a clean razor blade. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk dissolved in TBS-T buffer, and primary antibodies were allowed to bind overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies used for determining Hmg1 protein expression are as follows: GFP (Abcam ab290; 1:10,000 dilution), mRuby3 (Invitrogen R10367; 1:1000 dilution), and DsRed2 (OriGene TA180005; 1:1000 dilution). Rat monoclonal antibody to tubulin (Abcam ab6160; 1:15,000 dilution) and rabbit polyclonal antibody to Sec61 (Jonathan Friedman lab; 1:5000 dilution) were used as loading controls. Immunoblots were developed by binding HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma A0545; 1:10,000), anti-rat IgG (Abcam ab97057; 1:10,000), or anti-mouse IgG (Abcam ab6728; 1:2,000) secondary antibodies to the membrane for 1 hr in the presence of 5% milk followed by three washes in TBS-T and developing with ECL substrate (BioRad cat. 1705061). Signal was captured by X-ray film.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Radiolabeling, metabolite extraction, and metabolite separation</title><p>Approximately 100OD units of cells were used for radiolabeling experiments. All cells were grown and treated with AGR as previously described. Prior to radiolabeling, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with dextrose-free media. All liquid was removed from cell pellets prior to labeling. To start radiolabeling, 1.0 mL of dextrose-free media containing 5 μCi/mL <sup>14</sup>C-Acetate was quickly added to each tube, followed by mixing with pipetting. Tubes were tumbled in a 30°C rotating incubator for fifteen minutes. To quench the radiolabeling reaction, and wash the cells, samples were pipetted into 20 mL of −40°C quenching buffer (60% methanol; 1 mM tricine pH 7.4). Cells were incubated in quenching buffer for three minutes, centrifuged at 3000xg at −10°C, and washed with 20 mL of −40°C quenching buffer. Cells were again pelleted by centrifugation, and pellets for lipid extraction were stored at −80°C. For pellets undergoing soluble metabolite extraction, all quenching buffer was thoroughly removed and 1.5 mL of 80°C 75% ethanol was added to each sample followed by a three-minute incubation at 80°C and a subsequent 5-min incubation on ice. Debris was removed from metabolite extract by centrifuging at 20,000xg for 1 min. HMG-CoA labeled during the pulse was separated and quantified as mevalonate. To convert endogenous HMG-CoA to mevalonate, ethanol was thoroughly evaporated from isolated metabolites under argon gas, and each sample was resuspended in HMGCR buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 1 mM NaCl; 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 1 mM DTT; 100 mM glucose-6-phosphate; 1 mM NADP+; 1 mM NADPH). The samples were split into two tubes, one tube would be treated with enzymes, and the untreated tubes acted as blanks for endogenous mevalonate labeled during the pulse. For treated tubes, 2U of HMGCR enzyme (Sigma H7039) and 2U of glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma G6378) were added. Reactions were carried out over night at 37°C. Prior to loading samples onto TLC plates, total radioactivity in each sample was quantified by scintillation counting and loading was adjusted accordingly. HMGCR Reactions were spotted onto Silica gel G plates (Miles scientific P01911) and separated with a mobile phase of 70:25:5 Diethyl ether:glacial acetic acid:water. Each lane was doped with 5 μg of unlabeled mevalonate to act as a tracer for downstream scraping/quantification. TLC plates were developed overnight by autoradiography and visualized in an Amersham Typhoon FLA 9500 developer. To visualize the unlabeled tracer mevalonate, plates were sprayed with p-anisaldehyde reagent and baked at 140°C for 10 min. Individual bands were scraped, mixed with 6 mL of EcoLume scintillation cocktail (VWR cat. IC88247001), and quantified by scintillation counting in a Beckman LS 6500 instrument. Mevalonate from the untreated samples was averaged and subtracted from the final values of the treated samples. For lipid extracts, an aliquot of cell lysate was taken immediately following bead beating and radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting to serve as a normalization standard prior to loading samples onto the TLC plate. Lipid extraction was performed as described above. To separate squalene, ergosterol, DAG, and sterol-esters, total lipid extracts were spotted onto silica gel 60G plates (Fisher cat. NC9825743), and developed in a mobile phase of 55:35:10:1 hexane:petroleum ether:diethyl ether:glacial acetic acid. Autoradiography and scintillation counting was performed as indicated above. Prior to TLC separation, unlabeled squalene, ergosterol, and sterol-ester was added to each lane of the plate as tracer. DAG and ergosterol were quantified by densitometry in Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Native protein isolation</title><p>Approximately 100OD units of cells were collected for BN-PAGE analysis. Cell pellets were collected into 2 mL screw-cap tubes and frozen at −80°C until further processing. For cell lysis, one large scoop of glass beads and 300 μL of lysis buffer was added to each tube (50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0; 50 mM NaCl; 250 mM sorbitol; 10% glycerol; 20 mM arginine; 20 mM glutamic acid; 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 1.0 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM DTT; 50 μM Mg132; 1x protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher cat. 78429)). Tubes containing frozen cell pellet, glass beads and lysis buffer were agitated for one minute using a bead beater followed by 2 min on ice and another minute of agitation with a bead beater. After glass bead lysis, another 700 μL of lysis buffer was added to each tube followed by a brief mixing via vortex. Cell debris was cleared by a 5 min 1000xg spin at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and centrifuged again at 21,000xg for 30 min at 4°C to isolate a crude microsomal fraction. The supernatants from the first spin were discarded and crude microsomes were washed with 1000 μL of cold lysis buffer followed by another spin at 21,000xg for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatants were again discarded and crude microsomes were resuspended in 60 μL of lysis buffer containing digitonin at a final concentration of 1.5%. Tubes were kept on ice for 30 min and gentle pipetting was applied every 10 min to aid in solubilization of the microsomes. To clear insoluble materials, tubes were centrifuged at 100,000xg for 30 min at 4°C in a Beckman TLA-55 fixed angle rotor. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes on ice after the clearance spin. Approximately 30 μL was reserved for BN-PAGE and 20 µL for SDS-PAGE. The remaining 10 μL was used to quantify protein concentrations in duplicate with the Pierce detergent compatible Bradford kit (ThermoFisher cat. 23246). For SDS-PAGE samples, 4x NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (cat. NP0007) was added to each sample for a final concentration of 1x. Each sample was supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol and urea at final concentrations of 5% and 8M, respectively. SDS-PAGE samples were heated at 37°C for 40 min and loaded onto homemade 4–15% polyacrylamide gels. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting was performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Blue native PAGE and immunoblotting</title><p>Prior to BN-PAGE, 3.3 μL of BN-PAGE loading buffer was added to each sample (100 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7.0; 500 mM 6-aminocaprioc acid; 5% Coomassie G-250) and gentle mixing was applied via vortex. Samples were loaded onto NativePAGE 3–12% Bis-Tris gels (ThermoFisher cat. BN1001BOX) alongside a NativeMark unstained protein standard (ThermoFisher cat. LC0725). Separation was performed in a mini gel tank (ThermoFisher cat. A25977) with 1x NativePAGE running buffer (ThermoFisher cat. BN2001) in the anode and 1x NativePAGE running buffer containing 1x cathode buffer additive (ThermoFisher cat. BN2002) in the cathode. Electrophoresis was performed at 150V for 30 min, after which cathode buffer was replaced with 1x NativePAGE running buffer containing 0.1x cathode buffer additive and ran at 150V for another 30 min. After 1 hr at 150V, voltage was increased to 300V until the dye front was at the bottom of the gel. Once gel case was removed, the wells and dye front were excised and discarded from the gel with a clean razor blade. The ladder was excised and stained separately in GelCode blue stain (ThermoFisher cat. 24594) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The remaining gel was incubated in denaturing buffer (300 mM Tris; 100 mM acetic acid; 1% SDS) for 20 min on a rocker, after which, the gel was placed between two glass plates wetted with denaturing buffer and incubated for one hour. Proteins were transferred to a 0.2 μm PVDF membrane overnight by wet transfer at 25V in a cold room with BN-PAGE transfer buffer (150 mM Tris; 50 mM acetic acid). After overnight transfer, the membrane was incubated in 8% acetic acid for five minutes followed by a 5-min incubation in MiilliQ water. The membrane was dried for 1 hr at room temperature and then washed quickly four times with 100% methanol followed by a quick wash with MilliQ water. The membrane was then placed in 5% milk for 1 hr, and subsequent steps for immunoblotting were performed as described above. For detection of Hmg1-3HA, an anti-HA primary antibody was used (Abcam ab9110; 1:2000 dilution) followed by rabbit secondary described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>T-tests and one-way ANOVA tests were performed using Graphpad Prism8 software.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Benoît Kornmann as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>This study shows that the yeast HMG-CoA reductase, which normally localizes throughout the ER, is, upon acute glucose removal (AGR), sequestered at a contact site between the nuclear ER and the lysosome, called nuclear-vacuole junctions (NVJ). AGR is accompanied by an increase in sterol ester synthesis, and failure to generate NVJs hampers the flux in the steryl ester biosynthesis pathway, suggesting that the sequestration of the HMG-CoA reductase impacts its activity positively. One of the strengths of the manuscript is that it takes a great care in removing any transcriptional influence by observing changes in HMG-CoA reductase activity when the protein is expressed from constitutive promoters, and also that it attempts to recreate the activity change by artificially clustering of the protein at defined positions. This novel finding stresses the importance of subcellular localization for proper wiring of metabolic fluxes. Additionally, AGR causes the appearance of liquid-crystalline structures in lipid droplets, an interesting side observation.</p><p>All three reviewers found the work exciting and important. There are nevertheless ambiguities in the present manuscript that need to be addressed, and a decision taken about what to make of the side observation with liquid crystalline structures in LDs (see below).</p><p>Points that require new experimental work:</p><p>1. The first point is about the artificial clustering. This is a very important point of the study, but the result is however yet not entirely clear.</p><p>– The human HMG-CoA reductase works as a tetramer. The oligomerization state of yeast Hmg1 is unclear. There is a strong focus on the manuscript on multimerization without data supporting it. Monomeric mRuby and tetrameric DsRed are used to manipulate the oligomeric state Hmg1 but there is no information on the oligomeric state of these fusion proteins. Moreover it is not tested whether the fusion to different tags affect the protein's activity and/or abundance. In order to make the point that it is indeed the oligomerization status change that causes the change in activity, it is necessary to rule out changes in abundance or activity due to the tags being appended to the protein.</p><p>– It is unclear why AGR should cause stabilized Hmg1-dsRed2 multimers in nvj1-delete cells (lines 243-244, figure 6I). Here the multimerization is supposed to be constitutive and driven by the dsRed. The factor (Nvj1) that is supposed to cause AGR-dependent clustering of Hmg1 is absent. Does it mean that Hmg1 has a tendency to cluster during AGR in a way that is mechanistically unclear, and in order for it to happen efficiently, it needs to be boosted, either by being sequestered at the NVJ, or by being fused to a tetramerizing tag? This definitely requires further tests and explanations.</p><p>2. The second point is Nvj1's influence on Hmg1.</p><p>– One likely explanation that is strongly implied is that Nvj1 and Hmg1 interact via the 10 a.a. stretch identified therein. Can this interaction be shown by pull-down? Is the interaction induced by AGR, or is it constitutive (in which case Hmg1 simply follows Nvj1 relocalisation to NVJs in AGR)? Also several conditions prevent Hmg1 recruitment and sequestration to NVJs (e.g. lovastatin, upc2 deletion). Do these conditions affect the making of NVJs and the localisation of Nvj1 therein or are they specific to Hmg1 recruitment?</p><p>– There is a possibility that the effects of the Nvj1 deletions are indirect through the absence of NVJ, and the absence of recruitment therein of other lipid homeostasis factors (e.g. Osh1, Tsc13, Vps13). It is however possible to decouple NVJ generation and Hmg1 recruitment by using the 10 a.a. deletion mutant. Using such a mutant would be much cleaner and ideally, all experiments using Nvj1 delete cells should be replaced or complemented with the 10 a.a. mutant. This would imply a large amount of work, and the reviewers discussed that it should be sufficient to just do the growth assays, as well as the data in figure 5A-G with this setup (see also point below).</p><p>– It is emphasized throughout that Nvj1's influence on Hmg1 activity is limited to AGR conditions. This is consistent with Hmg1 sequestrations at NVJs only in these conditions. It is however not tested.</p><p>All the data from figure 5C-G and 6D-G,J-M are in AGR only. Yet, Nvj1 might also influence the mevalonate pathway in log phase. Since it will be anyway necessary to redo the experiments of figure 5A-G with the 10 a.a. nvj1 mutant (see point above), it will be necessary to add log phase quantification. If nvj1 mutation or deletion had an effect on log phase, a condition where Hmg1 is not clustered at NVJs, then this would imply a much more indirect mechanism. To make the claim water-tight, these experiments should ideally be performed in an Hmg2-delete background to discount any variations in Hmg2 expression during AGR.</p><p>Points that might be addressed by amendments in the text, or by new experimental work:</p><p>3. The part on Liquid crystalline layered LDs is disconnected from the rest. It is not tested whether Nvj1-dependent clustering of Hmg1 to NVJs is necessary, sufficient or unrelated to the formation of these structure. While all three reviewers found it to be an interesting observation, they found that, as presently written, the manuscript is ambiguous at stating the lack of connection between the two phenomena. The title itself &quot;Glucose restriction drives spatial re-organization of mevalonate metabolism and liquid-crystalline lipid droplet biogenesis&quot; could suggest that the latter is the result of the former, which is not tested. It would be crucial to either strongly emphasize the absence of connection between the two stories (including likely remove reference to the LCL<sup>-</sup>LDs in the title), find a link between the stories (e.g. show that LCL<sup>-</sup>LDs are not made with the 10 a.a. mutant), or remove this part entirely to keep it for another, more focused manuscript.</p><p>4. The effect of Upc2 on Hmg1 is unclear. The paragraph starts with the observation of increased Hmg1 accumulation in AGR, then looks for factor affecting this induction and homes in on Upc2. There, however, instead of protein accumulation, the subcellular localization is assessed. Does Upc2 deletion blunt Hmg1 induction in AGR or does it only affect its localization? If the latter, is it because of a general imbalance in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, akin to lovastatin-treated cells? Does it also affect Njv1 localization to the vacuole, or does it affect Hmg1-Nvj1 interaction (if not constitutive, see above)? While deciphering the exact mechanistic role of Upc2 in this context is probably beyond the scope of this manuscript, it should however be discussed clearly in the text.</p><p>5. Seo and colleagues (<italic>eLife</italic> 2016) showed that AGR triggers LD autophagy. While the two phenotypes observed are not incompatible, the apparent differences of AGR in LD formation and/or consumption should at least be discussed.</p><p>6. The reduced ability of nvj1 deleted cells to cope with AGR is attributed to reduced sterylester synthesis. Since Nvj1-delete cells might be suffering from several other ailments, a more direct way to test the importance of sterylester biosynthesis in AGR survival could be to look at are1,2 deleted cells.</p><p>Please also have a careful look at and address the points of the individual reviews appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study reports that acute glucose restriction (AGR) causes the sequestration of HMG-Coa reductases at Nucleus-Vacuole Junctions (NVJs), contact sites between the nuclear ER and lysosomal membranes in yeast. This sequestration is shown to enhance the metabolic activity of the enzyme, something that is beneficial to survive AGR. In a second part, AGR is shown to cause phase separation of steryl-esters in lipid droplets, but the connection to NVJ and HM-Coa reductase sequestration is unclear. The authors hammer their points home with elegant genetics where they artificially cluster HMG-Coa reductase and remove any transcriptional influence.</p><p>This is a very interesting story that shows that mere subcellular repositioning of enzymes can affect their activity and change metabolic fluxes. It is one of the first study that pinpoints a role for membrane contact sites beyond the classical lipid and calcium exchanges.</p><p>Below are some ideas to strengthen the main claims of the paper:</p><p>1. Throughout, the importance of HMG-CoA reductase sequestration is assessed by comparing wild-type strains to a NVJ1-delete strain, which is incapable of sequestering HMG-CoA reductase to NVJs. However the deletion of Nvj1 affects much more than HMG-CoA sequestration. It affects the whole making of NVJs and the sequestration therein of several factors which could have indirect roles in the phenotypes observed, for instance Osh1, Vps13 and Tsc13. Incidentally, the authors present a much cleaner way to assess the role of HMG-CoA reductase sequestration; a mutant lacking just 5 amino acids from Nvj1, which is still able to make NVJs and presumably still able to recruit Osh1, Vps13 and Tsc13 therein. It would be much more informative if all experiments using NVJ1-delete cells were performed while rescuing the phenotype with either WT Nvj1 or the 5-aminoacid deletion thereof. This would tease apart what from the phenotype is due to a lack in HMG CoA reductase sequestration and what is due to lack of NVJs in general.</p><p>2. There is a confusion regarding Upc2's activity in regulating Hmg1. It is proposed that this transcription factor is responsible for the increased accumulation of Hmg1 in AGR. Yet, the test for this idea, does not look at Hmg1 accumulation, but at its distribution. Accumulation and distribution are two separate processes that can be teased apart as shown in figure 6A-C. It appears, from figure 4E that Upc2 rather affects the distribution of Hmg1. We do not know if it affects its accumulation, since a western blot (or any other quantification) has not been performed. Even if Upc2 was necessary for transcriptional induction of Hmg1, a change in distribution of the preexisting pool of Hmg1 should be observed, unless only the newly synthesized pool is susceptible to sequestration. This should be tested, and is not quite consistent with the experiments where Hmg1 is under the control of the ADH1 promoter. An alternate hypothesis is that Upc2 is required for the expression of another factor that is necessary for Hmg1 sequestration. This hypothesis appears quite likely and can be tested by deleting UPC2 in the strain where Hmg1 is under the Adh1 promoter.</p><p>3.

Hmg1 partitioning is mediated through its transmembrane domain and requires a 10 amino acid region in Nvj1 luminal domain.

A major assumption of this study is that Hmg1 does not normally function as a tetramer as mammalian HMGR. In mammals HMGR tetramerization is mediated by its cytosolic catalytic domain which is more than 60% similar to Hmg1. This complicates the interpretation of several experiments. For example, the authors the authors use monomeric mRuby and tetrameric DsRed to &quot;manipulate&quot; the oligomeric state Hmg1 but there is really no information on the oligomeric state of these fusion proteins.

There are nevertheless ambiguities in the present manuscript that need to be addressed, and a decision taken about what to make of the side observation with liquid crystalline structures in LDs (see below).</p><p>Points that require new experimental work:</p><p>1. The first point is about the artificial clustering. This is a very important point of the study, but the result is however yet not entirely clear.</p><p>– The human HMG-CoA reductase works as a tetramer. The oligomerization state of yeast Hmg1 is unclear. There is a strong focus on the manuscript on multimerization without data supporting it. Monomeric mRuby and tetrameric DsRed are used to manipulate the oligomeric state Hmg1 but there is no information on the oligomeric state of these fusion proteins. Moreover it is not tested whether the fusion to different tags affect the protein's activity and/or abundance. In order to make the point that it is indeed the oligomerization status change that causes the change in activity, it is necessary to rule out changes in abundance or activity due to the tags being appended to the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this excellent point. We have now analyzed both Hmg1-mRuby3 and Hmg1-DsRed2 protein expression in WT and nvj1-KO backgrounds by Western blot, and found very similar trends for Hmg1-GFP levels in WT and nvj1-KO backgrounds. That is to say, Hmg1 expression increases in AGR very similarly in both strains, suggesting that our radio-pulse data cannot be simply explained by differential protein expression. Unfortunately, due to lack of antibodies recognizing untagged Hmg1, we cannot compare Hmg1 protein expression directly <italic>between</italic> Hmg1-mRuby3 and Hmg1-DsRed2 strains. We attempted several ways to do this, including use of multiple antibodies raised against human HMGCR, but these would not recognize yeast Hmg1. We also contacted other members of the yeast community that have studied Hmg1 in the past, but no antibodies were available.</p><p>Secondly, to address the point about Hmg1 oligomerization: (1) We now directly observe Hmg1 high molecular weight (HMW) species by blue native PAGE (Figure 7A,B). Importantly, these HMW species are induced by AGR, and are Nvj1-dependent. This supports a model where AGR induces Hmg1 to partition at the NVJ, which promotes Hmg1 incorporation and/or assembly into a HMW species. (2) To be as precise on our interpretation as possible, we have changed the phrasing used in this paper to describe Hmg1 entering into ‘High Molecular Weight Species’ rather than explicitly stating that these are Hmg1 tetramers.</p><p>Third, regarding the use of DsRed2 to modulate Hmg1 multimerization: we attempted several different methods to directly monitor Hmg1-DsRed2 oligomeric status. Indeed, by BN gels, we observed that Hmg1-DsRed2 ran at high molecular weights, but these gels were often of lower quality as the Hmg1-DsRed2 bands were quite smeary. We also noted that Hmg1-DsRed2 ran at a higher than expected molecular weight even in SDS-PAGE gels, indicating that this tag promoted SDS-resistant multimers. We have now added a comparative SDS-PAGE gel showing this and comparing it to Hmg1-mRuby3 in Supp Figure 5E. You can also note the smear-like pattern of the Hmg1-DsRed2 in Supp Fig5D.</p><p>Fourth, regarding any changes to Hmg1 abundance in different genetic backgrounds: We noted above that Hmg1-DsRed2 and Hmg1-mRuby3 both display comparative increases in protein abundance with AGR, suggesting these tags to not alter the AGR-induced protein increases for Hmg1. Additionally, because we now have an Nvj1 mutant (Nvj1 RK-28,29-AA) that exhibits mevalonate pathway defects, we quantified Hmg1-mRuby3 fluorescence intensities when expressed in Nvj1 WT and Nvj1 RK-28,29-AA backgrounds. The Hmg1-mRuby3 fluorescence intensity distributions are near identical in both backgrounds, suggesting the alterations to mevalonate pathway flux in the Nvj1 RK-28,29-AA background are not due to differences in Hmg1 protein levels (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear why AGR should cause stabilized Hmg1-dsRed2 multimers in nvj1-delete cells (lines 243-244, figure 6I). Here the multimerization is supposed to be constitutive and driven by the dsRed. The factor (Nvj1) that is supposed to cause AGR-dependent clustering of Hmg1 is absent. Does it mean that Hmg1 has a tendency to cluster during AGR in a way that is mechanistically unclear, and in order for it to happen efficiently, it needs to be boosted, either by being sequestered at the NVJ, or by being fused to a tetramerizing tag? This definitely requires further tests and explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We agree: our point here was that the DsRed2 tag is designed to generate constitutive multimers for Hmg1. Indeed, we observe that this DsRed2 tag promotes Hmg1-DsRed2 to run at high molecular weight even in SDS-PAGE gels in Log or AGR conditions (Figure 7—figure supplement 1E). We do see more Hmg1-DsRed2 foci by imaging during AGR, but this may be due to the increase in total Hmg1-DsRed2 protein induced by AGR, which is similar to other tags (Figure 7—figure supplement Supp 1D). We have amended the text to try to articulate this as precisely as possible. Our current model for how Hmg1 multimerizes, which we now state in the Discussion, is that NVJ compartmentalization of Hmg1/2 may promote the probability of these enzymes, which normally diffuse throughout the ER network, to engage each other and multimerize. In essence, the NVJ may serve as an ER sub-domain where enzymes may have increased probability to engage one another.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The second point is Nvj1's influence on Hmg1.</p><p>– One likely explanation that is strongly implied is that Nvj1 and Hmg1 interact via the 10 a.a. stretch identified therein. Can this interaction be shown by pull-down? Is the interaction induced by AGR, or is it constitutive (in which case Hmg1 simply follows Nvj1 relocalisation to NVJs in AGR)? Also several conditions prevent Hmg1 recruitment and sequestration to NVJs (e.g. lovastatin, upc2 deletion). Do these conditions affect the making of NVJs and the localisation of Nvj1 therein or are they specific to Hmg1 recruitment?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Working with Hmg1 in biochemical experiments has proven very challenging as Hmg1 is prone to aggregation. Thus, we were concerned with co-IP data. However, we now present new data showing that mutation of Nvj1 residues RK-28,29 to alanine (RK— 28,29—AA) inhibits Hmg1 recruitment to the NVJ while maintaining NVJ patch formation (Figure 3G-I). This Nvj1 mutant enabled us to show that loss of Hmg1 NVJ recruitment perturbs mevalonate pathway flux (Figure 6A-D), and growth resumption after glucose starvation (Figure 6E,F) even while the NVJ is intact. We also now show that loss of Upc2 does not affect NVJ formation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C). We did not use lovastatin for these experiments. We also now comment in the Discussion that we cannot rule out the fact that the Nvj1-Hmg1 interaction may be indirect via another protein, but fully elucidating this interaction is beyond the scope of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is a possibility that the effects of the Nvj1 deletions are indirect through the absence of NVJ, and the absence of recruitment therein of other lipid homeostasis factors (e.g. Osh1, Tsc13, Vps13). It is however possible to decouple NVJ generation and Hmg1 recruitment by using the 10 a.a. deletion mutant. Using such a mutant would be much cleaner and ideally, all experiments using Nvj1 delete cells should be replaced or complemented with the 10 a.a. mutant. This would imply a large amount of work, and the reviewers discussed that it should be sufficient to just do the growth assays, as well as the data in figure 5A-G with this setup (see also point below).</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we now show that a mutant Nvj1 (Nvj1 RK-28,29-AA) shows very similar defects in mevalonate pathway flux AND growth resumption in a background where the NVJ is still intact (Figure 6A-F). This strongly suggests that the effects we observe are due to Hmg1 not being recruited to the NVJ, and not from the general loss of the NVJ itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is emphasized throughout that Nvj1's influence on Hmg1 activity is limited to AGR conditions. This is consistent with Hmg1 sequestrations at NVJs only in these conditions. It is however not tested.</p><p>All the data from figure 5C-G and 6D-G,J-M are in AGR only. Yet, Nvj1 might also influence the mevalonate pathway in log phase. Since it will be anyway necessary to redo the experiments of figure 5A-G with the 10 a.a. nvj1 mutant (see point above), it will be necessary to add log phase quantification. If nvj1 mutation or deletion had an effect on log phase, a condition where Hmg1 is not clustered at NVJs, then this would imply a much more indirect mechanism. To make the claim water-tight, these experiments should ideally be performed in an Hmg2-delete background to discount any variations in Hmg2 expression during AGR.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to monitor mevalonate pathway flux during Log phase via radiolabel pulse-chase experiments.

This also addresses the indirect effect issue.Regarding variation from Hmg2 expression, we have conducted experiments in our artificial strain that only expresses Hmg1-GFP on an artificial promoter (Figure 6H-M), as well as a strain background expressing only Hmg1 (Hmg2 also deleted here) with a mutant Nvj1 that cannot recruit Hmg1 (Figure 6A-D). Both experiment sets indicate that loss of Hmg1 recruitment to the NVJ perturbs mevalonate pathway flux.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Points that might be addressed by amendments in the text, or by new experimental work:</p><p>3. The part on Liquid crystalline layered LDs is disconnected from the rest. It is not tested whether Nvj1-dependent clustering of Hmg1 to NVJs is necessary, sufficient or unrelated to the formation of these structure. While all three reviewers found it to be an interesting observation, they found that, as presently written, the manuscript is ambiguous at stating the lack of connection between the two phenomena. The title itself &quot;Glucose restriction drives spatial re-organization of mevalonate metabolism and liquid-crystalline lipid droplet biogenesis&quot; could suggest that the latter is the result of the former, which is not tested. It would be crucial to either strongly emphasize the absence of connection between the two stories (including likely remove reference to the LCL<sup>-</sup>LDs in the title), find a link between the stories (e.g. show that LCL<sup>-</sup>LDs are not made with the 10 a.a. mutant), or remove this part entirely to keep it for another, more focused manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these constructive comments. We have now removed the data related to the liquid-crystalline LDs in this revision. The revision is thus focused on dissecting the role of Hmg1 compartmentalization on mevalonate pathway flux during AGR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The effect of Upc2 on Hmg1 is unclear. The paragraph starts with the observation of increased Hmg1 accumulation in AGR, then looks for factor affecting this induction and homes in on Upc2. There, however, instead of protein accumulation, the subcellular localization is assessed. Does Upc2 deletion blunt Hmg1 induction in AGR or does it only affect its localization? If the latter, is it because of a general imbalance in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, akin to lovastatin-treated cells? Does it also affect Njv1 localization to the vacuole, or does it affect Hmg1-Nvj1 interaction (if not constitutive, see above)? While deciphering the exact mechanistic role of Upc2 in this context is probably beyond the scope of this manuscript, it should however be discussed clearly in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show that Upc2 deletion does not alter the behavior of Hmg1 protein levels (Figure 4figure supplement 1D). We also now show that Upc2-ko does not impact NVJ formation or Nvj1 levels (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C). We agree that completely dissecting the interplay between Upc2, Nvj1, and Hmg1 is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but have revised the text to say that the full mechanism will be explored in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We now discuss the relationship between glucosestarvation induced autophagy and glucose restriction in the Discussion. We speculate that HMGCR partitioning at the NVJ may impact aspects of LD biogenesis or composition, which may ultimately impact the micro-autophagy of LDs. These are a part of ongoing studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The reduced ability of nvj1 deleted cells to cope with AGR is attributed to reduced sterylester synthesis. Since Nvj1-delete cells might be suffering from several other ailments, a more direct way to test the importance of sterylester biosynthesis in AGR survival could be to look at are1,2 deleted cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We find that the growth resumption defects associated with nvj1-ko can be rescued by culturing the yeast with mevalonate, the enzymatic product of HMGCRs. Therefore, we attribute the defects with perturbed mevalonate synthesis itself, rather than sterol-ester synthesis, per se. Mevalonate is a key metabolite needed for several metabolic pathways including sterol metabolism but also coenzyme Q and heme production, which are needed for mitochondrial metabolism. We speculate that growth resumption defects may be related to mitochondrial metabolism, but fully resolving this is beyond the scope of this current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please also have a careful look at and address the points of the individual reviews appended below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study reports that acute glucose restriction (AGR) causes the sequestration of HMG-Coa reductases at Nucleus-Vacuole Junctions (NVJs), contact sites between the nuclear ER and lysosomal membranes in yeast. This sequestration is shown to enhance the metabolic activity of the enzyme, something that is beneficial to survive AGR. In a second part, AGR is shown to cause phase separation of steryl-esters in lipid droplets, but the connection to NVJ and HM-Coa reductase sequestration is unclear. The authors hammer their points home with elegant genetics where they artificially cluster HMG-Coa reductase and remove any transcriptional influence.</p><p>This is a very interesting story that shows that mere subcellular repositioning of enzymes can affect their activity and change metabolic fluxes.

As discussed above, we now show that Nvj1 mutant RK-28,29-AA, which can form an NVJ but does not recruit Hmg1, manifests defects in mevalonate pathway flux (Figure 6A-D) and growth resumption following glucose starvation (Figure 6E,F).

However, this possibility was not formally tested by preventing steryl ester formation, which can be easily done by deleting Are1 and Are2 acyl transferases.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we have modified the text to suggest that defects in AGR response my be due to defects in mevalonate production, which is necessary for many aspects of lipid and mitochondrial metabolism. In line with this, addition of mevalonate rescues NVJ1-ko associated growth defects following AGR (Figure 5H). Additionally, we now show that the Nvj1 RK-28,29-AA, which has an NVJ but cannot recruit Hmg1 to it, and has defects in mevalonate pathway flux, also has growth resumption defects (Figure 6E,F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 6I, why does Hmg1-DsRed2 responds to AGR even in nvj1D cells. Presumably the tetramerization of DsRed is independent of glucose levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not completely understand this, but it is possible that the organization of the nuclear envelope and/or cytoplasm changes during AGR. It is also known that the fluidity of the yeast cytoplasm changes during glucose starvation, which may affect general macromolecular mobility, and could induce clustering of high molecular weight complexes (Joyner, e<italic>Life</italic>, 2016; https://elifesciences.org/articles/09376). This is part of an ongoing investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The data on LCL<sup>-</sup>LDs is very interesting but it does not seem to belong to this story.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have removed this section and put in another ongoing project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Seo and colleagues (eLife 2016) showed that AGR triggers LD autophagy. While the two phenotypes observed are not incompatible, the apparent differences of AGR in LD formation and/or consumption should at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We now discuss the Seo <italic>et al.</italic> study and its relationship to our work in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
