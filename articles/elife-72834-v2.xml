<italic>KirrelL</italic> is an essential downstream effector gene in this network and encodes an Ig-superfamily protein required for the fusion of skeletogenic cells and the formation of the skeleton. In this study, we dissected the transcriptional control region of the <italic>kirrelL</italic> gene of the purple sea urchin, <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>. Using plasmid- and bacterial artificial chromosome-based transgenic reporter assays, we identified key <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factor inputs that regulate <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic>, including direct, positive inputs from two key transcription factors in the skeletogenic GRN, Alx1 and Ets1. We next identified <italic>kirrelL cis</italic>-regulatory regions from seven other echinoderm species that together represent all classes within the phylum. By introducing these heterologous regulatory regions into developing sea urchin embryos we provide evidence of their remarkable conservation across ~500 million years of evolution. We dissected in detail the <italic>kirrelL</italic> regulatory region of the sea star, <italic>Patiria miniata</italic>, and demonstrated that it also receives direct inputs from Alx1 and Ets1. Our findings identify <italic>kirrelL</italic> as a component of the ancestral echinoderm skeletogenic GRN. They support the view that GRN subcircuits, including specific transcription factor–CRE interactions, can remain stable over vast periods of evolutionary history. Lastly, our analysis of <italic>kirrelL</italic> establishes direct linkages between a developmental GRN and an effector gene that controls a key morphogenetic cell behavior, cell–cell fusion, providing a paradigm for extending the explanatory power of GRNs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>kirrelL</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory analysis</kwd><kwd><italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory elements</kwd><kwd>Gene regulatory network</kwd><kwd>Skeletogenesis</kwd><kwd>Echinoderm</kwd><kwd>Sea urchin</kwd><kwd>Embryonic development</kwd><kwd>Biomineralization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. purpuratus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>L. variegatus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>P. miniata</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24-OD023046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ettensohn</surname><given-names>Charles A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS2004952</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ettensohn</surname><given-names>Charles A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcriptional control system of a sea urchin gene reveals the deep evolutionary conservation of a gene regulatory network underlying morphogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolutionary changes in animal form have occurred through modifications to the developmental programs that give rise to anatomy. These developmental programs can be viewed as gene regulatory networks (GRNs), complex, dynamic networks of interacting regulatory (i.e., transcription factor-encoding) genes that determine the transcriptional states of embryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peter and Davidson, 2015</xref>). Sea urchins and other echinoderms are prominent models for GRN biology for several reasons: (1) there are well-developed tools for dissecting developmental GRNs in these animals, (2) a large number of species that represent a wide range of evolutionary distances are amenable to study, and (3) there is a rich diversity of developmental modes and morphologies within the phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnone et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>All adult echinoderms possess elaborate, calcified endoskeletons. Most species are maximal indirect developers; that is, they develop via a feeding larva that undergoes metamorphosis to produce the adult. The feeding larvae of echinoids (sea urchins) and ophiuroids (brittle stars) have extensive endoskeletons, holothuroids (sea cucumbers) have rudimentary skeletal elements, and asteroids (sea stars) lack larval skeletal elements entirely. Larval skeletons are thought to be derived within the echinoderms as the feeding larvae of hemichordates (acorn worms), the sister group to echinoderms, and the larvae of crinoids (sea lilies and feather stars), a basal echinoderm clade, lack skeletons. The skeletal cells of larval and adult echinoderms are similar in many respects, supporting the widely accepted view that the larval skeleton arose via co-option of the adult skeletogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Czarkwiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao and Davidson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Killian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richardson et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>The embryonic skeleton of euechinoid sea urchins, the best studied taxon, is formed by a specialized population of skeletogenic cells known as primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs). These cells are the progeny of the large micromeres (LMs), four cells that arise near the vegetal pole during early cleavage. The GRN that underlies PMC specification is one of the best characterized GRNs in any animal embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oliveri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shashikant et al., 2018a</xref>). This GRN is initially deployed through the activity of a localized maternal protein, Dishevelled, which stabilizes β-catenin in the LM lineage, leading to the early zygotic expression of a repressor, <italic>pmar1</italic>/<italic>micro1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Logan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishimura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oliveri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peng and Wikramanayake, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weitzel et al., 2004</xref>). These molecular events lead to the zygotic expression of several regulatory genes selectively in the LM-PMC lineage. Two of the most important of these regulatory genes are <italic>alx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ettensohn et al., 2003</xref>) and <italic>ets1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kurokawa et al., 1999</xref>), each of which is required for PMC specification and morphogenesis.</p><p>After their specification, PMCs undergo a spectacular sequence of morphogenetic behaviors that includes epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), directional cell migration, cell fusion, and biomineral formation. PMCs undergo EMT at the late blastula stage, ingressing from the vegetal plate into the blastocoel. They migrate along the blastocoel wall and gradually arrange themselves in a ring-like pattern near the equator of the embryo. As they migrate, PMCs extend filopodia that fuse with those of neighboring PMCs, giving rise to a cable-like structure that joins the cells in a single, extensive syncytium. Beginning late in gastrulation and continuing throughout the remainder of embryogenesis, PMCs deposit calcified biomineral within the syncytial filopodial cable.</p><p>The complex sequence of PMC morphogenetic behaviors is regulated by hundreds of specialized effector proteins. The spatiotemporal expression patterns of these proteins are controlled by the GRN deployed in the LM-PMC lineage. A major current goal is to identify effector proteins that regulate specific PMC behaviors and elucidate the GRN circuitry that controls these genes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ettensohn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>). Dissection of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (CREs) that control essential morphogenetic effector genes, including the identification of specific transcription factor inputs, would directly link them to the relevant circuitry and provide a GRN-level explanation of developmental anatomy. At present, we have only a limited understanding of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory control of three PMC effector genes: two genes (<italic>sm30</italic> and <italic>sm50</italic>) that encode secreted proteins occluded in the biomineral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makabe et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walters et al., 2008</xref>) and a third gene (<italic>cyclophilin</italic>/<italic>cyp1</italic>) of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amore and Davidson, 2006</xref>).</p><p>KirrelL is a PMC-specific, Ig domain-containing, transmembrane protein required for cell–cell fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ettensohn and Dey, 2017</xref>). The expression and function of the protein have been examined in two sea urchin species, <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> and <italic>Lytechinus variegatus</italic>. In <italic>kirrelL</italic> morphants, PMCs extend filopodia and migrate but filopodial contacts do not result in fusion; this prevents the formation of the PMC syncytium and results in the secretion of small, unconnected biomineralized elements. In all echinoderms that have been examined, the <italic>kirrelL</italic> gene lacks introns, raising the possibility that its origin early in echinoderm evolution was a consequence of retrotransposition, a common gene transfer mechanism that results in intronless genes and one that has played a particularly prominent role in the diversification of Ig-domain-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baertsch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cordaux and Batzer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dermody et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farré et al., 2017</xref>). The expression pattern of <italic>kirrelL</italic> is typical of many PMC effector genes . In <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, <italic>kirrelL</italic> expression is first detectable at the blastula stage (~18 hpf) and peaks early in gastrulation (~30 hpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tu et al., 2014</xref>). Expression then declines and is followed by a second peak at ~64 hpf, when <italic>kirrelL</italic> is expressed predominantly at sites of active skeletal rod growth as a consequence of localized, ectoderm-derived cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun and Ettensohn, 2014</xref>). RNA-seq studies have shown that <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic>, like many PMC effector genes, is positively regulated both by Alx1 and Ets1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rafiq et al., 2014</xref>). Although the gene has only been studied in detail in sea urchins, a recent study found that <italic>kirrelL</italic> is also expressed specifically in the embryonic skeletogenic mesenchyme of a brittle star, <italic>Amphiura filiformis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dylus et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we used plasmid- and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based transgenic reporter assays to identify key CREsand transcription factor inputs that regulate <italic>kirrelL</italic> in the sea urchin, <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, directly linking this morphogenetic effector gene to the PMC GRN. In addition, we identified <italic>kirrelL cis</italic>-regulatory regions in echinoderm species from all major clades within the phylum and found that these regulatory regions drove PMC-specific expression in developing sea urchin embryos, highlighting their striking conservation across 450–500 million years of evolution. We analyzed in detail the <italic>kirrelL</italic> regulatory region of the sea star, <italic>Patiria miniata</italic>, and found that this gene, like <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic>, receives direct inputs from Alx1 and Ets1. Our findings identify <italic>kirrelL</italic> as a component of the ancestral echinoderm skeletogenic GRN and strengthen the view that GRN subcircuits, including specific transcription factor–CRE interactions, can remain stable over very long periods of evolutionary history.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The sea urchin <italic>Sp-kirrelL cis</italic>-regulatory landscape</title><p>We identified potential <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> CREs based on several criteria. We considered whether candidate regions were (1) hyperaccessible in PMCs relative to other cell types, (2) bound by Alx1, a key transcription factor in the PMC GRN and a positive regulator of <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic>, (3) associated with active enhancer RNA (eRNA) expression, and (4) phylogenetically conserved at the level of DNA sequence. In a previous study, ATAC-seq and DNase-seq were used to identify regions of chromatin that are differentially accessible in PMCs relative to other cell types at the mesenchyme blastula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shashikant et al., 2018b</xref>). ChIP-seq was used to identify binding sites of Sp-Alx1 at the same developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khor et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, we used Cap Analysis of Gene Expression Sequencing (CAGE-seq) to profile eRNA expression at nine different stages of early sea urchin embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khor et al., 2021</xref>). Significantly, our integration of these different genome-wide datasets revealed several putative CREs located near <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic>, some of which were found to share several signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Developmental CAGE-seq profiles of eRNAs also provided additional information regarding temporal patterns of CRE activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To assist in identifying candidate CREs regulating the spatiotemporal expression of <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic>, we used GenePalette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2017</xref>) to perform phylogenetic footprinting of the <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>L. variegatus kirrelL</italic> gene loci. Based on cross-species sequence conservation, cell type-specific DNA accessibility, Sp-Alx1-binding, and eRNA expression, we divided the intergenic sequences flanking <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> into nine putative CREs (labeled elements A–I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Increasing the distance between the C.ChIP element and the promoter (as in the C.DNase construct) significantly reduced enhancer activity.

Strikingly, we found that elements B, C, E, F, H, and I were individually able to drive strong PMC-specific GFP expression when cloned adjacent to the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter, although these elements had previously exhibited minimal activity in the context of the <italic>Sp-endo16</italic> promoter alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4D</xref>; compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As an example, element C in combination with the <italic>Sp-endo16</italic> promoter drove GFP expression in only 8.6% of embryos, the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter region in combination with the <italic>Sp-endo16</italic> promoter drove GFP expression in 19% of the embryos, but the combination of element C with the two promoter elements drove expression in 37.8% of embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The elevated expression of the latter construct indicated that the its activity was not due solely to the additive activity of the C and SpkirrelL promoter elements interacting independently with the <italic>Sp-endo16</italic> promoter (37.8 &gt; 8.6 + 19). In addition, we found that the C element exhibited substantial activity in the context of the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter alone, in the absence of the <italic>Sp-endo16</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We also observed that the presence of the native <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter mitigated the need for the C.ChIP element within element C to be adjacent to the promoter for strong PMC-specific GFP expression. We confirmed that enhancer activity was dependent on the sequence of the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter, as GFP expression was abolished in a construct where the sequence was shuffled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the effect of deleting the region between C.ChIP and the promoter was due to the removal of repressor sites or to a change in the spacing between C.ChIP and the promoter, we generated and tested a construct that contained the region in question but in which the sequence of that region was randomly scrambled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4E</xref>). We found that insertion of this sequence decreased activity compared to when C.ChIP was directly adjacent to the promoter. This supports the view that the principle effect of deleting this region was to decrease the spacing between C.Chip and the promoter rather than removing repressor sites. Taken together, these findings showed that several CREs are capable of functioning in concert specifically with the native <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter and that this can bypass spacing hurdles that are evident when the <italic>Sp-endo16</italic> promoter alone is present.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Relative contributions of individual CREs in the context of the entire <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> regulatory apparatus</title><p>Our analysis identified multiple CREs in the vicinity of the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> locus that were capable of driving PMC-specific reporter expression when cloned into plasmids that contained the endogenous <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter.

These findings confirmed the importance of the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter in supporting PMC-specific expression of the gene and showed that this region is essential even when all distal CREs are present.

As we observed previously, GFP expression was completely abolished when element G was deleted (ΔG.GFP.BAC) and this effect was diminished when the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter was retained (ΔG.kirrelLprm.GFP.BAC). Quantitative analysis revealed, however, that retention of the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter alone resulted in only a partial rescue of expression, with overall levels reduced substantially compared to the wild-type BAC. We also observed that deletion of element H resulted in decreased expression levels. Deletions of elements A and D were not tested as there was no evidence from our plasmid reporter analysis that these were functional CREs.

Although these studies have focused largely on interactions among regulatory genes that constitute the core of such networks, the importance of GRNs from a developmental perspective is that they underlie the dramatic anatomical changes that characterize embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ettensohn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). In that respect, GRNs have considerable power in explaining the transformation of genotype into phenotype. Moreover, if GRNs are to be useful in understanding the evolution of morphology, currently a major goal of comparative GRN biology, the developmental mechanisms by which these genetic networks drive morphology must be addressed. This work seeks to partially fill this conceptual gap by elucidating the transcriptional control of <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic>, an effector gene required for cell–cell fusion, an important morphogenetic behavior of PMCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory apparatus of <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic></title><p>The combinatorial control of CRE function is important for driving complex gene expression patterns during animal development. In the present study, we identified key regulatory elements and transcription factor inputs that control <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> expression. Using plasmid reporter constructs, we identified seven CREs (elements B, C, E, F, G, H, and I) that were individually sufficient to drive strong PMC-specific GFP expression when placed adjacent to the native <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter. Most of these same elements failed to drive reporter expression at detectable levels, however, when cloned directly adjacent to the 140-bp <italic>Sp-endo16</italic> core promoter, a component of <italic>EpGFPII</italic>, a vector widely used for <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory analysis in sea urchins. As proximal promoter elements have been shown to tether more distal elements in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calhoun et al., 2002</xref>), we hypothesize that such tethering activity is present in the 301-bp <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter element contained in element G. Tethering activity would also account for the fact the regulatory sites in the C element (i.e., those contained in C.ATAC and C.ChIP) must be in close proximity to the <italic>Sp-endo16</italic> promoter to activate transcription, while these same sites can function at a greater distance when working in concert with the endogenous <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter. These findings highlight the potential limitations of transgenic reporter assays that rely exclusively on exogenous and/or core promoters.</p><p>As multiple CREs were capable of supporting PMC-specific reporter expression in combination with the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter, we performed BAC deletion analysis to determine the relative contributions of these elements to <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> expression. We quantified reporter expression using a newly developed, Nanostring-based assay that allowed us to measure the extent of transgene incorporation and reporter expression. We found that a single deletion of elements A–G entirely abolished GFP expression, even in the presence of the native <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter, pointing to this region as the major regulatory apparatus of the gene and demonstrating that any CREs outside this region (including elements H and I) are insufficient to support transcription during embryogenesis. Consistent with plasmid reporter assays, our quantitative BAC analysis confirmed that elements C and G both make major contributions to <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> expression. Furthermore, we confirmed that the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> native promoter is required for BAC reporter activity, also consistent with our plasmid reporter assays and with the hypothesis that the CREs are brought into physical contact with the promoter by chromatin looping during transcription. We observed that deletion of element H, which consisted of the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> 3′-UTR, also resulted in decreased expression of the BAC reporter at 30 and 65 hpf. Although an exogenous polyadenylation site was inserted at the 3′ end of the reporter coding sequence during BAC recombineering and was therefore present in all constructs, we cannot exclude the possibility that transcription extended beyond this site and that deletion of the 3′-UTR influenced the processing or stability of the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> transcript rather than transcription.</p><p>Elements B, E, F, and I each drove PMC-specific reporter expression in plasmid constructs that contained the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter, but deletion of these elements individually from the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> BAC did not quantitatively affect reporter expression at the developmental stages we examined. There are several possible explanations for this. First, these CREs may have no regulatory function in vivo. According to this view, the transcriptional activity of these elements in plasmid constructs was an artifact of bringing them in close proximity to the native <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter. This view is inconsistent, however, with the fact that most of these elements (B, E, and I) contain other signatures of enhancer activity. All three elements are hyperaccessible in PMCs relative to other cell types at 24 hpf as assayed by ATAC-seq, and elements E and I are also associated with eRNA signal during early development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, these elements exhibited some degree of promoter specificity in our reporter assays; that is, they were active in combination with the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter but not the <italic>Sp-endo16</italic> core promoter. These findings suggest that some or all of these elements ordinarily have a regulatory function. They may modulate the precision of <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> expression during early development in subtle ways that our assays did not detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lagha et al., 2012</xref>) or they may be entirely redundant; that is, deletion of any one of these elements may result in the complete assumption of its function by other elements. This might be the case, for example, if functionally equivalent CREs ordinarily share the <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter. In support of this hypothesis, many examples of functionally redundant enhancers have been described in other model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kvon et al., 2021</xref>). Lastly, although these elements are associated with eRNA expression and cell type-specific accessibility early in embryogenesis, their primary function may be to regulate <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> expression during stages of development later than those assayed in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Coregulation of elements C and G by Alx1 and Ets1</title><p>The results of both plasmid- and BAC-based reporter assays showed that elements C and G provide crucial inputs into <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic>. Detailed dissection of these key elements identified consensus Ets1- and Alx1-binding sites that were essential for activity. This finding was consistent with previous evidence that perturbation of <italic>alx1</italic> or <italic>ets1</italic> function using antisense morpholinos results in a dramatic reduction of <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rafiq et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, ChIP-seq studies have shown that Alx1 binds directly to both elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khor et al., 2019</xref>). We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that other ETS and homeodomain family members expressed in PMCs (e.g., Erg and Alx4) also bind to these sites. Interestingly, although paired-class homeodomain proteins (including Alx1-related proteins found in vertebrates) are thought to regulate transcription primarily through their binding to palindromic sites that contain inverted TAAT sequences (e.g., ATTANNNTAAT), we identified a half site (ATTA) in element C that was required for activity. This finding supports other recent work which has shown that half sites play a more prominent role in the transcriptional activity of Alx1 than was previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guerrero-Santoro et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Based on gene knockdown studies and the epistatic gene relationships they reveal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oliveri et al., 2008</xref> proposed that several PMC effector genes are regulated through a feed-forward circuit involving Alx1 and Ets1. They showed that Ets1 positively regulates <italic>alx1</italic> and that both regulatory inputs are necessary to drive expression of several biomineralization-related genes. Our findings support such a model and extend it by demonstrating that the topology of this feed-forward regulation is very simple – both Alx1 and Ets1 provide direct, positive inputs into CREs associated with <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic>. We identified dual, direct inputs into two different CREs, one associated with the promoter (element G) and a more distal element (element C). Evidence from other recent studies suggest that direct coregulation by Alx1 and Ets1 is a widespread mechanism for controlling PMC effector gene expression. Genome-wide analysis of Sp-Alx1 ChIP-seq peaks located near effector gene targets showed that both Alx1 and Ets1 consensus binding sites were highly enriched in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khor et al., 2019</xref>) and both Alx1- and Ets1-binding sites are enriched in regions of chromatin that are hyperaccessible in PMCs relative to other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shashikant et al., 2018b</xref>). Our analysis of <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> reveals that feed-forward regulation by Alx1 and Ets1 controls not only the expression of biomineralization-related genes but also genes that regulate PMC behavior, thereby integrating these cellular activities.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson, 1986</xref> proposed that sea urchins, ascidians, nematodes, and several other animal groups develop by a so-called ‘Type I’ mechanism, a mode of development characterized by the early embryonic expression of terminal differentiation genes. A prediction of this model is that Type I embryos deploy developmental GRNs that are relatively shallow; that is, there are few regulatory layers between cell specification and cell differentiation. The <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory control of <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> by Alx1 and Ets1 supports this prediction; both transcription factors are activated during early embryogenesis and provide direct, positive inputs into <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic>. Although mutations of other putative transcription factor-binding sites in elements C and G did not result in any noticeable effects on reporter expression in our studies, it should be noted that perdurance of GFP mRNA or protein following activation by early regulatory inputs such as Alx1 and Ets1 might have masked effects of such mutations on later stages of embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolutionary conservation of echinoderm <italic>kirrelL</italic> CREs</title><p>All adult echinoderms have elaborate, calcitic endoskeletons, but larval skeletal elements are found only in echinoids, ophiuroids, and holothuroids (the latter form only a very rudimentary larval skeleton).

In the present study, we showed that noncoding sequences upstream of the translational start sites of <italic>kirrelL</italic> genes from a diverse collection of echinoderms supported PMC-specific reporter expression in sea urchin embryos. These echinoderms included a crinoid (<italic>A. japonica</italic>) and two sea stars (<italic>A. planci</italic> and <italic>P. miniata</italic>), taxa that diverged from echinoids 450–500 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paul and Smith, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pisani et al., 2012</xref>). The deep evolutionary separation of these groups reveals a remarkable conservation of the <italic>kirrelL</italic> regulatory apparatus over this vast time period. To our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of conserved regulatory element function among deeply divergent echinoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hinman et al., 2007</xref>). Although the amino acid sequences of KirrelL proteins are well conserved within the phylum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), the sequences of the upstream regulatory regions we identified are more divergent. Despite limited nucleotide sequence conservation, dissection of the <italic>Pm-kirrelL</italic> regulatory region provided evidence that in sea stars, as in sea urchins, Alx1 and Ets1 provide direct, positive inputs into <italic>kirrelL</italic>. Moreover, we showed that regulatory elements directly upstream of the <italic>Pm-kirrelL</italic> translation start site could substitute for the native <italic>Sp-kirrelL</italic> promoter in supporting the activity of the <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> C element, an effect that we hypothesize reflects a deep conservation of the binding sites and proteins that mediate CRE-promoter tethering.</p><p>The embryonic skeletogenic GRN of sea urchins has been elucidated in considerable detail, but analysis of the ancestral, adult program has this far been limited to comparative gene expression studies, as there are several technical hurdles to molecular perturbations of adult echinoderms. Because sea stars do not express <italic>kirrelL</italic> at embryonic stages and lack a larval skeleton, but express <italic>kirrelL</italic> in adult skeletogenic centers, we conclude that the function of the sea star <italic>kirrelL cis</italic>-regulatory system is to control the transcription of this gene in the adult. Thus, our identification of Alx1 and Ets1 inputs into the <italic>Pm-kirrelL</italic> regulatory region provides evidence that these inputs are required in skeletal cells of the adult sea star, consistent with the finding that both Ets1 and Alx1 are expressed selectively by these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao and Davidson, 2008</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that the regulatory interactions we detected in the context of the <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> embryo are vestiges of an ancient, larval skeletogenic program that has since been lost in sea stars, if indeed this was the evolutionary trajectory of larval skeletogenesis within echinoderms. This interpretation, however, would require the evolutionary conservation of the relevant regulatory DNA sequences over a vast period of time despite their complete lack of function, a scenario that seems very unlikely. We propose instead that our findings provide the first glimpse of functional gene interactions in the ancestral, adult echinoderm skeletogenic program and highlight the remarkable conservation of this program in adults and embryos. As Ets1 is expressed in the embryonic mesenchyme of modern sea stars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCauley et al., 2010</xref>), our findings support the view that a major event in the co-option of the adult skeletogenic GRN into the embryo was a heterochronic shift in the expression of Alx1. This would have been sufficient to transfer a large part of the skeletogenic GRN into the embryo, as the transcription of many key effector genes, including <italic>kirrelL</italic>, was already directly linked to Alx1 and Ets1 expression. Direct analysis of CRE structure and function in the adult skeletogenic centers of sea stars and sea urchins will be required to more fully elucidate the architecture of the ancestral network.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>P. miniata</italic> were acquired from Patrick Leahy (California Institute of Technology, USA).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers are in general agreement that the manuscript warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the reviewers have also requested some additional experiments and edits to improve the study and the manuscript. We suggest the authors address all of the issues raised by the individual reviewers, giving special attention to the essential revisions listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers feel that is it necessary to validate RNA-seq results with qPCR or in situ hybridization when possible, and so agree that it would be appropriate for the authors to knock down Alx1 in S. purpuratus embryos both to confirm that kirrelL expression decreases and to show that the activity of the P. miniata CRE is affected. Likewise, the reviewers feel that it will be important for the authors to show that Alx1 knockdown affects the activity of elements C and G to rule out the possibility that other transcription factors' binding to these sites underlies their importance.</p><p>2) The reviewers agree that the authors' data suggests that the Sp-kirrelL promoter is necessary for the BAC construct to be expressed. However, they believe that the authors need to revise the statement in line 252, where it is stated that endo16prm+Sp-kirrelLprm drives ectopic expression, and that this suggests the kirrelL promoter is a strong, ubiquitous promoter. The reviewers think the conclusion the authors draw from this reporter assay contradicts their BAC experiment showing that the promoter alone (without the other elements) cannot drive expression.</p><p>3) The reviewers also agree that it is important for the authors to analyze sequence conservation of the studied species' kirrelL cis-regulatory elements to support the claim of conserved sequence and function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Khor et al. examine the transcriptional regulation of kirrelL, a gene whose protein product is required for cell-cell fusion during the morphogenesis of the sea urchin larval skeleton. They identify cis-regulatory elements of Sp-kirrelL that contain putative binding sites for Alx1 and Ets1, two transcription factors that specify the cellular precursors of the larval skeleton, and show that mutating these sites abrogates one element's ability to drive reporter expression and alters the spatial pattern of the other. This putative direct link between a developmental gene regulatory network driving cell fate commitment and an effector protein enabling a key behavior of the specified cell type would strengthen the explanatory power of a well-established GRN model, making this study of interest for developmental biologists broadly.</p><p>The authors' selection of candidate cis-regulatory regions is well-grounded in functional genomic data showing that several of these regions possess signatures of active cis-regulatory elements. A reporter construct containing all of the chosen regions (A-G) is expressed specifically in primary mesenchyme cells in the majority of expressing, injected embryos, consistent with the PMC-specific expression pattern of Sp-kirrelL, confirming that this genomic region very likely contains enhancers of Sp-kirrelL. A thorough dissection of A-G identifies two regions individually able to drive PMC-specific expression when placed in front of a basal promoter, albeit at low frequency, leading the authors to investigate the trans-regulation of these elements. Elements C's loss of activity upon mutation of a single Alx site or a single Ets site is an exciting finding. It is interesting as well that mutating Alx or Ets sites within G causes it to drive ectopic activity. If, as these data suggest, Alx1 and Ets1 directly regulate the expression of Sp-kirrelL, this would be one of few sea urchin studies that have shown a direct and functional cis-regulatory link from a fate-specifying gene to an effector gene expressed in the differentiated cell (others are Amore and Davidson Dev. Biol. 2006 and Calestani and Rogers Dev. Biol. 2010, though the latter relies on mutation of putative binding sites only). Additionally, the high resolution at which the function of kirrelL is understood-we know the specific cell behavior it is needed for-is strong justification for studying the regulation of this gene, and therefore these findings on kirrelL's regulation are an important contribution to understanding of PMC morphogenesis. However, to confirm that Alx1 and Ets1 directly regulate Sp-kirrelL, it is necessary to show that knockdown of either factor alters Sp-kirrelL's expression, since the putative binding sites the authors identify could be bound by other transcription factors. Characterizing the effects of Alx1 and Ets1 knockdown on cis-regulatory element reporter activity could also further support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>The analysis of individual cis-regulatory elements' necessity for Sp-kirrelL expression using bacterial artificial chromosome deletions is a well-justified approach to understanding these elements' functions. Elements C, G and H each contribute to transcription in a BAC context and therefore likely contribute non-redundantly to endogenous Sp-kirrelL expression, though statistical analysis of the Nanostring data is needed to confirm the significance of these effects.</p><p>Aiming to test whether the Alx/Ets-kirrelL cis-regulatory link proposed for S. purpuratus is conserved in skeletal development of other echinoderm species, the authors characterize the expression of kirrelL in the sea star P. miniata and perform a heterologous reporter experiment showing that mutating putative Alx and Ets sites in a region upstream of Pm-kirrelL abolishes the region's ability to drive PMC-specific reporter expression. This result and the fact that Pm-kirrelL, Alx1 and Ets1 are expressed in PMCs in P. miniata are consistent with the authors' claim that Alx1 and Ets1 regulate kirrelL in P. miniata. However, given that the trans environments of S. purpuratus embryos and P. miniata larvae likely differ, the evidence shown so far is not compelling support for this claim. Showing that knockdown of Alx1 or Ets1 in S. purpuratus embryos alters the activity of the Pm-kirrelL CRE is necessary to support the assertion that these proteins regulate this element in its native species and developmental context.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Evidence for direct regulation by Alx1 and Ets1:</p><p>As raised in the public review, experiments testing how perturbing Alx1 and Ets1 expression affects Sp-kirrelL expression are needed to confirm that (1) binding of Alx1 and Ets1 (and not another factor) to the altered CRE sites underlies these sites' importance and (2) that this interaction consequential for the expression of Sp-kirrelL. The authors raise the former issue in lines 552-554. Though Rafiq et al. (2014) provide evidence for the latter in RNA-seq data, this should be validated with in situ hybridization, which will also allow reveal any changes in spatial expression of kirrelL (e.g. ectopic expression, which seems plausible given that mutating certain sites leads to ectopic reporter activity). An analogous experiment with the Pm-kirrelL CRE is necessary to support the claim that Alx1 and Ets1 regulate Pm-kirrelL.</p><p>Reporter assay data:</p><p>– Why is there so much variation in the number of embryos injected per construct?</p><p>– Does element C consistently fail to drive reporter expression in the vegetal-most PMCs, as in the image in Figure 2C? If so, this should be noted.</p><p>– Please state in the caption of Figure 2 the exact percent of GFP+ embryos that needed to have PMC-specific expression for a construct to be classified as strong or weak PMC expression (I assume 50%). Furthermore, by the criteria for being classified as &quot;ectopic expression&quot; in Figure 4, C.ChIP.Alx1palindrome should fall into this category. These classification criteria should be applied consistently to all figures.</p><p>– To support the conclusion that mutating putative Alx1 or Ets1 binding sites alters the spatial activity of the Sp-kirrelL promoter and of PmG (lines 254-255 and 435-7 state that these elements receive positive inputs from Alx1 and Ets1), the fraction of expressing embryos that display ectopic activity should be compared statistically between the wild-type and mutant construct for the Sp-kirrelL promoter and for PmG.</p><p>– Please state sample sizes for the experiment in which S. purpuratus CRE constructs were injected into L. variegatus embryos (of which images are shown in Figure S2B).</p><p>Nanostring data:</p><p>– Supplemental Table S1 appears to be missing expression pattern data for all but one of the BACs. These data are necessary to support the statements made in lines 336-343 on the spatial activity patterns of the deletion constructs.</p><p>– Statements comparing expression levels driven by the wild-type BAC and a particular deletion BAC (the authors make such statements for constructs ∆C.GFP.BAC, ∆G.kirrelLprm.GFP.BAC, and ∆H.GFP.BAC in lines 348-355) should be supported with statistical analysis of the nanostring data presented in figure 5C. This is especially necessary given that the normalized RNA counts for some replicates and time points are quite similar between the compared constructs (e.g. ∆C.GFP.BAC and the wild-type BAC at 50 hpf).</p><p>Suggestion for presentation of data:</p><p>The figures in their current form succeed in condensing the results of many reporter assays into a visually digestible form. However, conveying the results of each assay using a single parameter (strong, weak, or no PMC expression, or ectopic expression) whose value is determined using thresholds for percent of GFP+ embryos and percent of GFP+ embryos with PMC-specific expression hides interesting differences in constructs’ activity. For example, though C.ChIP, C.ChIP.Alx1halfsite1 and C.ChIP.Alx1palindrome are all categorized as “strong PMC expression”, the mutant constructs drive reporter activity in PMCs only less frequently and in ectopic locations more frequently than the wild-type construct, suggesting that these sites may be relevant for proper Sp-kirrelL expression.</p><p>I would suggest making bar plots depicting the spatial pattern category data in Supplemental Table S1 and placing these in the supplemental figures, or in the main figures where the data are most relevant or exciting (e.g. site mutations leading to ectopic activity). I would also consider graphically depicting for each construct the proportion of embryos showing expression. These figures would aid readers in making comparisons within these data, which may be of interest to those studying cis-regulation broadly.</p><p>Issue with interpretation of data relating to Sp-kirrelL promoter:</p><p>The claim in line 251, that the Sp-kirrelL promoter is a strong, ubiquitous promoter, is contradicted by the result in Figure 5a and lines 326-328 that a BAC containing the promoter only does not drive any expression. The latter result suggests that the Sp-kirrelL promoter lacks the ability to drive transcription without additional enhancer elements, and that the strong activity of the Sp-kirrelL promoter + endo16 promoter construct is due to synergistic activity of the Sp-kirrelL and endo16 promoters.</p><p>Issue pertaining to claim of enhancer-promoter-specific interactions:</p><p>The statement &quot;several CREs are capable of interacting specifically with the native Sp-kirrelL promoter” (274-276) should be rephrased and clarified. I would not use the word “interact” to describe an observation about the output of a combination of two CREs because this word suggests physical CRE-promoter looping, for which no direct evidence is presented. Wording like “super-additive/synergistic activity” would be more clear.</p><p>Furthermore, in claiming that pairs of elements interact specifically/display super-additive activity, the authors rightfully state that, e.g., B+sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm displays activity while B+endo16prm does not drive any reporter expression. However, given that sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm itself drives expression, the activity of B+sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm must be greater than the sum of the activities of B+endo16prm and sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm in order to state that B and sp-kirrelLprm interact super-additively. In other words, the activity of kirrelLprm+endo16prm must be taken into account.</p><p>Considering this activity, it does appear that B, C, E, F, H and I do act super-additively with Sp-kirrelLprm, considering at least one of the metrics of % of embryos expressing and % with PMC-specific expression (e.g. C+endo16prm drives GFP expression in 8.6% of embryos, Sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm drives expression in 19%, and C+Sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm drives expression in 37.8%, which is greater than 19+8.6). A+Sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm and D+Sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm, on the other hand, drive GFP expression both with less frequency and less PMC specificity than Sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm, so I do not think it can be said that these elements interact specifically with kirrelLprm, and it seems that they do not have enhancer activity and may not be functional elements at all. If this is why BAC deletion constructs were not made for A and D, this should be explicitly stated.</p><p>It is interesting that several X+Sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm combinations are more PMC-specific than Sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm alone. This suggests that some of these elements may not only be enhancers, but also have silencer activity necessary to drive kirrelL expression in the proper spatial pattern. It is an interesting finding, in line with Gisselbrecht et al. Mol. Cell. (2020)'s finding that many silencers are enhancers in alternate tissue contexts, that should be highlighted.</p><p>Finally, the interpretation in lines 269-271 that &quot;the presence of the native Sp-kirrelL promoter mitigated the need for the C.ChIP element within element C to be adjacent to the promoter for strong PMC-specific GFP expression&quot; (and restated in 274-276) is not strongly supported. Placing a spacer sequence with no enhancer or silencer activity in between C.ChIP and the promoter, and showing that this decreases activity as compared to when C.ChIP is adjacent to the promoter, would support this. However, the current data leave open the possibility that the part of element C downstream of C.ChIP contains sites for repressive factors, especially given that there is such a large difference in the activity of C.DNase and C.ATAC even though the former is only ~150 bp longer.</p><p>While these may seem like small points, being precise with the interpretation of the wealth of reporter assay and BAC data in this study will elevate the study's contribution to the field of cis-regulation.</p><p>kirrelL gene/protein tree:</p><p>Ettensohn and Dey Dev. Biol. (2017) show a protein tree in which Sp-kirrelL, Lv-kirrelL and Pm-kirrelL cluster together within a set of transmembrane Ig-domain proteins, but I have not found such an analysis for the sequences of kirrelL proteins in the other species whose kirrelL cis-regulatory regions are tested for activity in this manuscript. This is necessary to confirm the identity of these kirrelL genes. If such an analysis has been published, that paper should be cited.</p><p>Description of cross-species experiments:</p><p>The sequences or coordinates of the putative kirrelL CREs from multiple species tested in reporter assays should be provided. When describing the cross-species CRE reporter experiments (lines 376-381), please explicitly state the species for which the expression pattern of kirrelL is unknown, as this is relevant to the interpretation of these experiments. Also, the choice to examine the expression of kirrelL in the adult rudiment of L. variegatus rather than that of S. purpuratus needs to be explained.</p><p>Finally, when presenting the results of the promoter swap experiment, I would explicitly state that PmG1 and PmG2 each confer a roughly similar increase in expression frequency and specificity to C+endo16prm as Sp-kirrelLprm does to more clearly convey that PmG1 and G2 can substitute for Sp-kirrelLprm in a meaningful way.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The embryonic gene regulatory network (GRN) of sea urchins has been studied in considerable detail, providing numerous insights into how GRNs contribute to the development and evolution of phenotype. This study is significant because it places kirrelL, an important morphoeffector gene, into the GRN, thus providing an important link between early regulatory interactions that pattern the embryo and specify cell fate and later interactions that activate the genes that carry out morphogenesis. Through detailed experimental analyses, the authors identified the cis-regulatory elements that control the precise spatial and temporal pattern of kirrelL transcription and two transcription factors that act as positive inputs. A strength of the study is the combination of plasmid-based and BAC-based expression assays that dissect in detail the contribution of individual and combinations of regulatory elements, as well as targeted deletion of predicted transcription factor binding sites. Minor weaknesses are that most of these experiments used a heterologous basal promoter rather than the kirrelL basal promoter and that they were not designed to detect repressive interactions. Despite these minor concerns, the results identify the principal cis-regulatory elements and trans inputs that control kirrelL expression in the sea urchin embryo. A second set of experiments tested the ability of the 5' flanking region of the kirrelL gene from other echinoderm species to drive reporter gene expression. The species tested include members of distantly related groups and ones whose larvae do not produce a skeleton. The results show that the 5' upstream region contains regulatory elements that activate spatially and temporally correct transcription in the sea urchin embryo. Although regulatory element that have been conserved in function over comparable time scales have been described in other groups of animals, this seems to be the first well-documented example from echinoderms. The authors describe this as a case of &quot;striking conservation of sequence and function&quot; although it is not clear from the evidence presented that sequence conservation is actually involved. The authors show evidence of limited sequence conservation in noncoding regions around kirrelL between two sea urchins and between two sea stars, but no evidence for sequence conservation among the major groups of echinoderms. Even in the more closely related species there is no evidence that the small patches of similar sequences are actually the basis for conserved regulatory function. An interesting finding is that even species whose larvae lack a skeleton contain a 5' flanking region that can drive spatially and temporally accurate transcription in the sea urchin embryo. This finding led to the discovery of an enhancer that directs expression in the adult skeleton within the 5' flanking region of sea stars. Together, these results hint that some of the transcription factors that activate kirrelL transcription in embryos also perform that function during skeletogenesis in adult echinoderms.</p><p>Overall, this is a beautifully conducted study. The results are presented very clearly in both text and figures. Some specific questions and concerns follow below (numbers refer to line numbers in the manuscript):</p><p>178. What is the justification for using the core promoter of a different gene for these experiments? Given that some enhancers show selectivity for nearby core promoters (at least in other systems), this seems like an odd choice.</p><p>Figure 2B. I couldn't find any information about the number of replicates for these experiments, or any of the subsequent reporter assays presented in subsequent figures. A detailed tabulation for every separate experiment is not necessary, but a general statement about the number of replicates in a typical experiment would be very reassuring.</p><p>196-198. The explicit criteria for defining &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; expression are helpful. That said, it wasn't immediately obvious from Figure 2C how these differ when looking at the images for ABC and C (weak) versus the other constructs (strong). The weak constructs look a bit out of focus but that could simply be the weaker signal. How consistent are these differences among embryos and from replicate to replicate?</p><p>212-214. Could this result also be explained by the presence of binding sites for repressors in ABC that BC.ATAC lacks?</p><p>249-250. What was the basis for considering this region to be the core promoter?</p><p>251-252. Are these features (strong, ubiquitous) true of the core promoter that was used for the experiments? If not, the earlier concern about choice of core promoter for the experiments is even more acute.</p><p>265-268. This is an interesting result. What does it imply mechanistically?</p><p>342. Why so much redundancy? This is touched on only briefly in the Discussion but seems like an important result.</p><p>352-354. Is there any indication here (or in the previous results) of ectopic expression?</p><p>More generally: The experiments do not seem geared to detect possible repressive functions for any of the regulatory elements. Are there reasons for thinking that repressive functions would not be needed? What keeps kirrelL from being transcribed outside of the single cell type where it is expressed?</p><p>Figure 5: modifying the key in the lower left as follows might help make it easier to interpret panel C: GFP (deletion) mCherry (intact)</p><p>376: Mention the extent of region tested here so that readers don't need to consult other parts of the paper to understand the basic experimental design. If not exactly the same region in all of the species, mention that, too.</p><p>383-384. The results support function being highly conserved. What about sequence? It looks like there is some patchy short sequence conservation between two sea urchins (Figure 1C) and two sea stars (Figure 7A). What about between these groups?</p><p>In the literature &quot;conserved regulatory element&quot; more commonly applies to sequence than function. To avoid confusion, qualify &quot;conserved&quot; throughout the manuscript to clarify whether sequence or function is being discussed.</p><p>447-448. Is there evidence for sequence conservation (and see above)?</p><p>622-623. Is this sentence intended to mean that specific binding sites are conserved? Or that binding sites for the same transcription factors are present? This is an important distinction. There is evidence from other systems that individual binding sites can turn over while conserving regulatory element function. That seems much more plausible in this case than super-strong conservation of tiny patches of sequence.</p><p>There are examples from other groups (especially vertebrates) where a regulatory element shows conserved function among highly divergent species. It would be helpful to mention this in the Discussion to provide some context. Is this the first reported case of conserved regulatory element function among deeply divergent echinoderms? If so, this is worth mentioning explicitly, again for context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In an earlier paper this group showed that KirrelL is a protein necessary for syncytial fusion of skeletal cells in the sea urchin larva. Knowledge of the gene regulatory network driving expression of KirrelL showed that two transcription factors, Alx1 and Ets1 are drivers of KirrelL expression. The analysis in this paper accomplishes two goals: they uncover much of the cis-regulatory apparatus that drives KirrelL expression exclusively in the skeletogenic cells of the sea urchin larva, and they also demonstrate an unusually long period of relative conservation of the enhancer and basal promoter driving KirrelL expression.</p><p>The paper is very clearly written and illustrated. The illustrations are quite effective in showing the outcome of the experiments along the way, and each experiment is accompanied by a fluorescent read-out in the larva to show the specificity of expression of a construct. There are several surprises in the paper. The one that was most unusual to this reviewer was the deep conservation. They obtained cis-regulatory sequences from KirrelL genes in other classes of Echinoderms, including those that have no larval skeleton. These sequences were used to build constructs upstream of GFP. The constructs were injected into sea urchin eggs (S. purpuratus), and even those that have no larval skeleton, like sea stars, have a cis regulatory region that drives gene expression in skeletogenic cells in S. purpuratus, indicating a conservation of more than 500 million years. They go on to show that the sea star expresses KirrelL in the adult skeleton, apparently using the same cis-regulatory region. The paper will be of interest to several communities. It will be of strong interest to the echinoderm development community. It will also be of interest to those interested in evolution of cis-regulatory regions and their contribution to evolutionary change.</p><p>Finally, the fact that the gene is expressed in larvae that have skeletons and the same cis regulatory region drives the expression of the gene in adults of species that have no larval skeletons is a most interesting observation.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>The paper is really well written and logically presented. If it were simply a cis regulatory story on a random gene I would have recommended a lower level journal. However, here the impressive conservation of the cis regulatory region elevates the paper quite significantly. Still, they don't show anything of the cis-regulatory region sequences, and these would help improve the paper – is the conservation actually small islands perhaps the Alx1 and Ets binding regions? Is it the basal promoter primarily? Or is the entire region fairly well conserved? The answer to those questions will be helped with the sequences. I point out that illustrating the protein sequences across the phylum is OK but is not really the focus of this paper. The other point that I think needs better quantification is the call that anything above 15% expression is considered &quot;strong&quot;. I realize that these kind of reporter assays sometimes have a low percentage read-out, but the question is whether some elements are stronger than others. I ask simply the question about the strongest of the so-called strong vs the weakest of the so-called strong.</p><p>There are several components of the paper that would benefit from some revision to help me understand some of the interpretations.</p><p>1. In Figure 1 showing ATAC-seq, DNAse hypersensitivity, ChIP seq data how did you call the peaks? Some, especially G, the promoter, are obvious but others are less so, and still others look similar to peaks you called as enhancers.</p><p>2. You indicate that in scoring expression that greater than 15% of the embryos expressing a construct is strong expression. I understand some of the many reasons why 85% might not express. But, I would also like to know if some are stronger than others. For example is ABCDEFG stronger than DEFG and is that stronger than G? Also in Figure 2 I notice that C is indicated as weaker. The embryo illustrated has fewer fluorescent PMCs than other embryos in this panel with stronger promoters. Is it possible that element C somehow operates in a restricted number of cell bodies rather than all of them? After all, you show in other papers that there are mRNAs that are expressed in a restricted subset of PMCs even within the syncytium. Along the same line, although you indicate that Ets1 sites 2 and 3, when mutated, still allow for expression. Your images of those show stronger expression of GFP in the ventrolateral clusters than the spread of expression when all three Ets sites are control. Is that, or could that be meaningful?</p><p>3. The data in Figure 5 I find to be most valuable to the paper. That includes the nanostring data to indicate contributions relative to an mCherry control construct which is most informative.</p><p>4. The data on other species is most interesting. I see you have an alignment of the KirrelL proteins of the several species but that isn't really the story. You don't have anything to indicate the relative alignment of the same cis regulatory regions. The real question is how are those related? Are their islands of high conservation as seen earlier by Cameron and Davidson? Are there indels outside the areas that must be conserved enough to drive expression in S. purpuratus? It seems to me that these are the sequences of interest. Yes, there is demonstrated similarity in the KirrelL protein sequence but this paper is all about the cis regulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72834.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers feel that is it necessary to validate RNA-seq results with qPCR or in situ hybridization when possible, and so agree that it would be appropriate for the authors to knock down Alx1 in S. purpuratus embryos both to confirm that kirrelL expression decreases and to show that the activity of the P. miniata CRE is affected.

Based on their comments, we went back and re-tested the BAC construct that lacks elements A-G except for the 301 bp promoter region (∆CRE.kirrelLprm.GFP.BAC) and confirmed that it is not expressed at significant levels, demonstrating that the promoter alone is relatively inactive. In the context of the <italic>EpGFPII</italic> plasmid, however, the same 310 bp fragment drives significant ectopic expression. In agreement with Reviewer 1, we conclude that in the plasmid construct there is some unexplained and abnormal synergy between the two promoters.

We felt that the 1/3 cutoff was sufficiently stringent because typically many other embryos exhibited expression in the PMC syncytium but also had 1 or 2 ectopic cells labeled, and so fell into the “PMC + ectopic” class. To be classified as “weak PMC expression” we also required that the “PMC only” class be the largest of the 3 expression classes, but in this case the class represented &lt;15% of all injected embryos, reflecting lower overall levels of expression.

This is especially necessary given that the normalized RNA counts for some replicates and time points are quite similar between the compared constructs (e.g. ∆C.GFP.BAC and the wild-type BAC at 50 hpf).</p></disp-quote><p>The Nanostring experiments were laborious and, unfortunately, we only have 2 biological replicates of the time-course data for each of the eight BAC constructs tested. This means that our statistical power is low and only in the most extreme cases (like ∆G.GFP.BAC) does a simple test like a t-test support with high confidence a difference in the mean expression level between the parental and mutant constructs at any individual time point. For the two most important constructs that we emphasize in the text (∆C.GFP.BAC and ∆G.kirrelLprm.GFP.BAC), we think the overall trend is very convincing, since the expression level of the mutant construct is invariably lower than the co-injected parental construct, at every time point and in both replicates. It can be seen, however, that for both ∆C.GFP.BAC and ∆G.kirrelLprm.GFP.BAC, one trial consistently showed higher overall expression (i.e., of both the parental and mutant constructs) than the other, perhaps due to the random nature of the BAC integration, variation between egg batches, differences in injection volume, or other factors. This creates enough difference in the expression values between the two replicates that statistical analyses we’ve explored don’t support differences between the mutant and parental BACs at high confidence levels. For example, area-under-the-curve comparisons between mutant and parental constructs yields p-values of 0.08 and 0.12 for the ∆G.kirrelLprm.GFP.BAC and ∆C.GFP.BAC, respectively, so not at the usual 0.05 threshold (but not too far off). We can include these p-values, if the reviewers feel they are useful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestion for presentation of data:</p><p>The figures in their current form succeed in condensing the results of many reporter assays into a visually digestible form. However, conveying the results of each assay using a single parameter (strong, weak, or no PMC expression, or ectopic expression) whose value is determined using thresholds for percent of GFP+ embryos and percent of GFP+ embryos with PMC-specific expression hides interesting differences in constructs' activity. For example, though C.ChIP, C.ChIP.Alx1halfsite1 and C.ChIP.Alx1palindrome are all categorized as &quot;strong PMC expression&quot;, the mutant constructs drive reporter activity in PMCs only less frequently and in ectopic locations more frequently than the wild-type construct, suggesting that these sites may be relevant for proper Sp-kirrelL expression.</p><p>I would suggest making bar plots depicting the spatial pattern category data in Supplemental Table S1 and placing these in the supplemental figures, or in the main figures where the data are most relevant or exciting (e.g. site mutations leading to ectopic activity).

These figures would aid readers in making comparisons within these data, which may be of interest to those studying cis-regulation broadly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion, and we have modified the figures as recommended.

A+Sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm and D+Sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm, on the other hand, drive GFP expression both with less frequency and less PMC specificity than Sp-kirrelLprm+endo16prm, so I do not think it can be said that these elements interact specifically with kirrelLprm, and it seems that they do not have enhancer activity and may not be functional elements at all.

Placing a spacer sequence with no enhancer or silencer activity in between C.ChIP and the promoter, and showing that this decreases activity as compared to when C.ChIP is adjacent to the promoter, would support this. However, the current data leave open the possibility that the part of element C downstream of C.ChIP contains sites for repressive factors, especially given that there is such a large difference in the activity of C.DNase and C.ATAC even though the former is only ~150 bp longer.</p></disp-quote><p>We hadn’t considered this interpretation and thank both Reviewers 1 and 3 for raising the point.

We found that insertion of this sequence decreased activity compared to when C.ChIP was directly adjacent to the promoter.

This reporter plasmid has proven very useful for comparing the activity of CREs in the context of a consistent and “neutral” core promoter element. On the other hand, the reviewer is absolutely correct that some enhancers show selectivity for promoters; for example, by tethering to specific elements in the proximal promoter region.

For constructs that were expressed very robustly and for which a single replicate yielded very large numbers of GFP-expressing embryos, we sometimes performed only a single trial.

Lastly, some constructs were used repeatedly as internal controls for the analysis of other constructs and so were injected 5-10 times. This is why in Figure 2 – source data 1 the number of injected embryos varies considerably from construct to construct.

The explicit criteria for defining &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; expression are helpful. That said, it wasn't immediately obvious from Figure 2C how these differ when looking at the images for ABC and C (weak) versus the other constructs (strong). The weak constructs look a bit out of focus but that could simply be the weaker signal. How consistent are these differences among embryos and from replicate to replicate?</p></disp-quote><p>The “weak PMC” and “strong PMC” designations are not based on our qualitative assessment of the intensity of the fluorescence. First, we scored as “expressing” every embryo that had any cells with detectable GFP (or mCherry) fluorescence. Unavoidably, this was limited by the sensitivity of our particular imaging system, but we used the same imaging system and parameters throughout our analysis (i.e., for all replicates). In addition, the scoring was all done by the same individual (J. Khor) who scored living embryos and was therefore able to focus through each specimen. It is important to note that the images in the paper show only single focal planes, and some cells are therefore out of focus. Next, all cells that exhibited detectable levels of fluorescence were scored for expression territory (PMC only, ectopic only, or PMC + ectopic), which provided a reliable estimate of the PMC-specificity of reporter expression. The determination of “weak” vs. “strong” PMC expression was based on the fraction of injected embryos that showed detectable levels of expression that was completely restricted to PMCs (no ectopic expression). If this value was &lt;15% of injected embryos the construct was classified as “weak,” and if the value was &gt;15%, the construct was classified as “strong”. Thus, our scoring did not require that we qualitatively guess at whether the intensity of the fluorescence was “weak” or “strong” in any individual embryo. We’re confident that variation in the intensity of the fluorescence was captured by our scoring system, as we found that constructs that produced qualitatively very faint fluorescence always fell into the bin of “weak PMC” expression, presumably because many embryos had low levels of expression that were below the detection limit of our imaging system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>212-214.

Ets1 is initially expressed specifically in the PMC lineage, although it is later expressed by a subset of non-skeletogenic mesoderm cells. Our mutational analysis of element C indicates that direct inputs from both Ets1 and Alx1 are required for activity (i.e., the two TFs act combinatorially, not redundantly), because mutation of either Alx1 half-site 2 or Ets1 site 1 abolishes the activity of the C element.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: modifying the key in the lower left as follows might help make it easier to interpret panel C: GFP (deletion) mCherry (intact).</p></disp-quote><p>This change has been made and clarifies the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>376: Mention the extent of region tested here so that readers don't need to consult other parts of the paper to understand the basic experimental design.

In each case, the specific parameters used for peak-calling can be found in those publications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. You indicate that in scoring expression that greater than 15% of the embryos expressing a construct is strong expression. I understand some of the many reasons why 85% might not express. But, I would also like to know if some are stronger than others. For example is ABCDEFG stronger than DEFG and is that stronger than G? Also in Figure 2 I notice that C is indicated as weaker. The embryo illustrated has fewer fluorescent PMCs than other embryos in this panel with stronger promoters. Is it possible that element C somehow operates in a restricted number of cell bodies rather than all of them? After all, you show in other papers that there are mRNAs that are expressed in a restricted subset of PMCs even within the syncytium. Along the same line, although you indicate that Ets1 sites 2 and 3, when mutated, still allow for expression. Your images of those show stronger expression of GFP in the ventrolateral clusters than the spread of expression when all three Ets sites are control. Is that, or could that be meaningful?</p></disp-quote><p>With respect to the second part of the Reviewer’s comment, our microscopic analysis of transgenic embryos was carried out at 48 hpf, which is soon after PMC fusion is complete. Because GFP protein diffuses rapidly throughout the PMC syncytium, the entire PMC network is labeled in the embryos shown in Figures 1, 2, 6, S1-S5, and S7, despite the mosaic incorporation of transgenes in sea urchin embryos. This diffusion of GFP also means that possible regional variations in <italic>kirrelL</italic> expression during late development cannot be reliably detected using this reporter protein. The possibility that there is region-specific transcriptional regulation of <italic>kirrelL</italic> and other PMC effector genes at late embryonic stages is indeed very interesting to us and we are working on this problem separately, but this analysis will require the use of different (non-diffusible) reporter proteins.</p><p>Also, please note that our scoring did not require that we qualitatively estimate whether the intensity of the fluorescence in any individual embryo was “weak” or “strong”. We scored as positive every embryo that had any cells with detectable GFP (or mCherry) fluorescence. This was limited by the sensitivity of our particular imaging system, but we used the same imaging system and imaging parameters throughout our analysis (i.e., for all replicates). In addition, the scoring was all done by the same individual (J. Khor) who scored living embryos and was therefore able to focus through each specimen (note that the images in the paper show only single focal planes, and some cells are therefore out of focus). The determination of “weak” vs. “strong” PMC expression was based on the fraction of injected embryos that showed detectable levels of fluorescence (if this value was &lt;15% of injected embryos the construct was classified as “weak,” and if the value was &gt;15%, the construct was classified as “strong”). We’re confident that intensity of the fluorescence was captured by our scoring system, as we found that constructs that produced qualitatively faint fluorescence consistently fell into the bin of “weak” expression, presumably because many embryos had low levels of reporter protein that were below the detection limit of the imaging system. This qualitative scoring system definitely isn’t perfect, but the very large number of constructs we tested precluded us from more rigorously measuring the level of expression of each construct and we did use a quantitative approach (Nanostring) for the key BAC constructs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

That includes the nanostring data to indicate contributions relative to an mCherry control construct which is most informative.</p></disp-quote><p>No changes required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The data on other species is most interesting. I see you have an alignment of the KirrelL proteins of the several species but that isn't really the story. You don't have anything to indicate the relative alignment of the same cis regulatory regions. The real question is how are those related? Are their islands of high conservation as seen earlier by Cameron and Davidson? Are there indels outside the areas that must be conserved enough to drive expression in S. purpuratus? It seems to me that these are the sequences of interest. Yes, there is demonstrated similarity in the KirrelL protein sequence but this paper is all about the cis regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recommending additional analysis here. Additional information regarding CRE sequence conservation has been added to the revised manuscript, as described in our response to the Editor’s letter.</p></body></sub-article></article>
