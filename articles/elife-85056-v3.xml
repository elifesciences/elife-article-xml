Investigation of the function of human α-cells remains a challenge due to the lack of cost-effective purification methods to isolate high-quality α-cells from islets. Here, we use the reaction-based probe diacetylated Zinpyr1 (DA-ZP1) to introduce a novel and simple method for enriching live α-cells from dissociated human islet cells with ~95% purity. The α-cells, confirmed by sorting and immunostaining for glucagon, were cultured up to 10 days to form α-pseudoislets. The α-pseudoislets could be maintained in culture without significant loss of viability, and responded to glucose challenge by secreting appropriate levels of glucagon. RNA-sequencing analyses (RNA-seq) revealed that expression levels of key α-cell identity genes were sustained in culture while some of the genes such as <italic>DLK1</italic>, <italic>GSN</italic>, <italic>SMIM24</italic> were altered in α-pseudoislets in a time-dependent manner. In conclusion, we report a method to sort human primary α-cells with high purity that can be used for downstream analyses such as functional and transcriptional studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>α-cells</kwd><kwd>pseudoislets</kwd><kwd>human pancreatic islets</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 DK123717</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Bridget</given-names></name><name><surname>Kulkarni</surname><given-names>Rohit N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UC4 DK116255</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Bridget</given-names></name><name><surname>Kulkarni</surname><given-names>Rohit N</given-names></name><name><surname>Choudhary</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 067536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kulkarni</surname><given-names>Rohit N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 DK137242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choudhary</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name><name><surname>Kulkarni</surname><given-names>Rohit N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK132900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choudhary</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name><name><surname>Kulkarni</surname><given-names>Rohit N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live human pancreatic α-cells can be purified effectively using zinc-based reaction probe diacetylated Zinpyr1 and cultured as pseudoislets without losing their viability and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Zinc-binding molecules such as Newport Green (NPG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kirkpatrick et al., 2010</xref>) and ZIGIR (zinc granule indicator) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ghazvini Zadeh et al., 2020</xref>) have been employed previously for the purification of human or murine α-cells and β-cells. While NPG was reported to sort cell population with 75% enriched α-cells, ZIGIR enabled isolation of &gt;95% pure α-cells when used in combination with antibodies specific to endocrine cells and α-cells such as HPi2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dorrell et al., 2008</xref>) and TM4S4F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Muraro et al., 2016</xref>), respectively. We have recently reported the purification of human pancreatic β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2020</xref>) and stem-cell derived β-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kahraman et al., 2021</xref>) using the zinc-based reaction probe diacetylated Zinpyr1 (DA-ZP1). DA-ZP1 is a non-fluorescent zinc sensor that binds Zn(II) with nanomolar affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chyan et al., 2014</xref>). Binding of Zn(II) selectively and rapidly mediates hydrolytic cleavage of the acetyl groups and generates a strong fluorescence to sort the labeled cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). In Lee et al., we performed FACS analysis of DA-ZP1-stained human islets cells and observed enrichment of β-cells in the DA-ZP1 positive population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). To enhance purity of sorted human β-cells, we used a conservative gating strategy and sorted the cell population that emitted high DA-ZP1 fluorescence while excluding the other cell populations with low or no DA-ZP1 fluorescence. In the present study, we modified the gating strategy to explore whether zinc probes can be used to identify a purified population of α-cells within a mixed population of pancreatic endocrine cells. We reclassified DA-ZP1 positive cells as either ‘DA-ZP1 intermediate’ or ‘DA-ZP1 bright’ by distinctly marking the boundary among the fractions to contrast those with ‘bright’ DA-ZP1 fluorescence that were identified as β-cells. These data indicate that high purity α-cells and β-cells can be generated by simultaneously sorting islet cells using a zinc reaction probe (DA-ZP1). This approach could be useful for studying purified primary human α-cells for functional analyses and for comprehensive evaluation of the transcriptomes to further increase our understanding of α-cell biology in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DA-ZP1 as a tool to purify live human pancreatic α-cells</title><p>To test whether DA-ZP1 is able to sort α-cells from a mixed population of pancreatic endocrine cells, we dispersed human islets into single cells and labeled them with DA-ZP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of the cells showed a wide spread of fluorescence intensity among dispersed islet cells on a two-dimensional density plot. We classified the cells into three subsets based on their fluorescence intensity and drew a gate to separate each of the subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The subset centered near the unstained cell background showed ‘low’ fluorescence intensity while the other two cell populations positioned on the right side of the dot-plot showed ‘intermediate’ and ‘bright’ fluorescence intensities, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). We confirmed that DA-ZP1 labeling resulted in a similar fluorescence intensity pattern among the three cell populations (low, intermediate, bright) in an additional four independent human islet donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with the FACS-based fluorescence assessment, fluorescent microscopy validated that the DA-ZP1 ‘bright’ subset displayed higher fluorescence signal compared to the intermediate subset, and that the unsorted islet cells are comprised of a mixture of cells with varying fluorescence intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To identify percentage of hormone-containing cells in each subset, the sorted cells were plated, fixed, and immunostained using antibodies to detect insulin or glucagon. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the bright subset was highly enriched for human β-cells (~83% CPEP+ cells), while the intermediate subset consisted of α-cells of high purity (~95% GCG+ cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). The cells in the DA-ZP1 ‘low’ subset were mostly hormone negative, indicating that these cells likely represented non-hormonal cells such as fibroblast-like, endothelial, or exocrine cells. Consistently, transcriptomics analysis of three different populations by RNA-seq showed that the expression levels of α-cell markers such as <italic>GCG, TTR, ARX, IRX1, IRX2</italic> are higher in the intermediate subset, the expression levels of β-cell markers such as <italic>INS, MAFA, PDX1, IAPP</italic> are higher in the bright subset, and the expression levels of non-endocrine cell markers such as <italic>CFTR, KRT19, VIM</italic> are higher in the low subset compared to other subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). The low expression levels of <italic>SST, HHEX, GHRL</italic>, and <italic>PPY</italic> in the intermediate subset compared to other subsets indicate a small amount of contamination with the other endocrine islet cell types such as delta, epsilon, and PP cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isolation of live human pancreatic α-cells after staining with diacetylated Zinpyr1 (DA-ZP1) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimental outline.

Both the sorted α-cells and the unsorted islet cells formed islet-like clusters shortly after seeding in round-bottom non-treated plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and c</xref>). We refer to sorted α-cells (DA-ZP1 intermediate cells) as α-pseudoislets on day 5 and 10 post-sorting, since they consisted of highly purified GCG+ cells and formed islet-like cell clusters. Similarly, the unsorted islet cells are referred to unsorted pseudoislets on day 5 and 10 post-sorting since they formed islet-like cell clusters. The size of the clusters was proportional to the number of cells in each well. Interestingly, α-pseudoislets tended to form tighter clusters shortly after plating compared to unsorted pseudoislets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cell viability was determined by measuring intracellular ATP levels on day 5 and day 10 post-sorting. Culturing cells for up to 10 days did not alter viability of α-pseudoislets and unsorted pseudoislets indicating that these cells can be maintained in culture without significant cell loss. In contrast, native islets started to die after day 5 possibly due to necrosis in the core of the islets caused by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giuliani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Komatsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We further validated that α-pseudoislets consisted of a highly pure population of α-cells with ~95% GCG+ cells on days 5 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e and f</xref>). To assess α-cell death, apoptotic index was measured by quantification of the percentage of TUNEL+GCG+ cells. Apoptosis index remained stable over the duration of the culture in both α-pseudoislets and in unsorted pseudoislets indicating that α-cells survived even after they form pseudoislets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref>). However, the percentage of apoptotic α-cells in native islets tend to increase on day 10 compared to day 5 which could be due to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Komatsu et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, we observed proliferating α-cells in α-pseudoislets, unsorted pseudoislets, and native islets on both days 5 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). Percentage of Ki67+GCG+ cells was similar in each group on day 5 (α-pseudoislets; 0.038%±0.008, unsorted pseudoislets; 0.049%±0.007, native islets; 0.031%±0.004) and did not alter significantly with time spent in culture indicating that α-cells maintained their proliferation potential in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>).

We first used a publicly available single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) database performed on cadaveric human islets (GSE84133) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baron et al., 2016</xref>) to identify genes that are differentially expressed between cadaveric islet α-cells and β-cells (α-cell enriched and β-cell enriched genes).

A major limitation is the technical challenge in obtaining adequate numbers of high-quality live human α-cells for analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haliyur et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xin et al., 2016</xref>). In previous studies, live human α-cells were purified from human islet preparations by using a panel of cell-surface-binding monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dorrell et al., 2008</xref>) or by combining antibody labeling approaches with ZIGIR labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ghazvini Zadeh et al., 2020</xref>). Both methods enable isolation of live human α-cells with high purity, but require antibody staining, which increases the risk of cell loss during the labeling procedure and consequently limits α-cell yield. It has been reported that antibody-labeling approaches can recover 200,000 α-cells from 10,000 human islet equivalents (IEQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we provide an antibody-free approach to obtain primary human α-cells using a fluorescein-tagged sensor which can recover ~2×-fold higher live α-cells with ~95% purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Other advantages of the zinc-based labeling approach include: (1) the short incubation (10 min) for labeling with DA-ZP1 followed by sorting which reduces effort and limits stress on the cells; (2) zinc-based probes are cost-effective compared to antibodies and small quantities (80 nM) can be used for multiple experiments which allows scaling up of cell sorting processes. In regard to potential disadvantages is the ability of zinc-based probes to bind to intracellular Zn(II) which are important for cell functions including secretion of insulin. However, we have shown that DA-ZP1 does not affect insulin secretion, proliferation, or apoptosis in a human β-cell line (EndoC-βH1) even at high concentrations (10 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kahraman et al., 2021</xref>) and therefore this issue may not be a significant concern. Furthermore, since the levels of intracellular DA-ZP1 decrease gradually 24 hr after entering cells by passive diffusion and can last more than a week to disappear completely, further studies are warranted to determine additional effects of DA-ZP1. The function of re-aggregated α-pseudoislets was examined previously by Liu et al. after sorting individual islet cells by monoclonal surface antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). In their study, α-pseudoislets secreted glucagon at low concentrations of glucose but failed to respond to changes in glucose concentrations. They argued that the glucose-sensing machinery was deregulated in the absence of paracrine effects of neighboring β-cells. Conversely, our data demonstrated preserved glucose-sensing machinery and secretory actions of α-pseudoislets despite the absence of β-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). While our data suggest that α-cells can regulate glucagon secretion by using cell intrinsic signaling in response to glucose in the absence of paracrine factors, such as insulin and somatostatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elliott et al., 2015</xref>) and juxtracrine-signaling factors, such as EphA4/7 on α-cells and ephrins on β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reissaus and Piston, 2017</xref>), it cannot exclude their contribution to secretory function in vivo. Our RNA-seq data supported maintenance of α-cell identity in α-pseudoislets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>), and demonstrated culture time-dependent adaptive alterations in pathways involved in secretory capacity or glucagon signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Thus, the discrepancy between the two studies could be explained by the use of different methods and time points in performing functional assays.</p><p>Human islets are micro-organs composed of multiple endocrine cell types and feature heterotypic cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Earlier studies demonstrated that paracrine communication between islet cells are important for their function and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gromada et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, vascular endothelial cells, neuronal projections, and ECM network within the islets also contribute regulatory signals to islet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aamodt and Powers, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lammert and Thorn, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ng et al., 2021</xref>). This islet microenvironment is necessarily disrupted when islets are dissociated into single cells as in unsorted pseudoislets and likely absent in α-pseudoislets. The three groups, namely, (1) α-pseudoislets that are bereft of all other endocrine cells, (2) unsorted pseudoislets which include all endocrine cells but are distributed in a disorderly manner, and (3) native islets which consist of all endocrine cells with intact cell-cell interactions allowed us to dissect the effects of the microenvironment on transcriptional regulation of α-cells that reflects paracrine interactions. For example, over the 10 days in culture, we observed little change in the transcriptome of native islets compared with unsorted pseudoislets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Although the isolation procedure disrupts innervation and vasculature, the isolated islets preserve cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Almost no changes in the transcriptome of native islets in culture over the period of 10 days highlight the importance of intact islet structure on transcriptome stability.</p><p>Another example of the significance of the islet cell microenvironment is that genes involved in ECM organization and cell surface interactions were downregulated in unsorted pseudoislets compared with native islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). These observations are consistent with a previous report showing less abundant ECM components in re-aggregated pseudoislets than in intact islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lorza-Gil et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A notable finding revealed by RNA-seq data is that expression levels of α- or β-enriched genes were recovered after typical islet architecture was regained in unsorted pseudoislets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). These data support the fact that intact cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are important to sustain cell identity in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The expression levels of α-cell enriched genes did not return toward normal in α-pseudoislets despite their ability to self-assemble and form tight clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) which might argue that heterotypic cell-to-cell interactions are more important than homotypic interactions in maintaining α-cell identity. Indeed, previous studies reporting an upregulation of β-cell signature genes in α-cells after monotypic α-cell aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Furuyama et al., 2019</xref>) or extreme β-cell loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thorel et al., 2010</xref>) support the relevance of heterotypic cell-to-cell interactions in maintenance of α-cell identity. The tighter cluster formation of α-pseudoislets was an interesting observation which could be due to preferential expression of adhesion proteins such as N-CAM (neural-cell adhesion molecule) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cirulli et al., 1994</xref>). Overall, our RNA-seq data revealed important transcriptional effects secondary to dissociation of human islets and provide a useful resource for future studies on re-aggregated islet cells.</p><p>In conclusion, we report the use of a fluorescein-based sensor, to demonstrate isolation of live pancreatic α-cells with high purity and in vitro cultivation of α-pseudoislets without significantly affecting their identity and function over time. This unique tool can be used to isolate live human α-cells for functional studies, transcriptomic analyses, or studies assessing cellular toxicity or proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The rest of the human islets, approximately 15,000 IEQ, were collected in a 15 ml tube, washed with DPBS, and resuspended in 3 ml of TrypLE for single-cell dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). The islets were dispersed into a single-cell suspension in TrypLE for 12–15 min at 37°C. Dissociated islet cells were washed with DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and resuspended in the Miami medium containing DA-ZP1 (80 nM) for 10 min at 37°C. The cells were then filtered through a 30 μm filter to remove any aggregates before FACS sorting. Approximately 1/10th of the DA-ZP1-treated cell suspension were labeled as ‘unsorted islet cells’ and set aside while the rest of the DA-ZP1-treated cells was sorted by FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences, Joslin Flow Cytometry Core). After FACS, both sorted and unsorted islet cells were centrifuged at 250 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, resuspended in Miami media, counted using 0.4% trypan blue stain by cell counter (Nexcelom Bioscience) to determine number of live cells, and immediately seeded in round-bottom non-treated 96-well plates (Corning #3788) (1000 cells/200 μL/well or 2000 cells/200 μL/well). The day of sorting is considered ‘day 0’. Half of the medium was refreshed every other day. Analysis of flow cytometry data was completed using FlowJo 10.7.1 (FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR, USA).

Cells treated with DA-ZP1 (ex/em 495/500–650), ZIGIR (ex/em 571/543), and NPG (ex/em 485/530) were sorted by the FACSAria cell sorter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>To profile endocrine cell types after sorting, both sorted and unsorted islet cells were seeded in Matrigel-coated flat-bottom 96-well plates (1000 cells/200 μL/well) immediately after FACS. Next day (day 1), the cells were fixed in 4% PFA (Wako) for 15 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Cells were then permeabilized and blocked with PBS containing 0.25% Triton-X and 5% donkey serum (Sigma) for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies C-peptide (DSHB, 1:200) and glucagon (MilliporeSigma, G2654, 1:10,000) diluted in antibody dilution buffer (Abcam) were added to the wells for overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and the secondary antibody, diluted in PBS, was added to the wells for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and DAPI (Sigma) was added to the wells. Images were captured using an Olympus IX51 Inverted Microscope.

The cells were washed, embedded in agarose and paraffin, sectioned and used for immunostaining. Sections were stained using antibodies against Ki67 (BD550609, 1:100), insulin (Abcam, ab7842, 1:400), glucagon (MilliporeSigma, G2654, 1:10,000 or Abcam, ab92517, 1:5000) DLK1 (Abcam, ab21682, 1:1000), GSN (Sigma, HPA054026, 1:50), SMIM24 (Sigma, HPA045046, 1:50), and TUNEL (ApopTag, Chemicon, S7100) and counterstained with DAPI (MilliporeSigma, D9564, 1:6600). For estimation of cell composition, ~4000 cells were counted per donor and data were expressed as percentage of hormone+ cells. For estimation of cell proliferation, ~3000 GCG+ cells were counted per donor and data were expressed as percentage of Ki67+GCG+ cells. To assess cell death, ~1000 GCG+ cells were counted per donor and apoptotic index was measured by quantification of the percentage of TUNEL+GCG+ cells. Expression levels of DLK1, GSN, and SMIM24 in islet sections were measured using ImageJ. Fluorescent images were captured using a Zeiss Axio Imager A2 upright fluorescence microscope using the same exposure time. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was quantified in the selected islet area and the mean fluorescence of background is subtracted from the MFI to find corrected total cell fluorescence. Approximately 50 islets were analyzed per islet donor, and data were expressed as relative expression levels compared to day 0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Secretion assay</title><p>On day 5 post-sorting, eight α-pseudoislets, eight unsorted pseudoislets, and eight native islets were transferred to wells of a U-bottom non-treated 96-well plate (Corning #3788), and preincubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer containing 135 mmol/L NaCl, 3.6 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 mmol/L NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mmol/L MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 mmol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% FFA-BSA with 16.7 mM glucose for an hour.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David James as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Thompson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Increase the number of biological replicates for the functional analyses.</p><p>2) Provide comparisons with other documented techniques or more thoroughly assess and report the purity of the sorted populations.</p><p>3) Provide additional experimental details and clarifications as outlined by Reviewer 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Perform RNA-Seq on sorted high and medium intensity populations to more accurately and comprehensively assess the amount of cross contamination with other cell populations, including β cells, δ cells and non endocrine populations.</p><p>2. Directly compare the new method with other published methods of sorting human α cells to show the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods.</p><p>3. Increase the n's for the functional analysis of the α pseudo islets – especially since the secretion is very low (although statistically significant) and the author's results contradict Liu et al., 2019.</p><p>4. Indicate how the glucagon content in figure 3d is normalized. Were equal numbers of α cells used in the unsorted and whole islets compared to the α-pseudo islets?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Additional experiments. Some additional experiments that could strengthen the manuscript, its significance and conclusions are:</p><p>– A side-by-side comparison of DA-ZP1 alongside one other Zn-based probe and how it compares in terms of labeling efficiency, fluorescence intensity, background etc for α cells.</p><p>­ – Additional glucagon secretion assays with at least one or two more human islet donor preparations would strengthen the generalizability of the conclusions around the pseudoislet data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Terminology: Please provide further rationale for referral to α cells as &quot;intermediate&quot; in this manuscript as opposed to &quot;negative&quot; in previous paper in JACS.</p><p>2) Figures 1d, 2b-j, 3b-d, 5e-f: The figure legends state values represent &quot;biological replicates using islet cells from a single donor&quot;. Further clarification is needed. It is unclear whether these are actually technical replicates, and if so, data would be greatly strengthened by providing corresponding data from additional 3 donors analyzed and displaying values in aggregate.</p><p>3) Figure 2b: Why are pseudoislets prepared from unsorted islet cells 50-60% larger than those prepared from purified α cells, given the same number of cells are seeded and there is no difference in viability in 2c?</p><p>4) Figure 2: Cell viability is not significantly different between α-pseudoislets and unsorted pseudoislets in 2d, yet the apoptotic index is much lower in α-pseudoislets in 2h. What could explain these differences?</p><p>5) Figure 3: What day of reaggregation/in culture were pseudoislets and native islets used for these experiments?</p><p>6) Figure 3c-d: Analyzing data using a one-way ANOVA would be more appropriate as opposed to multiple t-tests.</p><p>7) Figure 4, Supplementary File 1: Do the genes classified as α- and β-enriched replicate across multiple single cell RNA-seq data sets?</p><p>8) Figure 4a: Does this mean that native islets/pseudoislets from the same donor were followed longitudinally – day 0, day 5, and day 10?</p><p>9) Lines 128-129: This sentence is difficult to understand. Does this mean that the gene expression in α cell-enriched pseudoislets returned to normal after 10 days of culture? Or genes differentially expressed in α cells at 5 and 10 days, were &quot;unchanged&quot; in pseudoislets made without cell sorting as well as whole islets?</p><p>10) Figure 5b-d: Are these paired experiments comparing α cell-enriched pseudoislets with pseudoislets made of unsorted islet cells and native islets? This is very difficult to follow because the proportion of cell types has changed after α cell purification.</p><p>11) Figure 4d: Does this imply dispersion doesn't influence gene expression?</p><p>12) Figures 4-5: The authors utilize the terms &quot;day 0&quot;, &quot;day 5&quot;, and &quot;day 10&quot;, although the meaning of these terms is not unclear. Is this in reference to days post-sort or the number of days in culture after the pseudoislets have formed? If the former, clarity overall would be improved by referring to cells as &quot;sorted α cells&quot; and &quot;unsorted islet cells&quot; prior to pseudoislet formation. After reaggregation, referral to these as &quot;α -pseudoislets&quot;, &quot;unsorted pseudoislets&quot;, and &quot;native islets&quot; would be more appropriate. For whole islets, does &quot;day 0&quot; imply day of arrival?</p><p>13) Figure 2b: Is the time scale here (beginning with Day 1) have the same meaning as the time points in Figures 4 and 5?</p><p>14) Figures 4a,5d: The color choice used to signify each donor makes the figure difficult to follow. More contrast between each assigned color would make it clearer.</p><p>15) Lines 522-523: What is the magnification/scale bar size for the images in the top row of 2e?</p><p>16) Figure 5d: DLK1, GSN, and SMIN24 do not appear in the heatmap, though emphasized in the text.</p><p>17) Figure 5e: Order of insets for GCG and SMIM24 staining at Day 0 are switched compared to other panels.</p><p>18) Lines 163-167: Are genes confirmed to also be downregulated at day 5, or was comparison only made between day 0 and day 10?</p><p>19) Lines 581-584: The stated description of data included in the heatmap is difficult to understand.</p><p>20) Supplementary Figure 1c: Please provide the number of live cell pre-FACS as well as the number of live α cells recovered.</p><p>21) Supplementary Files 2,3, and 6 – More detailed data (reads, log2FC, FDR) for genes reported is required; listing &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; is unclear.</p><p>22) Methods: Was viability PI/DAPI stain used during the sort to gate on live cells (Supplementary Figure 1a)?</p><p>23) Methods/Materials: Include catalog number for U-bottom plates used for pseudoislets.</p><p>24) Methods: Are islet preps handpicked before sorting?</p><p>25) Methods: How many cells were counted to measure composition of α pseudoislets, unsorted pseudoislets, and whole islets (Figure 2f)?</p><p>26) Methods: Are &quot;unsorted&quot; cells still labeled with DA-ZP1? If not, please discuss potential caveats of comparing unlabeled, unsorted cells with labeled cells.</p><p>27) Methods: Please provide further detail on how expression level in 5f is calculated from images in 5e.</p><p>28) Discussion: Please include a discussion of potential limitations to using this probe over antibody-based sorting approaches.</p><p>29) References 21 and 22 are duplicated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85056.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Increase the number of biological replicates for the functional analyses</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested an additional donor cells to increase the n number of the functional assay (new Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide comparisons with other documented techniques or more thoroughly assess and report the purity of the sorted populations</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments and compared DA-ZP1 with other Zinc binding molecules (Figure 1g) and report the purity of DA-ZP1-mediated sorted population by comparing transcriptomics of the low, intermediate, bright subsets and unsorted cells in Figure 1f.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide additional experimental details and clarifications as outlined by Reviewer 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added experimental details and clarified the points raised by Reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

NPG-mediated α cell sorting enabled isolation of human α cells with 74.5% purity (contamination with 6% β cells and 19% other cells) and ZIGIR-mediated α cell sorting enabled isolation of &gt; 95% pure α cells when used in combination with the HPi2 antibody and TM4SF4 antibody. Although NPG was not as effective as DA-ZP1 in sorting α cells (74.5% α cell purity with NPG vs &gt; 95% α cell purity in DA-ZP1), ZIGIR was highly effective in purifying α cells when combined with HPi2 antibody labeling endocrine cells (Dorell et al., 2008, PMID: 19383399) and TM4SF4 antibody for tetraspanin protein functioning as a marker to enrich for α cells (Muraro et al., 2016, PMID: 27693023). To perform a side-by-side comparison of DA-ZP1 with ZIGIR or NPG, we used these Zinc-binding molecules without assistance from antibodies during the staining of islet cells. FACS analysis showed that both ZIGIR-stained cells and NPG-stained cells generated a single bright subset with no distinct intermediate cell population as opposed to what we observed with DA-ZP1 staining. One could draw a gate to divide the bright population in two subsets (low and high subsets) to try to separate α and β cells, but this could result in variation in purity between different sorting and also affect the cell yield since α and β cells are not clearly separated with ZIGIR or NPG labeling without antibodies. The results are presented in the new Figure 1g.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Further clarification is needed. It is unclear whether these are actually technical replicates, and if so, data would be greatly strengthened by providing corresponding data from additional 3 donors analyzed and displaying values in aggregate.</p></disp-quote><p>Only the data shown in Figure 2j are from n=3 donors and the data given in Figure 1d,e, 2b-h, 3b-d, 5e-f are from a single donor. We analyzed 3 different tubes, wells, or tissue sections of islets from a single donor in the first manuscript to generate the data. Although the islets were obtained from the same donor, we grouped islets in 3 different wells, tubes, or sections and considered them as three different biological replicates given the fact that human pancreatic islets are heterogenous in nature and have different compositions, sizes, and structures. Upon your request, we have analyzed islets obtained from additional donors as shown in Figure 1d,e, 2b-h, 3b-d, 5e-f. Figure legends have been updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2b: Why are pseudoislets prepared from unsorted islet cells 50-60% larger than those prepared from purified α cells, given the same number of cells are seeded and there is no difference in viability in 2c?</p></disp-quote><p>We counted the number of live cells after FACS and plated the same number of cells in each well. Next day after sorting (on day 1), sorted ⍺-cells and unsorted cells had similar sizes (Figure 2b vs 2c). Interestingly, on day 3, the sorted ⍺-cells already formed tight clusters while unsorted islet cells were still in the process of aggregation and appeared as disorganized cell clusters. The reason for this could be preferential expression of adhesion proteins such as N-CAM in ⍺-cells and promoting the aggregation by providing connections between ⍺-cells. This possibility is discussed and we provide representative data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 comparing cluster sizes on day 5 in ⍺-pseudoislets vs unsorted pseudoislets.</p><p>Another possibility is that FACS could make sorted cells more fragile in the first days of cell culture compared to unsorted cells. We have not checked the changes in viability of sorted or unsorted cells on day 1 or 2. So, we speculate that more sorted ⍺-cells died shortly after plating compared to unsorted islet cells in the early days. However, luminescence levels which is an indication of the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, are very similar in ⍺-pseudoislets and unsorted pseudoislets on day 5 or day 10 (Figure 2d). So, this is probably not the sole reason of size difference between ⍺-pseudoislets and unsorted pseudoislets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2: Cell viability is not significantly different between α-pseudoislets and unsorted pseudoislets in 2d, yet the apoptotic index is much lower in α-pseudoislets in 2h. What could explain these differences?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for using cell viability assay was to determine the overall health of cells in culture by measuring ATP levels. Higher luminescence (ATP) levels indicated higher number of living cells. One drawback of this assay could be that measuring ATP may not be sensitive to capture changes at single cell level. In other words, a higher apoptotic index detected by TUNEL assay at single cell level in unsorted pseudoislets compared to α-pseudoislets in the previous version of this manuscript might not be captured by ATP level measurements.</p><p>Additionally, the data in Figure 2d in the first version of the manuscript expressed luminescence levels relative to day 5 of each group to show whether culturing cells up to 10 days affect viability. Now in the current version, we have tested another donor and presented the raw luminescence levels (normalized to blank control) to allow comparing viability of α-pseudoislets with other groups on day 5 and day 10. The new data is consistent with the previous data showing that viability of α-pseudoislets is not significantly different compared to unsorted pseudoislets. Only native islets showed decreased viability on day 10 vs day 5 possibly due to hypoxia in the islet core. We also increased the number of donors for the TUNEL assay. The new data (Figure 2h) does not show significant changes in apoptotic index between α-pseudoislets and unsorted pseudoislets. We only detected a small but insignificant increase in apoptotic index in native islet on day 10 versus day 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3: What day of reaggregation/in culture were pseudoislets and native islets used for these experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Functional assay was performed on day 5 post-sorting and is mentioned in Methods and Figure 3a legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3c-d: Analyzing data using a one-way ANOVA would be more appropriate as opposed to multiple t-tests.</p></disp-quote><p>The functional assay has been performed in an additional donor.

We meant by saying “expression levels of the altered genes returned to normal levels on day 10” that the genes differentially expressed in unsorted pseudoislets on day 5 vs day 0 were unchanged on day 10 vs day 0.

If the former, clarity overall would be improved by referring to cells as &quot;sorted α cells&quot; and &quot;unsorted islet cells&quot; prior to pseudoislet formation. After reaggregation, referral to these as &quot;α -pseudoislets&quot;, &quot;unsorted pseudoislets&quot;, and &quot;native islets&quot; would be more appropriate.
