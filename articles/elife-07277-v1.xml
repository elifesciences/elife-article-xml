pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07277.001</object-id><p>Many animal species, including insects, are capable of acoustic duetting, a complex social behavior in which males and females tightly control the rate and timing of their courtship song syllables relative to each other. The mechanisms underlying duetting remain largely unknown across model systems. Most studies of duetting focus exclusively on acoustic interactions, but the use of multisensory cues should aid in coordinating behavior between individuals. To test this hypothesis, we develop <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic> as a new model for studies of duetting. By combining sensory manipulations, quantitative behavioral assays, and statistical modeling, we show that <italic>virilis</italic> females combine precisely timed auditory and tactile cues to drive song production and duetting. Tactile cues delivered to the abdomen and genitalia play the larger role in females, as even headless females continue to coordinate song production with courting males. These data, therefore, reveal a novel, non-acoustic, mechanism for acoustic duetting. Finally, our results indicate that female-duetting circuits are not sexually differentiated, as males can also produce ‘female-like’ duets in a context-dependent manner.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07277.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07277.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07277.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When performing a duet, human singers listen to each other and also use other cues like tapping and nodding to keep in time. Duets are also found in the courtship rituals of some animals, but unlike human duetters—who tend to sing at the same time—the male and female animals take turns singing back and forth in quick succession. For most species, the male starts the duet and the female responds. It is thought that animals rely on their sense of hearing to perform their duets successfully, but it is not clear whether they also rely on other cues, or what these might be.</p><p>Fruit flies produce songs during courtship displays by vibrating their wings. Typically, only the male fly in a pair will sing, while the female is silent and makes the mating decisions. However, both the male and female sing in the courtship rituals of a fruit fly species called <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic>. Now, LaRue et al. have studied the songs and other behaviors produced by this fruit fly during courtship displays.</p><p>The experiments show that <italic>D. virilis</italic> males and females perform duets; in other words, there is a predictable timing between male and female songs. For the female fly to produce the right amount of song, she needs to detect sound cues from the male fly and also be in physical contact with him. This contact involves the male tapping the female's abdomen and licking her genitalia, and the precise timing of these behaviors predicts when she sings. This behavior was also observed in duets produced by male-only pairs, so it is not gender-specific.</p><p>These findings show that <italic>D. virilis</italic> flies use both sound and other types of cues to coordinate singing duets during courtship. LaRue et al. suggest that female flies may choose to mate with males that provide multiple timing cues during the duet. A future challenge is to understand how information provided by the different cues is combined in the brain of the female to drive this courtship behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies of acoustic communication focus on the production of acoustic signals by males and the arbitration of mating decisions by females. However, for many species of primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haimoff, 1986</xref>), birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall, 2004</xref>), frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tobias et al., 1998</xref>), and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey, 2003</xref>), females also produce songs, and duets are common; moreover, recent studies suggest that female song production may be ancestral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wiens, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Odom et al., 2014</xref>). Animal duets involve predictable response latencies between the calls of males and females; that is, males and females do not sing simultaneously, as human duetters do, but rather interchange acoustic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey and Hammond, 2003</xref>). Duetting species can be grouped into two classes: those that answer their partner's song without fine-scale coordination of song syllables or elements (polyphonal duetters) and those that synchronize within a song bout (antiphonal duetters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall, 2009</xref>). Regardless of duet type, each individual must adjust the rate and timing of his/her courtship songs relative to each other. Therefore, duetting requires speed and accuracy in both detection of a partner's signal and the production of a response. Latencies between male and female songs are reported to be as short as tens of milliseconds for some birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Logue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fortune et al., 2011</xref>) and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heller and von Helversen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rheinlaender et al., 1986</xref>). For example, the antiphonal duets of plain-tailed wrens are so rapid that they sound as if produced by a single animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mann et al., 2006</xref>). Both male and female wrens display differences in inter-syllable intervals when singing alone vs with a partner, indicating that sensory perception plays an ongoing role in shaping song timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fortune et al., 2011</xref>). In support of this, recordings from pre-motor areas of the wren brain (HVC) reveal auditory responses that are tuned to duets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fortune et al., 2011</xref>); that is, neural centers that drive song production also directly integrate auditory information. For polyphonal duetting bushcrickets, which like many insects produce sounds via their wings, auditory information is transmitted not only to the brain but also directly to wing-controlling neural ganglia; thus, similar to birds, this suggests that song pattern-generating circuits (housed in these ganglia) directly integrate auditory information to shape duets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rheinlaender et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>While auditory perception appears to play an important role in producing duets, no studies to date have investigated a role for non-acoustic cues. However, for many other behaviors, the use of multisensory cues is proposed to improve signal detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rowe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mirjany et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>), synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elliott et al., 2010</xref>), or decision-making abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kulahci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raposo et al., 2012</xref>). For example, mosquitos locating human hosts rely on both thermal and olfactory cues; this dual requirement increases the fidelity of host-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, bees have been shown to make faster and more accurate-foraging decisions when choosing between flowers that differ in multiple modalities (vs a single modality) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kulahci et al., 2008</xref>). These studies (and others) lend support to the idea that acoustic-duetting behaviors, which are under tight temporal control, might also benefit from the use of multimodal sensory processing. Moreover, because many species produce songs that are not stereotyped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kovach et al., 2014</xref>), the use of multiple sensory cues should aid in response timing.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we developed <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic> as a new model system for the study of acoustic coordination. Song production (via wing vibration) is an integral component of the courtship ritual among Drosophilid flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ewing and Bennet-Clark, 1968</xref>), but typically, as in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, only males produce song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickson, 2008</xref>). The presence of female song has been reported in only a handful of <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donegan and Ewing, 1980</xref>), and it is not known if any of these species duet. Here, by combining a battery of specific sensory manipulations, quantification of a large number of courtship songs, and statistical modeling, we not only show that <italic>D. virilis</italic> males and females duet but also uncover the underlying mechanisms. We find that females integrate both auditory (male song) and tactile (male contact with her abdomen and genitalia) cues for song production and coordination. Moreover, the precise timing of male tactile cues predicts female song timing, revealing a novel, non-acoustic, mechanism for acoustic coordination. Finally, we also address the importance of male and female song production for courtship success, and demonstrate, by comparing duets produced in male–male pairings, that acoustic-duetting behavior in females is not sexually differentiated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>D. virilis</italic> males and females coordinate song production into an acoustic duet</title><p>Previous studies have documented the presence of female song in the <italic>D. virilis</italic> group of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Satokangas et al., 1994</xref>); however, it is not known if males and females coordinate their song production into duets nor have the mechanisms underlying female song production been studied. By combining video and audio recordings, we matched <italic>D. virilis</italic> male and female wing movements with acoustic signals to accurately classify male and female song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We recorded song in a multi-channel recording apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arthur et al., 2013</xref>). We chose <italic>virilis</italic> strain 15010–1051.47, because males and females of this strain sang robustly in our courtship chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huttunen et al., 2008</xref>), we found that <italic>virilis</italic> males (when paired with a virgin female) produce highly stereotyped bouts of pulses via unilateral wing vibration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>). We define a bout as a stretch of song from either a male or female, which is separated from the next stretch of song by more than 150 ms. Each male bout contains 6.9 ± 1.2 pulses with an inter-pulse interval (IPI) of 21.2 ± 1.9 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Females (when paired with a virgin male), in contrast, use bilateral wing vibration to generate variable-length bouts of pulses separated by longer (and more variable) IPIs (7.2 ± 6.2 pulses per bout, with IPIs of 55.2 ± 26.3 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The frequency spectra of individual male pulses show a peak at higher frequencies relative to individual female pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Although there are instances of song overlap between males and females, this behavior is extremely rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref> [population median of overlaps = 0%]). Based on these characteristics, we modified our software for automated segmentation of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arthur et al., 2013</xref>) to segment <italic>virilis</italic> male and female pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07277.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila virilis</italic> males and females produce distinct courtship songs.</title><p>Schematic of the wing movement during the production of courtship song in <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic> male (<bold>A</bold>) and female (<bold>B</bold>).

To determine if <italic>virilis</italic> males and females duet during their courtship ritual, we characterized response times between male bouts (which are highly stereotyped, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and female pulses and vice versa. The distribution of female response times (relative to the onset of a male bout) is peaked at 409 ms and is significantly different from the distribution of response times calculated from randomized versions of the data set in which either male bout times or female pulse times were shuffled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and see ‘Materials and methods’). Thus, female song is temporally coordinated with male song. Male response times to female song have not been examined previously in any insect. We calculated the delay between the onset of male bouts and the center of each pulse in the preceding female bout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Male response times to the first, second, penultimate, and last pulse in a female bout were all significantly different from response times from randomized data, with responses to the last pulse showing the largest difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We, therefore, defined male response times as the latency between the onset of the male bout and the previous female pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and found that the distribution of male response times is peaked at short delays (110 ms), compared with female response times (even when accounting for differences in how response times are calculated for males and females).

Instead, AC male response times were not significantly different from response times from randomized versions of the data (p = 0.24). This effect was specific to response timing, because AC males maintained wild-type (WT) levels of song production (Figure 4B, manipulation 3), and showed no change in inter-bout interval (IBI) or pulse frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, males rely on hearing their partner's song for acoustic coordination. In contrast, AC females paired with intact males maintained coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, peak at 408 ms), even though this manipulation caused an up-regulation in song production (Figure 4E, manipulation 3) and a shift in IPI and pulse frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

However, deaf males, which cannot detect female song, still copulated at WT rates when paired with WT females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, light blue solid vs light blue dashed control). Because <italic>virilis</italic> females indicate their receptivity via wing spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuoristo et al., 1996</xref>), deaf males may use this visual signal (produced by intact females) to drive mating in the absence of acoustic cues. To prevent males from observing female wing spreading, we allowed deaf males to court WT females in the dark and subsequently observed a 29% reduction in copulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, black solid vs black dashed control, p = 0.08). The lack of significance of the reduction in courtship success may be due to the ability of males to still detect female wing spreading in the dark (e.g., using mechanosensation). Because AC males do not coordinate their song production with females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) but still maintain high-copulation success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), our data also suggest that females don't require coordinated duetting for mating when paired with a single male. Duetting, however, may be important for mate selection in the context of competition as has been suggested for other insects and some species of birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall, 2004</xref>).</p><p>A role for female song in mating would nonetheless be indicated by a correlation between female song production and her receptivity state. To test this hypothesis, we compared courtship success and song production rates (see ‘Materials and methods’) of virgin females and mated females. Mated <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> females show a reduction in copulation rates following mating; this is due to the effects of a sex peptide transferred from males to females during copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villella and Hall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yapici et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, we found that mated <italic>virilis</italic> females show significantly lower copulation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We, therefore, investigated the association between song production and state of the female. Both virgin <italic>virilis</italic> males and females sang more if they copulated within the 30-min experimental window vs if they did not copulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). After correcting for this difference (see ‘Materials and methods’), we still observed a significant reduction in song production in mated <italic>virilis</italic> females compared with virgin females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>); this reduction was specific to female song, as males who courted mated vs virgin females produced similar amounts of song. Finally, we observed that <italic>virilis</italic> females, on average, increased song production over the 400 s leading to copulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Based on the interactions we observed in videos of <italic>virilis</italic> courtship (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), we manipulated the following sensory structures: (i) aristae (to block the detection of acoustic signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gopfert and Robert, 2002</xref>]), (ii) antennae (to block the detection of volatile pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benton, 2007</xref>]), (iii) tarsi (to block the detection of contact pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thistle et al., 2012</xref>]), and (iv) female genitalia (to block male contact with the lower abdomen, which is known to be important for <italic>D. virilis</italic> courtship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vuoristo et al., 1996</xref>]; see ‘Materials and methods’). To block visual cues, we placed flies in the dark. We used generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict male or female song rates based on the sensory manipulations (see ‘Materials and methods’). The GLM weights or coefficients reveal the contribution of each sensory channel to song production. We first fit the GLM to data from pairings between manipulated males and WT females and found that bilateral removal of the male tarsi was the only significant predictor of male bout rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These results establish a role for multisensory cues in female song rate and indicate that information sensed via the female genitalia and aristae is combined to fine-tune how much song the female produces. We, therefore, next focused on these two sensory pathways to test their role in regulating female song timing relative to her partner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>D. virilis</italic> females rely on non-acoustic cues to coordinate song timing with males</title><p>Data from AC females indicated that male auditory cues are not necessary for female song response timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To further investigate the role of auditory cues in duetting, we examined female acoustic coordination with playback of recorded male song (see ‘Materials and methods’). Previous studies of the <italic>D. virilis</italic> species group showed that females respond to the playback of male song by spreading their wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ritchie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isoherranen et al., 1999</xref>), but these studies did not characterize female song production. We were unable to detect any female song in response to either playback alone or to playback in the presence of a decapitated male that does not interact with the female (data not shown). However, females produced abundant song in the presence of a WC male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For these pairings, we calculated female response times relative to the playback stimulus and found the distribution to be significantly different from response times from shuffled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, p &lt; 0.001). However, the distribution of female response times to playback does not resemble the WT distribution (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Due to issues (in only the playback experiments) with identifying female pulses that overlap with the male playback (see ‘Materials and methods’), we also calculated female response times from the end of the male bout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> inset). We found that this distribution more closely matched the distribution of response times from shuffled data (although they are still significantly different, p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, we performed the same experiment with AC females and saw similar trends in response time curve shape and significance values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results, therefore, suggest that auditory cues, when uncoupled with the male behavior, have little influence on female response timing (vs their influence on female song rate [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>]). Any relationship between female song and the acoustic playback must be due to indirect effects on the WC male.

The associated filters had their peaks within 16 milliseconds of female song, indicating low-latency coupling of male cues with female song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Predictability was not substantially enhanced with a two-variable model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, male song was much less predictive of female song, further suggesting that acoustic cues play a subordinate role in female song timing. Interestingly, we found that the male behaviors predicting female song also predict male song. That is, male tarsal vibration and proboscis licking were most predictive of the presence/absence of male song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). However, the associated filters peaked 200 and 50 ms preceding male song, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This implies that male courtship behavior forms a behavioral sequence that starts with tarsal vibration, transitions into proboscis licking, and ends with male song.</p><p>These results suggest that both male tarsal contact with the female abdomen and male proboscis contact with the female genitalia are independently predictive of female response timing. Above, we showed that blocking just the female genitalia reduces female song production rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4E, 6D</xref>). Given the GLM results, we next blocked segments A3–A5 of the female abdomen, while leaving the genitalia unblocked, and discovered that this manipulation also significantly reduced female song production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). However, additionally removing the aristae restored song production rates to WT levels (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that auditory and abdominal sensory inputs are combined to drive song production during courtship. We then compared female response time distributions for AC females with block to either abdominal segments A3–A5 or the genitalia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). We found a larger shift in the response time distribution when blocking the genitalia (KL divergence between AC distribution and AC genitalia block distribution = 0.36) vs when blocking the upper abdomen (KL divergence between AC distribution and AC upper abdomen block distribution = 0.12). We, therefore, propose that while both forms of male contact are required for normal song rates, female song timing relies more strongly on the timing of male proboscis contact with her genitalia. This represents a novel mechanism for coordinating duets. We hypothesize that male contact cues (both tarsal vibration and proboscis licking) are detected via mechanosensory neurons, as the female abdomen and genitalia are covered in mechanosensory machrochete bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fabre et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, gustatory receptors are expressed in multidendritic neurons that tile the abdominal body wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park and Kwon, 2011</xref>), but none of these neurons detect external chemical cues. Our videos, however, did not reveal which subsets of bristles are likely to be responsible for detecting the male contact cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>D. virilis</italic> female song production circuits are not sexually differentiated</title><p>In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, song production circuits are sexually differentiated or dimorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>); only males of this species produce song.

This sexual dimorphism relies on male-specific isoforms of both the <italic>fruitless</italic> and <italic>doublesex</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demir and Dickson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manoli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rideout et al., 2010</xref>), the regulation of which are conserved in <italic>virilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Usui-Aoki et al., 2005</xref>). We, therefore, expected that the disparate male and female song behaviors in <italic>D. virilis</italic> should also be sexually dimorphic. To test this hypothesis, we paired either two females or two males in behavioral chambers. We did not observe any song production in pairings between two females (data not shown). However, similar to studies in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Villella et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pan and Baker, 2014</xref>), we found that males will court another male. We observed two types of song in these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>): the courting male produced male-typical songs (blue), while the male being courted produced a secondary song that appeared more female-like (green), with longer IPIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, the fundamental frequency of the pulses of the courted male's song remained male-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This secondary song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suvanto et al., 1994</xref>), similar to female song, was generated by bilateral wing vibration (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Strikingly, we found response times of the courted male (secondary) song relative to the courting male (primary) song to match the distribution of female response times (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This implies that the male nervous system contains separable circuits for song production, which are each activated in a context-dependent fashion. When the male is courting a target, he produces ‘male’ or primary song bouts, but when he is being courted, he produces ‘female’ or secondary song at the appropriate (female-like) response delay (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Video 5</xref> e.g., of males alternating between courting and being courted).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07277.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>When courted by another male, males can produce female-like duets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Song produced in pairings between two WT males.

This is significant because, as a Drosophilid, <italic>virilis</italic> shares developmental similarities with <italic>melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuntz and Eisen, 2014</xref>) and in addition has had its genome fully sequenced and annotated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007</xref>). This makes feasible the development of genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassett and Liu, 2014</xref>) and neural circuit tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simpson, 2009</xref>) to resolve the mechanisms underlying duetting. Such tools will allow us to determine, for example, if genes such as <italic>fruitless</italic> and <italic>doublesex</italic>, known to be important for the establishment of sexually dimorphic and courtship-related behaviors in <italic>melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>), play different roles in a species in which both males and females are capable of song production. Our study also uncovered the sensory cues and putative neural mechanisms that orchestrate duetting in <italic>virilis</italic>. We can address these mechanisms by, for example, targeting neurons (via genetic methods) in <italic>virilis</italic> that are homologous to recently mapped song pathway neurons in <italic>melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>). These experiments should reveal for the first time how the function and modulation of the song motor pathway differs between males and females in a duetting species. Because <italic>virilis</italic> is separated from <italic>melanogaster</italic> by &gt;40 million years of evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007</xref>), the development of these tools should additionally provide insight into the evolution of new behaviors such as female song production.</p><p>We also establish with this study that duetting in <italic>D. virilis</italic> relies on multisensory cues. Our experiments using song playback (to test the sufficiency of auditory cues) and headless females (to test the sufficiency of tactile cues) showed that neither auditory nor tactile cues alone fully recapitulated female song responses (e.g., response time distributions did not wholly match those of intact females interacting with males). In addition, we showed that interfering with song production (e.g., blocking male tactile inputs to the female abdomen and genitalia) could be overcome by additional removal of the auditory receiver (arista). These results taken together suggest that auditory and tactile information are integrated to drive song production and coordination in females. This may be similar to the integration of multimodal signals observed in frogs during territorial behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Narins et al., 2005</xref>). Experiments that target the <italic>virilis</italic> song pathway for neural recordings will reveal if this pathway is directly sensitive to both auditory and tactile information (both types of stimuli can be easily applied in a preparation fixed for in vivo recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murthy and Turner, 2010</xref>]). These experiments should also reveal if auditory information is combined linearly (simple integration) vs nonlinearly with tactile cues.</p><p>Other studies in insects have found a role for tactile cues in some social (but non-courtship) behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rogers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramdya et al., 2014</xref>); however, ours is the first demonstration of a role for tactile cues in acoustic duetting in any animal species. Moreover, our GLM analysis revealed that it is the precise timing of the male's contact with the female abdomen and genitalia that is the biggest predictor of her song timing. These experiments and analysis not only expose a completely novel mechanism for coordinating acoustic behavior between individuals but raises the question of what advantage incorporating tactile information provides to the female. Because removing any individual sensory cue to the <italic>virilis</italic> female (e.g., tactile cues sensed either via the genitalia or the upper abdomen) disrupts female song production, it seems unlikely that a male provides multiple cues in the event that one of his signals fails—rather, females may select for males that can reliably provide multiple timing cues. This idea is consistent with studies showing that generating multiple cues is energetically costly for the sender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Partan and Marler, 2005</xref>). Moreover, studies of decision-making in higher systems show that different sensory channels provide independent sources of information for directing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fetsch et al., 2012</xref>). If this is true also for <italic>virilis,</italic> females may be better able to perform the duet by relying on multiple channels.</p><p>The only sensory manipulation performed in this study that disrupted duetting while leaving song production rates intact was deafening the male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, this manipulation did not affect time to copulation, which suggests that neither do males need to hear the female's song nor do females require a properly timed duet for mating. On the other hand, our experiments on virgin vs mated females suggest that female song production is a positive cue, because it is associated with her receptivity state. It is possible that our experimental conditions (pairing one male with one female) did not uncover the role duetting normally plays in mating. Studies in other model systems suggest the female song production evolved in species that experience high levels of reproductive competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clutton-Brock, 2007</xref>). Examining interactions between either two males and one female or two females and one male, for example, could reveal the relationship between duetting and mate selection in <italic>virilis</italic>; such experiments are feasible using <italic>Drosophila</italic> behavioral chambers with multiple microphones to separate the signals of multiple singers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coen et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, because humans can integrate both auditory and tactile cues during speech perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gick and Derrick, 2009</xref>), we propose that, more broadly, tactile cues may be critical for acoustic communication across the animal kingdom. Mapping the <italic>virilis</italic> circuits that detect tactile information, and then relay this information to the song production pathway, should therefore provide general insights into how precisely timed behaviors, such as song and speech production, are regulated.</p><p>Finally, our data suggest that neural circuits for female duetting (from circuits that detect tactile cues all the way to circuits that direct the production of song pulses) are not sexually dimorphic or differentiated between males and females; this result sharply contrasts with the observed sexual dimorphism of song production circuits in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clyne and Miesenbock, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>). However, we did not find conditions under which females produce male-like songs, suggesting that <italic>virilis</italic> male primary song production circuits are sexually differentiated. This discovery should aid in identifying the circuits for duetting in <italic>virilis</italic> (in other words, some song circuit elements should be present in both males and females, while others should only be present in males). Moreover, during male–male courtship, <italic>virilis</italic> males can switch between the production of female-like secondary or male-like primary song based on their role as courtee or courter, respectively (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). While some insects participate in sexual mimicry (imitating the song of the partner) during male–female courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo and Wei, 2015</xref>), ours is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of context-dependence of duetting behavior in any animal species. Therefore, dissecting the neural circuit basis for song production in <italic>D. virilis</italic> promises to reveal novel insights into how animals rapidly modulate behavior in response to changing sensory feedback.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and husbandry</title><p>We tested <italic>D. virilis</italic> strains 15010-1051.47, 51, 09, 48, 49, and 52 (UCSD Stock Center, San Diego, CA) in our song-recording chambers. We chose strain 15010-1051.47, derived from Hangchow, China, for all experiments in this study, because both males and females of this strain produced the most song during courtship. Flies were maintained on standard medium at 20°C, on a 16-hr light:8-hr dark cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suvanto et al., 1999</xref>). For behavioral assays, virgin males were housed individually, while virgin females were group housed. All flies were aged 10–20 days; this is the time required to reach sexual maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isoherranen et al., 1999</xref>). Behavioral assays were performed between 0–4 hr ZT and at approximately 22°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sensory manipulations</title><p>Aristae and antennae were removed by plucking with tweezers (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA). Distal fore-tarsi were removed by cutting with scissors (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA). To block contact with the female genitalia, we covered the genitalia and a portion of the A6 tergite with a low-melting temperature paraffin wax. We confirmed that results were similar whether we used wax or a UV-curable glue. To block contact with the female upper abdomen, we covered only tergites A3–A5. Visual cues were removed by turning off the lights in a windowless room and covering the recording system in blackout curtains. In this condition, red LED lighting was used for observations. We performed all physical manipulations on CO<sub>2</sub>-anesthetized flies a minimum of 12 hr prior to behavioral assays. The only exception was for decapitation, which was performed on females at least 30 min prior to recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Song recording</title><p>Courtship songs were recorded at 10 kHz on a 32-channel apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arthur et al., 2013</xref>). Mature flies were mouth aspirated into plastic chambers modified from the design in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arthur et al., 2013</xref>). Modified chambers were larger (2-cm diameter) and raised, to prevent direct contact with the microphones. These changes were made to accommodate <italic>virilis</italic> flies, which are larger and sing louder than <italic>melanogaster</italic> flies. To encourage two males to interact with each other, a small piece of paper was added to the chamber to reduce the available space. Acoustic behaviors were recorded for 20 min, and it was noted if copulation occurred during this period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Song segmentation</title><p>We wrote annotation software (FlySongSegmenter-Virilis [FSS-V]) that performs a continuous wavelet transformation (using the frequency B-spline wavelet) on the raw song trace to extract the spectral features (between 100 and 900 Hz) of the song as a function of time. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. For each time point in the wavelet transform, we computed the likelihood that it was generated from one of four previously assembled template distributions. These template distributions were created from manually annotated data for male, female, and overlapping pulses. The wavelet transforms corresponding to the pulse locations for each of these groups were then collated and rotated into a new orthogonal coordinate frame via principal components analysis. The distributions of projections along the modes were fit to a Gaussian mixture model through an expectation maximization algorithm. Thus, each template consists of a mean wavelet spectrum, an orthogonal basis set, and a set of distributions along each of these newly created axes. An identical procedure was performed to create a noise (N) template as well. However, for this case, we created a new noise template from the low-amplitude fluctuations in each data set separately, allowing us to account for differing noise conditions. Given these templates, we defined the likelihood that a wavelet was drawn from one of these templates, T, by transforming it into the appropriate template coordinate system and calculating p(x<sub>i</sub>|T) for each coordinate value, x<sub>i</sub>. The log-likelihood is simply the sum of the logarithms of these values. The end result of this process was to have a set of 4 log-likelihoods as a function of time (male [M, blue], female [F, red], overlap [O, green], and noise [N, black]). If we assume a uniform prior for the template distributions, then, p(T|x(t)) is simply proportional to the likelihood value, so we can then assign a probability to each of the templates as a function of time. We first eliminated all noise from the time series, zeroing out all segments where p(N|x(t)) &gt; 1/2. We then looked at each connected segment of non-noise data separately. If p(M|x(t)) + P(O|x(t)) &gt; p(F|x(t)) and the segment were at least 100 ms in length, we assigned that segment to M. All remaining segments at least 15 ms in length were assigned to F. Lastly, we looked within each of the M regions for overlapping pulses, where both the male and the female were singing. If p(F|x(t)) + P(O|x(t)) &gt; 0.8 over a region at least 15 ms in length, we labeled that as a male region with a female pulse. The automated code is available on github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/murthylab/virilisSongSegmenter">https://github.com/murthylab/virilisSongSegmenter</ext-link>). Lastly, these pulse calls were scanned by visual inspection, correcting mislabeled pulses by hand. Song segmented by this method was compared to manually segmented song from a WT data set that was not previously used to inform the likelihood models. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, and the harmonic mean (F) were calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arthur et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Video recording and annotation</title><p>To correlate song production with a particular singer (e.g., male vs female), we used a USB2.0 CMOS 1280 × 1024 Monochrome Camera (Thor Labs, New Jersey, USA) with 5-mm EFL lens, and uc480Viewer recording software was used to record single-courting pairs at ∼15 Hz. Audio and video data were synced using iMovie. To record fly behavior (in particular, male contact with the female abdomen) during duetting, we used a Point Grey Monochrome Camera with a 5-mm EFL lens to record single-courting pairs at 60 Hz in a 1 cm × 1 cm × 0.5 cm clear plastic chamber. Audio and video data were synced using iMovie. These videos were annotated for onset and offset of three behavioral features (tarsal contact with vibration, tarsal contact without vibration (pausing), and proboscis contact) using ANVIL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anvil-software.org/">www.anvil-software.org</ext-link>); we annotated only video segments during which both males and females produced song. Male and female songs were annotated in MatLab (Mathworks Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Playback experiments</title><p>Synthetic male courtship song (a recorded male bout was smoothed using a 300-Hz Butterworth low-pass filter; a single stimulus contained this bout repeated at 6× at 1.2-s intervals; stimuli were delivered every 30 s for 10 min) was delivered to females, paired with WC males, in a modified courtship chamber (a 2-cm diameter hole was cut into the top of the plastic chamber and replaced with mesh). Song was delivered via Koss earbud speakers, and earbuds were mounted above each chamber and oriented at a 45° angle toward the arena. Song intensity was calibrated to match song recorded in the same chambers (between an intact male and female pair). We were unable to score most female song that occurred at the same time as the playback stimulus (due to differences in intensity between the playback and the female song). Therefore, we also calculated female response time from the offset of the male artificial bout, which ignores potential overlaps (see inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). This is the only instance in all analyses in this study where overlaps were ignored.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Latency to mating assay</title><p>Male/female pairs were aspirated into clear plastic chambers, each 1 × 1 × 0.5 cm. Pairs were manually observed for 30 min, and copulations were recorded every minute. Manipulated flies (e.g., AC) and their corresponding controls (e.g., flies with intact aristae, but held on the CO<sub>2</sub> pad for the same amount of time) were observed simultaneously. Experiments that required observation in the dark were performed in a dark room under red LED lighting. Only pairs for which there was visible male wing vibration were scored. To generate mated females, females were paired with males until copulation occurred, at least 24 hr prior to pairing with virgin males.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analysis was performed in Matlab (Mathworks, Inc.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Song statistics</title><p>A male bout must contain at least four concurrent male pulses, with IPIs of less than 25 ms. Female bouts consist of successive pulses with IPIs &lt;100 ms. IPI values were calculated as the time between pulses with a threshold of 100 ms for males and 500 ms for females and reported as a median per individual. Male bout and female pulse rates were calculated as the number of bouts or pulses divided by total courtship time in seconds (Hz), where total courtship time is the time between the first pulse in the recording (male or female) and the last pulse (male or female). Because there can be long stretches of silence during a recording, song rates report how much singing occurs overall within a recording, whereas IPI reports the rate of pulsing when singing occurs. We chose to quantify female pulse rates (as opposed to bout rates) due to the highly variable structure of female bouts. Recordings with less than 20 s of either male or female song were assigned a male bout rate or female pulse rate of 0 Hz. The square roots of female pulse rates are plotted in all figures (to temper outliers), but all statistics were performed on raw data. A GLM (for details see next section) was used to determine the significance of song rate differences between virgin and mated females, independent of courtship success. Instances of overlaps between male and female song are reported as a percent (number of overlaps/number of male bouts) for each courtship pairing. For response times, we calculated the delay from the onset of a male bout to the previous female pulse within 1.5 s (male response time) or the delay from the onset of a male bout to the following female pulse within 1.5 s (female response time). This analysis includes regions of male and female overlap. We also randomly shuffled either female IPIs or male IBIs and then calculated male and female response times. Confidence intervals were generated with 500 bootstrapped permutations. The two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to determine if the difference between response time curves was statistically significant. We report median values and interquartile range (IQR) for non-normally distributed data and mean values and standard deviation for normally distributed data. Male secondary song elicited during male–male interactions was analyzed in the same manner as female song above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Generalized linear model analysis for sensory manipulations and mating state</title><p>To determine the sensory pathways influencing song production rate in males and females, we fit a GLM to the behavioral data. Since pulse/bout rates follow Poisson statistics (rates are bounded between 0 and infinity), we used an exponential link function in the model. The presence/absence of a sensory channel was coded as 1/−1. To ensure that the GLM coefficients reflect the relative impact of removing a sensory channel, we first z-scored the data. Fitting was performed using Matlab's <italic>fitglm</italic> function, and statistics and errorbars were extracted from the output of that function. The same approach was used to demonstrate differences in song rates dependent on the female mating state. For each pair, the state of the female (virgin/mated) and the success of the courtship (no copulation/copulation) were coded in a two-variable matrix (represented as −1/1, respectively). Statistical output of the fitglm function (from MatLab) is reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Generalized linear model analysis for annotated videos</title><p>To determine the behaviors that control the timing of song, we fit GLMs, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coen et al. (2014)</xref>, to predict the presence/absence of male song or female song from annotated behaviors during a courtship interaction. To learn about <italic>when</italic> a behavior is predictive about song, we used the temporal pattern of behaviors for prediction. For each time point in male or female song, we used the temporal pattern of behaviors in a window of ∼1 s (64 frames at 60 fps) preceding that time point for predicting song. This yielded GLM filters—a sequence of weights whose magnitude indicates the importance of each time point in the behavioral history. Since the predicted variable is binary (song/no song), we used a logistic link function for the GLM. The annotated behaviors are strongly correlated both in time (autocorrelation) as well as with each other (cross-correlation). We, therefore, used a GLM with a sparse prior that penalized non-predictive weights, which would have large magnitudes merely due to correlations in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mineault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coen et al., 2014</xref>). Model performance (relative deviance reduction) was evaluated using cross-validation; that is, model parameters were fitted from 80% of the data, and the model was tested with the remaining 20% of the data (random subsampling). To obtain a bootstrap estimate of the standard error of the mean for the GLM filters and GLM performance, we re-ran this cross-validation procedure 1000 times with a randomly selected 75% of all data. We started by fitting single-variable models (e.g., using only tarsal contact as a predictor) and determined the most predictive features. To rule out that including more parameters substantially improved performance, we took the best predictor and added any of the remaining three features to the model. However, this never increased performance by more than 14%.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ronald L Calabrese (Reviewing editor), Julie Simpson (peer reviewer), and Darcy Kelley (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present a very intriguing and thorough behavioral analysis of acoustic communication in adult <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic> that shows that acoustic communication is two way; males and females duet. These duets are a part of courtship that leads to successful matings. They are synched in the female mainly by tactile cues which the male provides rather than by auditory cues, though auditory cues do play a role. In the males auditory cues play a bigger role in synchronization but tactile cues are also important. These conclusions are based on extensive behavior tests with sensory modifications and the application General Linear Models (GLMs). Most intriguing is that males can also produce “female-like” songs, elicited by tapping, when isolated with a courting male. Thus, both sexes possess neural circuits capable of producing this type of courtship song. The writing in general is clear and concise. The figures are a bit busy (there is no need for this as there are no figure limitations) but clear in general. The modeling is well conceived and based on established procedures and it appears competently and prudently applied. The Methods section is appropriate but could provide access to the code used in the modeling and analysis. These results have important implications for analysis of acoustic communication in animals by pointing out a role for multisensory cues in the acoustic signaling, and they could serve as an entry point for further mechanistic studies in an important model system.</p><p>The consensus among the reviewers is that the paper is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> with no additional experiments but significant clarification of text on issues raised below and addition of an introductory figure.</p><p>1) Duets: The authors show that singing is synchronized between male and female and the synchronization is achieved multimodally by female responses to male input mostly tactile.

These duets are a part of courtship that leads to successful matings. They are synched in the female mainly by tactile cues which the male provides rather than by auditory cues, though auditory cues do play a role. In the males auditory cues play a bigger role in synchronization but tactile cues are also important. These conclusions are based on extensive behavior tests with sensory modifications and the application General Linear Models (GLMs). Most intriguing is that males can also produce “female-like” songs, elicited by tapping, when isolated with a courting male. Thus, both sexes possess neural circuits capable of producing this type of courtship song. The writing in general is clear and concise. The figures are a bit busy (there is no need for this as there are no figure limitations) but clear in general. The modeling is well conceived and based on established procedures and it appears competently and prudently applied.

Reference to any potential overlap should be made in the introductory figure and rationale for handling overlap in the analysis expanded</italic>.</p><p>Overlaps between female and male song during courtship were extremely rare (population median = 0%). We now plot the % overlaps for all wild type (non-manipulated) male/female pairs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3E</xref>. We also include this information in the text of the manuscript (Results section) and in the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We included these overlaps in all of the data analysis in the paper, with the only exception being the playback experiments (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Because the amplitude of the male playback stimulus was constant, but female song in this experiment was of variable intensity, any overlaps were obscured and difficult to score. However, we did try to score overlaps if they occurred, and any that we scored were included in the data analysis presented in the main panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, however, we calculated the female response time from the end of the male playback bout, in order to avoid any issue introduced by our difficulty in scoring overlaps in this particular experiment. To be clear, there was no difficulty in scoring overlaps in data from male/female courtship pairs, only for the playback experiment. The inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> was necessary to plot (as the Reviewers correctly point out) because if there was a problem with scoring overlaps in this experiment, we would artificially see a peak at the end of the male bout in the response time curve for the playback expt. As we show, the female response time curve more closely (but not perfectly: these curves are still significantly different) resembles the randomized curves when we examine response times from the end of the male bout (the inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and we therefore conclude that the playback has only a weak effect on her song timing. To strengthen this argument, we now include a new panel in this figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We repeated the playback experiments with the addition of deafening the female. We see no difference in the response time curves for arista cut versus intact females (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Any relationship between female song and the playback stimulus must therefore indirectly be due to the effect of playback on the male. We have expanded the explanation of these results in the text of the manuscript, accordingly (please see the subsection headed “<italic>Drosophila virilis</italic> females rely on non-acoustic cues to coordinate song timing with males”). We also have added text throughout the Results and Methods sections to explain how we treated overlaps throughout the paper.</p><p><italic>3) Sexually Monomorphic: The sexually dimorphic or monomorphic terminology may be difficult for the general reader to follow. The authors need to put this terminology more firmly in the context of standards in the literature and what is known about duetting in other species or consider alternatives. A particular type of song may be elicited by tapping on the abdomen, and this song can be produced by females or males. Thus the authors might consider using female-typical for this sort of song and sexually differentiated to deal with the issue that females don't produce male-type song patterns</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate that the terms dimorphic and monomorphic are a bit ‘jargony’, so we now define them clearly in the text of the manuscript. We also supplement these terms (or replace them) with the suggested terminology of “female-like” “male-like” or “sexually differentiated”. We decided not to remove the terms completely because they are widely used in both the acoustic duetting and <italic>Drosophila</italic> courtship literature.</p><p><italic>4) Other Concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>A) Male singing seems to be important for courtship success. Tapping may also important for courtship success, but is duetting itself? Does the total amount of the song matter or the timing? Is there a way to leave tapping intact but de-synchronize the song?</italic></p><p>These are excellent questions we considered; however, our study focused more on the mechanisms underlying the coordination of acoustic signals rather than the ethological relevance of male vs. female songs in mating. To address these questions it would be ideal to, as the reviewers suggest, uncouple song timing from male tapping. We did this with the headless female experiments (there she receives only the tactile cues); however, these females lack a brain and never become receptive. The only sensory manipulation in our study (of all combinations tried) that disrupted duetting but left song production rates intact was removal of the arista of males (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We observed no change in copulation rates for arista-cut males, but this may be due to the fact (as we suggest in the text) that these males can still sense female wing spreading (which is a receptivity cue). Male contact with her genitalia and abdomen should not change in this manipulation, which therefore suggests that the tactile cues alone are not only sufficient to drive female song production (as we show with the headless female experiments), but they also are sufficient to make the female receptive. Tarsiless males produce almost no song (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Males therefore also need information collected through contact with the female abdomen to drive his song production circuits (thus, we could not examine the impact of song in the absence of tapping; even in the playback experiments, females required interaction with a wingless male for song production). The experiment with arista-cut males also suggests that the male does not need to hear the duet to mate with the female. To clarify these points, we have added to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>B) Male performance is altered by deafening (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref><italic>), but it isn't clear if he needs to hear his own song or the female's</italic>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> we show that arista-cut (AC) males do not change the overall distribution of their inter-bout intervals. This argues that the reason the response time curves change in AC males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is because he needs to detect the female song to couple with her, not because deafening causes an overall change in his song structure. In the text we say: “This effect was specific to response timing, because AC males maintained wild type levels of song production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, manipulation 3), and showed no change in inter-bout interval (IBI) or pulse frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2A and C</xref>). Thus, males rely on hearing their partner’s song for acoustic coordination.”</p><p><italic>C) The authors might want to cite Peter Narins' studies on visual/auditory integration in tungara frogs as another example of multimodal integration.
