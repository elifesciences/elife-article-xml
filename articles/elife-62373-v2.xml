We find that cell-autonomous mutations within interneurons disrupts morphophysiological development of PV+INTs and results in the emergence of a non-canonical ‘intermediate spiking (IS)’ subset of PV+INTs. We also find that now dominant IS/NFS cells are prone to entering depolarization block, causing them to temporarily lose the ability to initiate action potentials and control network excitation, potentially promoting seizures.

During embryogenesis inhibitory interneurons are generated in the ganglionic eminences, then tangentially migrate to reach their cortical or hippocampal destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartolini et al., 2013</xref>). Upon reaching the cortex or hippocampus, interneurons migrate along radial glial cells to their final laminar position and integrate into developing circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lim et al., 2018</xref>). The process of neuronal migration requires molecular interactions of motor proteins with networks of microtubules; therefore, genetic mutations disrupting such proteins compromise neuronal migration and promote abnormal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wynshaw-Boris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corbo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tissir and Goffinet, 2003</xref>).</p><p> <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> encodes a protein (Pafah1b1) that regulates dynein microtubule binding and is essential for neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wynshaw-Boris, 2001</xref>). Consequently, <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> haploinsufficiency results in classical, or Type I, lissencephaly (‘smooth brain’), a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized in humans by brain malformation, intellectual disability, motor impairment, and drug-resistant epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kato, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Donato et al., 2017</xref>). Full loss of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> is embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirotsune et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Classical lissencephaly can be modeled in mouse lines generated through heterozygous removal of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>, which results in enlarged ventricles and disorganization of brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirotsune et al., 1998</xref>). Structural abnormalities are particularly notable in the hippocampus, where the normally tightly compacted layer of pyramidal cells fractures into multiple bands of loosely organized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Amour et al., 2020</xref>). Mice heterozygous for <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> share symptoms with human lissencephaly patients, including learning deficits, motor impairments, increased excitability and decreased seizure threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paylor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greenwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menascu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herbst et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the high density of recurrent excitatory connections and the reliance on inhibitory interneurons to control network excitability, the hippocampus and neocortex are prone to generating epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCormick and Contreras, 2001</xref>). Thus, the increased propensity for seizures in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutants may be indicative of dysfunctional inhibition. Indeed, specific deficits in inhibitory interneuron wiring with pyramidal cell targets have been identified in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant mice, but the origin of seizures remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones and Baraban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Amour et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Inhibitory interneurons are classified based on a combination of their morphological, biochemical, intrinsic electrical, and connectivity properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lim et al., 2018</xref>). Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revealed enormous diversity in interneuron genomics, and current efforts attempt to correlate transcriptomic data sets with previously identified interneuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; ﻿ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Muñoz-Manchado et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Que and Lukacsovich, 2020</xref>). In CA1 hippocampus alone, inhibitory synaptic transmission is mediated by at least 15 different subtypes of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). Three canonical interneuron subtypes express the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV): basket-cells, axo-axonic cells, and bistratified cells. PV-containing inhibitory interneurons (PV+INTs) are often classified as ‘fast-spiking’ cells due to their ability to sustain high-frequency discharges of action potentials with minimal spike-frequency adaptation/accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). Fast-spiking interneurons are essential for proper network oscillations and disrupting the function of PV+INTs can generate spontaneous recurrent seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drexel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panthi and Leitch, 2019</xref>). Recent transcriptomics suggests that there are several genomically distinct subpopulations of PV+INTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>), some of which may correspond to unique PV+INT subtypes that have remained largely understudied relative to the canonical FS subtypes listed above.</p><p>A current model for the formation of neural circuits posits that pyramidal cells (PCs) instruct radial migration and synaptic connectivity of INTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wester et al., 2019</xref>). In the cortex, INTs are initially dispersed throughout cortical layers, only sorting into their final positions between the 3rd and 7th postnatal day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyoshi and Fishell, 2011</xref>). Interneurons have programs that enable both cell-type-specific and cellular compartment-specific targeting. For example, PV+INTs make connections with PCs and other PV+INTs, but rarely contact other subtypes of INTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kohus et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, different subtypes of PV+INTs target-specific regions of PCs such as dendrites (bistratified cells), the axon initial segment (axo-axonic cells), or the perisomatic region (basket cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations to chemokine receptors can alter this connectivity, and complete loss or reprogramming of cellular identity is possible when proteins are missing in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahadevan and Mitra, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Previous lissencephaly studies have demonstrated that migration of inhibitory interneurons is disrupted in <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> heterozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McManus et al., 2004</xref>). In particular, PV+INTs adopt atypical positions in the hippocampus, including between heterotopic bands of pyramidal cells and within stratum radiatum, a layer where PV+INTs are rarely found in wildtype (WT) CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones and Baraban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Amour et al., 2020</xref>). Despite ectopic positioning of inhibitory interneurons and layer-specific reorganization of inhibitory inputs, the nature and consequences of PV+INT morphophysiological development and microcircuit organization following <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutations have remained elusive.</p><p>Here, we report the impact of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutations and resulting neuronal migration deficits on the lamination, morphology, intrinsic physiology, connectivity, synaptic transmission dynamics, and genomics of hippocampal parvalbumin-containing inhibitory interneurons. Cell-autonomous loss of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> within interneurons results in the emergence of a novel physiological population of PV+INT, comprising ~50% of the total PV+INT cohort. Compared to canonical FS PV+INTs, these altered cells have lower firing rates, provide less reliable inhibition to pyramidal cells and have a higher propensity to enter depolarization block. Single-cell nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) revealed multiple disruptions to the expression of ion channels regulating PV+INT excitability. We propose that disrupted physiological development and deficient inhibitory output of PV+INTs likely contributes to the spontaneous seizures observed in classical lissencephaly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutant lines</title><p>To investigate the cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> heterozygous mutations on PV+INT migration and development, we crossed <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>floxedl/+</sup> breeders to three separate Cre lines: Sox2-Cre to generate heterozygous <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutations in all cells (‘GlobalLis’); Nkx2.1-Cre to generate heterozygous <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutations specifically in medial ganglionic eminence-derived interneurons (‘NkxLis’); and Emx1-Cre to generate heterozygous mutations specifically in pyramidal cells (‘EmxLis’).

This general pattern of disrupted hippocampal lamination is also observed in the EmxLis mouse line, but not in the NkxLis mouse, indicating that <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> expression in pyramidal cells, but not MGE-derived interneurons, is essential for proper hippocampal pyramidal cell layer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects of Pafah1b1 heterozygous loss on radial migration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Images of DAPI-stained hippocampus of WT, GlobalLis (global mutation), NkxLis (IN-specific mutation), and EmxLis (PC-specific mutation) mice.

To investigate the nature of the aberrant migration of PV+INTs, we first quantified their relative densities using immunohistochemistry. GlobalLis mutants exhibited no overall change in PV density in the CA1 subfield. However, as we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Amour et al., 2020</xref>) PV+INT density was reduced in both s.o. and s.p. and increased in stratum radiatum (s.r.) and stratum lacunosum-moleculare (s.l.m.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). In WT CA1, an overwhelming majority (&gt;95%) of PV+INTs are found in s.o. and s.p., while less than 5% reside in s.r. or s.l.m., indicating a strong preference for PV+INTs to typically inhabit deeper regions of the hippocampus. In contrast, in GlobalLis 77% of PV+INTs were found in s.o/s.p, with the proportion of cells in s.r./s.l.m. expanded to 23% of the total PV population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We next used the NkxLis and EmxLis lines, where <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> is eliminated only in MGE-derived interneurons and pyramidal neurons respectively, to assay the impact of cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mutations on PV+INT migration. Interestingly, both genotypes had similar patterns of PV+INT somatic distribution to that observed in the GlobalLis CA1. In these mutants, there was a significantly decreased density of PV+INTs in s.o./s.p. and increased density in s.r./s.l.m., with 80 (NkxLis)−82 (EmxLis) % of PV+INTs found in deep regions (s.o/s.p.) and 18 (EmxLis)−20 (NkxLis) % found in superficial regions (s.r./s.l.m.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Thus, proper migration and lamination of PV+INTs requires both <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-dependent cell-intrinsic mechanisms (as revealed by the disruption in NkxLis PV cells) and non-cell-autonomous cues from pyramidal neurons (demonstrated by the disruption in EmxLis PV cells).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>Pafah1b1</italic> heterozygous mutation alters PV+INT morphophysiological development</title><p>The vast majority of parvalbumin-containing inhibitory interneurons are classified as ‘fast-spiking’ (FS) cells, due to their ability to sustain high-frequency discharges of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>).

whether WT hippocampal PV+INTs could be functionally segregated into distinct clusters in an unbiased fashion, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering using several key intrinsic physiological features (action potential half-width, firing frequency at 2x threshold, firing frequency at 3x threshold, adaptation ratio at 2x threshold, input resistance, rheobase, sag index). WT PV+INTs neatly parsed into two subtypes comprised of a large majority FS cohort, and a small minority atypical subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Due to their intrinsic physiological differences from FS cells and inability to sustain high frequencies of action potentials, for ease of discussion we designate this unique subpopulation of PV+INTs as ‘non-fast-spiking’ (NFS) cells. PV+NFS cells have lower firing frequencies at 2x (55–75 Hz) and 3x (85–105 Hz) threshold, lower adaptation ratios (0.60–0.75) broader action potential half-widths (0.55–0.65 ms), larger input resistances (120–170 MΩ), and lower rheobases (120–180 pA) than standard PV+FS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>WT PV+INTs consist of two physiological subtypes: FS and NFS cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Unbiased cluster analysis dendrogram displays 83 PV+INTs sorted two clusters that represent fast-spiking (FS) and non-fast-spiking (NFS) cells.

Post-hoc anatomical recoveries of recorded cells regularly revealed these three standard morphologies, and additionally a unique hippocampal PV+INT, which we designate ‘radiatum-targeting cells’ (RTC) as this subtype confines its axon to s.r. and is presumably a subtype of dendrite-targeting cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows typical morphologies, polar histograms of axonal and dendritic arbors and firing patterns at threshold (with expanded action potentials; red) and at 2x threshold current injection (phase plots in blue) of WT CA1 PV+INTs (from left to right: BC, AAC, BiC, PV+RTC).</p><p>Hippocampal layers differ in their composition of PV+INT morphophysiological subtypes. In WT deeper regions (s.o./s.p.) are populated primarily by PV+FS cells (~90%), consisting of all of the morphological forms (BC, AAC, BiC, RTC). In contrast, all PV+NFS cells residing in s.o./s.p. had BC morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). The small number of PV+FS and NFS cells found in superficial layers (s.r.) all had RTC morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). In summary, WT hippocampal CA1 PV+INTs consist of two physiological (FS and NFS) and four morphological subtypes (BC, AAC, BiC, RTC), and the overwhelming majority of PV+INTs are found in deep hippocampal layers, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Using the same strategy, we next targeted PV+INTs in the GlobalLis mouse line and utilized PCA to cluster GlobalLis PV+INTs by their intrinsic physiological properties. Unlike WT PV+INTs, GlobalLis cells segregated into three clusters. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). In addition to the FS and NFS cell clusters, a third entirely new cluster of PV+INTs emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). GlobalLis FS cells had identical intrinsic properties as WT FS cells with the exception of shorter action potential half-widths (0.32–037 ms vs 0.41–0.44 ms; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). GlobalLis NFS cells were indistinguishable from WT NFS cells. A number of intrinsic physiological properties of the third group of cells fell between those of FS and NFS cells, including firing frequency at 2x (90–110 Hz) and 3x threshold (120–140 Hz), adaptation ratio (0.65–0.85), AP half-width (0.45–0.50 ms), and input resistance (80–100 MΩ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Consequently, we refer to this emergent physiological PV+INT subtype as ‘intermediate spiking’ (IS) cells. Of particular interest 47% of all GlobalLis PV+INTs consisted of the IS subtype and only 44% consisted of FS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) compared the 80% observed in WT CA1 PV+INTs. Within CA1, superficial layers had proportionally more IS cells (~60%) than deeper layers (~25%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Many cells did not resemble stereotypical morphologies of any WT PV+INT subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and often had ectopic axonal branching that extended in all directions, rather than forming the tight plexus seen in WT. Other mutant PV+INTs took on combinations of hippocampal PV cell features including bistratified-like cells with baskets, and radiatum-targeting cells with axons that also extended into the s.l.m. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Analysis of PV+INT polar histograms indicates that GlobalLis cells have alterations in the direction of axonal (but not dendritic) growth. GlobalLis PV+INTs project more axon in vertical (i.e. from s.o. to s.l.m.) than horizontal (i.e. from CA3 to subiculum) directions, a stark contrast to WT cells, which have more horizontally oriented axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

PCA of intrinsic physiological properties of PV+INTs from the EmxLis hippocampus identified two clusters (corresponding to FS and NFS), consistent with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To increase the power of the PCA and confirm accurate clustering, we combined and analyzed the WT and EmxLis datasets together. Combining WT and EmxLis cells resulted in identical clusters of FS and NFS cells, indicating the ease of identifying normally developed FS and NFS cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The total ratio of FS/NFS cells in CA1 as well as in each individual layer remains relatively unchanged in the EmxLis hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

In conclusion, in EmxLis mutants PV+INTs develop into canonical morphophysiological subtypes despite disorganized pyramidal cell layers.</p><p>We next examined PV+INTs in the NkxLis (interneuron-specific mutation) hippocampus and used PCA to analyze the physiological properties. Similar to the GlobalLis mutant, we detected 3 clusters of PV+INTs, however clustering accuracy was not optimal (i.e. occasional IS cells were classified as NFS cells etc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To increase analytical power and improve clustering accuracy, we combined the NkxLis and GlobalLis datasets and again found three clusters: FS, IS, and NFS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The novel IS cell subtype accounts for ~50% of total PV+INTs in both the NkxLis and GlobalLis genotypes, with more IS cells found in superficial hippocampal layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, with cell-autonomous <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> mutations within interneurons, the overall distribution of PV+INT physiological subtypes shifts away from the 80% FS, 20% NFS distribution in WT (and EmxLis) to 44% FS, 56% IS/NFS in the GlobalLis mutant and 29% FS, 71% IS/NFS in the NkxLis mutant. Despite the normal lamination of pyramidal cell layers in the NkxLis hippocampus, the morphology of NkxLis PV+INTs appear similar to the GlobalLis mutants; cells take on hybrid combinations of morphological features and distinguishing meaningful subtypes becomes nontrivial, if not impossible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To validate the accuracy of our cluster analysis, we performed additional clustering using Ward’s Method and compared the cluster identity of cells from Ward’s and K-means clustering algorithms.

To assess the broad biological impact of the DE genes (DEG), we applied the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) framework. These analyses revealed that the DEGs primarily serve to regulate synaptogenesis signaling pathways, glutamatergic/GABAergic neurotransmission, different distinct guidance cues, cell-cell adhesion, and maintenance of extracellular matrix (ECM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>First, we observed misregulated expressions of cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) belonging to cadherin family (<italic>Cdh8-13</italic>), contactin and related family (<italic>Cntn3-6, Cntnap3,5b</italic>), IgCAM family (<italic>Alcam, Dscam, Dscaml1, Ncam2, Kirrel1,3, Igsf11</italic>), including multiple CAM-modifiers (<italic>St3gal4, St6gal1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ei–iii</xref>).

This collectively indicates that multiple cellular mechanisms can converge toward regulating PV+INT morphology in a <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-dependent cell-autonomous manner.</p><p>Based on the <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> haploinsufficiency associated changes in PV+INT firing properties and propensity for depolarization block, we further scrutinized our transcriptome datasets for cell-autonomous changes that could impact membrane excitability. Several critical regulators of PV+INT excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>) including members of potassium channel family (<italic>Kcnj3, Kcnq5, Kcnh7, Kcnb2, Kcnk2, Kcnip1, Kcnip2</italic>) were misregulated in GlobalLis PV+INTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In addition, two GlobalLis PV+INT clusters displayed altered levels of the key neurotransmitter release regulator <italic>Syt2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), potentially reflecting the increased contribution of IS PV+INTs which display reduced unitary amplitudes and release probability in combination with longer latencies. We also observe that the cation/chloride co-transporter NKCC1 (<italic>Slc12a2</italic>) appears to be decreased in subset of basket cells which might also influence somatic chloride extrusion during high-frequency firing in PV+INTs, thereby influencing PV+INT excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Otsu et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, we observed altered expression patterns of glutamate receptors and associated auxiliary subunits (<italic>Grik1-4, Neto1, Neto2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>) that are previously established to regulate excitatory recruitment of PV+INTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christensen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wyeth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mulle et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Global <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> heterozygous loss has a dramatic effect on the migration and cellular positioning of both excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones and Baraban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Amour et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we observed fracturing of stratum pyramidale into heterotopic bands, reduction of PV+INT density in deep hippocampal layers and increased density in the superficial layers. In addition to studying the effects of global heterozygous <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> loss, we utilized cell-type-specific mutations to selectively remove one copy of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> from PCs (EmxLis) or from medial ganglionic eminence-derived INTs (NkxLis). The overall CA1 structure in the EmxLis mutation resembled the GlobalLis CA1 (disrupted PC layer formation), while the NkxLis mutation was indistinguishable from WT. In contrast, PV+INT radial migration in both the EmxLis and NkxLis genotypes was disrupted in a similar manner to GlobalLis mutation: decreased density in deep layers and increased density in superficial layers. Therefore, PV+INTs require both cell-autonomous <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-dependent processes, and non-cell-autonomous interactions with pyramidal neurons in order to achieve successful radial migration.</p><p>We found that 80% of WT PV+INs were fast-spiking (FS) cells and the remaining 20% were non-fast-spiking (NFS) cells. Compared to FS cells, NFS cells had lower rheobases, higher input resistances, longer action potential half-widths, and lower firing rates. NFS cells consisted of two morphological subtypes: basket cells and a newly identified subtype we have labeled ‘radiatum-targeting’ PV+ cells, as their axons are confined to stratum radiatum. FS cells consisted of basket cells, axo-axonic cells, bistratified cells and radiatum-targeting cells.</p><p>In the GlobalLis mutant, clear morphological labels are difficult to assign to recovered PV+INTs. Cellular morphology was disrupted, with axon patterns resembling combinations of the common morphological subtypes as well as branching into new patterns that have no resemblance to any WT PV+INT. Despite the morphological disruption, clusters of FS and NFS cells with essentially identical electrical properties as WT cells were detected in the GlobalLis mutant. Furthermore, an additional cluster of PV+ cells emerged. We refer to this population as ‘intermediate-spiking’ (IS) cells as their intrinsic properties fell between those of FS and NFS cells.</p><p>Despite pyramidal cell layer disorganization and disrupted radial migration of PV+INTs in the EmxLis mutant, PV+ cells were able to develop into normal morphophysiological subtypes. EmxLis PV+INs cleanly parsed into two clusters: FS and NFS cells. Surprisingly, neither the fractured banding of PCs or ectopic positioning of INTs interfered with the ability to form identifiable basket, axo-axonic, bistratified, or radiatum-targeting cells. Similar to GlobalLis mutation, the NkxLis hippocampus was composed of PV+ FS, IS, and NFS cells. Despite normal pyramidal cell layer development, morphological development of NkxLis PV+INTs was disrupted, and clear morphological subtypes could not be resolved.</p><p><italic>Pafah1b1</italic> haploinsuffiency disrupts numerous genetic programs controlling PV+INT migration, morphogenesis, synapse formation and cellular excitability. Interestingly, the emergence of IS cells and alteration of morphology in the GlobalLis mutant did not correlate with any additional PV+INT clusters in the snRNA-seq analysis and we did not detect any differences in ‘fast-spiking’ phenotype-related ion channels such as the Kv3 family of voltage-gated potassium channels. However, the snRNA-seq presents only a snapshot of the transcriptomic aberrations in PV+INTs due to Global <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> haploinsufficiency. Therefore, the lack of a distinct IS population in the snRNA-seq analysis could imply that alterations of a very small number of genes are responsible for changes, which would not result in any additional clustering. It is possible that the cellular changes observed may arise from epigenetic changes, changes in protein expression levels, or changes in modifications of proteins that would not be detectible in this dataset. A third possibility is that changes during development alter the circuit integration and maturation of PV+INTs and these changes might not be evident in their mature transcriptome. Finally, it is possible that the morphological aberrations in PV+INTs are further shaped by the transcriptomic aberrations in other cell types. Because <italic>Pafah1b1</italic>-disruption in pyramidal cells does not seem to affect PV+INT morphological maturation, future studies could examine <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> disruption exclusive to glial cells to examine such non-autonomous mechanisms of regulation of interneuron functions. For example, glial cells that are also impacted by <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> haploinsufficiency, also secrete several guidance cues that shape the assembly, lamination and morphology of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vallee and Tsai, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yokota et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, such cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms could converge to regulate PV+INT morphological maturation.</p><p>Although IS cells emerge in the GlobalLis and NkxLis mutants, physiologically typical FS and NFS cells also develop in these mice. A full understanding as to why some PV+INTs develop into FS cells while others become IS cells remains elusive. One factor that may influence PV+INT development is the embryonic birth date and the level of excitatory and/or inhibitory drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donato et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, analysis of spontaneous excitatory post synaptic currents (sEPSCs) in PV+INTs reveals that WT and GlobalLis FS cells receive a much higher level of spontaneous excitatory input than both IS and NFS cells. It is a possibility that PV precursors destined to become NFS cells require a low level of excitatory input to drive their development, while FS cells require a high level of spontaneous excitatory drive. A former study found that PV+INTs in visual cortex are composed of various subclusters of cells, and the cluster with the lowest sEPSC frequencies had low firing rates, high input resistances, low rheobases, and wide action potential half-widths, reminiscent of PV+NFS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Helm et al., 2013</xref>). Another study found that overexpressing synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) in PV+INTs increases sEPSC frequency, with a corresponding increase in firing rate and decrease in AP half-width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akgul and Wollmuth, 2013</xref>). It is possible that IS cells are PV precursors which failed to develop into FS cells due to insufficient excitatory recruitment.</p><p>Another possibility considers that cells produce variable amounts of proteins and protein levels change in response to intracellular and extracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dörrbaum et al., 2018</xref>). Cells that either synthesize lower amounts of <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> protein and/or have more disruptions to <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> turnover due to internal and external environmental interactions are expected to have more difficulty with cellular migration and protein trafficking and could consequently develop into IS instead of FS cells. Additionally, or alternatively, the different environments encountered by migrating early-born or late-born PV+INTs could interact with <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> intracellular signaling pathways to differentially affect development of these populations of cells. As the present study did not investigate the role of cellular birth-dating on PV+INT development, future experiments could examine this using BrdU fate mapping in combination with immunohistochemistry and with other techniques that allow labeling of isochronic cells for electrophysiological recording.</p><p>We observed that both WT and EmxLis CA1 are composed of 79–80% FS cells (preferentially found in deep layers) and 19–20% NFS cells (preferentially in superficial layers). In contrast, FS cells make up only 44% of GlobalLis and 29% of NkxLis PV+INTs, with the majority (56–71%) consisting of IS/NFS (which are also preferentially found in superficial layers). Compared to FS cells, IS and NFS cells have lower firing rates and provide less potent, less reliable inhibitory output to pyramidal cells. Thus, the expansion of these non-canonical cell types will erode the precise inhibition usually provided by FS cells, placing network excitability on the precipice for electrographic seizure activity. Finally, due to their susceptibility to depolarization block, IS and NFS cells will likely lose the ability to initiate action potentials and control runaway excitation during seizure episodes, allowing epileptic activity to spread from the hippocampus to other brain regions. Until now, the disrupted neuronal migration in classical lissencephaly has been paradigmatically linked to the generation of epileptiform activity; however, our EmxLis and NkxLis experiments challenge this assumption. We propose that it is not disrupted neuronal migration perse that underlies the origin of epilepsy, but rather disruptions to intrinsic developmental programs that result in the emergence of a less efficient PV+INT cell type.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with animal protocols approved by the National Institutes of Health. <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/fl</sup> male mice (provided by Anthony Wynshaw-Boris, Case Western Reserve University) were crossed with Sox2-Cre female mice (provided by National Human Genome Research Institute transgenic core, Tg(Sox2-Cre)1Amc/J).

Individual cells were visualized using a 40x objective using fluorescence and IR-DIC video microscopy. Electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments) to a resistance of 3–5 MΩ using a vertical pipette puller (Narishige, PP-830). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), and signals were digitized at 20 kHz (Digidata 1440A, filtered at 3 kHz) for collection on a Windows computer equipped with pClamp 10.4 software (Molecular Devices). Uncompensated series resistance ranged from 10 to 35 MΩ and was monitored continuously throughout recordings with −5 mV voltage steps. Pipette capacitance compensation and bridge balance were applied in current-clamp experiments.

Apparent membrane time constant (τm) was calculated from the mean responses to 20 successive hyperpolarizing current pulses (−20 pA; 400 ms) and was determined by fitting voltage responses with a single exponential function. Action potential (AP) threshold was defined as the voltage at which the slope trajectory reaches 10 mV/ms. AP amplitude was defined as the difference in membrane potential between threshold and the peak. AP half-width was measured at the voltage corresponding to half of the AP amplitude. Afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude was defined as the difference between action potential threshold and the most negative membrane potential attained during the AHP. These properties were measured for the first action potential elicited by a depolarizing 500 ms-long current pulse of amplitude just sufficient to bring the cell to threshold for AP generation (rheobase). The adaptation ratio was defined as the ratio of the average of the last three interspike intervals relative to the first three interspike intervals during a 500 ms-long spike train elicited using twice the rheobase. Firing patterns were investigated by a series of 500 to 800 ms-long current injections (step size 50 pA) until 3x threshold current was reached or depolarization-block was induced. Firing frequency was calculated from the number of spikes observed during the first 500 ms of the spike train. Firing frequency at 3x threshold was substituted by maximum firing frequency in cells with depolarization-block. Ihyp Sag index of each cell was determined by a series of 500 ms-long negative current steps to create V-I plots of the peak negative voltage deflection (Vhyp) and the steady-state voltage deflection (average voltage over the last 200 ms of the current step; Vsag) and used the ratio of (Vrest−Vsag)/(Vrest−Vhyp) for current injections corresponding closest to Vsag=−80 mV.</p><p>Spontaneous excitatory post synaptic currents (sEPSCs) were recorded from PV+INTs over continuous sweeps of 10–30 s. At least 50 events were sampled to determine sEPSC frequency, these events were averaged to determine average sEPSC amplitude and apparent sEPSC decay time constant. For PV+INT-CA1PC paired recordings, the presynaptic PV+INT was held in current clamp with membrane potential biased to −70 mV, while the postsynaptic cell was held voltage clamp at −70 mV. Synaptic transmission was monitored by producing action potentials in presynaptic PV+INTs (held in current-clamp around −70 mV) every 10 s by giving 2 ms 1–2 nA current steps. Presynaptic trains to probe unitary transmission dynamics consisted of 25 presynaptic action potentials at 50 Hz. Basal unitary event properties for each cell were analyzed using 10 consecutive events obtained 4–5 min after establishing the postsynaptic whole-cell configuration. Amplitudes reflect the average peak amplitude of all events including failures, potency is the average peak amplitude excluding failures. Decay kinetics were measured by single exponential fit of uIPSC potency. The latency of synaptic transmission was defined as the time from the peak of the AP to 5% of the uIPSC potency.</p><p>For depolarization block experiments, WT and GlobalLis TdT+PV+INTs were recorded in current-clamp mode. Rheobase, input resistance, AP half-width, firing frequency at two x threshold x and maximum firing frequency were recorded (and used to identify physiological subtype) using above protocols. Further depolarizing current was injected in 500 ms sweeps with a step size of 50 pA until cells were subject to depolarizing block or 1500 pA of current were injected. Following this, 10 s sweeps of spontaneous activity with 500 ms of evoked firing (with ~1.5 x threshold current) were taken.

The nuclei were resuspended in 500 µl 1xPBS with 1% BSA and 0.2 U/µl SUPERaseIn RNase Inhibitor (ThermoFisher, #AM2696) and loaded on top of 900 µl 1.8 M Sucrose Cushion Solution (Sigma, NUC-201). The sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 45 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the nuclei were resuspended in 500 ul Pre-FACS buffer (1xPBS with 1% BSA, 0.2 U/µl SUPERaseIn RNase Inhibitor and 0.2 M sucrose). Before sorting, nucleus from the six WT or seven mutant mice were pooled together and 5 µl of 5 mM DRAQ5 were added.</p><p>Samples were processed on a Sony SH800 Cell Sorter with a 100 mm sorting chip. 15,000 GFP+/DRAQ5+ nuclei from mutant and WT samples were collected directly into 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes containing 10 µl of the Pre-FACS buffer. PCR cycles were conducted for cDNA amplification, and the subsequent library preparation and sequencing were carried out in accordance with the manufacturer recommendation (Chromium Single Cell 3' Library and Gel Bead Kit 10X v3, 16 reactions). Sequencing of the libraries were performed on the Illumina HiSeq2500 at the NICHD, Molecular Genomics Core facility. The cell number estimates, mean reads per cell (raw), median genes per cell respectively, are as follows <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>: 8470, 22,289, 2024; <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>: 8185, 24,652, 2142. Demultiplexed samples were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10). The end definitions of genes were extended 4 k bp downstream (or halfway to the next feature if closer) and converted to mRNA counts using the Cell Ranger Version 2.1.1, provided by the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>RNAseq data processing and analyses, differential expression testing, and visualization</title><p>Processing (load, align, merge, cluster, differential expression testing) and visualization of the scRNAseq datasets were performed with the R statistical programming environment (v3.5.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">R Development Core Team, 2013</xref>), and Seurat package (v3.1.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> datasets were first merged with the Allen Institute reference and in-house MGE interneuron reference datasets. To analyze the Allen Institute mouse dataset of the single-cell transcriptomes of ~76,000 cells from &gt;20 areas of mouse cortex and hippocampus, we downloaded the transcriptome/HDF5 file (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq">https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq</ext-link>) and subsequently converted into Seurat v3-compatible format based on the instructions provided in the Allen Institute Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq/protocols-mouse-cortex-and-hippocampus">https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq/protocols-mouse-cortex-and-hippocampus</ext-link>) and custom scripts in R package as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chittajallu et al., 2020</xref>). Single-cell transcriptomes from <italic>Nkx2.1</italic>-cre:Ai14, MGE-derived cortical and hippocampal interneurons (postnatal day 18–20) were processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahadevan and Mitra, 2020</xref>). To perform integrated analyses, we identified a common set of genes between <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, <italic>Nkx2.1</italic>-MGE cortical and hippocampal interneurons and Allen datasets, and utilized these for the initial analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>. Data set preprocessing, normalization, identification of variable genes, canonical correlation analyses were performed according to default Seurat parameters, unless otherwise mentioned. Quality control filtering was performed by only including cells that had between 200 and 20000 unique genes, and that had &lt;5% of reads from mitochondrial genes. Clustering was performed on the top 25 PCs using the function FindClusters() by applying the shared nearest neighbor modularity optimization with clustering resolution of 0.5. Phylogenetic tree relating the 'average' cell from each identity class based on a distance matrix constructed in gene expression space using the BuildClusterTree() function. Overall, we identified 36 clusters using this approach, among which clusters 12, 13, 16, 17 are highly enriched in the <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> datasets and aligned well in their corresponding UMAP spaces with the reference datasets. The identities of clusters 12, 13, 16, 17 are matched with the top gene markers identified by the FindAllMarkers(). These four clusters are <italic>Gad1</italic>+, <italic>Pvalb</italic>+ and <italic>Vip</italic>-, and were putatively annotated as Bistratified, Fast-spiking, and Axo-axonic subsets of PV+INTs, based on marker expression of <italic>Sst</italic>, <italic>Tac1</italic>, and <italic>Pthlh</italic>, respectively, as indicated in interneuron literature and previous scRNAseq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fishell and Kepecs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 2018</xref>). Subsequent to dataset validation using references, the <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Pafah1b1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> datasets reanalyzed by subsetting the cells that expressed <italic>Gad1</italic>, <italic>Pvalb</italic> expression &gt;0.1 and by excluding the cells containing non-PV+INT genes <italic>Slc17a7</italic>, <italic>Ttr</italic>, <italic>Scn3a</italic>, <italic>Gpc5</italic>, <italic>Slc1a2, Htr2c</italic>, <italic>Trpm3</italic> expressions &lt; 0.1. Clustering was performed on the top 25 PCs using the function FindClusters() by applying the shared nearest neighbor modularity optimization with clustering resolution of 0.5. Similar to prior analyses, we recovered Bistratified, Fast-spiking and Axo-axonic subsets of PV+INTs. Additionally, a minor population of <italic>Nos1</italic>+ cells clearly segregated, which represents putative dentate gyrus-expressed PV+INTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vaden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jinno and Kosaka, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Differential gene expression testing was performed using the MAST package within the FindMarkers() function to identify the differentially expressed genes between two subclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finak et al., 2015</xref>). We applied a stringent false-discovery rate &lt;0.01, and minimum logFC in our DEGs as ±0.1, because MAST has been previously reported to underestimate the magnitude of fold change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ximerakis et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahadevan and Mitra, 2020</xref>). Moreover, previous studies have demonstrated the MAST approach for DEG testing to be powerful in determining subtle changes in highly transcribed genes, and among abundant populations, additional to underrepresenting changes among weakly transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ximerakis et al., 2019</xref>). Molecular and functional annotation of the DEGs were conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analyses (IPA) platform, to identify the biological pathways and disease pathways over-represented. Experimentally validated and predicted <italic>Pafah1b1</italic> genetic and protein interactions were obtained via publicly available data mining resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kotlyar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rahmati et al., 2017</xref>) IPA was also used to annotate genes with their known cellular functional classes. Heatmaps for the DEGs were generated using the Morpheus package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus">https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus</ext-link>) within the R framework.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Carolina Bengtsson-Gonzales for developing the code for cluster analysis.

To address this question, the authors use electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and molecular techniques including RNA seq. The main findings are:</p><p>– The lissencephaly mutation reduces the abundance of fast-spiking PV+ interneurons, and increases the proportion of neurons with intermediate spiking phenotype.</p><p>– Global and cell-specific mutations in GABAergic interneurons have comparable effects, suggesting cell-autonomous mechanisms.</p><p>– The mutation changes morphological development, intrinsic excitability, and inhibitory output of PV+ interneurons.</p><p>– Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals several dysregulated genes, related to morphogenesis, cell excitability, and synapse formation.</p><p>Based on these results, the authors conclude that impaired development and function of PV+ interneurons contributes to the spontaneous seizures observed in type I lissencephaly. Overall, the reviewers found this a quite nice paper. The key findings are exciting, the experiments are systematically planned and well performed, and the manuscript is carefully written. However, the reviewers have a couple of points that need to be addressed before the manuscript can be published.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate that the macroscopic morphological properties of axons and dendrites of PV+ neurons differ between wild type and mutant. However, the microscopic morphological properties are largely ignored. Parameters of interest include dendritic and axonal diameters, number of presynaptic terminals, and &quot;aspinyness&quot; versus &quot;spinyness&quot; of interneuron dendrites.</p><p>2) A different clustering analysis must be applied to validate the main conclusions.</p><p>The Materials and methods section, regarding clustering analysis, states that: &quot;To identify potential subclusters of PV+INTs, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean distance of normalized (log transformed) intrinsic electrophysiological parameters using R-studio version 0.99.451 and R version 3.4.2.&quot; So the question is, how many clusters exist in the sample? What value should be considered for k? Figure legends seem to provide the answer: &quot;The dendrogram inset indicates 2 optimal clusters&quot; and &quot;The dendrogram inset indicates 3 optimal clusters&quot;.</p><p>Unfortunately, dendrograms cannot (usually) tell you how many clusters you should have, unless the ultrametric tree inequality holds, which is very rare for any real-world data. In other words, it is a common mistake (and misinterpretation) to use dendrograms as a tool for determining the number of clusters in a dataset. As a result of that premise, one of the central arguments is that &quot;WT PV+INTs consist of two physiological subtypes: FS and NFS cells&quot; whereas &quot;GlobalLis PV+INTs consist of three physiological subtypes: FS, IS and NFS cells&quot;. But let us look at the data. Figure 3E and Figure 4E show cell intrinsic properties for these groups. Shouldn't the FS group be similar among these Figures? In fact, the FS groups seems indeed similar if we combine the FS+IS groups in Figure 4. This is because k=2 was assumed in Figure 3 and k=3 was assume in Figure 4, so the FS group suffered further splitting into a new IS subgroup.</p><p>3) The authors claim that connectivity of PV+ interneurons and pyramidal neurons differs between wild-type and mutant. To understand the network relevance, it would be nice to know whether this not only holds for inhibitory output, but also for excitatory synaptic input of PV+ interneurons. Mutual connectivity between interneurons might be also important. At the very least, these points need to be better discussed.</p><p>4) The conclusions stand and fall with the assumption that recording conditions are the same for wild-type and mutant mice. Controls should be provided to reassure that this is the case, and differences are not dependent on systematic differences in age of the animals, slice quality, etc.</p><p>5) The statistics of the paper requires improvement. A Fisher exact test should be used to test the statistical significance of the different proportions between wild-type and mutant mice. &quot;nonparametric t-test&quot; replaced by more specific information, such as Wilcoxon signed rank test or Mann-Whitney U test. Finally, the authors should revise the estimation of the number of classes in the cluster analysis. Based on the shape of the frequency distribution, the authors suggest that two classes in wild-type and three classes in mutant describe the experimental observations. However, the differences in the distributions are quite small, and the significance is unclear.</p><p>6) The authors demonstrate several structural and functional differences between PV+ interneurons in wild-type and mutant brains, but what this means for the activity of interneurons in vivo remains unclear. Ideally, the authors should record from PV+ interneurons in wild-type and mutant mice under in vivo conditions (some tetrode recordings might be affordable). At the very least, the results should be better discussed in the context of in vivo activity.</p><p>7) The mechanisms underlying the differences in excitability and synaptic output between fast and intermediate spikers remains unclear. Changes in in excitability are likely to be related to changes in Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> channel density or subtype. Similarly, changes in inhibitory output will be due to changes in q, N, or pR. Both are only tangentially related to the RNAseq data reported in the paper. More work seems needed to work out the mechanisms.</p><p>8) A bit more emphasis on whether there were any indications in the non-autonomous Emx1-cre mutant would have a made a nice complement (might have missed this if it was there).</p><p>9) Another concern is with confusing IS cells with the SST populations, as they are both more or less IS and they apparently had no specific marker to identify the PV cells other than the physiology that was sufficiently perturbed to confound proper identification of this population. That they were discernible seemed evident from the scRNA-seq analysis but some attention to the SST interneurons (which clearly would be affected in the nkx2.1-cre KO) would have been a nice addition. Are they still facilitating, is their morphology normal, Are they properly dendritically targeting. Both distinguishing these for the IS population and describing this population at least a bit more thoroughly would have been very nice additions to what is clearly a wonderful paper.</p><p>10) The presentation of the manuscript requires improvement. The amount of description of wild type PV interneurons is surprising, as it has already been thoroughly described, in particular in Pelkey et al., 2017. This is necessary for the comparison of wt and mutant cells but perhaps could be parred down rather than spending the first third of the paper describing things are already well documented in the literature. In the present form, the Discussion is rudimentary and focused on side-issues. Several other aspects need to be included (see other major points).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62373.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate that the macroscopic morphological properties of axons and dendrites of PV+ neurons differ between wild type and mutant.

We detected a difference in axon orientation preference in Lis PV cells, which markedly differs from the preferred orientations of those in WT PV cells. This information has been added to Figure 2. In addition, we analyzed morphologies of PV+ cells from the EmxLis and NkxLis genotypes. We found a similar pattern among PV+INTs in these genotypes: NFS cells in these genotypes also have less extensive dendrite and axons than EmxLis FS cells and NkxLis FS and IS cells. This is now in the manuscript as Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><p>We also agree that a thorough examination of the microscopic morphological properties would be useful information, however a proper investigation of these features requires electron microscopy, which is beyond the current scope of this study and our present capabilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A different clustering analysis must be applied to validate the main conclusions.</p><p>The Materials and methods section, regarding clustering analysis, states that: &quot;To identify potential subclusters of PV+INTs, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean distance of normalized (log transformed) intrinsic electrophysiological parameters using R-studio version 0.99.451 and R version 3.4.2.&quot; So the question is, how many clusters exist in the sample?

The optimal numbers of clusters were computed by the published NbClust package in R using Euclidean distances (Charrad et al., 2014); this is now stated in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript. We have also added silhouette plots to Figures 3 and 4. To validate the accuracy of the Kmeans clustering, we have also now performed a Ward Test, and then compared results to the original K-means clustering. In the WT and EmxLis genotypes, Ward clustering was identical to the Kmeans clustering. In the GlobalLis and NkxLis genotypes, Ward clustering was also very similar with Kmeans clustering, please see Figure 4—figure supplement 2 for the comparison of these clustering algorithms: the numbers at the bottoms of the column and ends of the row indicate respectively the number of cells in a given K-means or Ward-cluster. The numbers in the table indicate how many cells of a K-means cluster are contained within a given Ward cluster.</p><p>Based on the similar sorting by separate clustering algorithms and the consistency and across multiple genotypes, we are confident that the IS cells represent a novel population of PV+INTs that emerge following cell-autonomous <italic>LIS1</italic> mutations within interneurons. Regarding the comment on the identity of FS and IS cells, the clustering algorithm we used indicates that if we were to collapse the number of GlobalLis and NkxLis clusters to artificially select k=2, the IS cells would be part of the NFS cluster, not part of the FS cluster (the resulting dendrograms from the GlobalLis mouse are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62373-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Sorting using k=2 also results in highly significant differences between intrinsic properties of FS cells and the merged NFS/IS group.

In the manuscript, we report that WT FS cells have higher connectivity rates with pyramidal neurons than NFS cells (FS: 20/62 connected, NFS: 3/22 connected; Figure 7C). While this was not statistically significant using a Fisher exact test, the p-value was close to significance (p=.105).

To address excitatory input to PV+INTs, we analyzed spontaneous excitatory post synaptic currents on WT and GlobalLis PV+INTs in and found another pattern that persists across genotypes: FS cells receive a significantly higher frequency of spontaneous excitatory input than both IS (in genotypes that have them) and NFS cells. The summary of spontaneous excitatory post synaptic current frequency, amplitude, and apparent decay time constant are now present in the manuscript and summarized in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. The present study did not focus on PV-PV inhibition, but we agree that it would be an interesting area of future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusions stand and fall with the assumption that recording conditions are the same for wild-type and mutant mice.

Based on the shape of the frequency distribution, the authors suggest that two classes in wild-type and three classes in mutant describe the experimental observations. However, the differences in the distributions are quite small, and the significance is unclear.” Please see our response to major point 2 for a discussion of PV+INT cluster analysis.</p><p>Regarding significance, Figure 3 displays differences in intrinsic properties of WT FS and NFS cells, many of which (including input resistance, firing frequency at 2x and 3x threshold, adaptation ratio, rheobase, action potential half-width, and sag index) are highly significant. Figures 4 displays this information for GlobalLis, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 for EmxLis and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 for NkxLis PV+INTs, again with many of the same highly significant differences in intrinsic properties between physiological subtypes. Finally, in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 and Figure 4—figure supplement 4 distributions of, respectively, physiological and morphological properties of PV+INTs are shown by physiological subtype and genotype. While we detect almost no changes in these properties of physiological subtypes of PV+INTs based on their genotype, we observed many highly significant differences in intrinsic properties between FS, IS and NFS cells. Please see our response to Major Point 2 for examples of intrinsic physiological properties that are significantly different between FS cells and NFS and/or IS cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors demonstrate several structural and functional differences between PV+ interneurons in wild-type and mutant brains, but what this means for the activity of interneurons in vivo remains unclear. Ideally, the authors should record from PV+ interneurons in wild-type and mutant mice under in vivo conditions (some tetrode recordings might be affordable). At the very least, the results should be better discussed in the context of in vivo activity.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that examining function of <italic>LIS1</italic> mutant PV+INTs in vivo would be interesting, tetrode recordings would not allow for separation of FS and IS cells. Many exciting possibilities remain for investigating PV+INTs in vivo, however this is not the intention of our study. Furthermore, at this time the McBain lab remains closed until the new year at the earliest. We have been anticipating establishing an in vivo recording setup over the last year but due to vendors being unable to enter campus and the lack of personnel allowed on campus at any one time we have shelved our plans to build an in vivo system until next year.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The mechanisms underlying the differences in excitability and synaptic output between fast and intermediate spikers remains unclear. Changes in in excitability are likely to be related to changes in Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> channel density or subtype. Similarly, changes in inhibitory output will be due to changes in q, N, or pR. Both are only tangentially related to the RNAseq data reported in the paper. More work seems needed to work out the mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the mechanisms underlying the differences in excitability and synaptic output between FS and IS cells remains unclear. In regard to the comment that “Changes in in excitability are likely to be related to changes in Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> channel density or subtype”, we observed misrelation of several potassium channel family members (<italic>Kcnj3, Kcnq5, Kcnh7, Kcnb2, Kcnk2, Kcnip1, Kcnip2)</italic> in mutant PV+INTs from the RNAseq experiment (Figure 9). While this does not fully explain the emergence of IS cells, it provides a partial explanation, as subtle alterations to ion channels can alter intrinsic electrical properties. We agree that investigating quantal transmission would contribute to our understanding of the specific changes occurring on that scale, however we did not investigate this in great detail, and many additional experiments are required, that we are presently unable to perform, to fully answer these questions (see Lawrence et al., 2003). We have, however, further analyzed our RNA-seq dataset and identified a small subset of differentially expressed genes which interact with LIS1 and may be interesting targets for future research (this has been added to Figure 7 and to the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) A bit more emphasis on whether there were any indications in the non-autonomous Emx1-cre mutant would have a made a nice complement (might have missed this if it was there).</p></disp-quote><p>Analysis of PV+INT morphophysiology in the EmxLis mutant is summarized in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplements 2-4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Another concern is with confusing IS cells with the SST populations, as they are both more or less IS and they apparently had no specific marker to identify the PV cells other than the physiology that was sufficiently perturbed to confound proper identification of this population. That they were discernible seemed evident from the scRNA-seq analysis but some attention to the SST interneurons (which clearly would be affected in the nkx2.1-cre KO) would have been a nice addition. Are they still facilitating, is their morphology normal, Are they properly dendritically targeting. Both distinguishing these for the IS population and describing this population at least a bit more thoroughly would have been very nice additions to what is clearly a wonderful paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer may have mistakenly thought that we used the Nkx2.1-Cre for the RNAseq. In the manuscript we state that we used the PV-Cre line for this experiment. As explained in the Materials and methods section, <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre expression in the mother enables Cre-Lox recombination without Cre expression in the recombined pups (https://www.jax.org/strain/008454). This strategy was used to rederive the Cre-independent GlobalLis (<italic>LIS1</italic>+/-) mice. These mice were then crossed to PV-Cre/Sun1-GFP mice to enable specific targeting of PV+ nuclei. Regarding the potential confusion of IS cells with SST+ cells, we believe this is highly unlikely for several reasons. First, we used PV-TdTomto reporter mice for all recordings, and we demonstrated that there is very high colocalization between PV-TdTomato and PV-IHC and this is unchanged in the GlobalLis mutant. Second, we only observe IS cells following cell-autonomous <italic>LIS1</italic> mutations within interneurons (GlobalLis and NxkLis). If we were simply recording SST+ cells due to faulty TdTomato labeling, we would expect to find these cells in the WT and EmxLis genotypes. Third, IS cells are the dominant PV+INT subtype in the GlobalLis and NkxLis genotypes, if these cells represented SST+ cells, we would not expect to see them represent half of the total PV+ population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The presentation of the manuscript requires improvement. The amount of description of wild type PV interneurons is surprising, as it has already been thoroughly described, in particular in Pelkey et al., 2017. This is necessary for the comparison of wt and mutant cells but perhaps could be parred down rather than spending the first third of the paper describing things are already well documented in the literature. In the present form, the Discussion is rudimentary and focused on side-issues. Several other aspects need to be included (see other major points).</p></disp-quote><p>We have worked to improve the clarity of the presentation however we respectfully disagree with the notion that there is too much description of WT PV+INTs in this manuscript, and we disagree that first third of this manuscript was focused on “describing things that are already well documented in the literature”. Pelkey et al., 2017 does not describe PV+ NFS cells nor does it describe PV+ radiatum-targeting cells. These morphophysiological subtypes of PV+INTs are uncharacterized in the literature and we felt that they required adequate description. The Discussion section has also been expanded.</p></body></sub-article></article>
