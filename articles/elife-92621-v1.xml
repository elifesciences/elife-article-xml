animals renowned for their ability to withstand extreme conditions, including high doses of ionizing radiation (IR). To better understand their radio-resistance, we first characterized induction and repair of DNA double- and single-strand breaks after exposure to IR in the model species <italic>Hypsibius exemplaris</italic>. Importantly, we found that the rate of single-strand breaks induced was roughly equivalent to that in human cells, suggesting that DNA repair plays a predominant role in tardigrades’ radio-resistance. To identify novel tardigrade-specific genes involved, we next conducted a comparative transcriptomics analysis across three different species. In all three species, many DNA repair genes were among the most strongly overexpressed genes alongside a novel tardigrade-specific gene, which we named <italic>Tardigrade DNA damage Response 1</italic> (<italic>TDR1</italic>). We found that TDR1 protein interacts with DNA and forms aggregates at high concentration suggesting it may condensate DNA and preserve chromosome organization until DNA repair is accomplished. Remarkably, when expressed in human cells, TDR1 improved resistance to Bleomycin, a radiomimetic drug. Based on these findings, we propose that TDR1 is a novel tardigrade-specific gene conferring resistance to IR. Our study sheds light on mechanisms of DNA repair helping cope with high levels of DNA damage inflicted by IR.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tardigrade</kwd><kwd>ionizing radiation</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019125</institution-id><institution>Sorbonne Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SU-19-3-EMRG-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giovannangeli</surname><given-names>Carine</given-names></name><name><surname>De Cian</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Concordet</surname><given-names>Jean-Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-II-INBS-0014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giovannangeli</surname><given-names>Carine</given-names></name><name><surname>Concordet</surname><given-names>Jean-Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-0009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jourdren</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name><name><surname>Blugeon</surname><given-names>Corinne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-0008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adrait</surname><given-names>Annie</given-names></name><name><surname>Couté</surname><given-names>Yohann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-EURE-0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adrait</surname><given-names>Annie</given-names></name><name><surname>Couté</surname><given-names>Yohann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When exposed to high-dose ionizing radiation, tardigrades undergo extensive DNA damage, like humans, but cope by stimulating expression of DNA repair proteins and of TDR1, a novel tardigrade-specific DNA-binding protein.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tardigrades are microscopic animals found in marine or freshwater environments, and in semi-terrestrial habitats such as moss, lichen, and leaf litter. They are well known for their resistance to IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jönsson, 2019</xref>) and extreme conditions like desiccation, freezing, and osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guidetti et al., 2011</xref>). With over 1400 species, they belong to the clade of ecdysozoans, which also includes nematodes and arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Degma and Roberto, 2023</xref>). Tardigrades share a highly conserved body plan, with a soft body protected by a cuticle, four pairs legs, and a characteristic feeding apparatus. Tardigrades, however, can differ in their resistance to extreme conditions. For example, <italic>Ramazzottius oberhaeuseri</italic> withstands extremely rapid desiccation while <italic>Hypsibius dujardini</italic> only survives gradual dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wright, 1989</xref>), and the freshwater <italic>Thulinius ruffoi</italic> is not resistant to desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kondo et al., 2020</xref>). Many species across the Tardigrada phylum can tolerate irradiation doses higher than 4000 Gy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hashimoto and Kunieda, 2017</xref>), but some are less tolerant, like <italic>Echiniscoides sigismundi</italic>, which has an LD50 at 48 hr of 1000 Gy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jönsson et al., 2016</xref>). However, the doses compatible with maintenance of fertility seem much lower, e.g., the maximum is 100 Gy for <italic>Hypsibius exemplaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beltrán-Pardo et al., 2015</xref>). Due to challenges in rearing tardigrades in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altiero and Rebecchi, 2001</xref>), the maintenance of fertility has seldom been investigated and some species might remain fertile at higher doses.</p><p>Understanding the genes involved in tardigrade resistance to IR is essential to unraveling the mechanisms of their exceptional resilience. Systematic comparison of whole-genome sequences has suggested that tardigrades have one of the highest proportions of gene gain and gene loss among metazoan phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guijarro-Clarke et al., 2020</xref>). Several novel, tardigrade-specific genes have indeed been involved in resistance to desiccation including CAHS, MAHS, SAHS, and AMNP gene families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hesgrove and Boothby, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arakawa, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanaka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>). For resistance to IR, the tardigrade-specific gene Dsup (for DNA damage suppressor) has been discovered in <italic>Ramazzottius varieornatus</italic>. Dsup encodes an abundant chromatin protein that increases resistance to X-rays when expressed in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>). In vitro experiments have shown that DNA damage induced by hydroxyl radicals was reduced when Dsup was added to nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chavez et al., 2019</xref>), indicating DNA protection by Dsup. However, it is not yet possible to inactivate genes with CRISPR-Cas9 in tardigrades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein, 2022</xref>) and direct evidence for the importance of Dsup in radio-resistance of tardigrades is still lacking. Interestingly, the presence of resistance genes differs across tardigrade genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arakawa, 2022</xref>). While AMNP genes are found in both classes of tardigrades, Heterotardigrada and Eutardigrada, CAHS, SAHS, and MAHS genes are only found in Eutardigrada, and Dsup appears restricted to the Hypsibioidea superfamily of Eutardigrada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arakawa, 2022</xref>). However, given the range of species demonstrated to be radio-resistant across the phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hashimoto and Kunieda, 2017</xref>), it seems likely that additional tardigrade-specific genes are involved in tardigrades’ radio-resistance.</p><p>In addition to tardigrades, other animals display exceptional resistance to IR including rotifers, nematodes, and larvae of <italic>Polypedilum vanderplanki</italic> midges, all surviving doses more than 100 times higher than humans. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the mechanisms involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ujaoney et al., 2024</xref>). In addition to DNA protection, DNA repair may also help maintain genome integrity upon irradiation. In rotifers, the rate of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is equivalent to that in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gladyshev and Meselson, 2008</xref>), showing that DNA repair, rather than DNA protection, plays a predominant role in their radio-resistance. Furthermore, it was recently found that genes of DNA repair are upregulated in response to IR in rotifers and <italic>P. vanderplanki</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moris et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ryabova et al., 2017</xref>). In rotifers, upregulation of a DNA ligase gene acquired by horizontal gene transfer may be essential to radio-resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicolas et al., 2023</xref>). In prokaryotes, radio-resistance has been investigated in the bacterium <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic>, showing highly efficient DNA repair in response to the high levels of DNA damage induced by high doses of IR and the contribution of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> DNA repair genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Timmins and Moe, 2016</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that upregulation of DNA repair genes may also play a role in radio-resistance of tardigrades: irradiation with IR increases expression of Rad51, the canonical recombinase of homologous recombination (HR), in <italic>Milnesium inceptum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltrán-Pardo et al., 2013</xref>), and regulation of DNA repair genes was observed in <italic>R. varieornatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoshida et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To improve our understanding of resistance to IR in tardigrades, we sought to characterize DNA damage and repair after irradiation and to identify novel tardigrade-specific genes involved in resistance to IR. For this purpose, we first examined the kinetics of DNA damage and repair after IR in the model species <italic>H. exemplaris</italic>. This species was chosen due to its ease of rearing in laboratory conditions and its known genome sequence. Additionally, to identify novel genes involved in resistance to IR, we analyzed gene expression in response to IR in <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> and two additional species, <italic>Acutuncus antarcticus,</italic> from the Hypsibioidea superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giovannini et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>Paramacrobiotus fairbanksi</italic> of the Macrobiotoidea superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guidetti et al., 2019</xref>). Together with multiple DNA repair genes, a tardigrade-specific gene, which we named <italic>T</italic>ardigrade <italic>D</italic>NA damage <italic>R</italic>esponse gene <italic>1</italic> (TDR1), was strongly upregulated in response to IR in all three species analyzed. Further analyses in <italic>H. exemplaris</italic>, including differential proteomics and western blots, showed that TDR1 protein is present and upregulated. In vitro experiments demonstrated that recombinant TDR1 interacts with DNA and forms aggregates with DNA at high concentrations. Importantly, when expressed in human cells, TDR1 reduced the number of phospho-H2AX foci induced by Bleomycin, a DNA damaging drug used as a radiomimetic. These findings show the importance of DNA repair in radio-resistance of tardigrades and suggest that TDR1 is a novel tardigrade-specific DNA-binding protein involved in DNA repair after exposure of tardigrades to IR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DSBs and SSBs are induced and repaired after exposure of <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> to IR</title><p>IR causes a variety of damages to DNA such as nucleobase lesions, single-strand breaks (SSBs) and DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Téoule, 1987</xref>). In eukaryotes, from yeast to humans, phosphorylation of H2AX is a universal response to DSBs and an early step in the DNA repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2004</xref>). To investigate DSBs caused by IR, we generated an antibody against phosphorylated H2AX of <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> tardigrades were exposed to either 100 Gy or 1000 Gy of <sup>137</sup>Cs γ-rays, which are known to be well tolerated by this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beltrán-Pardo et al., 2015</xref>). We analyzed phospho-H2AX in protein extracts of <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> collected at 30 min, 4 hr, 8h30, 24 hr, and 73 hr after irradiation. For both 100 Gy and 1000 Gy doses, phospho-H2AX was detected at 30 min after irradiation, reached its peak levels at 4 hr and 8h30 and then gradually decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Irradiation was also performed with an accelerated electron beam, which delivered identical doses in much shorter times, 1000 Gy in 10 min instead of 1 hr for the <sup>137</sup>Cs source, in order to better appreciate the early peak of phospho-H2AX. A peak of phospho-H2AX was detected at 4 hr and a similar, gradual decrease was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Next, we performed whole-mount immunolabeling of tardigrades and observed intense, ubiquitous phospho-H2AX labeling in nuclei 4 hr after 100 Gy irradiation, which had significantly decreased 24 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This suggests irradiation impacts all adult cells and indicates efficient DNA repair by 24 hr after 100 Gy irradiation, consistent with the results of western blot analysis. After 1000 Gy irradiation, the intense signal detected at 4 hr had decreased in most nuclei at 24 hr but it persisted at high intensity specifically in gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>).

In order to investigate DNA synthesis taking place after irradiation, we incubated tardigrades with the thymidine nucleotide analog EdU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gross et al., 2018</xref>). Using confocal microscopy, we could detect DNA synthesis in replicating intestinal cells of control animals, as previously shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gross et al., 2018</xref>. In contrast, we could not detect any specific signal in irradiated tardigrades compared to controls, suggesting (i) that DNA synthesis induced during DNA repair remained at low, undetectable levels and (ii) that dividing intestinal cells detected in control animals were irreversibly damaged by the 1000 Gy irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate the dose-dependent induction and repair of DSBs in response to IR.

SSBs were evaluated by migrating DNA samples in denaturing agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). DNA from control, untreated tardigrades appeared as a predominant band running above the 20 kb marker with a smear. The smear, likely due to the harsh extraction conditions needed for tardigrade cuticle lysis, extended down between 20 kb and 10 kb markers where a discrete band, of unknown origin, could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). At 30 min after 1000 Gy irradiation, intensity of the high molecular weight band was drastically reduced, and DNA detected in the smear between 10 kb and 20 kb was strongly increased. In addition, the discrete band could no longer be detected. This clearly indicates that 1000 Gy IR induces high rates of SSBs. Considering that the majority of DNA fragments detected had a size of 10–20 kb and that the discrete band of 10–20 kb could no longer be detected, we can roughly evaluate that there is approximately 1 SSB every 10–20 kb. This corresponds to induction of SSBs at a rate of 0.05–0.1 SSB/Mb/Gy.

However, compared to 1000 Gy, the changes observed were not as marked and the discrete 10–20 kb band could always be detected, indicating SSBs were induced at lower rates. These results indicate that SSBs are inflicted by IR in a dose-dependent manner, roughly estimated to 0.05–0.1 SSB/Mb/Gy, and progressively repaired within the next 24–73 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>H. exemplaris</italic> strongly overexpresses canonical DNA repair genes as well as RNF146 and TDR1, a novel tardigrade-specific gene, in response to IR</title><p>To examine the gene expression changes associated with tardigrade response to IR, we performed RNA sequencing of <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> collected 4 hr after irradiation.

As expected, the correlation between highly expressed genes after IR and after Bleomycin treatment (with baseMean&gt;500, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>) was strong for most upregulated DNA repair genes such as XRCC5, XRCC6, PARP2, PARP3, XRCC1, LIG4, LIG1, and RNF146 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). Importantly, in addition to DNA repair genes, several genes of unknown function were also strongly overexpressed in both conditions and considered as promising candidates for a potential role in resistance to IR. One such gene, which we named TDR1 (for Tardigrade DNA damage Response 1), was chosen for further investigation. Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long read sequencing and cDNA cloning of TDR1 allowed us to determine the predicted TDR1 protein sequence which is 146 amino acids long (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>). We observed that the current genome assembly predicts a partially truncated TDR1 protein sequence, BV898_14257, due to an assembly error (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Our BLAST analysis against NCBI nucleotide non-redundant database suggested that TDR1 is a novel tardigrade-specific gene as no homolog could be found in any other ecdysozoan (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Analysis of proteomic response to IR in <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> confirms overexpression of TDR1</title><p>We next examined whether stimulation of gene expression at the RNA level led to increased protein levels and in particular, whether TDR1 protein was indeed overexpressed.

Our analysis documented dose-dependent DNA damage and repair taking place after exposure to IR. DNA damage could be detected in virtually all nuclei by immunolabeling. However, at 1000 Gy, phosho-H2AX labeling persisted longer than at 100 Gy in the gonad. Additionally, at 1000 Gy, cell divisions could no longer be detected in the midgut of the digestive system. These two consequences of exposure to higher doses of IR may be due to higher sensitivity of replicating cells to IR and explain why <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> tardigrades no longer lay eggs and become sterile after irradiation with 1000 Gy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beltrán-Pardo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Using standard agarose gel electrophoresis, we were able to observe that SSBs were induced every 10–20 kb in <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> after exposure to 1000 Gy of γ-rays, indicating a rate of 0.05–0.1 SSB/Gy/Mb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Remarkably, this rate is roughly similar to that reported for cultured human cells which is 0.17 SSB/Gy/Mb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohsin Ali et al., 2004</xref>), showing that high levels of DNA damage are induced after high doses of IR and thus supporting the importance of DNA repair in the radio-resistance of <italic>H. exemplaris</italic> compared to human cells. In radio-resistant rotifers, the rate of DSBs was comparable to non-radio-resistant organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gladyshev and Meselson, 2008</xref>), also suggesting the importance of DNA repair in radio-resistance. Concerning the role of DNA protection in radio-resistance, further studies would be necessary; in particular, determining the rate of DNA DSBs and testing the importance of Dsup in live <italic>H. exemplaris</italic>. Quantification of phospho-H2AX foci is frequently used as a proxy but given the small size of tardigrade nuclei, standard imaging by confocal microscopy was not sufficient to clearly identify and quantify independent phospho-H2AX foci. Recent developments in super-resolution microscopy could make it possible to perform such quantification in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tillberg and Chen, 2019</xref>). Pulse field electrophoresis is a method that would allow to directly examine DNA damage, but it would require to disrupt the cuticle and release DNA without causing damage which would confound the analysis of DNA integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Fine regulation of scaffolding proteins to cope with high rates of DNA damage</title><p>We performed comparative transcriptomics in three different species and uncovered the conserved upregulation of a wide number of DNA repair genes in response to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Remarkably, the strongest upregulations, both at RNA and protein levels, were detected for proteins acting early in DNA repair in the different pathways involved: XRCC5/XRCC6 in NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doherty and Jackson, 2001</xref>), POLQ in micro-homology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), XRCC1 in SSB, and PARP2/PARP3 which act as DNA damage sensors common to all DSB repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pandey and Black, 2021</xref>). These early acting proteins either stabilize DNA ends or provide essential scaffolding for subsequent steps of DNA repair. It is possible that producing higher amounts of such proteins is essential to maintain DNA ends long enough for more limiting components of DNA repair to cope with an exceptionally high number of damages. For XRCC5 and XRCC6, our study established, by two independent methods, proteomics and western blot analyses, that the stimulation at the protein level was much more modest (6- and 20-fold at most, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) than at the RNA level (420- and 90-fold, respectively). This finding suggests that the abundance of DNA repair proteins does not simply increase massively to quantitatively match high numbers of DNA damages. Interestingly, in response to IR, the RNF146 ubiquitin ligase was also found to be strongly upregulated. RNF146 was previously shown to interact with PARylated XRCC5 and XRCC6 proteins and to target them for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2011</xref>). To explain the more modest fold stimulation of XRCC5 and XRCC6 at protein levels compared to its massive increase at mRNA levels, it is therefore tempting to speculate that, XRCC5 and XRCC6 protein levels (and perhaps that of other scaffolding complexes of DNA repair) are regulated by a dynamic balance of synthesis, promoted by increased gene transcription, and degradation, made possible by RNF146 upregulation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that, similar to human RNF146 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>He</italic>-RNF146 expression in human cells reduced the number of phospho-H2AX foci detected in response to Bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Further studies should investigate the molecular mechanisms leading to such marked upregulation of RNA levels of these genes. Functional analysis of promoter sequences in transgenic tardigrades is now possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2023</xref>) and could help to identify a conserved set of transcription factors and/or co-regulators common to Macrobiotodea and Hypsibioidea tardigrades. Such information would provide original insight into the acquisition of resistance to IR and help analyze its relation to the resistance to desiccation. Another outstanding issue, given the high rates of DNA damage taking place, is whether DNA repair is accurate. This is particularly relevant for germ line cells where mutations will be transmitted to the progeny and could impact evolution of the species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A novel tardigrade-specific DNA-binding protein involved in resistance to IR</title><p>Among the genes overexpressed in response to IR in the three species studied, we identified TDR1 as a promising tardigrade-specific candidate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). At the functional level, we found that TDR1 protein interacts with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and that when expressed in human cells, TDR1 protein can reduce the number of phospho-H2AX foci induced by Bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). TDR1 is strongly overexpressed in response to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that it favors DNA repair. Proteins directly involved in DNA repair, however, usually accumulate at sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rothkamm et al., 2015</xref>), which did not appear to be the case for TDR1 overexpressed in human cells. Given that TDR1 can form aggregates with DNA in vitro, we speculate that it may favor DNA repair by regulating chromosomal organization. Intriguingly, the DNA-binding activities of TDR1 are reminiscent of DdrC from <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>. DrdC is a small DNA-binding protein which is among the most strongly overexpressed proteins after irradiation of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> with γ-rays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>) and DdrC forms aggregates with DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banneville et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouthier de la Tour et al., 2017</xref>). Further investigations of TDR1 may thus reveal unexpected parallels between mechanisms of DNA repair conferring radio-resistance in tardigrades and bacteria.</p><p>Recent progress in tardigrade transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2023</xref>) and promising findings of somatic mutagenesis by CRISPR-Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumagai et al., 2022</xref>) are paving the way toward germ line gene editing in <italic>H. exemplaris</italic>. Knocking out Dsup and TDR1 genes should help to better appreciate their importance in radio-resistance and the underlying mechanisms. The C-terminal portion of TDR1 is conserved in species of Macrobiotoidea and Hypsibioidea superfamilies of the Parachela order of Eutardigrada but absent from <italic>M. inceptum</italic>, the only representative of the Apochela order of Eutardigrada for which transcriptomic data is currently available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), and from Heterotardigrada. Compared to Dsup, which has only been found in Hypsibioidea, TDR1 appears more widely present and could be a more ancient tardigrade gene. As additional tardigrade species, more fully representing the phylogenetic diversity of the phylum, are reared in laboratory conditions and become amenable to experimental analysis, more novel genes and mechanisms of radio-resistance may become apparent. Generally, evolution of tardigrade-specific gene sequences appears highly dynamic in the phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arakawa, 2022</xref>), and further sequencing of tardigrade genomes will help get a better picture of gain and loss of tardigrade-specific genes and their relation to resistance to extreme conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that DNA repair is a major contributor to tardigrade radio-resistance. Functional investigations of TDR1, as well as the study of transcriptional regulation in response to IR, will contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying radio-resistance. Additionally, we believe that, as done here, further exploration of tardigrade-specific genes and comparative studies among tardigrade species will shed light on the evolution and diversity of radio-resistance mechanisms in these fascinating organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tardigrade culture</title><p><italic>H. exemplaris</italic> (strain Z151, Sciento, UK) and <italic>A. antarcticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giovannini et al., 2018</xref>) were cultivated from one individual in mineral water (Volvic, France) at 16°C with a 14 hr day and 10 hr night cycle and fed with <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> microalgae from Algothèque MNHN, France, or ordered from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ldc-algae.com/">https://www.ldc-algae.com/</ext-link> (Greenbloom pure fresh Chlorella).

With transcriptomics, they found many genes involved in DNA repair pathways to be overexpressed after ionizing radiation. In addition, they found RNF146 coding for a ubiquitin ligase, and genes of the AMNP family. Finally, they more deeply characterized one upregulated gene that they named TDR1 (Tardigrade DNA damage Response 1) which seems specific to tardigrades. With proteomics they verified these results. They show that TDR1 binds DNA in vitro and co-localize with DNA in tardigrades. Because of the difficulties of carrying reverse genetics in tardigrades, the authors showed in vitro that human cells expressing TDR1 led to a reduced number of phospho-H2AX foci (indicating DNA damages) when treated with Bleomycin. Based on these results, the authors suggested that TDR1 interacts with DNA and might regulate chromosomal organization and favors DNA repair.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper provides solid evidence of the upregulation of DNA repair enzymes after irradiation of tardigrades, as well as upregulation of the TRD1 protein.</p><p>The reduction of gamma-H2A.X spots in U2OS cells after expression of TRD1 supports a role in a DNA damage.</p><p>The shown interaction of TDR1 with DNA.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>No reverse genetics to support a DNA repair function for TRD1, even if I recognize that these remain difficult to carry in tardigrades.</p><p>No pulse field electrophoresis gels to show DNA damages in tardigrades, which remain apparently challenging to perform in tardigrades.</p><p>After revision, the manuscript gained in structure, and in precision.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript provides valuable and convincing results contributing to our knowledge of tardigrade radio resistance.

It is nicely written and the authors used different techniques to study these genes. There are sometimes problems with the structure of the manuscript but these could be easily solved. According to me, there are also some points which should be clarified in the result sections. The discussion section is clear but could be more detailed, although some results were actually discussed in the results section. I wish that the authors would go deeper in the comparison with other IR-resistant eucaryotes. Overall, this is a very nice study and of interest to researchers studying molecular mechanisms of ionizing radiation resistance.</p><p>I have two small suggestions regarding the content of the study itself.</p><p>(1) I think the study would benefit from the analyses of a gene tree (if feasible) in order to verify if TDR1 is indeed tardigrade-specific.</p><p>(2) It would be appreciated to indicate the expression level of the different genes discussed in the study, using, for example, transcript per millions (TPMs).Recommendations for the authors: please note that you control which revisions to undertake from the public reviews and recommendations for the authors</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his comments.</p><p>(1) To identify TDR1 homologous sequences in non-tardigrade species, we conducted extensive homology searches using multiple homology-based approaches (Blastp and Diamond against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequences (nr) database and hmmsearch against the EBI reference proteomes), which failed to identify TDR1 homologs in non-tardigrade ecdysozoans, thus strongly supporting that TDR1 is indeed tardigrade-specific.</p><p>To be clearer in the manuscript, we now state the absence of hits for TDR1 in non-tardigrade ecdysozoans. Given the absence of homologs in non-tardigrade species, it is not possible to make a gene tree with non-tardigrade species.</p><p>(2) To further document expression levels (which were already available from the Tables in the initial submission), we added MAplots (representing log2foldchange and logNormalized read counts) in the supplementary materials (Supp Figure 3 and Supp Figure 8). These additional figures clearly document that the DNA repair genes discussed in the main text and TDR1 are highly expressed genes after IR and after Bleomycin treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) It has always seemed strange to me that tardigrades accumulate just as much DNA damage as any other organism when irradiated and yet their Dsup protein is supposed to shield and protect their DNA from damage. Perhaps this is an appropriate time for this idea to be reconsidered given the Dsup was NOT induced by IR in this study and the authors found that their animals incurred just as much damage as other biological systems. While Dsup is clearly not the focus of this manuscript, it is the protein most associated with tardigrade radio-tolerance and I would argue this new paper would call into question previous conclusions made about Dsup.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it will be important to further investigate the role of Dsup in radio-tolerance.

In fact several authors on this manuscript have used RNAi to examine the necessity of genes in tardigrade stress tolerance in the past. Was an attempt made to RNAi TDR1? If not, why? With the large amount of work that the authors put into showing the sufficiency of TDR1 for increasing radiotolerance in cell culture, one would think looking at necessity in tardigrades would be of great interest. If RNAi was performed, what were the results? Even a negative result here is informative since a protein can be sufficient but not necessary for a function - if this were the case it would mean tardigrades have some redundant mechanism(s) for surviving radiation exposure beyond TDR1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted RNAi experiments targeting TDR1 or a mix of DNA repair genes (including XRCC5) and examined response to a bleomycin treatment of 2 weeks. Unfortunately, we could not distinguish any difference between uninjected animals and animals injected with TDR1 dsRNAs , or the mix of DNA repair genes dsRNAs. We concluded that, bleomycin treatment, that we used because it is much easier to perform than irradiation, was perhaps not the best way to assay a potential impact of RNAi on survival since it required long term treatment for several days during which the effect of RNAi may have waned. Another attempt was therefore made injecting with TDR1 or control GFP dsRNAs and exposing animals to a 2000Gy IR treatment. We noticed that the viability was lower after injection with GFP dsRNAs than with TDR1 dsRNAs (likely due to problems we had with the injection needle during injections). The next day, animals were irradiated and we observed after 24h that animals injected with GFP dsRNAs exhibited higher lethality rates than animals injected with TDR1 dsRNAs or uninjected animals. We found that this set of experiments were not conclusive. Our current experimental set up will make it difficult to distinguish lethality due to injections from lethality due to potentially decreased resistance to IR. In particular, many key controls are difficult to make (in particular, we could not confirm the efficiency of target gene knockdown, as it is very challenging given the low amount of biological material available and the poor expression of these genes without irradiation). From a practical point of view, performing these experiments is thus very challenging. We nevertheless agree that, in future work, further experimentation is needed to examine the impact of knock-down by RNAi of TDR1 or of other genes such as DNA repair genes or Dsup, in tardigrade DNA repair and survival after IR. Gene knock-out with CRISPR-Cas9 is a very promising alternative to RNAi given that studies in mutant lines will eliminate the confounding effect of lethality due to injections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Regarding the U2OS experiments. I have several questions/points of clarification:</p><p>a. Were survival/proliferation levels tested or only H2AX foci? I think that showing decreased H2AX foci (fewer double-stranded breaks) correlates with higher survival rates would be important.</p></disp-quote><p>In the experiments reported in Figure 6, cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors and we did not examine the impact on survival rates. U2OS cells are resistant to high doses of Bleomycin and testing survival would require longer exposure at much higher concentrations (Buscemi et al, 2014, PMID: 25486478). In order to try and better address an impact on cell survival, we therefore generated populations of cells stably expressing the candidate tardigrade proteins fused to GFP. Despite trying different experiment conditions for treatment with Bleomycin, we could not detect a reproducibly significant benefit on cell survival for any of the tardigrade proteins tested, including RvDsup which was used as a positive control (since it was previously reported to improve cell survival in response to X-rays). One possibility is that the analysis should be performed in clones and not in populations of cells with heterogeneous expression levels of the tardigrade protein tested. For example, expression levels of the tardigrade protein needed to reduce the number of phospho-H2AX foci in response to DNA damage may interfere with cell division. We note that in the original Dsup paper, the benefit of RvDsup on cell survival was reported in specific transgenic clones. Experiments in different biological systems have also started to document toxic effects of RvDsup expression, illustrating the challenge, when performing experiments in heterologous systems, to achieve suitable expression levels of the tested protein. Trying to perform such a finer analysis, in our opinion, would go beyond the scope of our manuscript and will be best addressed in future studies. We are therefore careful in the text not to make any claim on the benefit of TDR1 expression on cell survival in response to Bleomycin in human cultured cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) From the methods I am a bit confused as to how the images were treated/foci quantified. With the automatic segmentation and foci identification, is this done through the entire Z-series or a single layer? If the latter then I am not sure the results are meaningful, since we do not know how many foci might be present in other layers of the nuclei analyzed. If the former, please clarify this in the method since it is a very important consideration.</p></disp-quote><p>We have acquired images throughout the entire Z-series and edited the text to make it more clear ; We now write: “ Z-stacks were maximum projected and analyzed with Zen Blue software (v2.3)...”. To limit the time needed for image analysis, we have generated an artificial image by projecting the entire Z-series into a single image and counted foci in that single maximum projection image. Although there are potential drawbacks, such as potentially only counting one focus when two foci are superposed along the Z axis, this approach overcomes the limitations of quantification from a single layer. We further ensured statistical robustness of the analysis by performing quantification from several independent fields of the labelled cells and several independent biological replicates (n&gt;=3 as now specified in the legend of figure 6a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) RvDsup reduced levels of HXA1 foci in these experiments, however, HeDsup was not found to be enriched in the transcriptomic analysis performed here. Was there a reason HeDsup was not used in the cell-based experiments? One could argue that RvDsup is from a different species of tardigrade, but it is a bit concerning that an ortholog of a protein found NOT to be induced by radiation exposure seems to perform as well (if not better) than some versions of TDR1.</p></disp-quote><p>RvDsup is the protein initially shown to increase survival of human HEK293 cells treated with X-rays and reduce the number of phospho-H2AX foci induced: it was therefore used as a positive control in our experiments. The sequence of HeDsup is only poorly similar to RvDsup (with 26% identity) and activity of HeDsup in cultured cells has not been reported before. We therefore believe that HeDsup is not well suited to provide a positive control for the experiments performed in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) From the methods, it seems that cells were treated with Bleomycin and then immediately fixed without any sort of recovery time. In this short timeframe, the presence of TDR1 appears to be enough to deal with a substantial amount of double-stranded breaks (as evidenced by the reduced number of HXA1 foci). Does this make sense? How quickly could one expect DNA repair machinery to make significant progress in resolving damaged DNA? This response seems much faster than what was observed in tardigrades. Perhaps the authors to comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>Kinetic studies in human cells show extremely rapid repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Sensing of DNA double strand breaks by PARP proteins takes place within seconds after irradiation by IR (Pandey and Black, 2021, PMID: 33674152). NHEJ is then observed to take place by formation of 53BP1 foci within 15 minutes (Schultz et al, 2000, PMID: 11134068). The number of phospho-H2AX and 53BP1 foci peaks at 30 minutes and starts declining thereafter, showing that at a significant number of sites, DNA repair is proceeding very rapidly (by NHEJ). Although we are not aware of any studies of DNA repair kinetics in U2OS cells after addition of Bleomycin, DNA damage must be instantaneous and further take place during exposure to the drug in parallel to DNA repair, which would be expected to have similar kinetics than after irradiation with IR.</p><p>In our experiments, several mechanisms may be involved in reducing the number of phospho-H2AX foci induced by Bleomycin, such as DNA protection (for Dsup expression) or stimulation of DNA repair (for RNF146 expression). For TDR1, the molecular mechanism involved remains to be determined. Given our finding that TDR1 can form aggregates with DNA, an additional possibility is that clustering of phospho-H2AX foci is induced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I could not find the sequences of the TDR1 proteins studied here.

What was hard to grasp at the beginning is why TDR1 gene was named that way. It should be clearer that this study decided to further focus on that gene, one of the most overexpressed gene after IR, with an unknown function. Then maybe introduce that it was found to be unique to tardigrade and to interact with DNA. Therefore, it was named TDR1.</p><p>Introduction:</p></disp-quote><p>The introduction has been modified according to the suggestions of Reviewer#4 below. One of the suggested references, Nicolas et al 2023 from the Van Doninck lab, was published while our manuscript was under review and cannot be considered as background information for our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1st paragraph:</p><p>The study is on tardigrades, I found it strange that the first paragraph is on D. radiodurans. I think it is fine to mention what is known in bacteria and eucaryotes but we should already know what will be the main topic in the first paragraph of the introduction. Some details about D. radiodurans seem less important and distracting from the main topic (3D conformation).</p><p>2nd paragraph:</p><p>When mentioning radio-resistant eurcaryotes the authors do not mention the larvae of the anhydrobiotic insect Polypedilum vanderplanki. Stating that the mechanisms of resistance are poorly characterized should perhaps be nuanced. There are some recent studies on D. radiodurans (Ujaoney et al., 2017) the insect P. vanderplanki (Ryabova et al., 2017), tardigrades (Kamilari et al., 2019), and rotifers (Nicolas et al., 2023, Moris et al., 2023). Perhaps these papers are worth indicating that if mechanisms are not elucidated yet, recent studies suggest some actors involved in their resistance. Regarding the sentence stating that DNA repair rather than DNA protection plays a predominant role in the radio-resistance of bdelloid rotifers should also be nuanced. Indeed, many chaperones, antioxidants were mentioned to play a role in the radio-resistance of bdelloid rotifers (Moris et al., 2023). The authors mentioned the reference Hespeels et al., 2023 which is not found in their list of references, I am not sure which paper they refer to. The last sentence of the second paragraph does not mean much. I am not sure what the authors want to state with this. Perhaps they should specify if they mean that the function of many other genes overexpressed after IR remains unknown.</p><p>Still, in the second paragraph, the authors focus on rotifers. They also do not mention what is known in the insect P. vanderplanki, which should be added. They still do not mention tardigrades. I think it is nice to first start with eucaryotes and then focus on tardigrades but as I mentioned before it would help to understand the aim of the paper if the first paragraph mentioned briefly the tardigrades and then could go into detail in the third paragraph.</p><p>3rd paragraph:</p><p>The sentence starting &quot;with over 1400 species&quot; best to remove from it &quot;but they can differ in their resistance&quot; and start the next sentence with that.</p><p>4th paragraph:</p><p>Very clear, we finally understand what is the focus of the manuscript.</p><p>5th paragraph:</p><p>Very clear. The authors should mention the names of the three studied species. Here, A. antarcticus is missing. The sentence &quot;Further analyses in H. exemplaris... showed that TDR1 protein is present and upregulated&quot;. The authors should mention in which conditions the protein is upregulated. In that paragraph the authors mention phospho-H2AX: it might be good to introduce its functions before in the introduction (it is mentioned in the second sentence of the results: best to move it to the introduction).</p><p>Results:</p><p>There are a few sentences in this section which rather discuss the results than describe them. I think the manuscript might gain in quality if these interpretations of the results are moved into the discussion section. That would make the result section more concise and the discussion enriched.</p><p>For instance, I suggest to move these sentences into the discussion:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&quot;the finding of persistent DSBs in gonads at 72h.... likely explains...&quot;.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&quot;suggesting that (i) DNA synthesis...&quot;</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&quot; Phospho-H2AX....also suggested&quot;</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&quot;Moreover, expression of TDR1-GFP..., supporting the potential role of TDR1 proteins...&quot;</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&quot;our results suggest that RNF146 upreguation could contribute...&quot;</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&quot;AMNP gene g12777 was shown to increase...Based on our results, it is possible that...&quot;</p></list-item></list><p>Interpretations mentioned here above were always introduced cautiously (-&quot;suggesting that (i) DNA synthesis...&quot; ; -&quot; Phospho-H2AX....also suggested&quot; ; -&quot;Moreover, expression of TDR1-GFP..., supporting the potential role of TDR1 proteins...&quot; ; -&quot;our results suggest that RNF146 upreguation could contribute...&quot; ).

Especially since they start to do it in the first paragraph of that section. However, they only mention TDR1 in the second paragraph dedicated to Bleomycin treatment which is confusing as it is also overexpressed after IR. It is also not clear if RNF146 is also induced by Bleomycin.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>As recommended, the text presents first what is induced after IR and then what is induced by Bleomycin in the following paragraph. When reporting results with Bleomycin, we have provided a global assessment of what is common to both treatments in Supp Figure 3 and in Supp Table 3. In this figure, we also specifically highlighted several key genes of DNA repair induced by both treatments. These are also mentioned in the text (p8) to illustrate the point that many key DNA repair genes are common to both treatments. We have now added RNF146 to that list as recommended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Regarding TDR1, it is not clear when introduced in the text as &quot;promising candidate&quot; why it is the case. It is clear in the figures but perhaps the authors should explain why they chose these genes for further analyses: high log2foldchange and expression level for instance. Regarding that last comment, it would be interesting to have an idea about the expression level of the genes with high log2foldchange. In Figures 2, 3, and 4 the pvalue and log2foldchange are represented but not the expression level (ideally Transcript per Millions). These values would give an additional idea on the importance of that gene. While looking at the figures, it is unclear why you did not further characterize other genes with high log2foldchange (some with even hints of their function): the mentioned RNF146, macroH2A1 (not even mentioned in the results), some genes unannotated in the figures with likely unknown functions,</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>When selecting genes of interest, we did indeed take into account high expression levels.

Based on these criteria, TDR1 was annotated as “Tardigrade-specific”. As stated in the text, we also searched for TDR1 related sequences with (1) blastp (which is more sensitive than diamond) on the NCBI nr database and (2) HMMER on Reference Proteomes, and no hits were found among non-tardigrade ecdysozoans organisms, confirming TDR1 is specific to tardigrades. For Blast search for example, there were five hits in non-ecdysozoans organisms (two cephalochordates, one mollusc and two echinoderma). The blastp and HMMER results are now included in the revised supplementary material (Supp Table 5). These very few hits in species phylogenetically distant from tardigrades cannot be taken to support the existence of TDR1 genes outside tardigrades.</p><p>To be clearer in the manuscript, we now state the absence of hits for TDR1 in non-tardigrade ecdysozoans.

Although further studies would be needed to examine the mechanisms involved, we propose that upregulation of RNF146, whose human homolog has been shown to drive degradation of PARylated XRCC5 and XRCC6 proteins in response to IR (Kang et al. 2011), may be responsible for higher degradation rates and may thus counterbalance increased levels of protein synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Pulse field electrophoresis would be nice to be performed.

This finding suggests that the abundance of DNA repair proteins does not simply increase massively to quantitatively match high numbers of DNA damages. Interestingly, in response to IR, the RNF146 ubiquitin ligase was also found to be strongly upregulated. RNF146 was previously shown to interact with PARylated XRCC5 and XRCC6 and to target them for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Kang et al. 2011). To explain the lower fold stimulation of XRCC5 and XRCC6 at the protein levels, it is therefore tempting to speculate that, XRCC5 and XRCC6 protein levels (and perhaps that of other scaffolding complexes of DNA repair as well) are regulated by a dynamic balance of synthesis, promoted by gene overexpression, and degradation, made possible by RNF146 upregulation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that, similar to human RNF146 (Kang et al. 2011), He-RNF146 expression in human cells reduced the number of phospho-H2AX foci detected in response to Bleomycin (Figure 6).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Page 15: Please add a reference for the sentence &quot;Functional analysis of promotor sequences in transgenic tardigrades etc.&quot;</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The reference has been added to fix this omission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Material and Methods:</p><p>Small comments:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>40 μm mesh: space missing</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>100 μm mesh: space missing</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>(for Bleomycin): parenthesis missing</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>remove &quot;as indicated in the text&quot;</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The investigated time points after radiation need to be clearly stated in the method section.
