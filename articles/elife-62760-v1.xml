allows activation of muscle fibers in the absence of voluntary force generation. NMES could have the potential to promote muscle homeostasis in the context of muscle disease, but the impacts of NMES on diseased muscle are not well understood. We used the zebrafish Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<italic>dmd</italic>) mutant and a longitudinal design to elucidate the consequences of NMES on muscle health. We designed four neuromuscular stimulation paradigms loosely based on weightlifting regimens. Each paradigm differentially affected neuromuscular structure, function, and survival. Only endurance neuromuscular stimulation (eNMES) improved all outcome measures. We found that eNMES improves muscle and neuromuscular junction morphology, swimming, and survival. Heme oxygenase and integrin alpha7 are required for eNMES-mediated improvement. Our data indicate that neuromuscular stimulation can be beneficial, suggesting that the right type of activity may benefit patients with muscle disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuromuscular development</kwd><kwd>dystroglycanopathies</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Morgan Hoffman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kilroy</surname><given-names>Elisabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kilroy</surname><given-names>Elisabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011130</institution-id><institution>University of Maine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start up</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tilbury</surname><given-names>Karissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011130</institution-id><institution>University of Maine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seed Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Benjamin L</given-names></name><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Clarissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15 GM128026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelley</surname><given-names>Joshua B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRI 1726541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Clarissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AR075836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Clarissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15 HD99018-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Clarissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Depending upon the parameters used, neuromuscular stimulation can have beneficial or deleterious impacts on muscle structure and function in an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle is a dynamic tissue whose structural and molecular networks change in response to demand. Skeletal muscleâs ability to adapt is critical to maintaining not only muscle health, but also the overall health of an individual. Skeletal muscle is one of the primary predictors of longevity and recovery from illness and injury, demonstrating that robust skeletal muscle mass is essential for whole-body homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Margolis and Rivas, 2015</xref>). Whereas a great deal is known about the structural and functional plasticity of healthy skeletal muscle, far less is understood about plasticity and adaptation in diseased muscle. Muscular dystrophies are debilitating progressive diseases without cures. Here, we describe how neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) impacts the zebrafish model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).</p><p>Individuals with DMD harbor mutations in the gene encoding the protein dystrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hoffman et al., 1987</xref>). Dystrophin provides a link between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix (ECM) and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) within the sarcolemma (muscle plasma membrane) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonilla et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ervasti and Campbell, 1991</xref>). The stability and integrity of the ECM and DGC are critical to the viability of muscle fibers during contraction. The ECM modulates mechanical homeostasis and cell-matrix interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Grzelkowska-Kowalczyk, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>). ECM-mediated distribution and transmission of force across muscle fibers are mostly achieved through the ECM-cytoskeleton linkage via the DGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Humphrey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ramaswamy et al., 2011</xref>). The DGC maintains the structural integrity of the sarcolemma and serves as a scaffold for various signaling and channel proteins as well as an anchoring point for signaling molecules near their sites of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Constantin, 2014</xref>). The progressive muscle wasting and weakness in DMD is thought to result at least in part because the lack of dystrophin and the disruption of the DGC mechanically weaken the sarcolemma. Stress placed on a mechanically weakened sarcolemma causes microlesions to develop along the sarcolemma, increasing calcium entry, which results in muscle protein degradation and muscle fiber necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alderton and Steinhardt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gailly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gillis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ruegg et al., 2002</xref>). Given the role that the DGC plays in muscle during force generation and the concern about potentially increased muscle damage, there has been interest in studying the effects of activity on the progression of muscle disease in humans. However, studies tend to be small with heterogeneous populations and a clear answer has not yet been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">AlemdaroÄlu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bushby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gianola et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hyzewicz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Markert et al., 2012</xref>). The lack of a clear answer is because these studies vary with regards to exercise regimes, controls (contralateral limbs versus different subjects), time frames of treatments, outcome measures, and conclusions. For example, one study conducted in 1966 concluded that a resistance exercise program is most effective at increasing strength if instituted early in the disease, and a study conducted in 1981 concluded that resistance exercise negatively affects walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Scott et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vignos and Watkins, 1966</xref>). More recent studies have not examined resistance training but do suggest that bicycle ergometers can positively affect the quality of life early in the disease course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">AlemdaroÄlu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jansen et al., 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, studies using the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse to study the impact of exercise on disease progression also take different approaches â treadmill training, voluntary wheel running, swimming, rotarod training â beginning at 3â96 weeks, leading to disparate results. Collectively, studies demonstrate either improvements in twitch tension, decreased necrosis, antioxidant capacities, and oxidative enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltgalvis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Call et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hulmi et al., 2013</xref>); or reduced strength, increased edema and inflammation, increases in reactive oxygen species, and increases in lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burdi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Faist et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kobayashi et al., 2012</xref>). Most of these studies measured specific outcomes on individual muscles of the hindlimb, diaphragm, or heart. These muscles are not equally affected by the absence of dystrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Louboutin et al., 1993</xref>) and thus likely to respond differently to exercise. Taken together, these data clearly indicate that the impact of exercise on the progression of DMD is not very well characterized.</p><p>Skeletal muscle fibers are influenced by the activity pattern imposed upon them, whether the activity is from the innervating neuron or electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pette and VrbovÃ¡, 1985</xref>). Early researchers, including Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne, the French neurologist who described DMD in 1861, proposed that super-imposing electrical stimulation on dystrophin-deficient muscles could serve as a potential therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnard et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Duchenne, 1870</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reichmann et al., 1981</xref>). NMES delivers a series of waveforms of electrical current that is characterized by its frequency, amplitude, and pulse width (or pulse duration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sheffler and Chae, 2007</xref>). These three parameters dictate the strength of the muscle contraction and the amount of force that is generated. The main advantage of NMES is its ability to activate fast- and slow-twitch muscle fibers, resulting in hypertrophy without high-effort voluntary force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gondin et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible that NMES could impact muscle deterioration in congenital muscular dystrophies. However, only a few studies have examined the impact of NMES on muscle strength and function in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Scott et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scott et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zupan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zupan et al., 1993</xref>) and the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model of DMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dangain and Vrbova, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Luthert et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">VrbovÃ¡ and Ward, 1981</xref>). The only clear conclusion from these studies is that NMES does not appear to be detrimental.</p><p>Zebrafish are an attractive model to elucidate the consequences of NMES on diseased muscle. Many molecular, ultrastructural, and histological features are shared between zebrafish and human muscle, including components of the DGC, the excitation-contraction coupling machinery, and the contractile apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dowling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guyon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Parsons et al., 2002</xref>). Further, zebrafish exhibit reproducible, quantitative motor behaviors beginning at 1 day post-fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saint-Amant and Drapeau, 1998</xref>), providing simple and noninvasive measures of muscle function. Dystrophin-deficient zebrafish, known as sapje<sup>ta222a/ta222a</sup>, and referred here as <italic>dmd</italic> mutants, are the smallest vertebrate model of DMD. These <italic>dmd</italic> mutants exhibit severe structural and functional deficits by 4 dpf, and die prematurely between their second and third weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bassett et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this study was to use a longitudinal study design to evaluate the impacts of NMES on disease progression in <italic>dmd</italic> mutant zebrafish. Different NMES programs that varied in pulse frequency and voltage had differing effects on muscle structure, neuromuscular junction (NMJ) structure, motility, and life span. We did identify one program that improved all of the above. This program also increased the resilience of muscle fibers to high-force contraction, increased sarcomere length, and improved nuclear morphology. Deep sequencing indicated that, at least 3 days after exercise, transcriptional changes likely did not drive the improvement. However, deep sequencing did identify a couple of candidate mechanisms that were tested further. Heme oxygenase signaling and integrin alpha7 (Itga7) play roles in endurance NMES (eNMES)-mediated improvement. Taken together, our results show that NMES can have a dramatic positive impact on <italic>dmd</italic> muscle and establish the zebrafish as an excellent model for longitudinal studies that are critical for elucidating the basic mechanisms of skeletal muscle plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A model for studying the impact of NMES on <italic>dmd</italic> muscle</title><p>Strength training is an excellent approach to combat muscle wasting and weakness in healthy individuals. Using zebrafish larvae as a model for lifting weights is not feasible, so we asked whether we could use NMES as an alternate means to stimulate muscle activity and combat muscle wasting and weakness in <italic>dmd</italic> larvae. Previous work used NMES as a controlled stimulus designed to illuminate the fact that muscle that appeared morphologically normal was highly susceptible to stimulation-induced injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Subramanian and Schilling, 2014</xref>). We approached NMES from the opposite perspective and asked whether different NMES paradigms would have different impacts on neuromuscular stability in <italic>dmd</italic> larvae. The parameters that can be adjusted in NMES include pulse frequency and voltage. We designed four different NMES paradigms ranging from high-frequency/low-voltage pulse trains to lower-frequency/higher-voltage pulse trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). In order to easily differentiate these paradigms from each other, and because they were conceptually based on strength training paradigms that vary in the number of repetitions and load, we named these paradigms endurance NMES (eNMES), hypertrophy NMES (hNMES), strength NMES (sNMES), and power NMES (pNMES). We first asked whether these different NMES paradigms elicited unique tail bend patterns that vary in how many times the tail bends as well as how hard it bends. As would be expected, eNMES with high-frequency/low-voltage pulse trains elicited a fast but subtle tail beat. Conversely, with pNMES, the tail beat infrequently but bent to a much greater degree (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Four neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) paradigms do not result in immediate damage to the sarcolemma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental overview.

Prior to evaluating each NMES paradigm, we asked whether the pulse parameters resulted in dramatic immediate damage to the sarcolemma. We did this by asking whether increased Evans blue dye (EBD) was observed in muscle after one session of NMES. EBD was injected into the pericardial space at 2 dpf and allowed to circulate for 4 hr. Then, images of EBD in the zebrafish trunk musculature were taken immediately prior to and after one session of NMES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The relative amount of EBD in muscle was calculated using mean gray values of the EBD channel prior to and after NMES.

We measured three components of muscle nuclei size and shape: volume, surface area, and filament index. Filament index is a measure that quantifies the departure of an object from a circle. A circle has a filament index of 1, and a higher filament index indicates a departure to a more ellipsoidal shape. Thus, a higher filament index indicates that nuclei are more elongated, which is suggested to be healthier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruusgaard et al., 2003</xref>).

Therefore, the downregulation of key cell adhesion proteins following eNMES was puzzling and led us to ask whether muscle cell-matrix adhesion was altered by eNMES. We did this by subjecting zebrafish to a hard stimulation paradigm designed to make muscle fibers detach from their ECM for two back-to-back sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This experiment was conducted 2 days after the final eNMES training session. This 1 min hard stimulation paradigm was defined by a frequency of 4 pulses per second, a delay of 60 ms, a duration of 2 ms, and a voltage of 30 V, which is similar to that known to initiate muscle fiber detachment from their ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Subramanian and Schilling, 2014</xref>). Birefringence images were taken before and after each session. To ensure consistency in imaging, zebrafish were mounted laterally with their left side facing up, and the same imaging parameters were used for each zebrafish across all imaging sessions. We then analyzed the change in mean gray values before stimulation compared to after the first or second session. Nearly half of the control mutants (10/22) had decreased mean gray values after the first session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C4</xref>), and slightly over half (13/22) had decreased mean gray values after the second session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C5</xref>).

There are promising data: NMES improves muscle fiber morphology in dystrophic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dangain and Vrbova, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Luthert et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">VrbovÃ¡ and Ward, 1981</xref>) and chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnard et al., 1986</xref>). In chickens, the benefit was most pronounced if administered prior to rampant muscle degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnard et al., 1986</xref>). Small trials in young children also suggest that early low-frequency NMES can improve voluntary muscle contraction compared with the contralateral leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Scott et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scott et al., 1986</xref>). NMES can also improve muscle function in myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chisari et al., 2013</xref>) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">KilinÃ§ et al., 2015</xref>). Despite these promising studies, NMES is not commonly used as an adjuvant therapy in myopathies and dystrophies. This is potentially due to the impractical approach of chronic NMES for most if not all skeletal muscles. Thus, it is important to elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of beneficial impacts of NMES. It is known that electrical stimulation increases both the number and size of AChR clusters in primary myoblasts. The fact that the expression of Rhapsyn is also increased indicates that the increased AChR clusters are leading to increased mature NMJs. However, clearly more mechanistic studies regarding the effects of NMES on muscular dystrophies are warranted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential mechanisms for improved neuromuscular function</title><p>We found that eNMES increased sarcomere lengths, which could improve force generation by leading to a more optimal interaction between actin and myosin filaments. Nuclear volume, surface area, and filament index were increased with eNMES, suggesting that muscle nuclei are returning to their elongated shape. As nuclear size affects DNA organization, transcriptional and translational processes, and nuclear import and export activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Levy and Heald, 2012</xref>), minor changes in size correlate with reduced muscle function and fiber performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Windner et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, these improvements in muscle nuclei may also mediate improvements in muscle structure and function following eNMES. Time-lapse imaging data support the hypothesis that eNMES is creating an environment that supports regeneration. Following eNMES in <italic>dmd</italic> mutants, there is less degeneration and in those areas with degenerating fibers, newly regenerated fibers appear sooner. RNAseq data largely suggested that the impacts of eNMES are not primarily transcriptional. The RNAseq data did however identify two potential mechanisms that may allow for the above improvements to occur. HO is an antioxidant that has been implicated as a potential therapeutic treatment in both zebrafish and mouse models of <italic>dmd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kawahara et al., 2014</xref>). Hmox1a expression was upregulated in both WT and <italic>dmd</italic> mutants with eNMES. We found that <italic>hmox1a</italic> is necessary for the eNMES-mediated improvement in muscle structure and function in <italic>dmd</italic> mutants.</p><p>The second mechanism includes the potential remodeling of the ECM. The ECM is constantly responding to signals from both within and outside the cell, and incorporating these signals to create a scaffold that supports either regeneration or fibrosis such that the cell is protected from further damage. Our RNAseq data suggest that eNMES may result in ECM remodeling to support regeneration and/or limit fibrosis. One impact of changes in ECM could be increased adhesion of muscle fibers to their ECM. Fiber cross-sectional area is increased in transgenic mice overexpressing Itga7 after eccentric exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lueders et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, muscle damage is exacerbated in Itga7 mutant mice, especially near sites of high mechanical force near the MTJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boppart et al., 2008</xref>). While the complete mechanisms are not known, Itga7 promotes enhanced proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mahmassani et al., 2017</xref>) and increased Sca-1<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup> mesenchymal stem cells. We asked whether Itga7 was required for eNMES-mediated improvement. Itga7 mutant larvae did not improve with eNMES, indicating that Itga7 is required for eNMES-mediated improvement. We did not generate <italic>dmd;itga7</italic> double mutants to test whether eNMES is not effective in this context, which would be interesting to do. Taken together, these data suggest the hypothesis that one mechanism of eNMES improvement is increased adhesion of muscle fibers to their ECM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Summary</title><p>Identifying the basic mechanisms by which activity impacts muscle health in the context of muscle disease is a crucial first step towards identifying potential therapies. Here, we identify an NMES paradigm that improves neuromuscular structure, function, and life span. We show that NMES differently affects gene expression in WT versus <italic>dmd</italic> mutants. This result indicates that it is critical to study the impacts of the activity on diseased muscle in addition to WT muscle. Finally, we show that eNMES acts via Itga7 and HO signaling. Taken together, our data not only establish a model system for neuromuscular plasticity in healthy versus diseased muscle but also clearly elucidate the beneficial effects of NMES.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry and transgenic lines</title><p>Zebrafish embryos were retrieved from natural spawns of adult zebrafish maintained on a 14 hr light/10 hr dark cycle. We used sapje<sup>ta222a</sup> zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bassett et al., 2003</xref>). For live imaging studies, we used transgenic sapje<sup>ta222a</sup> 3MuscleGlow zebrafish expressing mylpfa:lyn-cyan, smych1:GFP, and myog:H2B:RFP (gift from Drs. Sharon Amacher and Jared Talbot; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hromowyk et al., 2020</xref>). Embryos were grown in embryo-rearing media (ERM) with methylene blue at 28.5Â°C. Embryos were manually dechorionated at 1 dpf. Zebrafish were fed once daily beginning at 5 dpf (Larval AP100 Dry Larval Diet [&lt;50 Âµm], Zeigler, PA). For survival studies, zebrafish were housed in 20 mm Petri dishes with 10 mL of system water per dish beginning at 8 dpf. Survival checks were performed in the morning and at night. All protocols conform to the University of Maine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committeeâs Guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental overview</title><p>Experiments were conducted identically so that variables such as treatment duration, disease stage at the time of treatment, and disease stage at the time of evaluation did not change. Zebrafish were followed individually throughout each experiment so that disease progression could be monitored throughout time in longitudinal studies. Experiments began at disease onset. Disease onset for our <italic>sapje</italic> line is at 2 dpf. For the live imaging studies, disease onset in the transgenic <italic>sapje</italic> line is at 3 dpf even though the alleles harboring the mutation are identical. However, this transgenic line was imported from The Ohio State University, while our line has been maintained solely at the University of Maine. Experiments were carried out exactly the same for our <italic>sapje</italic> line and the transgenic line. At disease onset, zebrafish were identified via birefringence as a <italic>dmd</italic> mutant or healthy WT sibling. Healthy WT siblings had myotomes with organized, parallel muscle fibers that appear bright white while <italic>dmd</italic> mutants had myotomes with disorganized and detached muscle fibers that appear gray to black (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bassett et al., 2003</xref>). Larvae were housed in 12-well plates (one fish per well) with 3 mL of ERM per well. Zebrafish were then randomly assigned to control or NMES cohorts for the next 3 days (the treatment period). At the end of this treatment period, zebrafish were allowed to recover for an additional 4 days (recovery period). During the treatment and recovery periods, disease progression was monitored by daily birefringence and swim activity analyses, with a special emphasis on what is occurring at 5 and 8 dpf as these mark the beginning and end of the recovery period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>NMES paradigm</title><p>The first NMES session began at disease onset. The treatment period included one session of NMES at 2, 3, and 4 dpf for a total of three sessions. Following the completion of the third NMES session, zebrafish entered the recovery period from 5 to 8 dpf.</p><p>Zebrafish were subjected to NMES in groups of four using our 3D printed âgymâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The rectangular gym is divided into six rectangular wells that measure 4.7625 mm (length), 1.5875 mm (width), and 1.5875 mm (depth). Two tunnels run parallel to the smaller sides of the rectangular wells and the positive and negative electrodes slide through these tunnels such that they are exposed only in the wells. This allows the delivery of electrical pulses to each zebrafish simultaneously. Prior to the NMES session, zebrafish were transferred to tricaine solution (612 ÂµM in 1Ã ERM) for 4 min. At the end of the 4 min, zebrafish were placed into a well with its head facing the positive electrode and its tail facing the negative electrode. The positive and negative electrodes were attached to a Grass SD9 Stimulator, which was used to generate the electrical pulses. The frequency, delay, and voltage were adjusted for the different paradigms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Each NMES session lasted 1 min. Following each NMES session, zebrafish were removed from the gym and placed back into their respective wells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Birefringence analysis</title><p>Birefringence was used to quantitatively assess the daily progression of dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berger et al., 2012</xref>). Zebrafish were placed in tricaine (612 ÂµM) immediately prior to imaging and then transferred to a 35 mm glass-bottom dish. Birefringence images were taken on a Leica MZ10 F Stereomicroscope with a Zeiss AxioCamMRm or Leica DMC5400 camera attached. An analyzer in a rotatable mount (Leica) was attached to the objective, and the glass-bottom Petri dish was placed on the polarized glass stage. Images were taken at the same time every day within an experiment. Imaging parameters were consistent for all zebrafish and across all days. Mean gray values were calculated using Fiji software as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berger et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the body of the zebrafish was outlined from the 6th to the 25th myotome using the âPolygon selectionsâ tool, and then the mean gray value was measured. Three separate outlines were drawn to obtain three separate measures, and the average was used for calculations. All images were blinded prior to measurements using a Perl script. Mean gray values are presented as a percentage of the average mean gray value of healthy WT siblings in the control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>DanioVision analysis</title><p>The DanioVision system and EthoVision XT 13.0 software (Noldus, VA) were used to conduct high-throughput locomotion tracking studies to better characterize the impact of NMES on zebrafish swim function. A clear 12-well plate was placed into the DanioVision observation chamber. The temperature control unit was set to 28.5Â°C, ensuring that the temperature of the ERM in the well plate was maintained. Zebrafish had a 5 min acclimation period to the observation chamber prior to the beginning of the recording period. Using the EthoVision software, we created a white-light routine that included 5 min in the dark followed by two light-on/off cycles, where the white light was turned on at 100% intensity for 5 min and then turned off for 5 min. The total recording time was 25 min. Recordings were made at the same time each day. For each fish, the average total distance and mean velocity across 1 min intervals were calculated, such that each fish had a total of 25 measurements for total distance and mean velocity. We then focused on swim activity during the three 5 min dark periods, which represent when zebrafish are most active. This analysis provided 15 measurements for each zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Membrane permeability indicated by Evanâs blue dye</title><p>Evanâs blue dye is a membrane-impermeable dye used to assess membrane damage. In <italic>dmd</italic> mutants, EBD is used to assess muscle fiber integrity, and we used EBD to assess fiber integrity pre- and post-NMES using the methods described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith et al., 2015</xref>. EBD (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) was dissolved to 1% w/v in 0.9% saline solution. This EBD stock solution was further diluted to 0.1% then loaded into an injection needle pulled from glass capillary tubes on a Sutter Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller (CA). Zebrafish were placed in tricaine (612 ÂµM) for 4 min. At the end of the 4 min, zebrafish were aligned on a 1% agarose-lined Petri dish in a minimal volume of ERM. The needle was gently inserted into the pericardial space, and EBD was injected using a MPPI-3 pressure injector (ASI, Eugene, OR). Zebrafish were allowed to recover for 4 hr, providing ample time for the dye to circulate the body and enter damaged muscle fibers. Zebrafish were prepared for live imaging as described above for birefringence. An ET DSR fluorescent filter (Leica) was used to visualize EBD. After imaging the initial dye amount in each zebrafish, zebrafish underwent one session of NMES as described above. Immediately after the NMES session, zebrafish were again prepared for live imaging. This allowed us to observe whether NMES caused additional dye entry into the muscle. Imaging parameters remained the same for all zebrafish and imaging sessions. Zebrafish were mounted laterally with the head on the left and dorsal up. To quantify EBD entry, we calculated mean gray values using the same methods described for birefringence except the outline was drawn from the first visible somite to the last visible somite. All images were blinded prior to analysis using a Perl script. Data is presented as the average mean gray value for three separate measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Zebrafish were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 âhr at room temperature. After fixation, embryos were rinsed in PBS-0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-tw; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For visualizing muscle structure, phalloidin was used. Zebrafish were first permeabilized in PBS-2% Triton-X-100 (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 1.5 âhr and then placed in 1:20 phalloidin (Invitrogen, Eugene OR) in PBS-tw for 4 hr on the rocker at room temperature. Zebrafish were rinsed out of phalloidin using PBS-tw and stored in PBS-tw until imaged. For visualizing NMJs, zebrafish were stained with alpha-bungarotoxin and SV2. Zebrafish were first permeabilized in 1 âmg/ml collagenase in 1Ã PBS for 1.5 hr, and then stained with 1:500 alpha-bungarotoxin-647 (Invitrogen) and 1:20 phalloidin in antibody block (5% BSA [Fisher Scientific], 1% DMSO [Sigma-Aldrich], 1% Triton-X-100, 0.2% saponin from quillaja bark [Sigma-Aldrich] in 1Ã PBS) for 2 hr at room temperature. Zebrafish were rinsed using PBS-tw and placed in antibody block overnight at 4Â°C. Zebrafish were then stained with 1:50 SV2 (DSHB, Iowa City, IA) in antibody block for 3 âdays at 4Â°C. Upon removal from SV2, zebrafish were rinsed using PBS-tw and then placed in antibody block for 8 âhr on the rocker at room temperature. This was followed by an overnight incubation in 1:200 GAM (Invitrogen) in antibody block. Zebrafish were then rinsed out of secondary antibody using PBS-tw and stored in PBS-tw until imaged. Phalloidin-488 or -546 and GAM-488 or -546 were used interchangeably with no differences in staining observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Imaging</title><p>Confocal imaging was used to visualize phalloidin and NMJ staining. Fixed and stained zebrafish were deyolked and then mounted in a 24-well glass-bottom plate using 0.5% low-melt agarose (Boston BioProducts, Ashland, MA) in 1Ã PBS. For live confocal time-lapse imaging, zebrafish were anesthetized in tricaine solution (612 ÂµM in 1Ã ERM) for 4 min and then mounted in a 24-well glass-bottom plate or 30 mm glass-bottom Petri dish using 0.5% low-melt agarose in 1Ã ERM (with 612 ÂµM tricaine). Two or three zebrafish were placed in each well. Zebrafish were mounted anterior left and dorsal up to ensure the same side of the fish was imaged each day. Finally, a small amount of tricaine solution (612 ÂµM in 1Ã ERM) was added to prevent the agarose from evaporating and ensure the zebrafish remained anesthetized throughout the imaging session. Upon completion of imaging, zebrafish were gently removed from the agarose using a fine fishing line and returned to their respective wells. All fluorescent images were captured using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope.</p><p>SHG imaging was used as a label-free mechanism to visualize sarcomeres. Fixed zebrafish were deyolked and then mounted in a 30 mm glass-bottom Petri dish using 1.0% low-melt agarose in 1Ã PBS. Once the agarose solidified, the Petri dish was filled with 1Ã PBS. Images were acquired using a custom-built two-photon microscope. This system uses a modified Olympus FV300 system with an upright BX50WI microscope stand and a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire (Coherent Ultra II) laser. Laser power was modulated via an electro-optic modulator. The SHG signals were collected in a non-descanned geometry using a single PMT. Emission wavelengths were separated from excitation wavelengths using a 665 nm dichroic beam splitter followed by a 448/20 nm bandpass filter for SHG signals. Images were acquired using circular polarization with excitation power ranging from 1 to 50 mW and a 40 Ã 0.8 NA water immersion objective with 3Ã optical zoom and scanning speeds of 2.71 s per frame. All images were 512 Ã 512 pixels with a field of view of 85 Âµm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image analysis</title><p>All images were blinded using a Perl script prior to analysis. The percent of myotomes with muscle fiber detachments was calculated manually by counting the number of muscle segments with visibly detached fiber(s). Muscle segments are defined as half myotomes. Additionally, we used machine learning to identify healthy versus unhealthy muscle fibers. For these analyses, we used MATLAB to implement a deep learning approach to segment images of phalloidin-stained fish into healthy muscle, sick muscle, and background. We used the DeepLab v3+ system with an underlying Resnet18 network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). We defined the ground truth dataset manually using LabelBox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labelbox.com/">https://labelbox.com/</ext-link>). Training images and ground truth images were broken down into 256 Ã 256 pixel images for training. The training dataset was divided into 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% test data. Median frequency weighting was used to balance the classes. Each fish was oriented such that the head of the fish would be at the left of the image. Data was augmented to translate the images by 10 pixels vertically and horizontally. Rotation was found to make the network less accurate as the orientation angle of the muscle fibers relative to the body orientation is important to assess their health. The stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer was selected with 0.9 momentum. The maximum number of epochs was 100, and the mini-batch size was 8. In every epoch, the training dataset was shuffled. The number of iterations between evaluations of validation metrics was 315. The patience of validation stopping of network training is set up to 4. The initial learning rate used for training was 0.001. The learning rate was dropped 0.3-fold piecewise during training every 10 epochs. The factor for L2 regularization (weight decay) was 0.005. The training set reached an accuracy of 97%. Images were then segmented by the MATLAB <italic>semanticseg</italic> command, which produced eight-bit unsigned integer segmentations. The fraction of each fish that was determined to be healthy was reported as a fraction of the total muscle. Pixels determined to be background (i.e., not muscle) were excluded from this calculation.</p><p>For NMJ analyses, we used a method previously published by our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2019</xref>). To prepare images for analysis, a custom Fiji macro was written to keep image processing consistent throughout all experiments. First, the raw .lif file was opened in Fiji and the image was split into its respective channels (phalloidin, AChR, and SV2). The phalloidin channel was immediately saved as a .tif file and closed. For the AChR and SV2 channels, duplicate z-stacks were created and a 10-pixel radius Gaussian blur was applied. These blurred images were then subtracted from their original images, respectively. The resulting images were then merged to a single image and a maximum intensity projection was generated. This maximum intensity projection was saved as a .tif file and closed. For each experiment, the maximum intensity projections were combined into a single .tif file using a custom MATLAB script. This combined .tif file was then opened in Fiji and three separate masks, marking the fish body, horizontal myoseptum, and myoseptal innervation, were drawn on the projected images using the Pencil tool. These masks were used to define individual muscle segments, where each muscle segment represents half of a single myotome. Using a custom MATLAB script, skeleton number and skeleton length were calculated for each muscle segment across all zebrafish analyzed.</p><p>Muscle nuclei were analyzed using Fijiâs 3D Objects Counter as well as the Measure tool. To prepare images for analysis, we first reduced background noise by duplicating the z-stack, performing a 10-pixel Gaussian blur on the duplicated image, and subtracting the blurred image from the original image. We then performed a 1-pixel Gaussian blur on the resultant image and set a threshold using âmax entropyâ setting. With this image, we used the Analyze Particles tool to generate masks to use with the 3D Objects Counter tool as well as the Measure tool. The 3D Objects Counter tool provided surface area and volume measurements while the Measure tool provided perimeter, area, and major axis measurements, which were used to calculate filament index.</p><p>To calculate sarcomere lengths, SHG images were first imported into ImageJ, and then, using the Freehand selection tool, two lines were drawn to indicate the outer boundaries (top and bottom) of the muscle fiber being analyzed. The Freehand selections were converted into .txt files and imported into LabVIEW VI. Using LabVIEW, the midline of the two selections (top and bottom) was determined. The midline was then imported back into ImageJ over the original photo such that it was positioned in the center of the sarcomeres. Next, the Plot Profile tool and Peak Finder tool were used to determine the peaks, which correspond to sarcomere length. Since the Peak Finder tool gives the distance in pixels, a conversion factor was used to convert pixels to micrometers based on the objective and optical zoom used. Multiple muscle fibers are analyzed for each zebrafish. We avoided the optical illusion effect of ESH veneers regions when measuring sarcomere lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dempsey et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA extraction and RNAseq</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from whole zebrafish at 7 dpf from replicate samples using the Zymo Direct-zol RNA microprep kit. Each biological replicate consisted of two zebrafish. For WT siblings, there were 4 replicates for the control group and 3 replicates for the eNMES group, and for <italic>dmd</italic> mutants, there were 8 replicates for the control group and 10 replicates for the eNMES group. Prior to performing RNA extractions, zebrafish within the eNMES and control groups were grouped based on their severity at disease onset and the calculated change in their birefringence from 5 dpf to 7 dpf. RNA was kept at â80Â°C until it was shipped to Quick Biology (Pasadena, CA) for sequencing. Following RNA quality control using an Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100 (), polyA+RNAseq libraries were prepared for each sample using the KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Final library quality and quantity were analyzed by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and Life Technologies Qubit3.0 Fluorometer. Each library was sequenced using 150 bp paired-end reads using an Illumina HiSeq4000 (Illumnia Inc, San Diego, CA).</p><p>Analyses of RNAseq reads were completed on the Advanced Computing Group Linux cluster at the University of Maine. To determine the quality of the RNA sequencing reads before further processing, FastQC version 0.11.7 was utilized. Following this quality assessment, reads were concatenated tail-to-head to produce one forward FASTQ file and one reverse FASTQ file for each sample. These FASTQ files were then trimmed of adapter sequences, and low-quality leading and trailing ends were removed using Trimmomatic version 0.36.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>). Trimmed paired-end reads mapped to the Ensembl-annotated zebrafish transcriptome (Ensembl version 95) to generate read counts per gene using RSEM version 1.2.31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) with bowtie version 1.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>).

Genes with fewer than te10 mapped reads across all samples were excluded. For each pairwise comparison of treatment groups, differentially expressed genes were determined using FDR p-value cutoff of 0.1 and requiring at least a 0.6 log<sub>2</sub> fold change (in either direction).

In cases where GOrilla found no enriched terms, PantherDBâs overrepresentation test on Biological Processes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pantherdb.org/">http://pantherdb.org/</ext-link>) was used.

Significance for all tests was set to p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

benefit of electrical stimulation for muscular dystrophy in terms of muscle structure and motor function. The authors take advantage of the zebrafish model system, and a well-characterized zebrafish mutant that models Duchenne muscular dystrophy, to show that certain stimulation paradigms can improve muscle morphology and muscle performance, like via integrin-mediated pathway(s). The potential implications of this research are broad as they begin to address the key question in the MD field about whether and what types of exercise may (or may not) be beneficial to dystrophic muscle.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62760.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Dowling</surname><given-names>James J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04374qe70</institution-id><institution>The Hospital for Sick Children</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inactivity is deleterious and neuromuscular stimulation is beneficial in an animal model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors seek to tackle the question of exercise and inactivity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an important and unsolved issue. They use the zebrafish model system and two paradigms, one an inactivity paradigm (using tricaine) and the other an exercise paradigm using NMES. They find that inactivity worsens the dystrophic phenotype, and that different exercise paradigms impact the dystrophic phenotype differently. Overall this is an important study with exciting data and a potential to impact our understanding of exercise in DMD. However, as described below, all reviewers felt that several critical experimental considerations are necessary to consider in order to substantiate the data claims.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. The inactivity paradigm (e.g. figure 2) using tricaine as a means of inducing inactivity has pluses and minuses. There are issues with comparing it to rodent and human inactivity experiments (which usually involve hindlimb/limb immobilization), as the authors here are using chemical inhibition. Tricaine has systemic effects on multiple tissue types and organ systems including neurological and respiratory systems. I would be careful to call this model an inactivity model. Other appropriate models of inactivity exist, including physically restraining the zebrafish larvae to prevent movement and use of chemicals like BTS. In sum, the authors need to rule out if the consequences of tricaine administration is due to inactivity or pulmonary/secondary dystrophic pathology issues (e.g. swim bladder or respiration), and also consider a second &quot;inactivity&quot; paradigm in order to validate that the findings are due to inactivity.</p><p>2. NMJ changes are hypothesized as an explanation for the response to NMES paradigms. Can/have the authors evaluated the functional output of the NMJ in the NMES-treated DMD zebrafish? Were any electrophysiological measurements performed on the NMES treated DMD fish, independent of any therapeutic experimental protocol?</p><p>3. Hmox1 overexpression has been pursued as a strategy for DMD in mice by the Zoltan Arany and Joseph Dulak's groups, so the findings in figure 10 are supported. Have the authors evaluated whether or not the entire Hmox1 pathway was affected in the NMES-treated DMD fish?</p><p>4. For data presented in figure 1: authors describe the birefringence phenotype in mild mutants as increased degeneration for three days and then increased regeneration. Could they provide any experimental evidence of &quot;muscle regeneration&quot; mentioned in this statement?. Similarly, they mention severe dmd mutant regenerated throughout this study, however, no experimental data is provided to support this statement. As myotome contains both normal and degenerating myofibers, could improvement in birefringence be a consequence of the growth of those normal myofibers vs regeneration of sick myofibers? The term regeneration has also been used later in NEMS studies and needs to be supplemented with the experimental evidence of regeneration. In sum, there needs to be experimental support for the supposition of regeneration throughout the manuscript, as well as more careful consideration of rates of degeneration and regeneration.</p><p>5. There were several concerns with the transcriptomic data. More information related to the comparison of WT vs untreated sap is necessary for the interpretation of the changes seen with NMES. Also, the authors see very few consistent changes in terms of genes regulated one way in untreated sap and the other with treatment. It appears in fact that an overarching conclusion is that the transcriptional changes are NOT a driving force of the response to NMES. There is concern about the interpretability of taking one or two changed genes, as most transcriptional programs do not function in this isolated manner. For example, what is the true meaning of a change in b1 integrin without any changes in a integrin levels. In other words, how is this finding really of biological significance? In addition, the authors propose ECM changes as a potential mechanism. This should be supported by evaluation of ECM proteins (by western or immunostaining for example).</p><p>6. The authors clearly demonstrate that the phenotype is variable. However, they do not carry this variability forward to all of their inactivity and exercise studies. Several of those studies feature relatively low n numbers. How have the authors ensured that the differences seen are not, in fact, due to the natural variability of the dmd phenotype in zebrafish? In particular, this seems like it would be an issue for all studies with n sizes less than 20, particularly given that the magnitude of difference for many of the studies is small.</p><p>7. DMD is caused by damage in sarcolemma and subsequent myofiber detachment. The authors didn't observe any effect on myofiber structure but still found reduced velocity in mutants that were subjected to intermittent inactivity. Could this be due to a slight increase in sarcolemma damage (not examined here) and/or changes in the calcium in muscle fibers? Similarly, what are the effects of extended inactivity on MTJ structure? While authors make good observations with their animal model (as also seen in human and other animal models previously), mechanistic details underlying these changes are lacking.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Beneficial impacts of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on muscle structure and function in the zebrafish model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They present data showing failure of itga7 mutants to respond to NMES. While this provides evidence that itga7 is potentially involved in mediated response in WT fish, it does not inform on the situation with dmd. The ideal experiment would of course be to test NMES in the setting of itag7/dmd double knockouts. At the very least, the fact that this link is not firmly established in the dmd model needs to be pointed out.</p><p>(3) The authors also implicate TGFb signalling based on RNAseq data.

Such assays would lend support to the RNAseq data, which on its own its relatively weak proof of the involvement of the ECM and TGFb.</p><p>Additional specific reviewer comments can be found below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I appreciate the authors for taking several of my considerations and concerns in the newly incorporated revised manuscript.

Does NMES result in formation of new myofibers or improves the attachment of existing myofibers? Are similar gene/pathways responsible for both?</p><p>2. Did authors look at the swimming behavior of fish during earlier time points (after NMES). Could a reduction in muscle degeneration could be due to low activity of fish during earlier time points following NMES treatment?</p><p>3. Figure 7D: Could differences observed in control dmd mutant and NMES treated mutant be due to variability in the initial damage (multiple somites in the control Vs isolated somites in NMES treated).

Does hmox1a transcript expression correlate with the protein expression? Similarly, were changes were observed at the protein level for ECM genes identified by RNA-seq?</p><p>5. Failure of muscle improvement by eNMES in ITGA7 mutants may not mean that improvement in muscle structure in dmd mutant is through ITGA7. DMD mutant control muscle do have some expression of ITGA7 (Fontelonga et al., 2019 HMG) unlike ITGA7 null fish and therefore, failure of ITGA7 null fish to show improvement in NMES assay could be independent of DMD.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62760.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Indeed, the fact that tricaine does not paralyze muscle is advantageous to us given that we immobilize larvae in tricaine during electrostimulation.

We hope that the reviewers appreciate our approach to broadening the discussion. The added text :</p><p>âElectrical stimulation has been shown to be generally safe and potentially effective for some conditions. For example, there are potential therapeutic benefits of NMES for treatment of spinal cord injuries. Although not all trials observe an increase in voluntary muscle strength with NMES, none found deleterious effects of NMES (de Freitas et al., 2018). NMES can also improve dysphagia after stroke: ten out of 11 trials showed that NMES improved swallowing with only one showing no effect (Alamer et al., 2020). NMES combats disuse atrophy in multiple contexts. Chronic NMES applied to mice who were anesthetized for 2.5 weeks not only showed increased muscle mass in the stimulated limb, but also had improved insulin sensitivity (Lotri-Koffi et al., 2019). NMES for at least seven days is sufficient to improve muscle mass of lower limbs in non-ambulatory patients with traumatic brain injury (Silva et al., 2019). NMES is even being studied as a means to combat muscle atrophy during spaceflight (Maffiuletti et al., 2019). The above data show that NMES has potential benefits for sudden muscle disuse caused by external events, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms are not well understood.</p><p>NMES also shows promise for neurodegenerative disorders and aging muscle. Muscle mass and strength are improved in aged rats with NMES and NMES improves muscle mass and balance in older adults as well as older adults with dementia (Dow et al., 2005; Kern et al., 2014; Nishikawa et al., 2021). NMES improves mobility in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (Wahls et al., 2010). NMES may also improve mobility and strength in ALS (Handa et al., 1995), although intensity may be important (The ALSUntangled Group, 2017). Far less is known about NMES in the context of muscular dystrophies. The concept of super-imposing electrical stimulation to improve dystrophic muscle was proposed by the neurologist who first described DMD over a hundred years ago (Duchenne, GB, 1870). Despite the longevity of this hypothesis, it has not been sufficiently tested as a therapy for DMD. There are promising data: NMES improves muscle fiber morphology in dystrophic mice (Dangain and Vrbova, 1989; Luthert et al., 1980; VrbovÃ¡ and Ward, 1981) and chickens (Barnard et al., 1986). In chickens the benefit was most pronounced if administered prior to rampant muscle degeneration (Barnard et al., 1986). Small trials in young children also suggest that early low frequency NMES can improve voluntary muscle contraction compared with the contralateral leg (Scott et al., 1990, 1986). NMES can also improve muscle function in myotonic dystrophy (Chisari et al., 2013) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy (KÄ±lÄ±nÃ§ et al., 2015). Despite these promising studies, NMES is not commonly used as an adjuvant therapy in myopathies and dystrophies. This is potentially due to the impractical approach of chronic NMES for most if not all skeletal muscles. Thus, it is important to elucidate underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of beneficial impacts of NMES. It is known that electrical stimulation increases both the number and size of AChR clusters in primary myoblasts. The fact that expression of Rhapsyn is also increased indicates that the increased AChR clusters are leading to increased mature NMJs. However, clearly more mechanistic studies regarding the effects of NMES on muscular dystrophies are warranted.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors suggest that NMES may be working through modification of ECM-cell adhesion.

We have not yet generated double mutants, mostly because data from Szatl et al., 2012 (Epistatic dissection of laminin-receptor interactions) strongly suggests that itga7;dmd double mutants would be so disrupted that it would be impossible to interpret results (The Currie group generated dmd;integrin linked kinase double mutants and showed severe disruption).</p><p>We have added the following sentences:</p><p>â To the Results section: âThus, Itga7 is required for eNMES-mediated improvement of muscle structure, at least in the context of itga7 mutantsâ.</p><p>â To the Discussion section âItga7 mutant larvae did not improve with eNMES, indicating that Itga7 is required for eNMES-mediated improvement.

This is why we conducted the cell adhesion experiments shown in Figure 9, which suggest that cell adhesion is increased with eNMES.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that using an assay for TGFb signaling at the protein level would be more informative. We thus stained control and eNMES wild-type and control and eNMES mutants for p-Smad. Please note that this has not previously been done in older fish. We did the experiment twice and imaged 68 embryos at at least three locations â anterior, middle, and posterior at 5, 6, and 7 days old. Unfortunately, the only conclusion that we can make from these data is that we canât conclude anything. p-Smad staining is incredibly variable in zebrafish skeletal muscle at 5,6,7 days (this has not previously been investigated). As an example I put one panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) that highlights just a couple of the muscle fibers with p-Smad positive nuclei in a wild-type embryo at 7 days (yellow arrows point to positive nuclei), as well as quantification of the data at 5 days â clearly showing dramatic variability. We suspect that TGFb signaling at this time point is dynamic, and thus capturing consistent changes in p-Smad readout in fixed larvae is impossible.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62760-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Developing tools and image quantification methods for live readouts of TGFb signaling is an interesting future direction but out of the scope of this manuscript.
