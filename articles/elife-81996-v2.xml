their action in the brown adipose tissue (BAT). However, T3 acts in many other peripheral and central tissues which are also involved in energy expenditure. The general picture of how T3 regulates BAT thermogenesis is currently not fully established, notably due to the absence of extensive omics analyses and the lack of specific mice model. Here, we first used transcriptome and cistrome analyses to establish the list of T3/TR direct target genes in brown adipocytes. We then developed a novel model of transgenic mice, in which T3 signaling is specifically suppressed in brown adipocytes at adult stage. We addressed the capacity of these mice to mount a thermogenic response when challenged by either a cold exposure or a high-fat diet, and analyzed the associated changes in BAT transcriptome. We conclude that T3 plays a crucial role in the thermogenic response of the BAT, controlling the expression of genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and regulating BAT proliferation. The resulting picture provides an unprecedented view on the pathways by which T3 activates energy expenditure through an efficient adaptive thermogenesis in the BAT.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>brown adipose tissue</kwd><kwd>energy expenditure</kwd><kwd>thermogenesis</kwd><kwd>sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>European Union's Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>825753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flamant</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>T3 regulates BAT thermogenesis by controlling the expression of genes involved in the management of metabolic fuels as well as tissue plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has the ability to dissipate energy through thermogenesis in response to cold and high-fat diet (HFD), to prevent hypothermia and limit body weight gain, respectively. In response to these stressors, sympathetic nerves stimulate brown adipocytes’ adrenergic receptors to trigger the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tabuchi and Sul, 2021</xref>), favoring local lipolysis and glycolysis to fuel an increase in energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hankir and Klingenspor, 2018</xref>). This is used by the BAT-specific protein UCP1 to favor thermogenesis at the expense of ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fenzl and Kiefer, 2014</xref>). In the long run, this causes an increase in lipogenesis to refill local lipid stocks, mitochondrial biogenesis, and a proliferation of brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fonseca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uldry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukano et al., 2016</xref>). These actions are coordinated by transcription factors, notably involving the coactivator PGC1⍺ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, cold exposure induces an indispensable increase expression and activity of the type 2 deiodinase activity (DIO2) resulting in an intracellular conversion of the inactive form of thyroid hormone, thyroxine or T4, into its active form, 3,3′,5-triiodo-<sc>L</sc>-thyronine or T3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fonseca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva and Larsen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco and Silva, 1987</xref>).</p><p>T3 exerts a large influence on energy expenditure, as hypothyroidism is associated with cold sensitivity and weight gain, while hyperthyroid patients display the opposite phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco and Silva, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolf et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Leo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maushart et al., 2019</xref>). T3 binds to the broadly expressed thyroid hormone nuclear receptors, TRα1 and TRβ1/2 (collectively called TR) encoded by the <italic>Thra</italic> and <italic>Thrb</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minakhina et al., 2020</xref>). Majority of TR bind to specific response elements resembling the archetypical DR4 consensus sequence (5′AGGTCAnnnnRGGnCA3′) to repress expression of neighboring genes. Upon T3 binding, TR results in a rapid activation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flamant, 2016</xref>).</p><p>T3 concentration drastic increase in BAT during cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianco and Silva, 1988</xref>) is crucial, as DIO2<italic>KO</italic> mice have impaired BAT thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneider et al., 2001</xref>). This was notably explained by the ability of T3 to regulate essential thermogenic processes in the BAT-like <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianco et al., 1988</xref>) and fatty acids oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fonseca et al., 2014</xref>). However, the involvement of T3 in energy metabolism is not restricted to brown adipocytes, as it directly increases hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ritter et al., 2020</xref>), and favors exercise-associated thermogenesis in the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicolaisen et al., 2020</xref>). It also triggers white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, a process in which heat-producing ‘beige’ adipocytes expressing <italic>Ucp1</italic> emerge in the WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martínez-Sánchez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Medina-Gomez et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, T3 stimulates indirectly BAT thermogenesis by acting in the hypothalamic ventro-medial nuclei where it triggers the sympathetic outflow to BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Thus, T3 exerts a broad influence on different tissues to regulate energy expenditure, making the relative importance of BAT thermogenesis in T3-dependent energy expenditure unclear. Moreover, T3 action directly in the BAT has not been exhaustively described as (1) no transcriptomic and cistromic analyses have been led to obtain T3/TR target genes in this tissue and (2) T3 also indirectly controls the BAT through the brain, making the role of local T3 difficult to pinpoint. Here, we aimed at distinguishing these two levels and focus on the T3 cell-autonomous (i.e., local) function in brown adipocytes, and address its importance in adaptive thermogenesis. To address this aim, we combined genomic analysis and the phenotyping of mice with selective blockade of T3 signaling in brown adipocytes. The resulting picture provides an unprecedented view on the pathways by which T3 activates energy expenditure through an efficient adaptive thermogenesis in the BAT.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BATKO mice present a BAT-specific deletion of T3 signaling</title><p>The blockade of T3 signaling specifically in brown adipocytes in adults has been achieved using the <italic>Ucp1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenwald et al., 2013</xref>).

TRα1<sup>L400R</sup> prevents the recruitment of coactivators and is thus condemned to constitutively repress T3 target genes expression.

It revealed that a large number of genes were regulated (1946 upregulated, 1744 downregulated) in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We observed that 49% of genes induced by T3 after 3 hr possess a TRBS within 30 kb of their TSS. This ratio fell below 10% for T3-repressed genes and for genes which expression was insensitive to T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This suggests that downregulation of gene expression is not directly exerted by T3-bound TR, but is an indirect consequence of the TH treatment, either cell autonomous or resulting from sympathetic stimulation. Given these considerations, the rest of the study was restricted to positively regulated genes.</p><p>We then crossed the RNAseq and the ChIPseq datasets to obtain a curated list of 639 putative TR direct target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), whose expression was most likely under the direct control of T3/TR signaling. As expected, this set of genes included two emblematic TR target genes: <italic>Ucp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martinez de Mena et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>Hr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engelhard and Christiano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Heatmap representation showed that TR direct target genes previously found to be upregulated after 24 hr of TH treatment in wild-type mice were not responsive in BATKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Transcriptome results were confirmed by RT-qPCR for some of the identified TR direct targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). We hypothesized that the residual response to T3 of BAT in BATKO mice might result either from the stimulation of brown adipocytes by the sympathetic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López et al., 2010</xref>) or from the T3 response of BAT cells which do not express <italic>Ucp1</italic>, like endothelial or immune cells. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we chemically destroyed BAT noradrenergic terminals of wild-type PTU-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>), treated or not afterwards with TH. T3-induced expression of target genes was mostly similar between sham and denervated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), indicating that, for the genes that we tested, the sympathetic stimulation was not involved.</p><p>According to gene ontology analysis, TR direct target genes were directly involved in the ‘regulation of cold-induced thermogenesis’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), including <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Ppargc1a</italic>, two fundamental actors of this process. Interestingly, <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> encodes for PGC1⍺, a co-activator of TR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>). Using a published list of PGC1⍺-binding sites (GSE110053) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2018</xref>), we found that around 33% of TR direct target genes showed a co-localization of TR and PGC1⍺-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), including genes involved in lipid metabolism as well as <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Ucp3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). In addition, many of TR direct target genes we identified were involved in mitochondrial transport, respiratory chain, catabolism, and biogenesis of lipids, as well as genes involved in the glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Finally, we also found genes involved in proliferation, a process of BAT mid-term adaptation to physiological stressors like cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukano et al., 2016</xref>). In summary, TR direct target genes belong to several biological processes, many of them being directly connected to BAT thermogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Altered response of BATKO mice to temperatures below thermoneutrality</title><p>Based on the roles of TR target genes identified above, we predicted that BATKO mice would display alterations in BAT thermogenesis.

HFD feeding was then conducted at thermoneutrality, eliminating the need to activate alternate mechanisms to defend body temperature. In this condition, the opposite result was observed, BATKO mice being more sensitive to diet-induced obesity than CTRL mice with similar food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Collectively, these results point out that BATKO mice suffer from a reduced efficiency of BAT adaptive thermogenesis both in condition of cold exposure and excess of calories.

However, neither the exhaustive list of TR direct target genes in BAT, nor the contribution of BAT in T3-mediated regulation of energy expenditure have been elucidated so far. Here, we present an unprecedented in-depth analysis of T3 direct influence on gene expression in brown adipocytes and developed a transgenic mice model with a brown-adipocyte-specific suppression of T3 signaling. To our knowledge, this model is currently the only one allowing a suppression of T3 signaling specifically in brown adipocytes at adult stages. This is a significant step forward as it allows (1) to dissect the contribution of BAT in the T3-mediated increased in energy expenditure, (2) to distinguish the hypothalamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López et al., 2010</xref>) versus local control of BAT thermogenesis, and (3) to bypass any developmental alteration mediated by the early lack of T3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). Collectively, this new model showed that T3 signaling was pivotal for BAT adaptive thermogenesis, regulating the management of thermogenic fuels as well as the plasticity of the tissue.</p><p>Combined with transcriptome analyses, the genome-wide study of TRα1 chromatin binding allowed us to identify 639 genes whose transcription is most likely controlled by liganded TR in brown adipocytes. This set of genes only partially overlaps with the ones described in other cell types, probably as a result of differential chromatin occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatonnet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirose et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richard et al., 2020</xref>) and the presence of cell-specific transcription cofactors. One of these cell-specific cofactors is PGC1α (encoded by <italic>Ppargc1a</italic>) which we found here to be a TR direct target gene. As PGC1α is a transcriptional coactivator of TR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>), it confirms previous hypothesis that TR and PGC1α are involved in an auto-regulatory feed-forward loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wulf et al., 2008</xref>). In line with this, we found that 33% of the TRBS in brown adipocytes are also occupied by PGC1α, notably for genes involved in lipid metabolism or directly involved in thermogenesis, like <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Ucp3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silvestri et al., 2020</xref>). PGC1α is thus likely to play a pivotal role in the T3-dependent regulation of energy metabolism in brown adipocytes. As PGC1α is also a coactivator of several other nuclear receptors, notably PPARγ and ERRα, its overexpression might generate a cross-talk with other signaling pathways.</p><p>One of the main challenges of our study was to make a distinction between a local influence of T3 and an indirect consequence, resulting from the hypothalamic response to T3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López et al., 2010</xref>). The BAT response to T3 is largely lost in BATKO mice and conserved in denervated mice, suggesting that the changes in gene expression observed in BAT mainly reflect the cell-autonomous response initiated by TR in brown adipocytes and not the effect of T3 mediated by the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López et al., 2010</xref>). Residual responses to T3 in BATKO may reflect the sensitivity of other cells types present in the BAT which do not express the <italic>Ucp1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> transgene or an incomplete effect mediated by tamoxifen. Otherwise, they could be secondary to a modification of circulating peptides caused by the T3 treatment on other organs. For instance, <italic>Fgf21</italic> expression is induced by T3 in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) and the resulting secreted peptide has been shown to promote BAT thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sáenz de Urturi et al., 2022</xref>). We found indication for a reciprocal influence as several TR direct target genes in brown adipocytes encode secreted factors and adipokines (<italic>Apln</italic>, <italic>Fdcn5</italic>, and <italic>Bmp8b</italic>), that are able to act in other organs. This suggests that T3 can influence a complex network of cross-talks in the organism.</p><p>T3 signaling in BAT is triggered in CTRL mice during cold exposure as it was previously shown by the activation of type 2 deiodinase activity in similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Jesus et al., 2001</xref>). This activation of T3 signaling represents a significant fraction of the cold response, since 17% of the gene regulations induced in the BAT by cold exposure in CTRL mice are lost in BATKO mice. We showed that T3 signaling in the BAT controls the expression of genes crucial for both lactate metabolism (<italic>Ldha</italic>) or glycolysis (<italic>Hk1</italic>, <italic>Aldoa</italic>, <italic>Pkm</italic>, and <italic>Pfkl</italic>), two pathways essential for BAT thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>). T3 also controls genes involved in lipid metabolism, which is also congruent with previous observations revealing that T3 signaling is required for efficient lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christoffolete et al., 2004</xref>) and lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oppenheimer et al., 1991</xref>). Here, we bring a broader picture by identifying all the genes which expression is regulated by T3 for these processes.</p><p>Interestingly, we showed that <italic>Ppargc1a</italic> was among impacted genes. As it coactivates other nuclear receptors, we can imagine that part of the genes dysregulated in BATKO mice can be attributed to other signaling pathways downstream of PGC1α. On the other hand, we observed that other classical thermogenic markers were not the most obviously affected in BATKO mice. Indeed, <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Dio2</italic> could not be detected as differentially expressed by our stringent whole-transcriptome approach but only by targeted expression assessment. Among TR-dependent cold-induced genes, we rather detected <italic>Alpl</italic>, a phosphatase required in brown adipocytes for UCP1-independent thermogenesis derived from futile creatine cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, T3 signaling in BAT coordinates the expression of genes involved in both UCP1-dependent and UCP1-independent thermogenesis. Finally, we showed that T3 signaling in brown adipocytes controls cell proliferation both during cold exposure and upon hyperthyroidism. This concurs with a recent study showing that T3 promotes BAT proliferation in adult mice in a cell-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Also, the link between TR target genes and the cell cycle remains uncertain. The direct activation of <italic>Ccnd1</italic>, encoding cyclin D1, provides a hypothetical link between T3 and proliferation. This intertwining might also occurs through the regulation of cell cycle gene regulators, as already demonstrated for CREB and AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pascual and Aranda, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Thus, inefficient handling of metabolic fuels, reduction of the tissue plasticity, and defect in thermogenic biochemical pathways can explain the apparent default in BAT thermogenesis. This can be compensated by an increased energy consumption which could explain why BATKO mice gained less weight than CTRL mice at room temperature, which represents a mild cold challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Škop et al., 2020</xref>). This extra-energy consumption might favor the onset of other thermogenic mechanisms, as observed with the exacerbated WAT browning. However, WAT browning’s ability to consume a significant amount of energy has recently been called into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challa et al., 2020</xref>). Although we failed to measure a striking difference in BATKO mouse oxygen consumption at room temperature over a 48-hr period, a minor increase in the respiratory quotient might have long-term consequences. At thermoneutrality, where no compensatory mechanisms are required to maintain body temperature, BATKO mice became hypersensitive to diet-induced obesity. This reflected the alteration of diet-induced BAT thermogenesis and the inability of this tissue to optimally use metabolic substrates and thus expend energy. A similar phenotype was previously observed for other mouse models deficient for BAT thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castillo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In humans, BAT has triggered a lot of interest for its ability to increase energy expenditure, which could be used in the fight against obesity. Interestingly, T3 levels also correlate with BAT activity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bredella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lahesmaa et al., 2014</xref>). Hyperthyroid patients have higher glucose uptake in BAT, and this effect is neutralized after treatment to restore the euthyroid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lahesmaa et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, T3 also plays a role in human BAT thermogenesis. Whether the mechanisms regulated by T3 in human BAT are the same as described here in mice is an open question. While T3 cannot be used per se to increase energy expenditure in humans due to cardiac side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biondi et al., 1993</xref>), its hybridization to other molecules could allow to target it selectively to BAT, as already done for liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we used a combination of both omics data and BAT-specific TR-signaling alteration in mice to introduce an unprecedented view of T3 cell-autonomous response in brown adipocytes. We showed that T3 signaling in BAT controls both key metabolic pathways and tissue plasticity that are essential for adaptive thermogenesis. These results represent a valuable database that pave the way for further metabolic studies to detail the molecular implications of T3 signaling during BAT adaptive thermogenesis. Finally, as T3 acts in many other tissues, a similar approach could be used to put together the puzzle of T3 influence in energy expenditure.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>One of the objectives of this study was to define a catalog of TR direct target genes in brown adipocytes, based on a combination of RNAseq and ChIPseq. Both TRα and TRβ are present in the BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minakhina et al., 2020</xref>) but we only performed the TRα1 ChIPseq due to the absence of adequate tools for the TRβ ChIPseq. The cistromes of the two receptors might not fully overlap, and we might have missed a fraction of the TRBS on the genes of interest. However, this limitation should be tempered since previous data have indicated that TRβ-selective binding site are infrequent in the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatonnet et al., 2013</xref>). Another limitation is that we assigned genes to a given TRBS by considering only its distance to the transcription starting site. Chromatin 3D organization and insulation are well known to influence the interactions between distant regulatory elements, and the linear distance is only partially informative. The additional genomic investigations required to overcome these limitations remain for the moment hardly feasible in mouse tissues. Finally, we did not look at protein changes while post-translational events could occur.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Despite the persistence of one intact <italic>Thra</italic> allele in <italic>Thra</italic><sup>AMI/+</sup> mice after Cre-recombinase action, the dominant-negative action of TRα1<sup>L400R</sup> eliminates the capacity of cells to respond to T3. <italic>Thrb<sup>lox</sup></italic> has 2 tandem-arranged loxP sequences, allowing Cre-mediated excision of exon 3 of the <italic>Thrb</italic> gene, which encodes the DNA-binding domain of the TRβ1/TRβ2 receptor, resulting in a frameshift and a loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Winter et al., 2009</xref>). In the present study, we used mice of the <italic>Ucp1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> line, in which CreERT2 expression is under the control of the <italic>Ucp1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenwald et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of physiological stressors, <italic>Ucp1</italic> is specifically expressed in brown adipocytes, thus restricting Cre-mediated recombination to this cell type.

Genetically modified mice were generated in our own animal facility, whereas wild-type C57BL6/J mice were ordered from a commercial supplier (Charles River). Mice were fed ad libitum with LASQC Rod16 R diet (Altromin, Germany) and housed under recommended conditions (notably, at room temperature, i.e., 23°C). Hypothyroidism in adult animals was induced as previously described, with 14 days of treatment with a propylthiouracil (PTU)-containing diet (Harlan Teklad TD95125, Madison, WI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weiss et al., 1998</xref>).

T3, the active compound, was not injected alone to get close to hyperthyroid conditions met in vivo.</p><p>Before assessment of cold response, mice were housed for 10 days at 30°C (with normal 12 hr light/dark cycles) and subcutaneously implanted with IPTT-300 transponders (Plexx BV, Netherlands). The mice were then housed in pairs without enrichment and placed at 4°C during the indicated period. Infrared thermography was performed on awake mice after 48 hr of cold exposure, using an infrared camera (FLiR Systems, Inc). For cell proliferation assessment, EdU (Thermo Fisher) was intraperitoneally injected twice (100 mg/kg, after 24 and 48 hr of cold exposure) and mice were killed after 72 hr of cold exposure. This allowed to stain proliferative cells over the last 48 hr of cold exposure.</p><p>At the end of experiments, mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (25 mg/kg) and ketamine (130 mg/kg) mixture.

The effects of sympathetic denervation were compared to those obtained after vehicle injection (0.15 mol/l NaCl and 1% ascorbic acid, sham mice). Briefly, the two lobes of interscapular BAT were exposed through a midline skin incision along the upper dorsal surface and gently separated from the skin with surgical forceps. Then, injections of 6-OHDA (Sigma-Aldrich) were performed directly into each lobe of the interscapular BAT. For each lobe, 10 µl (10 mg/ml) was injected in several times (10 injections of 1 µl) using a Hamilton syringe (i.e., 20 µl/mice). The skin incision was then closed with several surgical stitches.

Data were scaled independently for each gene, with the same color code for all genes (red: above mean, white: mean, blue: below mean).</p><p>Gene ontology analyses were made using the Gene Ontology Resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org">http://geneontology.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>ChIPseq and analysis</title><p>Freshly dissected small pieces of BAT were incubated during 25 min at room temperature under agitation with a crosslink solution (250 mM disuccinimidyl glutarate, 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid). Then, 1% formaldehyde was added for 20 min followed by 50 mM glycine addition. The tissue was rinsed several times with cold PBS. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was then performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chatonnet et al., 2013</xref>). Sequencing libraries were prepared from the immunoprecipitated fraction and the input fraction as a control, using the Accel-NGS 2S Plus DNA library kits with single indexing (Swift Biosciences). They were analyzed on a Nextseq 500 sequencer (Illumina). Raw data of paired-end sequencing were aligned on the GRCm38 (mm10) reference genome using Bowtie (Galaxy Version 2.2.6.2). MACS2 (Galaxy Version 2.1.1.20160309.0) was used for peak calling and peaks with a score inferior to 60 were filtered out. De novo motif search was performed using SeqPos motif tool (version 1.0.0). Genes within 30 kb of peaks were called out using GREAT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://great.stanford.edu/public/html/">http://great.stanford.edu/public/html/</ext-link>). We chose a distance of 30 kb upstream or downstream of the TSS to attribute a TRBS to a gene. Although arbitrary, this distance was found to maximize the ratio of T3-responsive genes among the included genes, without excluding genes which have been well characterized as TRα1 target genes in other neural systems, such as <italic>Klf9</italic> or <italic>Hr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gil-Ibañez et al., 2013</xref>). The distribution of distances of TRBSs around TSSs, as well as the distribution of TRBSs in the genome, were assessed using PAVIS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://manticore.niehs.nih.gov/pavis2/">https://manticore.niehs.nih.gov/pavis2/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data shown represent the average values for animals with the same genotype that were given the same treatment. The number of animals used in each experiment (<italic>n</italic>) is indicated in figure legends. Except when anything else is mentioned, the error bars represent the standard deviation. For comparing two means, the statistical relevance was determined using an unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. For determining the effects of the mutations on food consumption, body temperature, body weight overtime, we used a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with time as one factor, and the other parameter as the second factor. For comparing the different levels of one factor to a control group, the statistical relevance was determined using the one-way ANOVA method. When this test showed significant differences (p value &lt;0.05), a post hoc Tukey test was used for multiple comparisons. To assess the effects of the mutations or the denervation on a given treatment (2 factors with 2 levels each), the statistical relevance was determined using a two-way ANOVA. Only when the interaction term was significant (interaction p value &lt;0.05), a post hoc Tukey test was used to compare the effects of the indicated combinations. For any of these tests, statistical relevance is shown in the graphs as follows: *p value &lt;0.05, **p value &lt;0.01, ***p value &lt;0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were carried out in accordance with the European Community Council Directive of September 22, 2010 (2010/63/EU) regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.

It is true that many important aspects and progresses that differentiate our study from others were not sufficiently highlighted. We added a section about this at the beginning of the ‘discussion’ section, and we think that it considerably reinforces the outcome of our work (see lines 247-250).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The historical context should be revised. The introduction should say that 3 decades ago D2-generated T3 in BAT was shown to transcriptionally accelerate the transcription of UCP1 gene (PMID: 3192531).

Thus, the idea that it is not known how T3 stimulates BAT thermogenesis needs revision. Yes, there are other genes as shown here but UCP1 is the key to BAT thermogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry if we omitted to consider the historical context appropriately and the suggested articles are now referenced. Yet, we want to be careful: UCP1 is indeed key to BAT thermogenesis. However, these observations are mostly based on UCP1-KO animals that present altered mitochondrial function (Kazak et al., 2017, PNAS). In the absence of functional mitochondria, any UCP1-independent mechanism involving mitochondria would not be altered. The phenotype of UCP1-KO mice is thus not directly related to UCP1 metabolic function, but rather reflect a developmental alteration of BAT. Other authors have highlighted UCP1-independent mechanisms, like creatine futile cycle, which inhibition decreases brown adipocytes thermogenesis and energy expenditure even in presence of UCP1 (Rahbani et al., 2021, Nature). The current trend is to consider that UCP1-independent mechanisms also bring a significant contribution to thermogenesis.</p><p>Based on the reviewer recommendation, we modified the introduction to remind the known link between T3, UCP1 and BAT thermogenesis (lines 76-78) but that a full description of the T3 function in BAT based on transcriptomic data and appropriate animal models was missing (see line 86-88).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I find it interesting that the two most important genes identified were UCP1 and PGC1a. Both genes are also stimulated by T3 during BAT development. How do the authors interpret this?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. UCP1 and PGC1a are up-regulated early in life in BAT as a result of local T4 deiodination (Hal et all, 2010, Endocrinology). T3 might be link to the post-natal BAT expansion (Negron et al., Sci Rep 2020) and thus also promote adipocytes proliferation in both juveniles and adults. At adult stages, the chromatin environment may be similar and T3 is most likely to regulate an overlapping set of genes. This is something that we recently observed in a compilation of thyroid hormone target genes in several mice tissues: a huge majority of genes upregulated by T3 in the striatum at P15 is also upregulated at adult stages (Zekri et al., 2022, IJMS).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As noted this study provides significant new information on TH signaling in brown adipocytes and the physiologic relevance thereof.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1. It is not clear or I missed it. What age was TH signaling knocked out in mice? It mentions mice between 2-5 months old. Were there age-related differences??</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, TH signaling was knocked-out in 2-5 months old mice. As we combined 3 different transgenes with different levels of zygosity, we had small cohorts and it was tricky to obtain mice within the same age at the same time. Importantly, this heterogeneity occurred both in CTRL and BATKO groups, allowing to neutralize age-related interferences. We completely agree that this is an important issue. Based on your remark, we compared the transcriptome of mice according to their age. In this new analysis, we split animals in two groups according to their age: the youngest and the oldest (independently of the treatment). DESeq2 analysis evidenced that 9 genes were differentially expressed between these two groups, but none of them were genes that we sorted out as interesting in our publication. This evidences that our results are not contaminated by the ‘age’ factor. But you were completely right, this is something that we should have checked before and this is now something we will systematically check on RNAseq data. Thank you very much for this constructive remark.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Would the expected phenotype differ between mice that expressed the dominant negative α allele and the BATKO presented? It is surprising that the authors did not look at specific β deletion alone. No ER CRE alone control with tamoxifen is shown. Was it tested?</p></disp-quote><p>You are right, due to our model combining knock-in for TRα and knock-out for TRβ, we cannot distinguish which effects are TRα or TRβ-dependent. Despite not being the focus of our study, this is a really interesting question. We have not questioned the effects of TRα<sup>AMI</sup> alone as it presents dominant-negative effects towards TRβ. However, we have partially established the phenotype of mice with a selective deletion in brown adipocytes of TRβ only. These mice present a similar phenotype as BATKO mice, since they gain less weight than CTRL mice at room temperature when fed a high fat diet. They are also cold-sensitive in the absence of food. Thus, at least a part of BATKO phenotype relies on TRβ. However, we must not forget that TRα is also expressed and has been shown to control specific function in BAT thermogenesis (Marrif, Endocrinology, 2005). As we wanted to determine the whole T3 response and did not want to deal with the residual response of TRα in TRβKO mice, we focused here our attention on BATKO mice. BATKO mice give a more representative picture of T3 signaling in brown adipocytes.</p><p>We agree with you that this is an important aspect. Thus, we introduced in this publication mice with the deletion of TRβ only (called BATβKO). We mentioned their phenotype in the main text and we added the corresponding figures as supplementary data (see lines 174-177, lines 182-185, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 and the associated legend lines 897-901).</p><p>Characterization of the Ucp1-Cre has been done by the lab that generated this Cre (Rosenwald, Nature Cell Biology, 2013). This paper was cited in the method section, but we also added it in the Results section when presenting the model (line 99).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is TRa400 expression similar to WT α expression ie in control versus mutant mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is something that can be seen on the Sanger sequencing made on cDNA from BATKO mice (Figure 1B). Even if this method is only semi-quantitative, we don’t observe any tendency for TRa400 to more expressed than the WT allele. However, it is difficult to recognize if the wild-type allele is similarly expressed between CTRL and BATKO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, does the expression of the GS α occur on the Β KO background or in the presence of β?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, GS-TRα binding occurs even in the presence of ΤRβ as GS-TRα1 is expressed in wild-type mice. As GS-TRα1 is expressed under the control of the wild-type TRα1 promoter, it is a good indication that TRα1 is significantly expressed in BAT.</p><p>Previous in vitro work of our team (Chatonnet, 2013, PNAS) highlighted that TRα1 and TRβ1 most likely bind on similar sites. In the context of this study, we acknowledge that introducing GS-TRα in TRβKO would be a convincing indication that it extends, or not, the binding sites of GS-TRα. This idea could perfectly fit a future study that aims at deciphering the respective roles and binding specificity of TRα1 and TRβ1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 2D it is interesting that the BAT KO mice lose repression of target genes in hypothyroidism. This would imply that the TRalpha allele may lose the ability to bind in the absence of T3. Did the authors look at TRalpha binding in hypothyroidism?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we looked at TRα binding in hypothyroidism conditions. These data have been gathered with others in a recently published atlas of thyroid hormone target genes (Zekri et al., 2022, IJMS). We observed that T3 treatment slightly decreases the number of TRα binding sites in brown adipocytes, but the majority of TRα binding sites are shared between hypo- and hyperthyroid conditions. However, it is difficult to draw conclusions from these comparisons as they are based on only one sample. This is also not a general model as T3 treatment increases, rather than decreases, the number of TRβ binding sites in the liver (Shabtai, 2021, Genes Dev).</p><p>Concerning TRα<sup>AMI</sup>: one explanation would be that the small subset of genes you highlighted in figure 2H corresponds to TRβ-regulated genes, where the mutated TRα does not play a dominant-negative effect. Without the repression neither mediated by TRα<sup>AMI</sup> nor TRβ in the absence of T3, the expression of these genes “leaks” in the mutants, explaining the differences observed in figure 2H. The hypothesis that TRα<sup>AMI</sup> cannot bind DNA in the absence of T3 is not the most likely, as the number of genes which expression ‘leaks’ would be much more important. One hardly-feasible way to test that would be to combine TRα<sup>AMI</sup> allele with the GS-tag, and compare its binding sites with GS-TRα1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 3 no attempt was made to define what stimulated food intake. Given the potential paracrine or endocrine control via BAT it might be important to discern if any orexigenic pathways were altered to mediate this phenotype. Also, the mechanisms around Figures 3C and D needs to be clarified. This looks similar to some of the phenotypes seen in D2KO mice but it is not well clarified here. Was food intake measured?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to cold exposure, we hypothesized that food intake is secondary to the higher energy expenditure required for BATKO animals to maintain their body temperature (Figure 3A), as already described in hypothyroid animals. In the absence of food, the increased energy expenditure cannot occur and BATKO animals’ temperature drops significantly (Figure 3B). Unfortunately, the device we used for indirect calorimetry cannot be used at 4°C to experimentally test this hypothesis. We agree that this would have been a very interesting demonstration.</p><p>During HFD feeding, the food intake was measured and was not different between BATKO and CTRL mice, a phenotype indeed similar as the one observed after the inhibition of D2 in adipose tissues (Fonseca, 2014, Diabetes). Thus, food intake is not the reason why BATKO mice gain more weight than CTRL mice. You are right to mention it because it is a very important information to interpret this phenotype. Thus, we added figures to show these data. They are presented in figure 3C and 3D, and mentioned at lines 181 and 190 with the associated legend at lines 853-860.</p><p>Thank you very much for that, it will clearly help the reader to better understand the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 4, presumably the partial response seen in the BAT KO mice is due to the SNS. A denervation experiment here would have been important.</p></disp-quote><p>You are completely right, this is the most probable hypothesis. For example, Ucp1 expression becomes less sensitive to norepinephrine in hypothyroid rats. On the contrary, BAT denervation prevents the optimal increased expression of Ucp1 mediated by T3 (Bianco, 1988). Thus, the SNS and T3 act synergically to regulate Ucp1 expression. The absence or alteration of one system still allow a residual response to the other one. More broadly, DIO2-KO mice mount an exaggerated response of the SNS to compensate inefficient BAT thermogenesis (Christoffolete, 2004, Diabetes). Thus, the residual response is most likely a consequence of an important SNS stimulation of the BAT. The intertwining between T3 signaling and the SNS is a very complex question that would deserve a complete study in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 5 looks at BAT proliferation but &quot;browning&quot; is not explored or the mechanism therein.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, figure 5 focuses on BAT proliferation during a 72h cold exposure. This experiment was made to reinforce the transcriptomic observations and we did not aim at understanding the underlying mechanisms. Recent publications were specifically dedicated to this task (Liu, 2022, Nat Comm) and are referenced in the main text (line 299) if it triggers the readers curiosity.</p><p>Concerning WAT browning, we have presented the data in Figure 3 —figure supplement 3. WAT browning was observed after 3 days of cold exposure in CTRL mice, but this phenomenon was exacerbated in BATKO mice. Please note that this event is unrelated to the T3 response in the WAT as TR are not mutated in this tissue in BATKO mice.</p><p>A massive WAT browning was also observed in UCP1-KO mice (Ukropec, 2006) or in mice with surgically suppressed BAT (Piao, 2018). As the above-cited authors, we interpreted this as a compensatory mechanism to generate heat in the absence of an efficient BAT thermogenesis. However, we must be careful about this hypothesis as the contribution of WAT browning to thermogenesis and energy expenditure as recently been called into question (Johann, 2019 / Challa, 2020).</p></body></sub-article></article>
