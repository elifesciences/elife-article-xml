We combine experiment and theory to study this problem in the developing wing epithelium of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. At pupal stages, the wing-hinge contraction contributes to anisotropic tissue flows that reshape the wing blade. Here, we quantitatively account for this wing-blade shape change on the basis of cell divisions, cell rearrangements and cell shape changes. We show that cells both generate and respond to epithelial stresses during this process, and that the nature of this interplay specifies the pattern of junctional network remodeling that changes wing shape. We show that patterned constraints exerted on the tissue by the extracellular matrix are key to force the tissue into the right shape. We present a continuum mechanical model that quantitatively describes the relationship between epithelial stresses and cell dynamics, and how their interplay reshapes the wing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07090.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07090.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07090.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The individual cells in a developing animal embryo organize themselves into tissues with specific and reproducible shapes, which requires the cells to communicate with one another. Cells in tissues exert forces on their neighbors, and respond to being pushed and pulled by the cells around them.</p><p>In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, each wing consists mainly of a framework of proteins and other molecules that is built by epithelial cells. These epithelial cells divide and grow during the life of a fly larva, and then reorganize themselves into the shape of the wing after it forms into a pupa. During this reshaping, epithelial cells in some regions of the wing experience powerful contractions. Previous work had suggested that and these forces produced tension in the rest of the wing to pull it into its final elongated shape. But it wasn't clear what exactly these contractions were pulling against to produce the tension. Nor was it understood exactly how wing epithelial cells responded to tension to reorganize themselves into a different wing shape.</p><p>Now, Etournay, Popović, Merkel, Nandi et al. have analyzed the forces acting across the entire wing blade and how these forces shape the wing. All cell divisions, cell neighbor exchanges and changes in cell shape in the developing wing blade were tracked under a microscope; this revealed how each one of them contributed to the change in wing shape. Further experiments revealed that localized contractile forces produce tension in the wing because it is connected around its edge to surrounding structures via an extracellular protein called Dumpy. Releasing these contacts, by severing them with a laser or by mutating Dumpy, caused the wing to develop into abnormal shapes, showing that the tension in the wing blade has an important role in determining wing shape. Furthermore, by tracking cells in wings that had been severed by a laser, or mutated for Dumpy Etournay, Popović, Merkel, Nandi et al. could figure out exactly which cellular processes were guided by epithelial tension.</p><p>Etournay Popović, Merkel, Nandi et al. also present a theoretical model that describes how the interplay between active force generation and the response of cells to the resulting tension shapes the wings of fruit flies. They propose that epithelial tension provides a mechanism through which cells can communicate with each other to ensure that together the combined behavior of these cells generates reproducible shapes. Further studies are required to analyze how active force generation is patterned and cells sense and respond to external forces during development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07090.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07090.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>tissue-mechanic</kwd><kwd>cell-dynamic</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>wing-epithelium</kwd><kwd>continuum-mechanics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Popović</surname><given-names>Marko</given-names></name><name><surname>Merkel</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Nandi</surname><given-names>Amitabha</given-names></name><name><surname>Salbreux</surname><given-names>Guillaume</given-names></name><name><surname>Jülicher</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eaton</surname><given-names>Suzanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Etournay</surname><given-names>Raphaël</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blasse</surname><given-names>Corinna</given-names></name><name><surname>Myers</surname><given-names>Gene</given-names></name><name><surname>Jülicher</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name><name><surname>Eaton</surname><given-names>Suzanne</given-names></name><name><surname>Popović</surname><given-names>Marko</given-names></name><name><surname>Merkel</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Autonomous patterns of cell contraction in the context of localized apical extracellular matrix constraints specify tissue stresses that reshape the wing epithelium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dynamic choreography of tissue shape changes that occur during development dramatically illustrates the fact that morphogenesis depends on organized cellular force generation. The mechanisms that control the orientation and patterning of these active processes and the corresponding tissue stresses are beginning to be explored in a variety of developmental systems, for review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heisenberg and Bellaiche, 2013</xref>). However, a complete understanding of the mechanical basis of morphogenesis will require not only a description of cell autonomously generated forces, but also quantitative insights into how cells respond to tissue stresses. Cells exert forces on extracellular matrices, but also on each other—this is particularly true of epithelial cells, which are tightly connected by specialized adhesive junctions. Thus, stresses generated by one epithelial cell can be transmitted to others throughout the tissue. In vitro experiments have shown that tissues respond to stress elastically over short time scales but that they can plastically remodel when subjected to stress over longer times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beloussov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2012</xref>). This can occur as a result of cell shape changes, cell rearrangements or both, and appears to vary with the cell types examined. Furthermore, experiments with cultured epithelial cells suggest that tissue compression can limit cell proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puliafito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Streichan et al., 2014</xref>)<italic>.</italic> How these cellular responses might influence tissue size and shape in vivo is not clear. Nevertheless, these in vitro observations suggest that a complete and quantitative understanding of tissue morphogenesis will require new insights into tissue viscoelasticity in vivo and the cellular mechanisms that give rise to it.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal wing morphogenesis is an ideal system in which to study the interplay of cellular force generation and tissue material properties in vivo. During pupal stages, anisotropic stresses along the proximal-distal (PD) axis of the wing blade epithelium help guide anisotropic tissue flows that reshape the blade—elongating it in the PD axis and narrowing it in the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, for review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eaton and Julicher, 2011</xref>). The mechanisms that produce PD-oriented stresses in the wing blade are not fully understood. They are generated in part by contraction of cells in the wing hinge, which connects to the wing blade on its proximal side. However, we do not understand the origin of counterforces that restrain movement of the wing blade at the margin.</p><p>Analyzing cells in a subregion of the wing blade showed that tissue flows are associated with cell shape changes, cell divisions and cell rearrangements that are oriented along the PD axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>). To quantitatively understand the cellular basis of this tissue shape change, we must determine the global patterns of these cellular events throughout the wing blade. Furthermore, while hinge contraction contributes to PD tissue stresses in the blade, cells in the wing blade might also contribute autonomously to tissue flows and stresses. Thus, to understand the mechanical basis of pupal wing morphogenesis, we must understand the emergence of PD-oriented stresses in the wing blade, and distinguish stresses autonomously generated by wing epithelial cells from the response of epithelial cells to these stresses.</p><p>Here, we combine several quantitative methods to investigate how cell flows and global tissue shape changes emerge from the collective behavior and mechanical properties of many wing epithelial cells. We develop image analysis methods to track the majority of cells in the wing throughout morphogenesis, and analyze cell shapes and rearrangements of the junctional network. Furthermore, we develop theoretical methods to quantify the cellular contributions to tissue shear and area homeostasis in the wing blade.</p><p>We show that localized apical extracellular matrix connections to the cuticle at the wing margin provide the counterforce to hinge contraction, and are required for the development of normal stresses in the wing blade. These stresses are essential to reshape the pupal wing while maintaining wing area homeostasis. We distinguish autonomously controlled from stress-driven cellular events, and present a continuum mechanical model that quantitatively explains wing shape changes on the basis of the relationship between tissue stress, cell elongation and cell rearrangements.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dumpy-dependent physical constraints at the margin maintain epithelial tension in the wing</title><p>The emergence of two-dimensional stresses in the plane of the wing blade suggests that there are physical constraints on the movement of wing epithelial cells near the margin. We wondered whether there might be a matrix connecting the wing epithelium to the overlying pupal cuticle in this region. To investigate this, we used a laser to destroy the region between the margin of the E-Cadherin:GFP expressing wing epithelium and the cuticle after the two had separated as a consequence of molting. Although this treatment does not apparently damage either the wing or the cuticle, it causes the wing epithelium to rapidly retract away from the cuticle within seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B′′</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Laser ablation causes epithelial retraction when performed at any region along the wing blade margin—anteriorly, posteriorly or distally. During tissue flows, the now disconnected margin moves even further away from the cuticle, producing abnormal wing shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). This shows that the wing is physically restrained by apical extracellular matrix connections to the overlying cuticle, and that these connections are required to shape the wing during tissue flows.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07090.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Physical constraints at the margin maintain epithelial tension in the wing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting a pupal wing at 32 hAPF.

Dumpy is a 2.5 MDa protein that is predicted to form filaments at least 1 µm long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilkin et al., 2000</xref>).

To calculate these changes starting at the time of laser ablation, we must first estimate the outline of the tracked region at the time of laser severing—after laser severing, the wing changes its area rapidly before time-lapse imaging can begin. Since molting has not yet occurred at 15.5 hAPF, the outline of the cuticle serves as a marker for the initial anterior and posterior edges of the wing. We estimate the initial hinge-blade interface position in laser severed wings by overlaying the cuticle outline of the laser severed wing with that of a non-perturbed WT wing at 15.5 hAPF. We determine the initial position of the cut from the laser-burned imprint in the cuticle. By using these landmarks to calculate the initial area, we estimate the area change that occurred before the onset of recording, and offset each cumulative area change (blue) curve by this amount. The offsets are negative for dist-sev#1 and #2, that is, wing blade area shrinks rapidly in response to laser ablation. In contrast, the offset is zero for the proximally severed wing blade, which does not shrink immediately after ablation.

These are averages over three WT wings. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> shows the corresponding cumulative quantities. The dynamics of wing area changes in the 3 WT wing blades are extremely similar—after contracting slightly during the first half of morphogenesis, blade area gradually returns to very close to its original value (dark blue lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). This almost constant area reflects a balance between cell divisions (orange) on the one hand, and cell area changes (green) and extrusions (light blue) on the other. Interestingly, blade area in three analyzed wings is more reproducible than would be expected from the variation in each cellular contribution, if they were independent of each other (see shaded regions depicting standard deviations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). To quantify this observation we compared the variance of overall relative area change with the sum of the variances of the cumulative cellular contributions. We find that sum of variances is about 20 times larger than variance of the sum. This shows that cellular contributions are not independent and that normal variations in the rate of cell division can be compensated by changes in cell area and/or extrusion to maintain wing blade area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To ask whether connections to the cuticle were required to maintain wing blade area, we examined blade area changes and the underlying cellular contributions in <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutant wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). As a complementary approach, we quantified the cellular contributions to area changes in laser-severed wings. We severed the wing either between the hinge and the blade, or at the very distal tip before hinge contraction occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also severed connections between the wing margin and the cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>) at about 22 hAPF. In contrast to unperturbed WT wings, total wing area decreases dramatically when connections at the margin are weakened by <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutation or by laser severing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, see dark blue curve). Thus, connections to the cuticle are required to maintain wing blade area during morphogenesis. These connections provide mechanical linkages that permit the buildup of tensile stresses while maintaining wing blade area.</p><p>How does epithelial stress influence the cellular events contributing to area homeostasis? To answer this question, we first compared cellular contributions to area change during morphogenesis of WT and <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutant wings. Wing blade area decrease in <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutant wings is not a consequence of fewer cell divisions—cells actually divide more than in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D–F,I</xref>). Cells in <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutant wings have a similar maximum division rate but divide over a longer period of time, resulting in more cells at the end of morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>, yellow curve). The reduced wing blade area in <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> is quantitatively explained by reductions in cell area and by cell extrusions, which more than compensate the increased proliferation. Thus, reduced epithelial stresses in <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> wings perturb the balance between cell divisions, area changes and extrusions seen in WT.</p><p>All laser-severing perturbations decrease the final wing area, similar to <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutant wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In these wings, the analysis of cellular contributions to wing area changes is complicated by the delay between cutting and the initiation of time-lapse imaging (about 45 min). During this intervening time, the wing responds acutely to reduced tension, and both wing and cell area decrease to values below those expected for WT wings of the same stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D–F,H</xref>). While we can estimate changes to cell area during this time, we cannot know the rates of cell division and extrusion. Nevertheless, several interesting conclusions can be drawn by analyzing final cell area, and the rates of division, area change and extrusion after time-lapse imaging begins. Wings that have been severed before hinge contraction (whether at the hinge-blade interface or at the distal tip) behave similarly to <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutant wings. After an initial delay, the rate of cell division increases and cells divide more than in unperturbed wings. However, cell extrusions and decreasing cell area more than compensate for increased cell division to produce smaller wings. When cuticle connections are severed later at 22 hAPF, most cell divisions have already occurred, and this treatment does not increase proliferation. In this case, the number of cell extrusions increases, and the final cell area is smaller than that of unperturbed wings. Taken together, analyzing <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> and laser-severed wings shows that epithelial stresses are required to balance cell divisions with cell extrusions and cell area changes to maintain area homeostasis during morphogenesis. This is consistent with observations in the thorax, where overcrowding drives delamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marinari et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A method to quantify cellular contributions to wing blade deformation</title><p>In the preceding section, we discussed how cellular processes contributed to wing blade area changes. These area changes correspond to the isotropic component of a tensor characterizing the tissue strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Now, we discuss shape changes of the wing blade, which correspond to the anisotropic part of this tensor and characterize the process of elongation along an axis (i.e., pure shear).

In the following, we use the term shear to refer to pure shear. We now discuss how tissue shear can be decomposed into contributions from cell shape changes and topological changes.

In a piece of tissue where no topological changes occur within the cellular network, the deformation of the individual cells defines the deformation of the whole piece of tissue. However, when topological changes occur, deformation of individual cells no longer completely accounts for the overall shear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–H</xref>). The triangle method we outline below represents an exact geometrical formalism to decompose large-scale deformations of the wing blade into contributions by cell deformation and by each kind of topological change.</p><p>First, we tile the cellular network with triangles as follows. Each vertex of the cellular network that touches three cells (red dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) gives rise to a single triangle (red), whose corners are defined by the centers of the three cells (green dots). Vertices that touch more than three cells are treated as described in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, ‘Triangulation procedure’. The resulting set of triangles tiles the cellular network without gaps or overlaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). We choose a tiling into triangles, because the deformation of a single triangle between two frames of the video can be uniquely characterized by a single 2 × 2 tensor describing a linear transformation (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, ‘Triangle deformation’). Note that such a characterization by a 2 × 2 tensor is in general not possible for polygons with more than three sides. For each triangle and time point, this tensor describes relative area changes, rotation, and shear of the triangle. The average shear rate of all triangles in the tissue corresponds to the overall tissue shear rate. To connect the tissue shear rate to cell elongation changes, we define a nematic tensor <bold><italic>Q</italic></bold> characterizing the state of triangle elongation (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, ‘Triangle elongation’). Then, the change of triangle elongation corresponds exactly to triangle shear. Cell elongation is obtained as the average of the elongation tensors <bold><italic>Q</italic></bold> of those triangles that belong to a given cell. Hence, in the absence of topological changes, we find an exact relation between cell elongation change and overall tissue shear (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, ‘Large-scale shear in the absence of topological transitions’).</p><p>If topological changes occur, then average cell elongation change is not equal to tissue shear. To include the effect of topological transitions, we write (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, ‘Contributions to shear by topological changes’):<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">Q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">R</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the overall tissue shear rate tensor, <italic>D</italic><bold><italic>Q</italic></bold>/<italic>Dt</italic> is a corotational rate of change in average triangle elongation, and <bold><italic>R</italic></bold> is the shear rate tensor due to topological changes.

During a topological transition, the triangulation changes and thus the average triangle elongation changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L–O</xref>). However, at the moment the topological change occurs there is no tissue shear. Therefore, tissue shear and triangle elongation are no longer the same. This can be compensated by introducing a contribution to tissue shear by topological transitions. This contribution corresponds to the negative change in the average triangle elongation caused by the change in the triangulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, ‘Intermediate network states’ and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, ‘Contributions to shear by topological changes’).</p><p>In the definition of <bold><italic>R</italic></bold> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>, we have also introduced the contribution <bold><italic>D</italic></bold> to tissue shear, which accounts for collective cellular events that combine to increase average triangle elongation in the absence of tissue shear and topological transitions. This occurs when several triangles have fluctuating shapes, such that the instantaneous elongation and the rotation rate or area expansion rate of triangles are correlated. Note that this effect does not occur when several triangles undergo equal deformations and rotations. One example of a cellular network deformation that produces the contribution <bold><italic>D</italic></bold> to tissue shear is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>. Here, cells in neighboring rows slide relative to each other in alternating directions, such that no net pure shear occurs. However, there are alternating rows of <italic>simple</italic> shear and a net change in triangle elongation.

At about 21 hAPF, the shear pattern develops a sharp reorientation between veins L3 and L4, where shear is oriented along the AP axis. This region corresponds to a stripe of Dumpy-containing matrix that attaches the blade to the cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Shear decreases over time, beginning distally and proceeding proximally, and finishes by about 32 hAPF.</p><p>What are the patterns of cellular contributions to the tissue shear? These patterns reveal a surprising complexity that changes with time. Shear caused by cell elongation and cell rearrangements (T1 transitions) display significant contributions that are antagonistic. Unexpectedly, T1 transitions cause shear along the AP axis early in the process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–B′′</xref>). This shear is opposed by increasing cell elongation along the PD axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–C′′</xref>). At intermediate and late stages, T1 transitions shift their average orientation to cause PD shear—at the same time, cells reduce their elongation along the PD axis, causing AP shear. The contribution of cell extrusions to tissue shear is negligible (not shown) and cell divisions result in significant shear only during the early stages of wing morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–D′′</xref>). Finally, plotting the contribution <bold><italic>D</italic></bold> to shear due to correlation effects reveals that these effects do exist in the wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–E′′</xref>). Thus, patterns of cell elongation, cell rearrangement, cell division and correlation effects make dynamically changing contributions to tissue shear that are sometimes antagonistic.</p><p>To investigate the cause of altered wing shape in <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup><italic>,</italic> we performed a similar analysis.

These averages were taken over the tracked region shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and the resulting quantities were further averaged over the three videos. These averages and the standard deviations between the videos are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>.

To verify this, we characterize the blade shape by a nematic determined by the outline of the tracked region (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, ‘Characterization of wing blade anisotropy’). The change of this nematic with respect to its initial value over time is shown together with the cumulative tissue shear obtained by the triangle method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These quantities agree well, indicating that the shear projected on the PD axis accounts for the main features of tissue shape changes. Thus, we can now use the shear decomposition method to discuss how different cellular events contribute to shape change of the wing over time.</p><p>On average, the wing shears smoothly along its PD axis between 17 and 32 hAPF as the hinge contracts. In contrast, the cellular processes that combine to produce tissue shear change over time. During the first 6 hr of our videos, shear caused by cell elongation in the PD axis (green curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) is even larger than PD tissue shear (blue curves). This shows that cell elongation increases more than the tissue elongates suggesting that active cellular processes also contribute to PD cell elongation. Subsequently, starting at about 22 hAPF, cell elongation decreases although the blade continues to elongate. These discrepancies between cell shape changes and tissue shape changes require topological changes in the cell network. To more clearly discuss these events, we define two distinct phases of wing morphogenesis (phases I and II) that are separated by the peak of cell elongation occurring at about 22.5 hAPF.</p><p>Quantifying shear caused by T1 transitions and by cell elongation reveals that they change dynamically throughout morphogenesis with a striking reciprocal relationship (green and red curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This reciprocal relationship accounts to a large extent for the discrepancies between cell elongation and tissue shear. It further suggests that the active contribution to cell elongation (i.e., the amount of cell elongation that exceeds tissue shear) may be linked to AP-oriented T1 transitions—the orientation of these T1s, which work against the observed tissue shear, suggests that they are autonomously controlled. Active AP-oriented T1 transitions could produce PD cell elongation if mechanical constraints prevent the wing from shearing. In principle, it is also possible that active PD-oriented cell shape changes could produce AP-oriented T1 transitions under the same constraints. Cell divisions also contribute to PD shear in the wing blade. Although cell divisions initially cause a small amount of AP shear, their direction changes during phase I such that their net contribution shears the wing in the PD axis. In addition, correlation effects produce significant shear in the AP direction and contribute most strongly at the time that T1 transitions are changing their orientation.</p><p>In summary, the continuous large-scale deformation of the wing blade emerges from complex patterns of cell dynamics on small scales. During phase I, cells undergo AP-oriented T1 transitions while elongating in the PD axis. Cell divisions during phase I contribute shear along the PD axis. During phase II, the orientation of T1 transitions shifts to the PD axis and cells relax their shape. Correlation effects contribute AP shear, and peak roughly at the time that T1's shift their orientation.</p><p>To ask whether the cellular contributions to tissue shear were independent of each other, we compared the sum of the variances of the final cellular contributions to tissue shear with the variance of final tissue shear itself. The ratio of these values is about 25, indicating that the cellular contributions to tissue shear—like the contributions to area change—are not independent of each other. Thus, the overall tissue shear is more reproducible than would be expected from the variations of the cellular contributions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Alternating directions of shear and rotation in neighboring cell rows contribute to tissue shear</title><p>What exactly are cells doing that results in correlation effects? We found that shear due to correlation effects was mainly generated by correlations between local elongation and rotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–I</xref>). To investigate this further, we determined the magnitude and orientation of shear and the rotation rate associated with each triangle for each frame of the video. We observed that triangles rotated and sheared in striking spatial patterns that rapidly fluctuate in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,F,G</xref>). These patterns correspond to rows of correlated shear and rotation that are distributed throughout the wing blade. To characterize these correlated patterns, we calculated the spatial power spectrum of the local tissue rotation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, ‘Power spectrum of local tissue rotation’). This revealed that shear and rotation are correlated in regions corresponding to PD-oriented rows that were about 3–7 triangles long. These rows consist of triangles that all rotate and shear in the same direction. The rows are interspersed with other rows of similar length with mirrored patterns of shear and rotation (note blue and red rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). Such a pattern of rotation and pure shear is characteristic of neighboring rows of triangles and cells undergoing simple shear in alternating directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This would occur if PD-oriented rows of cells slide with respect to each other. As discussed above, such rearrangements can indeed contribute to correlation terms (see cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>If rows of cells slide past each other, cells typically engage in T1 transitions. Since the peak of AP correlation effects coincided with a shift in the net orientation of T1 transitions (i.e., when the red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> crosses 0), we wondered whether correlation effects could be associated with T1 transitions at this time (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We therefore examined whether correlation effects were associated with a particular type of topological change. Indeed, correlation effects are mostly accounted for by those cells that are about to undergo a T1 transition within the next 9 frames, although they cover only a small fraction of the total area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>, ‘Role of T1 transitions in the correlation-induced shear’).</p><p>For rows of cells to slide past each other, cells would have to undergo a peculiar type of T1 transition in which the orientation of the boundaries gained and lost are similar. Boundary orientations around T1 transitions are difficult to measure, because boundary length is small. The triangulation method provides us with a more robust measure of a bond orientation. As a proxy for cell boundary orientation, we use the orientation of the line connecting the centers of the two corresponding triangles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We calculated the proportion of connection losses or acquisitions occurring in different directions over the course of morphogenesis, and compared them with the distribution of connection angles in general. We observe that at early times, when T1-induced shear is mainly along the AP axis, connections are typically lost along the PD axis and gained along the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). At intermediate times, when the correlation term is maximal, both lost and gained connections were oriented along the PD axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This is consistent with the unusual T1 transitions associated with sliding cell rows. Finally, as T1 transitions begin to cause net PD shear, AP connections are preferentially lost and PD connections are gained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, as T1 transitions shift from an AP- to a PD-oriented shear, they pass through an intermediate state where connection gains and losses are still oriented but do not cause shear. Interestingly, at the same time, the correlation term has maximal magnitude. This suggests that the correlation effects are related to these unusual patterns of T1 transitions at intermediate times.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07090.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Changes in angular distribution of lost and newly formed cell–cell junctions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>D</bold>) Effective proportions of cell–cell connections that are lost (blue) or gained (red) in different directions as a consequence of cell rearrangements in a WT wing.

Analogously, cell divisions cause more cumulative PD shear than in WT—consistent with the increased number of cell divisions in the <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutant wing.

We first examined wings that had undergone laser severing before hinge contraction at the distal tip of the wing blade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These wings experience mechanical conditions similar to those in <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> wings in that they undergo hinge contraction but cannot attach properly to the distal cuticle. Consistent with this, the final shape of distally severed wings resembles that of <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> wings. Furthermore, distally severed wings show similar tissue shear and cellular contributions to shear as <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutant wings. These observations suggest that weakened connections to the distal cuticle are key to the altered wing shape of <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutants.</p><p>To perturb PD stresses even more strongly, we severed the region between the hinge and the blade before hinge contraction occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). These wings are not subjected to externally generated PD stresses at all, although they may still experience autonomously-induced stresses. We expected that cellular events that depended on externally generated stresses would be even more strongly perturbed in proximally severed wings than in <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> or distally-severed wings. The proximally severed wing undergoes significant but short-lived PD shear during the molting process until 18 hAPF. Subsequently, PD shear stops and becomes even negative by 20 hAPF. Cells do not elongate in the PD axis as much as in WT wings, although PD cell elongation still exceeds PD tissue shear. Again, this suggests that only a fraction of PD cell elongation is normally caused by external stresses, and that autonomous cellular events must produce the residual PD cell elongation in proximally severed wings. PD shear due to cell division is larger than in WT (as it is in <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> and distally severed wings) confirming that these divisions do not depend on external stresses. Furthermore, like <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> and distally severed wings, proximally severed wings undergo greater AP shear resulting from correlation effects. Thus the cellular events underlying correlation effects produce even more shear when stresses are reduced. However later, T1 transitions fail to generate significant PD shear in proximally severed wings. The reduction in T1-dependent PD shear is much stronger than in either <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> or distally severed wings, confirming that reorientation of T1 transitions in phase II is dependent on externally generated PD stress. At the very beginning of the video, PD-oriented connections are preferentially lost and AP-oriented connections are preferentially gained, consistent with the AP shear caused by T1 transitions at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C–F</xref>). However, unlike WT, the preferential loss of connections never shifts towards the AP axis. Loss of connections remains biased towards the PD axis throughout the video—despite the fact that net shear caused by T1 transitions becomes very small. Shear caused by T1 transitions becomes small because the preferred orientation of gained connections gradually shifts from the AP to the PD axis. By the end of the video, both the assembly and disassembly of cell boundaries are preferentially oriented along the PD axis. These observations suggest that PD-oriented cell boundaries have a greater tendency to disassemble than those oriented at other angles, and that this is an autonomous, planar polarized feature of wing epithelial cells.</p><p>To disturb connections to the overlying cuticle without damaging the wing epithelium we disrupted apical extracellular matrix between the wing margin and the cuticle shortly before the onset of phase II, when this region becomes accessible (see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8 media9">Videos 8, 9</xref>). When anterior connections are severed, the wing blade shears even more in the PD axis while the area decreases slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that these connections restrain the narrowing of the wing blade in the AP axis. Increased PD tissue shear is mainly a consequence of T1 transitions. Since severing anterior connections reduces AP stress while PD stress does not change, this supports the idea that T1 events during phase II are oriented by anisotropic stress.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media8" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-07090-media8.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07090.028</object-id><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>Video of a WT wing in which the extracellular matrix was laser-ablated anteriorly.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07090.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07090.028</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media9" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-07090-media9.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07090.029</object-id><label>Video 9.</label><caption><title>Video of a WT wing in which the extracellular matrix was laser-ablated distally.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07090.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07090.029</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>When distal connections are severed, cells rapidly reduce their elongation and area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Boundary stresses are due to hinge contraction and to the resistance of extracellular matrix attachments to the cuticle. Internal tissue stresses are generated by cell autonomous processes, like T1 transitions, and by elastic cell deformations. Tissue mechanics depends strongly on elastic connections of the wing to the cuticle. We must now understand how these isotropic and anisotropic mechanical stresses in the tissue, combined with boundary stresses, lead to cell and tissue remodeling. The interplay between boundary stresses and forces generated in the tissue is complex and requires a physical approach.

A similar fit is performed for the hinge and corresponding parameters are superscripted with an index H.</p><p>This leaves 10 parameters unspecified. These characterize the isotropic stresses in the blade, the anisotropic stresses in the hinge, the stiffness of the elastic linkers at the boundary, and the coefficient describing external friction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We estimated these parameters by performing joint fits of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equations 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">5</xref> to the quantified time dependence of tissue area changes and shear in unperturbed and mechanically perturbed WT wings. We found that anisotropic stresses in the hinge are small compared to isotropic stresses and therefore we could set <italic>ζ</italic><sup><italic>H</italic></sup> and K<sup><italic>H</italic></sup> to zero.

How tissue material properties emerge from the properties and behavior of their many constituent cells, and how these properties quantitatively account for tissue shape change is a major question in developmental biology. These questions have been difficult to answer because of both experimental and theoretical limitations. Methodologies for large-scale imaging and image analysis of entire tissues at the cellular level were insufficient, and direct measurement of forces and stresses in vivo have been rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farhadifar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bambardekar et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, theoretical approaches are required to understand how tissue shear emerges from different kinds of cellular processes. By developing new experimental and theoretical approaches, we have been able for the first time to account for the shape change of a developing tissue on the basis of its active and its viscoelastic properties. Our approach allows us to quantitatively understand how such tissue properties emerge from the interactions of its constituent cells.</p><p>Our work is stimulated by previous approaches to tissue dynamics. For example, previous work on tissue tectonics highlighted the decomposition of tissue shear in cell shape changes and cell intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brodland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marmottant et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butler et al., 2009</xref>). Our triangle method refines these ideas using a geometrical scheme that defines and distinguishes exact cellular contributions to tissue shear. These are contributions due to cell deformation, cell division, T1 and T2 transitions. This approach has also led to the discovery of a new correlation effect that contributes significantly to tissue shear. This collective effect can result from local correlations between cell elongation and tissue rotation, or between cell elongation and cell area changes. For instance, this correlation effect can be produced by relative sliding of neighboring cell rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>In our work we combine this approach with a novel continuum mechanical model based on patterns of cell elongation. Our model combines visco-elastic material properties with additional cell autonomous so-called active stresses. These active stresses contribute to force balances and also can drive topological rearrangements. This model allows us to quantitatively discuss tissue deformations that emerge from the dynamic interplay of externally applied forces, internally generated stresses and the resulting collective cell rearrangements. Our model is related to continuum models of active gels and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kruse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brodland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ranft et al., 2010</xref>) that can be obtained by coarse-graining cell-based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honda et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graner and Glazier, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drasdo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Brodland, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brodland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farhadifar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basan et al., 2011</xref>). However, our model differs from existing continuum models in several ways: it is directly based on measurable cellular contributions to tissue shear, it includes a new time scale corresponding to a delay for the generation of T1 transitions, and it introduces a cell-autonomous contribution to T1 transitions. Such cell-autonomous T1 transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>) may for example be generated by orientation-dependent contractility of cell boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skoglund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rauzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sawyer et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, our approach can bridge scales from individual cellular events to cell flows and large-scale tissue shape changes.</p><p>We find that the wing tissue shapes itself through patterned contractions and shear that occur in the context of patterned extra-cellular matrix (ECM) connections to a surrounding cuticular scaffold. Thus, by pulling on these connections, the tissue forces itself into the right shape. In <italic>dumpy</italic> mutants, these connections are weakened and the final tissue shape is dramatically altered as compared to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waddington, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carmon et al., 2010</xref>). Dumpy plays a similar role in shaping the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanical function of such ECM connections may be generally important during epithelial morphogenesis in vivo.</p><p>Our quantitative analysis has provided new insights into the biology of pupal wing morphogenesis. We have discovered that cell-autonomous planar polarized T1 transitions occur early, during the first phase of the process. Surprisingly, they occur along the AP axis and actively increase cell elongation in the PD axis. Why were these AP-oriented T1 transitions not detected in our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>)? Comparing the rate of T1 transitions with the amount of shear they generate shows that the orientation of T1 transitions at this time is less focused than it is later when T1 transitions cause shear in the PD axis. However, because their overall rate is higher in phase I, a slight bias in their orientation causes significant AP shear. The fact that there is only a slight AP bias in these T1 transitions likely explains why they have not been detected before, and highlights the importance of the large-scale quantitative analysis that we employ here. What mechanisms might underlie AP-oriented T1 transitions that occur in phase I? Quantitative analysis of laser ablation data indicates that the preferred shape of wing epithelial cells in the absence of external forces is not isotropic, but rather elongated in the AP axis. Increased contractility of PD-oriented cell boundaries could explain this preference, and would also tend to favor AP-oriented T1 transitions. We note that components of both the Fat and Core planar cell polarity pathways are enriched on PD-oriented cell boundaries during phase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>). These systems are known to regulate both cell boundary tension and Cadherin turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Classen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Warrington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagaoka et al., 2014</xref>), and it will be interesting to investigate their involvement in orienting T1 transitions at this stage.</p><p>Our theoretical analysis suggests that AP-oriented T1 transitions are unlikely to strongly influence the final shape of the wing. However, they have a strong influence on peak cell elongation and final cell shape. What function could this serve during morphogenesis? One possibility is that AP-oriented T1 transitions influence the morphology of cuticular ridges on the adult wing surface. The cuticle of the adult wing is shaped in a reproducible pattern of ridges that form between cell rows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>). These ridges likely influence anisotropic mechanical properties of the wing during flight. Orderly packing of the wing epithelium into hexagons is necessary for the long-range order of these ridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>), and their spacing presumably depends on the spacing of cell rows at the time the adult cuticle is secreted. AP-oriented T1 transitions could influence both these features. First, they are predicted to increase the final magnitude of PD cell elongation and may therefore influence ridge spacing. Second, increased cell elongation contributed by AP-oriented T1 transitions may help focus the direction of the subsequent PD-oriented T1 transitions and increase hexagonal order. Interestingly, PCP mutant wings are characterized by irregular cell packing geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Classen et al., 2005</xref>), and less long-range order in the pattern of cuticular ridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis has revealed unexpected properties of the cell elongation-dependent shift of T1 transitions towards the PD axis. Separately quantifying the orientations of cell boundary loss and cell boundary expansions during this shift shows that these two components of a T1 transition respond differently to cell elongation. The average orientation of cell boundary expansion shifts from the AP to the PD axis at 21 hAPF before the complementary change in orientation of cell boundary loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This suggests that PD-oriented epithelial stresses promote expansion of cell boundaries along the PD axis at a lower threshold than is required to block shortening of PD-oriented boundaries. Thus, the mechanisms that operate to contract cell boundaries and to expand new ones respond differently to epithelial stresses. This difference means that cells tend to both gain and lose boundaries along the PD axis during the shift from AP to PD-oriented T1 transitions. Interestingly, this does not always simply represent the contraction and re-expansion of the same cell boundaries. Rather, contractions and expansions of different cell boundaries in the same direction occur as rows of cells move with respect to each other—a process that is associated with the maximal contribution of measured correlation effects (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> magenta line and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>PD-oriented cell divisions also contribute to the shape change of the wing blade during pupal morphogenesis. Interestingly, while epithelial stresses promote cell division in cultured epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puliafito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Streichan et al., 2014</xref>), this does not appear to be the case in the wing. In fact cell divisions occur at a similar rate and for longer times in laser ablated and <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutant wings. Thus, there are more cell divisions overall in situations where stresses are reduced. This suggests that the cell divisions that occur normally are not initiated by the stresses associated with hinge contraction but are controlled by other factors. Examining their pattern suggests that signals from veins may play a role (data not shown, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1994</xref>]). It is also possible that hormonal signals such as ecdysone could control their timing. We do not yet understand why perturbations that reduce stress result in slightly more cell divisions. These extra divisions may occur by different mechanisms that respond to wounding.</p><p>Furthermore, the magnitude of PD shear caused by cell divisions is proportional to the rate of cell divisions, suggesting that cell division orientation is also unaffected by reducing PD stresses. Thus, it may be that cell divisions in the pupal wing are autonomously controlled by planar polarized cortical cues. Alternatively, because the AP-oriented T1 transitions still cause some PD cell elongation in laser severed and <italic>dumpy</italic><sup><italic>ov1</italic></sup> mutant wings, it may be that residual cell elongation is still sufficient to orient cell divisions.</p><p>During development, tissues are shaped with extreme reproducibility. It has been estimated that the shape of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing is precise to within 1 cell diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abouchar et al., 2014</xref>). How is such reproducibility achieved? The cell lineage in the wing is indeterminate, and both wing shape and wing area can be preserved in the face of a variety of developmental insults—including cell death and differential growth rates. This requires that all cells within the wing be able to sense its overall size and shape. How do cells acquire this information? Based on our findings, we would propose that stresses in the wing epithelium could be one cue.</p><p>Interestingly, the total area and shear of WT wings is more reproducible than would be expected from the variation in individual cellular contributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig6">Figures 3, 6</xref>). Thus, these cellular events influence and can compensate for each other. The fact that epithelial tension is required to maintain area homeostasis and to control tissue shear suggests a mechanism for this compensation. Variations in cell division, cell shape change, cell rearrangements and cell extrusions could be detected by cells as changes in epithelial tension. The ability of cells to sense and respond to tension could underlie this compensation and produce wings of reproducible sizes and shapes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains and crosses</title><p>Flies were raised at 25°C under standard conditions unless stated otherwise.

A low-pass filter was first applied to images to remove high frequency noise. For each z-stack, the signal of highest contrast was projected using a C++ algorithm as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merkel et al., 2014</xref>). Tiles were stitched using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preibisch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Stitched images were then loaded in Packing Analyzer v8.5 (PA8.5) for cell edge detection by using a seeded-watershed algorithm. To facilitate cell tracking, cross-correlation of subsequent images was performed in PA8.5 to calculate local tissue displacement beforehand. Resulting cell-tracking masks were parsed using a custom C++ parser that extracted cell shape properties, cell lineages and cell neighbor relationships for further storage in a SQLite relational DB. Topology was kept in the DB by ordering cell neighbors counter-clockwisely around each cell, namely by following a directed path of cell–cell junctions around each cell. One DB file was created per video. All DB queries were carried out using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">R Development Core Team, 2014</xref>) or Python (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29a">Hunter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44a">Pérez and Granger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57a">van der Walt et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We restricted our analyses to a subset of cells that were trackable throughout the entire course of the video, excluding cells that became visible only at later stages due to the apposition of the two cell layers. At 32 hAPF, most cells of the dorsal cell layer are visible. Therefore, we manually drew regions of interest (ROIs) on 32 hAPF wings using the veins and hinge–blade interface as landmarks, where the Ecad::GFP signal is more intense. These ROIs include the blade region delimited by the hinge–blade interface and the wing margin, but also the hinge–blade interface itself. In addition, we defined a triangular portion of the hinge delimited by the hinge–blade interface and the most anterior sensory organ located in the bulk of the hinge. In other hinge regions, cells were too small and elongated to be consistently tracked. Starting from these ROIs at 32 hAPF, we developed a backward-tracking algorithm that uses information about cell divisions and cell extrusions to reconstitute the corresponding group of cells at start of recording (usually ∼16 hAPF), discarding margin cells that were not present through the course of the video. In the resulting set of cells, cells in contact with the wing margin at start of recording (about 16 hAPF) were not perfectly segmented and therefore further discarded. This gave rise to a group of cells that is fully consistent in time.</p><p>Since part of the hinge could not be analyzed at cellular resolution, we complemented our analysis of the small portion of the hinge by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrian and Westerweel, 2011</xref>) to extract information about the entire hinge deformation as described thereafter.

For tissue severing, a C-apochromat-40×/1.2 water immersion lens was used to focus the beam along AP-oriented line segments to ablate both dorsal and ventral cell layers. Subsequent long-term imaging of the whole wing was then carried out on our dedicated Zeiss spinning disk. Extracellular-matrix ablations were done using a 63×/1.4 oil lens to focus the beam between the tissue and the cuticle and to cut over 10 μm in depth. Circular cuts were also conducted with the 63×/1.4 oil lens but over a depth of 5 μm. Each circular cut experiment was repeated on five distinct pupae.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of circular laser ablations</title><p>Fly wings expressing Ecad::GFP were used in all circular cut experiments. Circular cuts were performed to disconnect a small subset of cells present inside the circle from the rest of the tissue. The interface of the tissue with the ablated circular region was always visible and well spatially defined after laser ablation. Therefore we quantified its displacement to calculate the initial velocity gradient that describes the immediate tissue deformation in response to the ablation. To do so, we first fitted an ellipse to this manually segmented interface, at 50 s after ablation. The major and minor axes of the ellipse define the orientation of two orthogonal kymographs, each intersecting the ellipse in two points corresponding to two opposite sides of the interface between the tissue and the ablated region. Each kymograph depicts the displacement as a function of time of the two opposite sides of this interface, which were manually segmented using sub-pixel resolution ROI. Thus, we quantified the displacement of four points corresponding to the intersections of the minor and major axes with the ellipse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This procedure was semi-automated in a custom Fiji macro. The initial response of the tissue reflects the orientation and amplitude of tissue stresses. This can be captured by the initial velocity gradient within a few seconds after the 4 s ablation. Indeed, the initial displacement normal to the cut boundary was approximately linear as a function of time within the first 5 s after ablation. A linear fit to the data provided the initial normal velocities <italic>V</italic><sub>||</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>⊥</sub> along the major and minor axis of the ellipse, respectively.

We first show how a characteristic height and length can be associated to an arbitrary two-dimensional shape. We then specify how hinge and blade regions were selected to obtain the associated height and length. Note that for the purpose of estimating the wing dimensions, we do not used tracked regions of a subpart of the wing as in ‘Data handling and image processing’, but we use all available segmented data.

The position of the mother cell center in <italic>I</italic><sub>3</sub> is defined as the midpoint between the daughter cell centers in <italic>O</italic><sub><italic>n</italic> + 1</sub>.

As a consequence, <italic>I</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>3</sub> contain the same set of cells.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In general all of the reviewers felt the body of work was very impressive, and brings important new information to the field. Using live imaging, genetic/physical perturbations, quantitative data analysis and modelling they explore morphogenesis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal wing and how tissue shape changes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing are related to cell shapes and mechanics. It also reveals the importance of Dumpy-dependent attachment of the disk to the cuticle. The authors develop a method to extract cell-level contributions to tissue area changes and tissue shear, and demonstrate that the various drivers of tissue shape are changing with time in interesting and robust patterns. In addition, the authors develop a fairly simple continuum model for tissue shape changes that can fit all the data in WT, mutants, and ablated embryos. This work demonstrates that both external boundary conditions as well as internal force generation are necessary to generate the WT cell shape. The deformation of wing tissues in normal and dumpy mutants is decomposed into contributions from cell growth, rearrangement and mitosis. An effort is made to distinguish autonomous cell behaviours from responses to stresses that arise from hinge reshaping and pinning of the blade margins. The experiments have been done carefully and bring important new information to the field.</p><p>In their revised version of the manuscript the authors should address the following points raised by the reviewers.</p><p>1) Calling ṽ the change in the “shear” is not precise. Some people use “shear” to refer to “shear stress” instead of shear strain. Why not call it the shear strain?</p><p>2) Why is there no autonomous active pressure in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>, which is the analogue to the active shear stress in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>?</p><p>3) Why does <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ52">Equation 52</xref> in the supplemental include a viscous contribution to the pressure (and that's what the authors say they fit), but <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> includes no such term? It is not clear when the dissipative term is included and when it is not.</p><p>4) Given that several main results in this paper rely on the fact that there is a delay (<italic>τ</italic><sub>d</sub>) between the cellular topological changes (<italic>R</italic>) and the cell elongation (<italic>Q</italic>), and that this delay seems to be about 4 hours, it would be extremely useful to have some discussion of what is generating that delay. Naively, I would expect that cell elongation would drive rearrangements instantaneously—changes to shape should immediately generate T1s in fairly generic geometries. I find the existence of <italic>τ</italic><sub>d</sub> to be incredibly surprising (although the data is convincing that it exists.) So this 4 hour timescale must be something having to do with a signaling cascade specific to biological systems? Are there any candidates for this?</p><p>5) Building upon this, it would be useful to provide a sentence or two (or a reference) for why the functional form of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref> is chosen. There are other ways to incorporate delays into partial differential equations—why is this the correct way to do it?</p><p>6) It was not clear why the authors choose to use shear to characterize deformation (subsection headed “A method to quantify cellular contributions to wing blade deformation”). The authors might consider that elongation in the proximal-distal (PD) direction might be a more natural and easily understood measure. Shear is notoriously difficult to interpret mechanically. What defines its positive sense? An examination of Mohr's circle or some other strain clarification tool highlights the challenges associated with its definition and interpretation, even for mechanicians, never mind biologists and others lacking that specific training. By describing the deformations in terms of elongations, these unnecessary complications might be avoided. For example, one of the reviewers struggles greatly with the authors defining shear in terms of “the negative change in average triangle elongation” (in the third paragraph of the aforementioned subsection and then seemingly contradicted in the fourth paragraph). If a triangle elongates in the PD direction, that motion could be just as easily assigned to positive or negative shear (a square whose top moves to the right or to the left, respectively) suggesting that the correspondence is arbitrary, and not meaningful. Modern continuum mechanics texts and a few biologically-motivated articles provide shear definitions that are mathematically-motivated and rigorous.</p><p>7) While using shear strain is okay (and is natural for a physics audience) it is not as natural for a solid mechanician. All the reviewers agree that the description of what is meant by “shear” is confusing at present in the manuscript, and could benefit from making more connections to the engineering literature. When using Hooke's law, it and other constitutive equations should be qualified with a statement that points out it is a simple and appropriate starting point, but that nonlinear elasticity may play a role.</p><p>8) The authors are missing references to other cell mechanics models, including those by Brodland et al. and comparison with previous cell-based computational models and constitutive equations that address how tissue deformation is related to mitosis, cell rearrangement and growth, and other factors. The paper has the potential to bring much understanding of tissue reshaping, and defining the deformations and their contributions in terms of elongation (normal strain) rather than shear (shear strain) would represent a tremendous improvement to its presentation, rigor and accessibility. It would also remove many of the hand-waving machinations that clutter an otherwise lovely story. It furthermore seems a shame that an article that could serve as a major reference to future researchers does not bring clarity and simplicity to the mechanical analysis and lead future investigators in that direction.</p><p>9) Wing area is determined by mass accumulation, tissue (cell) height and cell loss, not by other parameters. This should be made clear and discussed (in the subsection “Cellular contributions to wing area changes” and in the Discussion), i.e. there is probably no growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-E</xref>).</p><p>10) It is surprising to see how similar tissue tension is in the wild type and Dumpy mutant tissue, as measured by both the isotropic and anisotropic components of wound opening following a cut. This suggests that the tissue is able to re-establish the force balance when uncoupled from the cuticle.</p><p>This is surprising and should be discussed more fully in the text (subsection headed “Dumpy-dependent physical constraints at the margin maintain epithelial tension in EDH the wing”).</p><p>Is it correct that cell shape anisotropy is better aligned with tension anisotropy in the mutant as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I-I’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>?</p><p>11) There are several striking findings that are not that fully explained in the text in the wild type, cell division is shut down by 22.5h APF. This is not the case in the mutant. Interestingly, this is exactly when the shift in the T1 cell contribution to shear occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Is it possible that this is related to DILP8 function? If not, what is it that happens at 22.5h?</p><p>12) The biggest behaviour change in the mutant is the increase in the rate of cell extrusion and in area compression. This implies that area compression and extrusion are mechanistically related (i.e. extrusion is driven by compression) and are subject to extrinsic regulation. If this is the case (i.e. if the rate of compression is proportional to rate of extrusion with a delay), this should be made clear. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2D-F</xref> it appears that extrusion varies most between wildtype animals and perturbations.</p><p>Again, this suggests that extrusion is not subject to intrinsic control but is regulated by tissue mechanics, as previously suggested. Division appears largely insensitive to mechanics, despite what is stated in the text (in the last paragraph of the subsection headed “Cellular contributions to wing area changes”). Interestingly, extrusion does not contribute to shear. This may suggest that it is driven by isotropic forces, e.g. isotropic compression. Please discuss (e.g. in the Discussion: “This suggests that cells may measure epithelial tension to communicate with each other and reproducibly control tissue area despite variable contributions of cell division, cell extrusion and cell area).</p><p>13) The authors suggest that the precision of the wildtype tissue is greater than that of individual cellular processes. This is a very important point. While the data suggest that this may the case, it would be good to come up with a quantitative measure of precision and variation by which to test this idea with, i.e. compare cell number/cell area/division/extrusion precision/variation with that of tissue area and/or tissue shape precision/variation. Importantly, if there is no growth during the experiment, area precision may simply reflect the absence of cell mass accumulation. If this is the case, it is a trivial result.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07090.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Calling ṽ the change in the “shear” is not precise.

We now clearly define “shear” in the revised manuscript as pure shear, corresponding to axial elongation at constant area, similar to the shape change associated with convergence-extension (please see the first paragraph of the subsection headed “A method to quantify cellular contributions to wing blade deformation”). All shear tensors in the manuscript describe this type of pure shear. We distinguish it from simple shear, which is a combination of pure shear and rotation. We have added new figure panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A-C</xref>) to clarify the definition of shear and the decomposition of simple shear in shear and rotation.</p><p><italic>2) Why is there no autonomous active pressure in</italic> <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3"><italic>Equation 3</italic></xref><italic>, which is the analogue to the active shear stress in</italic> <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4"><italic>Equation 4</italic></xref>?</p><p>In our model, there is an autonomous active pressure, which is analogous to the active shear stress in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>.

We now explain this more clearly in the main text in the fourth paragraph of the subsection headed “Cell shape changes and tissue flows during pupal development can be understood by a continuum mechanical model”. The tissue area viscosity is included in the fits shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10–figure supplement 2</xref> and the corresponding values are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>For the sake of logical flow, we prefer to begin with the simple description of tissue pressure given in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> and only introduce area viscosity after it is motivated by fits to the experimental data.</p><p><italic>4) Given that several main results in this paper rely on the fact that there is a delay (τ</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub><italic>) between the cellular topological changes (</italic>R<italic>) and the cell elongation (</italic>Q<italic>), and that this delay seems to be about 4 hours, it would be extremely useful to have some discussion of what is generating that delay.

Are there any candidates for this</italic>?</p><p>We were as surprised as the reviewers to notice the existence of this delay. We are currently investigating this, both experimentally and theoretically. One possibility is based on the idea that T1 transitions are influenced by planar cell polarity (PCP) domains. As cells elongate, the Core PCP domains reorient along the PD axis on the time scale of a few hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aigouy 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Merkel 2014</xref>). One might imagine that these PCP domains contribute to the disassembly of cell boundaries required for PD-oriented T1 transitions. Thus, the delay could correspond to the time needed to reorient PCP domains.

Below, we outline our current thinking about these divisions, and discuss the reviewers’ proposal that Dilp signaling and T1 transitions may regulate them.</p><p>Although pupal cell divisions start at the same time as hinge contraction, it is clear that they are not initiated by the resulting epithelial stresses because releasing such stresses prolongs rather than prevents them. We agree there could be some sort of hormonal initiating signal. While it is possible that Dilp6 could contribute, pupal cell divisions (unlike Dilp6) don’t appear to increase the size of the wing; they are almost perfectly balanced by a decrease in cell area. (Dilp8 was probably a typo, since Dilp6, not Dilp8, increases body size in post-feeding animals). The burst of ecdysone that occurs at the prepupal to pupal transition might be a better candidate to initiate these divisions.</p><p>However, we don’t think that a single external signal, like Dilp or ecdysone, can completely explain the number or pattern of pupal cell divisions (though such a signal could help initiate them), because divisions can be prolonged by wing autonomous perturbations like laser ablation. Also (although we have not included this in the paper) pupal divisions occur in specific vein and intervein regions at reproducibly different times (consistent with Garcia-Bellido’s studies in the 90’s). This is hard to reconcile with control by a single hormonal signal. It suggests that local signals must also play a role, possibly signals associated with veins.</p><p>The reviewers note that cell divisions stop near the time that T1 transitions reorient. This is an interesting correlation, and seems to hold true for the perturbed wings as well. Since cell divisions do not appear to be promoted by epithelial stresses, it is unlikely that these T1’s inhibit cell divisions by relieving stress in the epithelium. But it is certainly possible that stress-induced T1 transitions inhibit cell division by some other mechanism. Probing a possible causal relationship between T1 transitions and cell divisions, and its directionality, will require us to analyze wings where each process is specifically blocked. We are pursuing this goal, but it is outside the current scope of the manuscript.</p><p>Another possibility is that the prolongation of cell division in Dumpy mutants, or upon laser ablation constitutes a wound healing response that occurs when stress is reduced. Scratching MDCK cell monolayers (thus releasing stress in the epithelium) causes a wave of proliferation that contributes to wound healing. In fact, we have noticed that pupal wing epithelial cells robustly heal wounds caused by laser ablation—the wing must be completely severed both dorsally and ventrally to prevent the resealing of the epithelium.</p><p><italic>12) The biggest behaviour change in the mutant is the increase in the rate of cell extrusion and in area compression. This implies that area compression and extrusion are mechanistically related (i.e. extrusion is driven by compression) and are subject to extrinsic regulation. If this is the case (i.e. if the rate of compression is proportional to rate of extrusion with a delay), this should be made clear.

Division appears largely insensitive to mechanics, despite what is stated in the text (in the last paragraph of the subsection headed “Cellular contributions to wing area changes”). Interestingly, extrusion does not contribute to shear. This may suggest that it is driven by isotropic forces, e.g. isotropic compression. Please discuss (e.g. in the Discussion: “This suggests that cells may measure epithelial tension to communicate with each other and reproducibly control tissue area despite variable contributions of cell division, cell extrusion and cell area)</italic>.</p><p>Our data indeed suggest that extrusions depend on isotropic stress. We have begun to analyze this quantitatively as suggested by the reviewer. However, we find that the details of the relationship are not straightforward and will require more analysis. We think that this point is outside the scope of the present paper. We have now rewritten the corresponding parts to make the qualitative relationship more clear and we now cite previous work consistent with this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marinari et al., 2012</xref>; in the Results).</p><p><italic>13) The authors suggest that the precision of the wildtype tissue is greater than that of individual cellular processes. This is a very important point. While the data suggest that this may the case, it would be good to come up with a quantitative measure of precision and variation by which to test this idea with, i.e. compare cell number/cell area/division/extrusion precision/variation with that of tissue area and/or tissue shape precision/variation</italic>.</p><p>In the previous manuscript, we used the standard deviation as a quantitative measure for the variation of cellular contributions to shear and area change. These standard deviations can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig6">Figures 3 and 6</xref> as shaded regions surrounding the different curves. Now, to determine whether different cellular contributions influence each other, we have calculated the variances (square of the standard deviation) of the cumulative cellular contributions to area change and shear at the final time point. We then compared the sum of these variances to the variance of overall relative area change and overall shear deformation at the final time point. If cellular contributions were completely independent of each other, the sum of their variances would equal the variance of the sum and their ratio would be 1. However, we find that this is not the case but the ratio is about 25 and 20 for shear and area change respectively.</p><p><italic>Importantly, if there is no growth during the experiment, area precision may simply reflect the absence of cell mass accumulation. If this is the case, it is a trivial result</italic>.</p><p>The fact that releasing connections to the apical extracellular matrix reduces the area of the wing suggests that area homeostasis is not a trivial consequence of lack of growth. Note also that in the two-dimensional arrangement of cells, area can change in the absence of growth if the height changes or if cells are extruded.</p></body></sub-article></article>
