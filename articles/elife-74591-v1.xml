Recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that large-scale neural dynamics inhabit a low-dimensional subspace or manifold, and that learning is constrained by this intrinsic manifold architecture. Here, we asked, using functional MRI, whether subject-level differences in neural excursion from manifold structure can explain differences in learning across participants. We had subjects perform a sensorimotor adaptation task in the MRI scanner on 2 consecutive days, allowing us to assess their learning performance across days, as well as continuously measure brain activity. We find that the overall neural excursion from manifold activity in both cognitive and sensorimotor brain networks is associated with differences in subjects’ patterns of learning and relearning across days. These findings suggest that off-manifold activity provides an index of the relative engagement of different neural systems during learning, and that subject differences in patterns of learning and relearning are related to reconfiguration processes occurring in cognitive and sensorimotor networks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>functional MRI</kwd><kwd>brain networks</kwd><kwd>motor learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP126158</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallivan</surname><given-names>Jason P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human sensorimotor learning is associated with changes in the structure of cognitive and motor functional brain networks, and reconﬁguration processes occurring in these networks are associated with distinct patterns of subject learning and relearning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Effective motor behavior relies on the central nervous system’s ability to adapt to the environment by learning new mappings between motor commands and sensory outcomes. For example, an inexperienced youth hockey player, when walking from the change-room onto the ice surface, has to learn to adapt their stride in response to the drastic change in surface properties. This sensorimotor adaptation is known to rely partly on implicit learning processes, driven by sensory prediction errors reflecting the difference between the expected and sensed consequences of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolpert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wolpert and Ghahramani, 2000</xref>). In addition, there is evidence that explicit (declarative) learning processes, such as cognitive strategies, also help guide behavioral adjustments, and that these operate synergistically with implicit processes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krakauer and Mazzoni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McDougle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wolpert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miyamoto et al., 2020</xref>). Recent behavioral and computational work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDougle et al., 2015</xref>) has suggested that these two processes operate on different timescales, with implicit and explicit learning leading to slow and fast adaptation and de-adaptation, respectively.</p><p>Although the neural systems supporting these two learning processes are not perfectly understood, there is considerable evidence that implicit adaptation relies, in part, on sensory prediction errors computed in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Izawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>), which are used to drive adaptation in frontal and parietal sensorimotor regions in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDougle et al., 2015</xref>). Explicit learning, by contrast, has been linked to higher-level working memory and inhibitory control processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keisler and Shadmehr, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anguera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drummond et al., 2015</xref>), and thus has been associated with a wide array of higher-order association areas across the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anguera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dayan and Cohen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doyon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hardwick et al., 2013</xref>). There is also evidence that explicit learning is responsible for ‘savings’, or faster relearning upon reexposure to the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morehead et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, emerging behavioral evidence indicates that individual differences in rates of adaptation and savings is largely driven by subject-level differences in the contribution of explicit processes to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Brouwer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>). While the neural bases that underlie these subject-level differences in learning performance are likewise poorly understood, one hypothesis that follows from this prior work is that fast and slow learners are likely to differ in the relative degree to which they recruit brain networks associated with these distinct learning systems. These differences in the engagement of sensorimotor networks on the one hand, and higher-order cognitive regions on the other, may then reflect the differential contribution of explicit cognitive processes to their learning performance.</p><p>At the neural level, learning requires that the brain generates new patterns of activity. These activity patterns are presumably constrained by the underlying neural circuitry and shaped by the information processing functions of single neurons or individual brain regions. This architecture results in correlations between the activity of neurons (and between brain regions), resulting in patterns of activation that primarily occupy a low-dimensional subspace or manifold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallego et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadtler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shenoy et al., 2013</xref>). In neurophysiological studies, this manifold structure has been observed both at the level of whole-brain functional networks (via functional MRI [fMRI]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shine et al., 2019</xref>) and at the level of local neural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadtler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gallego et al., 2017</xref>). Recent work has suggested that some types of learning are associated with a reconfiguration of this low-dimensional structure, allowing the brain to generate new patterns of off-manifold activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oby et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we wondered whether differences in the rate of learning and relearning during sensorimotor adaptation could be explained by differences in the generation of off-manifold activity in cognitive and sensorimotor networks; and, if so, whether differences in cognitive and sensorimotor excursion are associated with distinct patterns of subject performance.</p><p>We used fMRI to study changes in intrinsic manifold structure during sensorimotor adaptation on 2 consecutive days. Analysis of subject behavior revealed three broad clusters of learners: Subjects who adapted and dea-dapted rapidly on both days; subject who adapted and de-adapted slowly on both days; and a third group of subjects who learned slowly on day 1, but de-adapted rapidly and relearned rapidly on day 2. We then examined excursions from intrinsic manifold structure in cognitive and sensorimotor networks (i.e., off-manifold activity) during learning, and found that the degree of excursion in these networks is related to differences in these group’s patterns of learning and relearning across days. Finally, to further characterize these changes, we analyzed functional network structure across learning epochs by embedding networks from each subject and learning phase of the task into a common space. Together, our findings suggest that excursion from intrinsic manifold structure provides an index of the relative engagement of distributed brain networks during learning, and that fast versus slow patterns of learning across days are associated with different reconfiguration processes of cognitive and sensorimotor systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study adaptation learning, subjects (<italic>N</italic> = 32) performed a visuomotor rotation (VMR) task on 2 consecutive days, requiring them to launch a cursor to intercept a stationary target by applying a brief, isometric directional force pulse on an MRI-compatible force sensor. The task structure on each day was identical: After a series of baseline trials (baseline epoch), the mapping between force and cursor motion was rotated clockwise by 45°, such that subjects had to learn to counteract the rotation in order to successfully hit the target. Following this learning epoch, the rotation was removed (washout epoch) to allow subjects to de-adapt before relearning on the second day (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> for trial structure).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Adaptation task and analysis approach for the neural data.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Visuomotor rotation (VMR) trial structure.

(<bold>b</bold>) We studied the degree to which learning is associated with the generation of novel patterns of neural activity by estimating resting-state manifolds for each subject, and then calculating the magnitude of the off-manifold component of the BOLD signal at each imaging volume during task. This measure, which we call <italic>excursion</italic>, provides a moment-by-moment index of functional reconfiguration of a brain network over the course of learning. (<bold>c</bold>) We studied functional network structure during baseline, early, and late learning on each day (mean subject learning curves shown on left over these epochs) by estimating covariance matrices from the mean BOLD signals extracted from cognitive and motor regions of interest (ROIs).

We then jointly embedded networks estimated during each learning epoch into a common space in order to characterize changes in network structure over the time course of learning.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74591-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Here, we took two approaches to study neural changes associated with learning. First, we examined learning-induced changes in cognitive and sensorimotor network structure (i.e., following the onset of the VMR) using a neural manifold approach inspired by the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadtler et al., 2014</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shine et al., 2019</xref>. This allowed us to study the degree to which activity in each network during learning deviates from its intrinsic manifold structure, assessed during a prior resting-state scan — a measure which we will hereby refer to as <italic>excursion</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We then related the degree of this neural excursion in the cognitive and sensorimotor brain networks to subjects’ patterns of learning performance within and across days. Second, we examined changes in functional network structure during learning by estimating covariance networks from the cognitive and sensorimotor regions during the baseline, early, and late learning epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We then derive a low-dimensional embedding of these networks, which allows us to directly characterize subject differences in network structure across each of these epochs of the task, as well as across days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clustering of behavior reveals qualitatively distinct groups of learners across days</title><p>Mean error curves across subjects for each day are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> (top), confirming that subjects successfully reduced their error over the course of the learning epoch. Since a full characterization of subject performance would require summarizing rates of learning, unlearning, and the total adaptation on both days (along with other features of performance, e.g., reaction times, which have been linked to distinct cognitive or motor processes), here we sought an interpretable, low-dimensional summary amenable to simple statistical analysis. This approach was motivated by our observation that standard summary measures generally failed to capture overall performance patterns across both days (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Standage et al., 2020</xref>). For example, ‘savings’, the difference in early learning performance across days, failed to distinguish between subjects who learned the rotation rapidly on both days versus those who learned and relearned slowly. Similarly, early learning did not distinguish between subjects who adapted and de-adapted slowly on the first day versus those who learned slowly but showed performance features similar to fast learners by the end of the first day. In order to properly profile these differences in performance, we clustered individual subjects by early error on days 1 and 2 (defined as the mean error over the first 4 eight-trial blocks of the rotation phase), along with savings (the difference in early error across days). This clustering revealed three distinct subgroups of learners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), which corresponded to subjects who exhibited fast learning on both days (FF, <italic>N</italic> = 16), slow learning on both days (SS, <italic>N</italic> = 9), and slow learning on day 1 but fast learning on day 2 (SF, <italic>N</italic> = 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We evaluated this cluster solution using the procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimes et al., 2017</xref>. For numbers of clusters between 2 and 8, we computed the ratio of within/between cluster sums of squares and compared this to a null model of a multivariate normal distribution with covariance equal to the observed covariance between variables. Based on these simulations, we judged that a three cluster solution best explained the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, bottom). This clustering solution had the dual benefit of both capturing the dominant patterns of variability in subject performance, and of producing a simple performance measure that could be compared to each subject’s neural data.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Clustering reveals three distinct groups of learners across days.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) (Top) Mean angle error during baseline, rotation, and washout on both days.

In the context of the VMR task, this includes the use of a re-aiming strategy, in which a subject aims so as to counteract the rotation applied to the cursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>). One possible interpretation of the SF group’s performance is that they adopt an explicit strategy early during day 2, after learning largely implicitly on day 1. Another alternative is that this group learns explicitly, even on day 1, but employs an explicit strategy either poorly or too late to reduce their early error. This second possibility is supported by similarity between the FF and SF groups later on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>): both groups show comparable performance during late learning and washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The FF and SF groups also display relatively long reaction times compared to the SS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), which have been associated with explicit strategy use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haith et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As explicit learning is believed to be highly cognitive, we may expect that the rapid learning exhibited by the FF group would be associated with the greater recruitment of cognitive brain regions outside of traditional sensorimotor networks, commonly associated with adaptation to sensorimotor errors. Moreover, if the late performance of the SF group on day 1 is indeed reflective of explicit strategy use, we might expect to see similar patterns of neural recruitment between the FF and SF groups.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FF and SF groups show greater excursion from intrinsic manifold structure at the onset of learning</title><p>In order to quantify the engagement of cognitive and sensorimotor systems during learning (and, in particular, at the onset of the VMR), we developed a novel measure, called <italic>excursion</italic>, quantifying the degree to which the functional organization of these networks deviates from the structure present during rest. Our approach is motivated by recent neural recording work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadtler et al., 2014</xref>) investigating whether deviations from low-dimensional manifold structure are related to the capacity for learning, as well as fMRI work investigating how these deviations relate to task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shine et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We first defined cognitive and sensorimotor networks using the whole-brain parcellation proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seitzman et al., 2020</xref>, comprising 300 regions of interest (ROIs) across the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, and assigned functional classifications according to the parcellation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Power et al., 2011</xref>. Given that nearly every part of the brain can be said to be involved in ‘cognition’ in some capacity, we simplified our division of motor versus cognitive networks such that it distinguished between higher-order association areas implicated in attention and cognitive control (frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and ventral attention networks, FP, DA and VA, respectively; 62 ROIs), and regions primarily involved in the control and generation of movement (somatomotor dorsal and somatomotor lateral networks, SMD and SML, respectively; 51 ROIs). We note that our cognitive network comprises a large part of what has been characterized as the ‘multiple-demand system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duncan, 2010</xref>) in frontal and parietal cortex, which has been associated with diverse cognitive processes and the implementation of strategies. The DA and VA networks in particular have been implicated in motor inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hsu et al., 2020</xref>) and in the reorienting of spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>), both processes of which are involved in explicit strategy use during VMR learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Brouwer et al., 2018</xref>). A more exploratory analysis, comprising the individual functional networks making up the Seitzman parcellation, is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We used principal component analysis (PCA) to estimate a low-dimensional subspace capturing the dominant patterns of BOLD signal covariance in each network during each subject’s resting-state scan. We then examined excursions from this intrinsic structure during the VMR task, defined as the proportion of the BOLD signal activation vector which lies off of the subject’s intrinsic manifold. This measure provides an index of the degree to which activation within the cognitive and sensorimotor networks deviate from the structure present during rest. For each subject, we computed this neural excursion at each timepoint (imaging volume) in the cognitive and sensorimotor networks on each day. We then baseline-centered these excursion curves in order to isolate changes in excursion during the learning phase (see Materials and methods for a more detailed description).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> shows the mean excursion across subjects in the cognitive and sensorimotor networks on each day.

Note the peak in excursion after rotation onset on day 1, most prominent in frontal and parietal cognitive networks. We also observed sustained excursion in the visual network (comprising V1 and its periphery). Although we cannot speak definitively as to its cause, it may reflect some degree of top-down modulation of the visual cortex during adaptation, so as to orient spatial attention away from the location of the stimulus, or visual feedback processing (such as the feedback related to visual errors). We also contrast the high excursion in the ventral attention network (VAN) with the near absence in the dorsal attention network (DAN). In our embedding of the cognitive network, both components predominantly encoded changes in functional connectivity between the DAN and frontoparietal networks (FPN), with the VAN loading relatively weakly. Together, these results may suggest that excursion in our cognitive network reflects excursion in the VAN and FPN individually, or in the connectivity between FPN and DAN. We note that the DAN is frequently implicated in the top-down orientation of spatial attention, and so the change in functional connectivity between DAN and FPN may reflect the learning of the visuomotor rotation.

To this end, we used multivariate functional principal component analysis (mfPCA) to derive a low-dimensional summary of the main patterns of excursion across individual subjects during learning.

As each subject contributes four excursion curves – one for each network and each day – we used mfPCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Happ and Greven, 2018</xref>) to summarize the dominant patterns of excursion across days and networks. Based on variance explained by each component, we retained three components for analysis, which together describe 77% of the variance across all excursion curves. Each of these components describes a characteristic pattern of excursion, represented as a deviation from the overall mean. Note that the identification of these components was done over all subjects, and thus is agnostic to group membership (i.e., FF versus SS versus SF subjects).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Functional principal component analysis (fPCA) of network excursion data.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) An example illustration of fPCA.

In this example, the first component encodes whether the curve is higher or lower than average, while the second encodes a sinusoidal pattern in which the curve begins higher or lower than average, and then reverses direction. The score associated with a component then describes the degree to which that component is expressed in a particular observation (third row).

These results are consistent with the idea that the rapid learning exhibited by the FF group involves the recruitment of cognitive brain regions outside the sensorimotor cortices. The fact that the SF group expresses a similar excursion profile on day 1 lends evidence to the interpretation that the SF does indeed engage cognitive learning processes on day 1, as reflected in their late performance, but merely fails to learn a strategy early enough to bring down their early error.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FF and SF groups show similar changes in cognitive network structure during learning</title><p>We now turn our attention to the interpretation of the patterns of neural excursion described in the previous section.

To remove these subject-specific differences prior to analysis, we centered each subject’s task-related covariance matrices with respect to their resting-state covariance matrix using a procedure modelled after the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhao et al., 2018</xref> (a full description is given in the Materials and methods). To illustrate the effect of this centering procedure – and why it is critical for investigating any learning-related effects here – we used uniform manifold approximation (UMAP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>) to project the individual covariance matrices into two dimensions, both before and after centering. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6b</xref>, prior to the centering, the network structure is completely dominated by subject-level clustering, with no hint of any task-related structure (i.e., separation of baseline, early, and late learning).

Notably, the VA network loads relatively weakly on both of these components, suggesting that connectivity both within and between this network may not be strongly modulated by task. In order to assess whether these components – and in particular, the latter component, which spans large portions of the cortex – are simply reflective of brainwide changes in the BOLD signal associated with learning, we examined the mean BOLD amplitude across the learning block, as well as within each epoch (baseline, early, and late learning). The data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.

In particular, consistent with the idea that the FF and SF recruit their cognitive systems in a similar fashion, we find that both groups show greater functional connectivity within and between the DA and FP networks (cognitive component 2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prior work has shown that some neural activity patterns are more difficult to generate than others, and that this constrains learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadtler et al., 2014</xref>. Here, using human fMRI and by investigating changes in cognitive and sensorimotor network structure during sensorimotor adaptation, we asked whether similar principles might also account for individual differences in learning. Clustering of subject learning data revealed distinct profiles of learning, including a group which adapted rapidly on both days, achieving near-complete reduction of error during late learning, as well as rapid de-adaptation (FF), and a group which adapted and de-adapted slowly on both days (SS). The performance patterns exhibited by the FF group, including rapid learning, unlearning, and relearning, are consistent with the use of an explicit cognitive strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Brouwer et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, we also observed a third group of subjects (SF), who displayed large early errors and slow adaptation during the first day, but also showed comparable rates of de-adaptation to the FF group, and rapid readaptation on the second day. We interpreted this as evidence that the SF group may have been attempting the use of cognitive re-aiming strategies during initial learning, but that it took them longer to figure out the appropriate strategy. Consistent with this idea, the embedding of subject cognitive networks revealed that network structure in the FF and SF groups were highly similar during learning across both days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). In particular, both groups showed high expression of a component encoding an increase in connectivity within and between the FP and DA networks. Our excursion analysis further revealed that these groups’ cognitive networks exhibited greater excursion from intrinsic network structure during the learning phase, after onset of the VMR. Taken together, these results suggest that both the FF and SF groups, who display behavioral characteristics consistent with the use of explicit, cognitive strategy use, engage their cognitive brain networks in a manner that is distinct from gradual learners, and to a greater degree.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cognitive and sensorimotor network structure during learning</title><p>Our cognitive network embedding revealed a pair of components encoding, predominantly, connectivity within and between FP and DA networks. The first of these components appeared to encode a decrease in connectivity within the DA network but an increase in connectivity between the FP and DA networks. This component showed a decrease in expression from early to late learning in all three behavioral groups, suggesting that it may reflect a general feature of learning or task performance (e.g., decreasing errors). The second component, encoding an increase in connectivity both within and between the FP and DA networks, was more strongly expressed in both the FF and SF groups than in the SS group. The DA network in particular is implicated in the top-down orientation of spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>), and is known to be modulated by the FP network during goal-directed cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spreng et al., 2013</xref>). The increase in connectivity within and between these networks in the FF and SF groups may then reflect the deliberate reorienting of attention during task performance, which would be consistent with the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Brouwer et al., 2018</xref>, that explicit learners alter their gaze behavior to reflect their intended aim direction in response to a VMR. The DA network has also been implicated in motor inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hsu et al., 2020</xref>), which in the VMR task is thought to be essential for the initial suppression of a motor response to the actual target prior to implementation of a re-aiming strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drummond et al., 2015</xref>). The reduced connectivity in the DA network in the SS compared to the FF/SF groups might then reflect weaker engagement of this system. This would also be consistent with the shorter response times in SS, as this initial inhibition and the successful deployment of a re-aiming strategy are believed to require longer preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It is notable that subcortical and cerebellar regions loaded relatively weakly on the components extracted in both the cognitive and sensorimotor networks. This, however, should not be taken to suggest that these regions are not functionally engaged during learning, as the cerebellum in particular is known to play a key role in sensorimotor adaptation. Rather, because our components reflect <italic>changes</italic> in functional connectivity with respect to rest, it may suggest that the ways in which these regions are situated in the cognitive and sensorimotor networks are similar across task and rest, or that changes in functional connectivity are relatively larger within cortical networks. In our cognitive network, both components reflected changes in connectivity within and between cortical FP and DA regions, which may suggest that these regions drive the majority of functional reconfiguration during our task.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neural excursions from manifold structure</title><p>Low-dimensional structure in the activity of local neural populations is generally believed to result from the underlying network organization, with structural connections imposing strong constraints on the activity patterns expressible by the network. Several authors, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadtler et al., 2014</xref>, have suggested that this structure may, in turn, impose constraints on learning, such that behaviors requiring the generation of on-manifold activity are learned more quickly than behaviors requiring novel, off-manifold activation. Although whole-brain fMRI BOLD activity is likewise known to display low-dimensional structure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2020</xref>), its origins are likely to involve not only the underlying structural connectivity, but also shared function, shared sensory input, and correlations introduced by shared activation during cognitive tasks. In the context of large-scale brain networks, then, excursion from resting manifold structure is likely to reflect, at least partly, a change in the functional organization of these networks.</p><p>We observed a large spike in excursion after rotation onset, located predominantly in the cognitive networks, and which was largest on the first day. This spike was most prominent in the FF and SF groups, which show behavioral traits consistent with explicit learning. The excursion does not appear to be a response to error, as the SS group showed less cognitive excursion than both the FF and SF groups, despite greater errors on both days. Nor does it appear to reflect the pure recall of a strategy itself, as the spike was dampened in the FF group on the second day, while being maintained in the SF group. This may suggest that the excursion reflects cognitive network engagement involved in the learning or refinement of an explicit strategy, and not in the recall or implementation of the strategy itself.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>Our characterization of brain network structure during VMR learning comes with a few caveats. First, we consider cognitive and sensorimotor networks separately, while ignoring possible functional interactions between them. In truth, sensorimotor regions receive substantial top-down modulation from higher-order cognitive regions, and these connections are likely essential for successful learning and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mars et al., 2011</xref>). Our decision to treat these networks separately was motivated largely by interpretability: Whole-brain networks spanning multiple functional domains are more difficult to analyze and summarize, and because our hypotheses concerned the role of higher-order cognitive regions specifically, their separation from sensorimotor regions allowed us to more directly probe the structure of these networks during learning. It is worth noting that our fPCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) of subject excursion revealed higher excursion in sensorimotor as well as cognitive networks in FF and SF learners, which suggests a functional reconfiguration of sensorimotor network structure in explicit learners. This may itself be partly a consequence of a change in cognitive networks, and a resulting change in the functional connections between cognitive and sensorimotor regions.</p><p>Second, while our joint embedding and our excursion measure probe the static and dynamic structure of cognitive and sensorimotor networks during learning, respectively, they do so in slightly different ways, and their respective conclusions are difficult to directly compare. Specifically, our excursion measure isolates the off-manifold component of the BOLD signal, and so quantifies the degree to which a brain network exhibits covariance patterns qualitatively different from rest; though it doesn’t provide a characterization of the nature of the difference (though this is also true in the neural manifold work of, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadtler et al., 2014</xref>). The embedding, by contrast, is conducted on the centered tangent vectors encoding differences in covariance relative to rest, which include both on-manifold (a change in expression of components already present during rest) and off-manifold components. It is not necessarily the case, then, that the components extracted by our embedding describe the changes in network structure underlying the increase in excursion during learning. Future work will be required to establish this relationship. Moreover, excursion allows for a moment-by-moment characterization of changes in network structure, whose time course may not be fully captured by the windows we have used for our embedding.</p><p>Finally, although we interpret several features of subject performance, such as rapid learning, savings, and long reaction times, as reflecting explicit, cognitive learning, our study lacked a direct assay of subjects’ explicit strategy. This is often assayed through the incorporation of report trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>), in which subjects are periodically asked to report their aim direction prior to performing a movement. The difference between the target location and reported aim direction then provides a direct measure of a subject’s explicit knowledge, which might have allowed stronger claims about the relationship between explicit strategy use and the structure of cognitive brain networks. However, there is considerable evidence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Brouwer et al., 2018</xref>) that these trials can alter subject performance on the task and magnify the use of these strategies. Moreover, their inclusion may have contaminated the neuroimaging data, which would then reflect not only the performance of the main task, but also the secondary reporting task. For these reasons, report trials were not included. Nevertheless, subject reports strongly correlate both with our measures of error and other assays of explicit learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Brouwer et al., 2018</xref>), and measures such as savings and learning rate are linked to explicit learning processes by a large literature, both behavioral and computational (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDougle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morehead et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Forty right-handed individuals between the ages of 18 and 35 (M = 22.5, SD = 4.51; 13 males) participated in the study and received financial compensation for their time.

A white target circle (30-pixel radius) appeared at one of eight locations (0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315°) on an invisible ring around the central position (300-pixel radius) and filled in (white) following a 200 ms delay. Once launched, the cursor would travel the 300-pixel distance to the ring over a 750 ms period (with a bell-shaped velocity profile) before becoming stationary at the ring to provide participants with end-point error feedback. If the cursor overlapped with the target to any extent, the target would become green, signifying a target ‘hit’. Each trial was separated by 4 s and within this period, participants had 2.6 s from target presentation to complete the trial (including the 200 ms target delay, participants’ own reaction time, and the 750 ms cursor movement; any remaining time was allotted to providing the end-point error feedback). At 2.6 s the trial was ended, the screen was blanked, the data saved, and participants would briefly wait for the next trial to begin. Reaction times were not stressed in this experimental procedure. On trials in which the reaction time exceeded 2.6 s, the trial would end, and the participant would wait for the next trial to begin. These discarded trials were rare (0.56% across all trials, all participants) and were excluded from behavioral analyses, but were kept in the neuroimaging analysis due to the continuous nature of the fMRI task and our focus on functional connectivity analyses.</p><p>During each testing session, 120 baseline trials (15 sets of eight trials) were completed without a rotation of the cursor. Following these trials, 320 learning trials (40 sets of eight trials) were completed, wherein a 45° clockwise rotation of the cursor was applied. The baseline and learning trials were completed during one continuous fMRI scan. Following this scan, conditions were restored to baseline (i.e., no rotation of cursor) in a separate scan and participants performed 120 washout trials. These washout trials allowed us to probe participants’ rate of relearning 24 hr later (and thus, their savings). In addition to these VMR-related task components, we also interspersed three 6 min resting-state fMRI scans prior to, between, and following VMR learning and washout. During these resting-state scans, participants were instructed to rest with their eyes open, while fixating a central cross location presented on the screen.

Additionally, because subjects occasionally had difficulty utilizing the force sensor, leading to trials in with extreme cursor deviations (e.g., in the opposite direction of the target), we performed outlier removal by first detrending each block by subtracting a smoothed error curve estimated using a cubic spline basis with one knot per 40 trials, and then excluding those trials more than 3 standard deviations from the fitted curve.

First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <italic>fMRIPrep</italic>. The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greve and Fischl, 2009</xref>). Co-registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. Head motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>). BOLD runs were slice-time-corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20160207 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox and Hyde, 1997</xref>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_005927">SCR_005927</ext-link>). The BOLD time-series, were resampled to surfaces on the following spaces: <italic>fsaverage</italic>. The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying a single, composite transform to correct for head motion and susceptibility distortions. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as <italic>preprocessed BOLD in original space</italic>, or just <italic>preprocessed BOLD</italic>. The BOLD time-series were resampled into several standard spaces, correspondingly generating the following <italic>spatially normalized, preprocessed BOLD runs</italic>: MNI152NLin6Asym, MNI152NLin2009cAsym. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <italic>fMRIPrep</italic>. Automatic removal of motion artifacts using independent component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pruim et al., 2015</xref>) was performed on the <italic>preprocessed BOLD on MNI space</italic> time-series after removal of non-steady-state volumes and spatial smoothing with an isotropic, Gaussian kernel of 6 mm FWHM (full-width half-maximum). Corresponding ‘non-aggresively’ denoised runs were produced after such smoothing. Additionally, the ‘aggressive’ noise regressors were collected and placed in the corresponding confounds file. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the <italic>preprocessed BOLD</italic>: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS, and three region-wise global signals. FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in <italic>Nipype</italic> (following the definitions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Power et al., 2014</xref>). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (<italic>CompCor</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behzadi et al., 2007</xref>). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the <italic>preprocessed BOLD</italic> time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128 s cut-off) for the two <italic>CompCor</italic> variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 5% variable voxels within a mask covering the subcortical regions. This subcortical mask is obtained by heavily eroding the brain mask, which ensures it does not include cortical GM regions. For aCompCor, components are calculated within the intersection of the aforementioned mask and the union of CSF and WM masks calculated in T1w space, after their projection to the native space of each functional run (using the inverse BOLD-to-T1w transformation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the <italic>k</italic> components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components’ time-series are sufficient to explain 50% of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time-series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Satterthwaite et al., 2013</xref>).

As all methods returned similar results, we report the results with a threshold of 75% as a median compromise. The resting-state scan was chosen over the baseline epoch of the task in order to avoid the following possible confound: As the end of the baseline block corresponds precisely with the onset of rotation, it is difficult to disentangle a change in excursion due to (1) introduction of the VMR itself versus (2) the jump expected due to the fact that we are now considering out-of-sample imaging volumes. Because PCA maximizes variance explained <italic>in-sample</italic>, we would expect larger excursions in out-of-sample observations, even if they were generated by the same process.

In order to remove static subject difference, we then applied a translation to each subject’s covariance matrices so that their resting-state covariance aligned with the grand mean resting-state covariance. For data lying in Euclidean space, this could be accomplished by subtracting, from each covariance matrix, the difference between corresponding subject’s resting covariance and the grand mean resting covariance. But because the space of covariance matrices is a Riemannian manifold (and, moreover, because the difference between two covariance matrices is not necessarily a covariance matrix), we must adopt another approach. Intuitively, we flatten out the space in a neighborhood of each subject’s resting-state covariance, so that the difference between each task covariance matrix and resting state is given by a vector (strictly, a symmetric matrix), which can be added and subtracted normally. We then transport these vectors to the grand mean covariance in a way which preserves their direction. We then project these vectors back onto the space of covariance matrices, giving a ‘centered’ matrix which encodes an identical change in covariance structure, but now with respect to the grand mean. More formally, we project each subject’s task matrices onto the tangent space at their resting-state covariance matrix using the matrix logarithm, transport these tangent vectors to the grand mean, and then exponential map back onto the space of covariance matrices. A high-level overview of these techniques is given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">You and Park, 2021</xref>, although we describe the relevant calculations below.</p><p>The procedure is as follows.

This embedding reveals that centering was successful in eliminating static differences in covariance and in isolating the effect of task condition.</p><p>For the embedding, rather than modelling the centered covariance matrices themselves, we focused our analysis on the centered tangent vectors, which can be interpreted as differences in covariance relative to resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Varoquaux et al., 2010</xref>). We then constructed weighted, signed graphs from these tangent vectors, and derived a joint two-dimensional embedding of the graphs in each network using the model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2019</xref>. Intuitively, the embedding seeks a two-dimensional representation of the ROIs in each network, with each individual observation (group, scan, day) receiving a score indicating the degree to which it expresses each component of the embedding. These components are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, while scores for each observation are given in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data availability</title><p>All behavioral and imaging data (including T1w and functional scans) are hosted in a repository at OpenNeuro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Standage et al., 2022</xref>, accession number ds004021).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Timothy Verstynen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Chris Baker as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript describes a fascinating experiment looking at gross network dynamics across cognitive and motor circuits and across different stages of learning, during an adaptive visuomotor learning experiment in the MRI environment. The authors found that there were reliable &quot;excursions&quot; from low-dimensional network states that are associated with learning, primarily in cognitive networks, and that this excursion metric is a reliable indicator of differences in learning.</p><p>All three reviewers thought this was a very well designed study, with sophisticated analyses designed to ask deep questions about the nature of brain network interactions during motor skill learning. This is reflected in the reviews (shown below). There are a few points of clarification, however, that need to be resolved before publication.</p><p>Here I provide a singular consolidated review, along 3 major themes, for guidance with your revisions. You can feel free to organize your replies around the consolidated review.</p><p>General concerns</p><p>1. Manuscript logic</p><p>Reviewer 1 felt that the manuscript describes essentially 2 phases of inquiry: (1) do excursions of network states, during the task, from resting-state baselines, associate with learning? and (2) if so what are the characteristics of these network changes in motor and cognitive networks? Yet the logic of first identifying an effect and then characterizing it is reversed in the manuscript. The authors start by carefully explaining how cognitive and motor subnetworks vary across learning, with cognitive networks having more consistent shifts across groups, and ‘then’ highlight how deviations from resting states correlates with learning and distinguishes learning groups. This seems to put the cart before the horse.</p><p>Reviewer 2 also wondered about the restriction to motor and cognitive subnetworks, wondering at times how other networks that might be involved in the task (e.g., visual regions for the perception of the stimuli; or endogenous attentional regions that might have otherwise impacted the performance, and hence would need to be inhibited in order to promote effective performance) may have been associated with the task. Have the authors analysed data outside of the selected ROIs? And do these regions conform to expectation?</p><p>2. Groups</p><p>Reviewer 1 thought that the stratification of the three learning groups, based on behavioral performance, feels a little post hoc, particularly given the sample size of the study. It is particularly odd given how the excursion metrics are calculated on a per-subject basis, which would be perfect for a true individual differences analysis. Was a subject-wise association analysis performed and failed? If the goal is to look at individual differences in learning driven by excursions from a resting null state, it seems like a subject-by-subject comparison is more intuitive. Of course, if the sample size is too small for such analysis and stratification based on learning style increases sensitivity, then that is fine (it happens with pesky imaging studies). The authors should, at a minimum, address why this was not done.</p><p>This was mirrored in Reviewer 3's concerns as well. The reviewer points out that this manuscript sets out to address how brain dynamics underlie individual differences in learning, but these remain addressed largely as two separate questions: (1) what are the differences amongst participants (with compelling finding of distinct subgroups)? (2) what is the underlying brain dynamics. While the latter question is analysed by splitting individuals into subgroups, the results do not present compelling evidence of group differences. Most of the metrics show no differences amongst the groups or very subtle differences (e.g. differences in cognitive network embedding in Figure 3g), which are commonly only descriptive and not backed up with the necessary statistics. This may be because of a relatively small sample size (N=32) which is likely insufficient to address the question of intersubject variation with sufficient power. It is therefore difficult to say if the presented findings are evidence of absence of group differences or absence of evidence for intersubject variation. In light of this, the title of the manuscript seems misleading, as the manuscript does not present convincing evidence of how 'neural excursions from low-dimensional manifold structure explain intersubject variation in human motor learning'. Therefore, the link between intersubject differences and network dynamics should be made stronger to reflect the abstract, title and interpretation, or the two questions (on behavioural differences and network dynamics) should be addressed separately.</p><p>3. Analysis</p><p>Reviewer 1 felt that the manifold analysis is incredibly interesting and appears to yield fascinating learning dynamics (particularly the mfPCA results in Figure 6). However, a careful read of the methods leads to many questions. For example, it is not intuitively clear how the authors get to the form of the tangent vector in Eq. 1. Also, it is not clear if the weight graphs (Figures 3 &amp; 4) are derived from the tangent vectors (T) or the projection into the covariance matrices (S)? What is &quot;x_t&quot; in the excursion calculations? Is P^{on} just a norm on the PCA components? Why use a mixture of linear and non-linear methods to find low dimensional subspaces? Given the novelty of the approach, understanding these steps is crucial for the reader to interpret the results.</p><p>This was echoed in Reviewer 2's concern as to why the authors chose to use UMAP (a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique) to demonstrate the utility of their mean-centering approach (which the reviewer found to be well-justified), but then later used a functional variant of PCA on the actual data themselves.</p><p>Along the same lines, Reviewer 1 felt that the resting state is used as the baseline by which deviances are estimated. Wouldn't the Baseline period during the task be a more appropriate baseline for looking at learning related changes? It seems like using rest, without the same sensory or motor engagement, would be the wrong way to isolate excursions from the manifold from learning alone.</p><p>This was echoed in Reviewer 3's comments as well. The network embedding analyses are performed by defining regions of interest (across cognitive and sensorimotor networks), followed by calculating the covariance matrix across defined regions in each learning stage, and contrasting the obtained matrices to the group average resting state. The authors justify well why centering to the group average resting state is necessary to remove subject-specific differences and focus on the learning-related changes. Yet, their subsequent assessment across the baseline/early/late stages allows for interpretations of only how the relative differences in the strength of (task)-components differs across learning compared to the resting state. Given the nature of the visuomotor rotation task, wouldn't the initial 'baseline' stage provide a more natural starting point to assess changes that occur with learning? This would also enable a more direct assessment of whether there is a reconfiguration of network dynamics after the onset of rotation, and how it unfolds during subsequent learning.</p><p>Reviewer 2 also wondered whether the increase in the diffuse cognitive component, in which covariance was relatively wide-spread across the cortical regions, may have been associated with a decrease in the BOLD signal as a function of improved performance? To this end, it could be useful for the authors to plot the raw BOLD (or β weights following a GLM) collapsed across the loadings of each of the eigenvectors. This would give the reader a sense of how the covariance related to recruitment, as covariance will increase regardless of whether pairs of regions both went up or both went down.</p><p>Reviewer 3 had similar concerns with the interpretation of the manifold analyses. The presented analyses on network dynamics are rigorous and justified, yet interpreting some of the presented results is not straightforward. For instance, in Figure 3e, it seems that the mean component effect for embedding of cognitive networks shows an effect where the network landscape initially moves away from 'baseline' to 'early' stage, and then reverses for 'late' stage such that late stage is more similar to baseline than to early stage on component 1. In the manuscript, only a comparison across the groups is interpreted (FF and SF groups showing more similar trajectories), but how does one interpret changes in the trajectories themselves? Could it be that the changes in relative connectivity within this component (the dorsoattentional network and between dorsoattentional and frontoparietal networks) reflects increases in error rate, or differences in reaction time?

There are many strengths here. My critique focuses only on the aspects of the study and manuscript that require clarity.</p><p>1. Manuscript logic</p><p>The manuscript describes essentially 2 phases of inquiry: (1) do excursions of network states, during the task, from resting-state baselines, associate with learning? and (2) if so what are the characteristics of these network changes in motor and cognitive networks? Yet the logic of first identifying an effect and then characterizing it is reversed in the manuscript. The authors start by carefully explaining how cognitive and motor subnetworks vary across learning, with cognitive networks having more consistent shifts across groups, and *then* highlight how deviations from resting states correlates with learning and distinguishes learning groups. This seems to put the cart before the horse.</p><p>2.

If the goal is to look at individual differences in learning driven by excursions from a resting null state, it seems like a subject-by-subject comparison is more intuitive. Of course, if the sample size is too small for such analysis and stratification based on learning style increases sensitivity, then that is fine (it happens with pesky imaging studies). The authors should, at a minimum, address why this was not done.</p><p>3. Analysis</p><p>The manifold analysis is incredibly interesting and appears to yield fascinating learning dynamics (particularly the mfPCA results in Figure 6). However, a careful read of the methods leads to many questions. For example, it is not intuitively clear how the authors get to the form of the tangent vector in Eq. 1. Also, it is not clear if the weight graphs (Figures 3 &amp; 4) are derived from the tangent vectors (T) or the projection into the covariance matrices (S)? What is &quot;x_t&quot; in the excursion calculations? Is P^{on} just a norm on the PCA components? Why use a mixture of linear and non-linear methods to find low dimensional subspaces? Given the novelty of the approach, understanding these steps is crucial for the reader to interpret the results.</p><p>Along the same lines, resting state is used as the baseline by which deviances are estimated. Wouldn't the Baseline period during the task be a more appropriate baseline for looking at learning related changes? It seems like using rest, without the same sensory or motor engagement, would be the wrong way to isolate excursions from the manifold from learning alone.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors use a set of dimensionality reduction techniques to analyse fMRI data collected while participants performed a sensorimotor adaptation task. They find evidence to suggest that the capacity for participants to learn the sensorimotor contingencies was associated with deviation from low-dimensional manifolds estimated from the data.</p><p>The manuscript was clearly presented, and the methodological choices were well-justified. There was a thorough review of the existing literature, focussing on how low-dimensional signatures estimated from neuroimaging data might relate to the capacity to learn sensorimotor contingencies in a research setting. The aims of the project were spelled out clearly, and the methods aligned well with the proposed goals of their study.</p><p>One aspect of the study that I enjoyed was the appreciation of the individual differences in learning rates. -While the group mean appeared to show a gradual increase in performance across the cohort, clustering of the trajectories revealed separable patterns of performance improvement which, if analysed en masse, may have led to erroneous conclusions regarding the neurobiological substrates of these effects. One side-effect of this approach is that it did render the Results quite complex, however the authors did a nice job of regularly referring back to the main point of the manuscript when relaying each set of results.</p><p>I was a little confused as to why the authors chose to use UMAP (a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique) to demonstrate the utility of their mean-centering approach (which I found to be well-justified), but then later used a functional variant of PCA on the actual data themselves.</p><p>I expect that this manuscript will have a positive effect on the field, as it links exciting dimensionality techniques to data recorded across the performance of an interesting cognitive task.</p><p>I did find myself wondering at times how other networks that might be involved in the task (e.g., visual regions for the perception of the stimuli; or endogenous attentional regions that might have otherwise impacted the performance, and hence would need to be inhibited in order to promote effective performance) may have been associated with the task. Have the authors analysed data outside of the selected ROIs? And do these regions conform to expectation?</p><p>I found myself wondering whether the increase in the diffuse cognitive component, in which covariance was relatively wide-spread across the cortical regions, may have been associated with a decrease in the BOLD signal as a function of improved performance? To this end, it could be useful for the authors to plot the raw BOLD (or β weights following a GLM) collapsed across the loadings of each of the eigenvectors. This would give the reader a sense of how the covariance related to recruitment, as covariance will increase regardless of whether pairs of regions both went up or both went down.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The present investigation aimed at investigating changes in brain dynamics that underlie motor learning, and how this relates to intersubject differences in learning.</p><p>The manuscript presents a learning fMRI study, employing the visuomotor rotation paradigm, which participants performed on two consecutive days. To assess differences in learning ability amongst participants, participants' performance is clustered based on behavioural measures of error and savings, which results in three distinct subgroups of learners. Then, the brain dynamics is assessed by estimating the covariance networks from cognitive and sensorimotor regions across different learning epochs. Several metrics are derived to explain how network dynamics changes with learning, finding especially differences within the 'cognitive' network. These metrics are also separately inspected across the three distinct subgroups with the aim to relate network dynamics to intersubject variation in learning ability.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The question on how brain dynamics change during learning is an important one, of potential interest to a broad audience. The authors utilize advanced and rigorous techniques to address this question. This has in the domain of motor learning, specifically on visuomotor rotation not been done and is therefore an important advancement of the field. Also dividing brain regions into 'motor' and 'cognitive' networks is relevant as several motor learning studies have demonstrated recently that 'motor' learning might be underpinned by substantial changes in regions traditionally regarded as 'cognitive'. Finally, the clustering of participants into distinct groups based on their learning ability is justified and a valid approach, especially for small sample sizes, to aim at investigating differences in learning ability across individuals. Despite many strengths of the manuscript, there are some outstanding concerns, especially pertaining to the interpretation of the link between brain dynamics and individual differences in learning.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1) First, this manuscript sets out to address how brain dynamics underlie individual differences in learning, but these remain addressed largely as two separate questions: 1) what are the differences amongst participants (with compelling finding of distinct subgroups), 2) what is the underlying brain dynamics. While the latter question is analysed by splitting individuals into subgroups, the results do not present compelling evidence of group differences. Most of the metrics show no differences amongst the groups or very subtle differences (e.g. differences in cognitive network embedding in Figure 3g), which are commonly only descriptive and not backed up with the necessary statistics. This may be because of a relatively small sample size (N=32) which is likely insufficient to address the question of intersubject variation with sufficient power. It is therefore difficult to say if the presented findings are evidence of absence of group differences or absence of evidence for intersubject variation. In light of this, the title of the manuscript seems misleading, as the manuscript does not present convincing evidence of how 'neural excursions from low-dimensional manifold structure explain intersubject variation in human motor learning'. Therefore, the link between intersubject differences and network dynamics should be made stronger to reflect the abstract, title and interpretation, or the two questions (on behavioural differences and network dynamics) should be addressed separately.</p><p>2) The presented analyses on network dynamics are rigorous and justified, yet interpreting some of the presented results is not straightforward. For instance, in Figure 3e, it seems that the mean component effect for embedding of cognitive networks shows an effect where the network landscape initially moves away from 'baseline' to 'early' stage, and then reverses for 'late' stage such that late stage is more similar to baseline than to early stage on component 1. In the manuscript, only a comparison across the groups is interpreted (FF and SF groups showing more similar trajectories), but how does one interpret changes in the trajectories themselves? Could it be that the changes in relative connectivity within this component (the dorsoattentional network and between dorsoattentional and frontoparietal networks) reflects increases in error rate, or differences in reaction time? There is potential to link these network metrics to subject performance which would help in interpreting the findings as well as relate them more closely to variation in performance.</p><p>3) The network embedding analyses are performed by defining regions of interest (across cognitive and sensorimotor networks), followed by calculating the covariance matrix across defined regions in each learning stage, and contrasting the obtained matrices to the group average resting state. The authors justify well why centering to the group average resting state is necessary to remove subject-specific differences and focus on the learning-related changes. Yet, their subsequent assessment across the baseline/early/late stages allows for interpretations of only how the relative differences in the strength of (task)-components differs across learning compared to the resting state. Given the nature of the visuomotor rotation task, wouldn't the initial 'baseline' stage provide a more natural starting point to assess changes that occur with learning? This would also enable a more direct assessment of whether there is a reconfiguration of network dynamics after the onset of rotation, and how it unfolds during subsequent learning.</p><p>It would be useful if the performed analyses / metrics were better justified or interpreted. For instance, in the functional PCA analysis (Figure 6) what is the interpretation of having a sinusoidal component? Is this in any way linked to the onset of rotation? If not, what would be the rationale of having such a component in the brain dynamics? What could this reflect?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74591.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>General concerns</p><p>1.

We have thus reordered these sections in the Results, and framed the embedding analysis more clearly as an effort to characterize the changes in network structure underlying the excursion effects observed in the first section.

We kindly ask the reviewers to see these modifications in the actual manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 also wondered about the restriction to motor and cognitive subnetworks, wondering at times how other networks that might be involved in the task (e.g., visual regions for the perception of the stimuli; or endogenous attentional regions that might have otherwise impacted the performance, and hence would need to be inhibited in order to promote effective performance) may have been associated with the task. Have the authors analysed data outside of the selected ROIs? And do these regions conform to expectation?</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 is right that similar questions could be asked of many networks, such as early visual regions essential for the perception of the stimulus and/or sensory feedback processing of errors, or e.g. middle temporal regions that may play a role in the recall of the task or strategy during relearning on the second day. Our decision to focus on sensorimotor and cognitive networks was motivated by two considerations: First, the division between implicit learning systems (supported by cortical and cerebellar sensorimotor systems), and explicit learning systems (supported by higher-order association regions) is clear in the VMR literature, and is essential for characterizing learning in this task. Our networks were thus targeted towards these systems in particular. Second, it was an attempt to simplify the analysis as much as possible (both statistically and conceptually), given the complexity of the data in general, and the limited sample size available in our study. In particular, we wished to avoid having to conduct separate analyses for a large number of networks, and then struggle to summarize the results in a way that was both acceptably powered and interpretable, and that, moreover, would allow us to link our findings to the existing literature on explicit vs. implicit learning processes. Given that the two networks under consideration can be linked to learning systems that are well understood in the context of the task, we felt that this was the appropriate level of complexity that could reasonably address our research question.</p><p>Nevertheless, we appreciate that the readers, in addition to this reviewer, might be interested in seeing the effects occurring outside of our selected subnetworks. To this end, as noted at the outset, we have created a new supplemental figure (Figure 3 – supplemental figure 1), wherein we show the excursion profiles on a network-by-network basis for the majority of the task-positive networks in the Seitzmann atlas. This figure includes excursion curves for each network individually, as well as mean excursion during early and late learning. Note that networks are ordered by early excursion in order to most clearly illustrate trends in excursion across networks. This analysis reveals large spikes in excursion after rotation onset in fronto-parietal, ventral-attention, and cingulo-opercular networks, as well as smaller and more sustained increases in excursion in sensorimotor and visual networks. In order to summarize these differences, we conducted a principal component analysis on early and late excursion in each network. We present the scores on each component for each subject, as well as group means, revealing that FF and SF subjects again display similar patterns of excursion, consistent with our analysis in the main manuscript.</p><p>To the reviewer's interest in visual regions specifically, note that we observe a sustained increase in excursion in the visual network (comprising V1 and surrounding regions) after rotation onset, most prominently on day 1. This excursion may reflect the perception of the target stimulus itself, or the visual error feedback received by participants, or the top-down modulation of these regions during learning. Any interpretation would, of course, be speculative, but it is nevertheless interesting. Another potential point of interest is the difference in excursion between the dorsal and ventral attention networks, which have frequently been implicated in the top-down and bottom-up orienting of attention, respectively. In our main analysis, we observed increased connectivity between dorsal attention and fronto-parietal networks, consistent with the top-down orienting of spatial attention during learning. Here, examining the two attention networks (dorsal vs. ventral) in isolation (i.e. not considering their interactions with other cognitive regions), we observe the greatest excursion in the ventral attention network. Although we are reluctant to speculate too deeply about these differences, it may be that this network -- which is implicated in the involuntary orientating of spatial attention -- becomes strongly engaged at the onset of the rotation, before being later suppressed during learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Groups</p><p>Reviewer 1 thought that the stratification of the three learning groups, based on behavioral performance, feels a little post hoc, particularly given the sample size of the study.

The authors should, at a minimum, address why this was not done.</p></disp-quote><p>The clustering of subject behavior was indeed post-hoc to the observation of the behavior itself, though not to the fMRI analysis. One of the challenges to conducting a more &quot;pure&quot; individual differences analysis is that it is not obvious, in this case, how an appropriate summary measure should be chosen. Subject behavior in the VMR task is often summarized using scalar measures like savings (the difference in early error between learning and relearning), but as we observe in our data, these measures do not do a good job of fully characterizing subject performance. For example, savings itself does not distinguish between subjects who learn rapidly on both days, and those who learn slowly on both days. Nor does early error, another common measure, distinguish between subjects who learn and unlearn slowly, and those who learn slowly but show behavioral characteristics (e.g., higher RTs) associated with explicit learners during late learning.</p><p>Characterizing subject performance in this task thus seems to be an inherently multivariate problem. It would be possible to assess subjects on a variety of measures, and correlate our neural measures with each of them separately. Or, alternatively, to conduct a more elaborate multivariate analysis (e.g. association analysis, or perhaps a canonical correlation analysis) in order to identify relationships between behavioral and neural features. But in that case we would indeed be stretching our sample size to the limit (as the reviewer points out), and these analyses would add complexity to an already complex analysis.</p><p>We view our clustering analysis as a simplified approach to this problem. We begin with a more complex, multivariate summary of subject behavior, and condense it down to broad categories. These clusters have the benefit of capturing the dominant patterns of variability in the data, of being clearly interpretable, and of reducing the complexity of the problem to a level that can be reasonably tackled at the sample sizes typical of an imaging study. Although we touched on some of these issues in the original version of the manuscript, we have revised the description of the behavioral analysis to make the reasons for these decisions more explicit. In particular, we now state:</p><p>“Since a full characterization of subject performance would require summarizing rates of learning, unlearning, and the total adaptation on both days (along with other features of performance, e.g. reaction times, which have been linked to distinct cognitive or motor processes), here we sought an interpretable, low dimensional summary amenable to simple statistical analysis. This approach was motivated by our observation that standard summary measures generally failed to capture overall performance patterns across both days (see also Standage et al., 2020). For example, 'savings', the difference in early learning performance across days, failed to distinguish between subjects who learned the rotation rapidly on both days versus those who learned and relearned slowly. Similarly, early learning did not distinguish between subjects who adapted and deadapted slowly on the first day versus those who learned slowly but showed performance features similar to fast learners by the end of the first day.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This was mirrored in Reviewer 3's concerns as well.

There is, of course, an argument to be made that using the baseline phase of the task as the manifold from which excursion is measured is more interpretable, and more directly assesses the deviations from manifold structure associated with the onset of rotation. However, it also introduces a key confound: As the end of the baseline block corresponds precisely with the onset of rotation, it is difficult to disentangle a jump in excursion due to (1) introduction of the visuomotor rotation itself versus (2) the jump expected due to the fact that we are now considering out-of-sample imaging volumes. Because PCA maximizes variance explained <italic>in-sample</italic>, we would expect larger excursions in out of sample observations, even if they were generated by the same process. That is, we would expect an increase in excursion during the learning block, even if network structure remained constant. Given this potential confound, we thus chose the resting state scan as the basis for our comparison.
