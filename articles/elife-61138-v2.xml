flow, resulting from accumulation of molecular mistakes. These mistakes ultimately give rise to debilitating disorders including skeletal muscle wasting, or sarcopenia. To derive a global metric of growing ‘disorderliness’ of aging muscle, we employed a statistical physics approach to estimate the state parameter, entropy, as a function of genes associated with hallmarks of aging. Escalating network entropy reached an inflection point at old age, while structural and functional alterations progressed into oldest-old age. To probe the potential for restoration of molecular ‘order’ and reversal of the sarcopenic phenotype, we systemically overexpressed the longevity protein, Klotho, via AAV. Klotho overexpression modulated genes representing all hallmarks of aging in old and oldest-old mice, but pathway enrichment revealed directions of changes were, for many genes, age-dependent. Functional improvements were also age-dependent. Klotho improved strength in old mice, but failed to induce benefits beyond the entropic tipping point.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>hallmarks of aging</kwd><kwd>klotho</kwd><kwd>muscle stem cells</kwd><kwd>sarcopenia</kwd><kwd>adeno-associated virus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG052978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ambrosio</surname><given-names>Fabrisia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG061005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ambrosio</surname><given-names>Fabrisia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001003</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ambrosio</surname><given-names>Fabrisia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcriptomic analysis using a novel information-based network entropy approach provides mechanistic insights into the ability of Klotho to successfully ameliorate age-related sarcopenia in old mice, but not oldest-old mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a universal process, and decades of research have gone into understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying aged tissue phenotypes. With the goal of conceptualizing common molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the effect of time’s arrow on mammalian tissue health, López-Otín et al. described nine ‘Hallmarks of Aging’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). These hallmarks are: epigenetic alterations, cellular senescence, altered intercellular communication, telomere attrition, nutrient sensing deregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, stem cell exhaustion, loss of proteostasis, and genomic instability. A criterion in the identification of these hallmarks was that aggravation or attenuation of the biological process results in an accelerated aging or more youthful phenotype, respectively. These hallmarks, therefore, have the potential to pave the way toward the development of therapeutic approaches to counteract the effect of aging on organismal health.</p><p>Numerous longitudinal aging studies have positively associated skeletal muscle health with healthspan and longevity, and skeletal muscle strength has even been shown to be a reliable predictor of biological age and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Voisin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Metter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frontera et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, an age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (i.e., sarcopenia) is associated with loss of mobility and increased fall risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kinney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Landi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Imagama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goodpaster et al., 2006</xref>). Tissue-level features of sarcopenia have been described extensively, and include a decreased myofiber size, increased intramuscular fat accumulation, a preferential atrophy of type II (fast-twitch) muscle fibers, and compromised function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Doherty, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Morley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Miljkovic et al., 2015</xref>). However, our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying sarcopenia is still lacking, a shortcoming that has hindered the development of targeted and specific interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Marzetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dhillon and Hasni, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Woo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Currently, approaches to the treatment and prevention of sarcopenia largely focus on the prescription of physical activity and dietary modifications, strategies that have shown moderate success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Morley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Waters et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Taaffe, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, proven pharmacological interventions for sarcopenia do not exist, although drugs such as vitamin D, insulin-like growth factors, testosterone, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC2), as well as monoclonal antibody treatments have entered advanced clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Woo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Drescher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rolland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2015</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01963598">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01963598</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02333331">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02333331</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02575235">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02575235</ext-link>). Interestingly, many of the drugs currently being tested also act on pathways associated with the longevity protein, α-Klotho (Klotho).</p><p>Klotho is best known for its role in delaying age-related pathologies in various organ systems, including skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kurosu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kuro-o et al., 1997</xref>). The pro-longevity effects of Klotho have been partially attributed to modulation of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), Wnt, and mTOR pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), several of which have also been a targets in sarcopenia research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Woo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yoshida et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">D'Antona and Nisoli, 2010</xref>). With age, circulating Klotho levels gradually decline, and epidemiological studies have revealed that decreased circulating Klotho levels are associated with an accelerated loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yamazaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Semba et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, mice deficient for Klotho display significant muscle wasting, which is hypothesized to be caused by increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sahu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Phelps et al., 2013</xref>). These findings are consistent with the observation that mitochondrial accumulation of ROS leads to a decline in muscle mass and decreased regenerative potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sahu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Leduc-Gaudet et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest an unexplored mechanistic link between sarcopenia and a decline of Klotho with increasing age.</p><p>In this study, we first thoroughly characterize and compare structural, functional, and transcriptomic changes in skeletal muscle across the lifespan in mice. In order to derive a global metric of the loss of molecular fidelity over time, we used an information-based calculation of network entropy from muscle RNA-﻿seq data. A higher network entropy means a probabilistically greater degree of disorganization, or randomness, in the system. We found that network entropy increases from young (4–6 months) to old (21–24 months) mice, but then plateaus in the oldest-old mice (27–29 months). We then tested the ability of AAV-mediated Klotho delivery (AAV-Kl) to attenuate these changes and counteract sarcopenia in old and oldest-old mice. The impact of AAV-Kl was age-dependent, and whereas old mice displayed a significant improvement in function, AAV-Kl failed to induce a benefit in the oldest-old mice. Furthermore, AAV-Kl regulated a multitude of genes associated with all hallmarks of aging. Unexpectedly, however, the direction of change in response to treatment was, for many genes, dependent on the age of the host. Taken together, these results suggest Klotho enhances skeletal muscle structure and function at the early stages of sarcopenia, but the beneficial effects are lost after the entropic inflection point.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sarcopenic changes are subtle until mice reach an advanced age</title><p>To thoroughly describe the trajectory of sarcopenic alterations according to sex and over time, we characterized muscle structure and function in young (3–6 months), middle-aged (10–14 months), old (21–24 months), and oldest-old (27–29 months) male and female C57BL/6J mice. Age groups were selected to parallel stratifications commonly used in epidemiological studies and correspond, roughly, to individuals aged 20–30, 38–47, 56–69, and 78 + years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dutta and Sengupta, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sayer et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, a progressive decline in tibialis anterior (TA) wet weight (normalized to body weight) was observed over time for both males and females, though the percent decrease at the oldest-old age was significantly greater in male mice (34%) when compared to females (17%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A decline in TA weight was concomitant with a decline in physiological cross-sectional area (CSA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Bulk decreases in size and cross-sectional area were accompanied by a decrease in individual myofiber cross-sectional area for both sexes, though declines were greater in female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The total number of muscle fibers did not change with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Myofiber typing was quantified by staining for myosin heavy chain markers of the dominant fiber types in mouse TA muscles. A decrease in the percentage of the more oxidative Type IIA and IIX muscle fibers was observed in the oldest-old, but not old, age group for both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These changes were accompanied by an increase in the percentage of the glycolytic Type IIB phenotype and a decrease in fiber area of all fiber types in oldest-old groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–G</xref>). These results are consistent with a loss of oxidative fiber types with age observed in previous murine studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augusto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Giacomello et al., 2020</xref>). We also observed increased intramuscular collagen deposition in the oldest-old age groups of both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Unexpectedly, there was no age-related increase in intermuscular lipid accumulation in either sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This contrasts with clinical reports of muscle quality in older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Doherty, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Morley et al., 2014</xref>). We did observe a small increase in intramuscular lipid only in old male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Finally, given that denervation commonly accompanies a sarcopenic profile in clinical populations, we probed transcript levels of common markers of muscle denervation (<italic>Musk</italic>, <italic>Ncam1</italic>, <italic>Runx1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aare et al., 2016</xref>) in young, middle-aged, old, and oldest-old skeletal muscle RNA-seq data that is publicly available through the Tabula Muris Senis (TMS) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Musk</italic> and <italic>Runx1</italic> displayed increased expression in oldest-old mice, although sex differences could not be determined due to inadequate power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Declines in muscle structure are subtle until advanced age.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tibialis anterior (TA) muscle weight as a percentage of whole-body weight in young (3–6 months), middle-aged (10-14 months), old (21-24 months), and oldest-old (27-29 months) male (N = 57) and female mice (N = 78, one-way ANOVAs).

Whereas this approach is valuable for identifying specific signaling pathways that may contribute to sarcopenia, it does not give an integrative view of underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Therefore, we employed a top-down approach, whereby we constructed interactomes according to muscle transcriptional profiles over time. It has been proposed that ‘the common denominator that underlies all modern theories of aging is change in molecular structure and, hence, function.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hayflick, 2007</xref>) Although the entropy theory of aging has existed for centuries, entropy has generally been considered in the context of thermodynamics (i.e., ‘dissipation’ of energy at the biomolecular level). While theoretically intriguing, this form of entropy is challenging to quantify. Given that the essence of entropy is a loss of information in a system, we estimated network entropy as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Menichetti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Menichetti and Remondini, 2014</xref>. To do this, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were generated from RNA-seq data across young, old, and oldest-old age groups. Given our focus on age-related alterations, only those genes associated with the hallmarks of aging were included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). In the network, nodes represent the corresponding proteins, edges represent the physical interaction of proteins, and edge weights represent the differential gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Genes associated with ‘stem-cell exhaustion’ largely overlapped with all other hallmarks, and, hence, were excluded from our analysis.</p><p>Consistent with PCA findings, but contrary to phenotypic changes, we observed the greatest increase in network entropy between young and old groups, with little difference between the old and the oldest-old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This suggests that gene expression changes likely precede the observed functional deficits in oldest-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The same entropy trend emerged even when all genes were considered, suggesting that the subset of genes associated with the hallmarks of aging captures the overall tissue transcriptomic profile without loss of information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the increase in entropy between young and old muscles was driven by a relatively small pool of genes that displayed a large magnitude of change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, there were many more DE genes when comparing old and oldest-old muscles, although the magnitudes of change were generally low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests a loss of specific changes and a broadening of gene expression alterations across the genome in the oldest-old age group. We cross-checked entropy trends in skeletal muscle of young, middle-aged, old, and oldest-old male mice using RNA-seq data available through the TMS database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike females, we saw that entropy continued to increase from old to oldest-old timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), which we found interesting considering that male mice showed less severe sarcopenic declines at the oldest-old age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Also interesting, entropy was lowest at the middle-aged timepoint, then gradually increased.</p><p>To probe the translational potential of the network entropy approach, we used open-source RNA-seq data from aging male rats and humans (SRA: PRJNA516151 and GSE164471) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shavlakadze et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tumasian et al., 2021</xref>). We did not present female data for either species due to a lack of sufficient sample sizes. In rats, entropy decreased from young to middle-age, after which time it increased into old age, consistent with the aforementioned trend observed in male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Oldest-old muscles were not available in rats. Entropy in humans similarly decreased from young adulthood into the fourth decade of life, after which time it increased, reaching a tipping point in the sixth decade of life, then decreasing slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). It is interesting to note that the entropic nadir in humans coincides with the commonly observed onset of sarcopenic declines in the fourth decade of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Walston, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yazar and Olgun Yazar, 2019</xref>). With the goal of providing the broader research community an easily accessible tool for estimating network entropy from transcriptomic and proteomic datasets, we created an open-source Python streamlit web-app (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://network-entropy-calculator.herokuapp.com/">https://network-entropy-calculator.herokuapp.com/</ext-link>).

This further implies a dysregulation of the transcriptomic profile in the oldest-old mice, a finding that is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cellerino and Ori, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>AAV-Klotho administration improves muscle regeneration after severe, but not exercise-induced, injury in old mice</title><p>Given that a criterion in the identification of aging hallmarks is a susceptibility to interventions that may aggravate or attenuate age-related declines, we next tested whether the declines in muscle function and structure observed in aged mice could be attenuated through Klotho supplementation. As a first step, we confirmed that circulating Klotho gradually declines with age in mice, consistent with human findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yamazaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In both sexes, we also observed a stepwise increase in circulating fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), a known co-factor for Klotho signaling and a key hormone in the regulation of mineral ions and vitamin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). It was interesting to note that circulating FGF23 levels in the oldest-old females clustered into two different groups, with approximately 40% of the population displaying very high levels compared to the more linearly increasing levels of the remaining mice.

We also evaluated the ability of AAV-Kl to attenuate a sarcopenic phenotype in both old and oldest-old mice. These studies were performed only in female mice, which we found to display age-associated declines in muscle quality and function that are more comparable to clinical indices of sarcopenia when compared to male counterparts. Interestingly, we found that Klotho overexpression enhanced muscle function in the old mice. Notably, Klotho overexpression in old mice reduced pathogenic expression of genes involved with cell structure, ion homeostasis, and signaling for muscle adiposity.

Future studies are needed to elucidate potential mechanisms by which the progression and severity of sarcopenia may be mediated by sex.</p><p>Clinical studies performed in older adults have suggested that loss of muscle function is predominantly a result of a loss of muscle quality, as opposed to a loss of muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goodpaster et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, in our study, age-related functional declines were not accompanied by a significant loss of muscle mass. Instead, muscle mass and myofiber area were, for the most part, preserved over time. Although muscle mass decreased by only approximately 10% between the old and oldest-old age groups, the accompanying decrease in peak force production was over two-fold greater.</p><p>Several transcriptional studies using functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes have reported that age-related changes play a key role in the progression of sarcopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shavlakadze et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zahn et al., 2006</xref>). In the current study, we built on the previous body of work by using an information-based approach to describe integrative changes in gene expression over time, as defined by network entropy. Although an aging system is not necessarily closed (a now overturned criteria for an entropic system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hayflick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Samaras, 1974</xref>), evaluation of the interconnectedness of the PPI interactome allows for a single, integrative metric to estimate the ‘disorderliness’ of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Menichetti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Menichetti and Remondini, 2014</xref>). We chose to use PPI network given that the network edges are based on experimentally validated interactions. As such, the PPI network allows visualization of the functional relationship between genes, an approach that has been used in several studies that explore the mechanism of complex diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zahn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Samaras, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shannon, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Teschendorff and Enver, 2017</xref>). In contrast, gene co-expression networks contain edges that are based on correlation coefficients between gene expression values. Despite the advantages, limitations in the PPI network include the fact that mapping of genes to proteins is not necessarily one-to-one in the PPI network. Moreover, there are a number of proteins for which PPI information has not been documented.</p><p>In our study, ‘disorderliness’ of the gene expression profiles over time is represented by the probability of a network connection, mathematically analogous to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shannon, 1948</xref> entropy. Similar to a previous report using microarray gene data from human circulating T-lymphocytes, we observed that network entropy increased from young to old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Menichetti et al., 2015</xref>). Comparable to entropy change estimates in the context of stem cell differentiation, cancer, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Menichetti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Teschendorff and Enver, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kannan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conforte et al., 2019</xref>), the absolute magnitude of entropy change in our study is small. Mathematically, this is not surprising given that the spatial network entropy represents the total number of possible configurations (i.e. the flexibility of the system), which has a magnitude on the order of 10<sup>6</sup>. The entropy of the network is dependent on the network architecture, which includes the number of nodes, the number of edges, and the edge weights (i.e. the difference in gene expression). Since fundamental features of network architecture remain relatively stable over time, the change in the magnitude of network entropy represents only a small fraction of all possible configurations (1.1%). However, this small percentage captures the change in expression of a large number of genes (~7600 genes), each of which has the potential to elicit a cascade of downstream phenotypic changes. Indeed, from a physiological perspective, there is growing evidence that very small-scale mRNA changes can lead to extreme changes at the level of protein expression and cellular phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ruzycki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>). In the context of cancer, for example, a single base mutation led to extensive cell remodeling that extended well beyond the predicted downstream responses, a so-called ‘butterfly effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hart et al., 2015</xref>). Others have similarly shown that cells display a sensitive dependence to initial conditions (in this case, gene expression), and that very small changes in transcriptional regulation and equilibrium may exert potent – perhaps even chaotic – impacts on disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Desi and Tay, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dorn, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Whereas T-lymphocytes displayed a sharp decline in entropy in the oldest-old group, potentially suggestive of a ‘survival effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Menichetti et al., 2015</xref>), we observed a plateau in entropy after old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hayflick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Menichetti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Samaras, 1974</xref>). The data suggest that this peak then plateau may result from a small subset of genes that display highly specific changes from young to old age, followed by a large number of small, non-specific changes between old and oldest-old ages. Our observation that network entropy in mice peaks at old age but that phenotypic changes are not prominent until later in life supports the hypothesis that phenotypic alterations are a lagging indicator of gene expression changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frenk and Houseley, 2018</xref>). Evaluation of entropy at additional time points across the lifespan would be valuable to better identify an optimal therapeutic window for sarcopenia. A therapeutic challenge lies in how to promote healthier aging and best address the root of these gene expression changes before a sarcopenic phenotype develops. Moreover, although here we focused on quantification of entropy at the gene-level, given the progressive loss of histological and functional muscle integrity, it would be interesting to determine whether entropy at the proteomic level (e.g. using mass spectrometry) is able to capture entropic changes even into very old age.</p><p>Given the aforementioned observations, we tested whether modulation of genes associated with the hallmarks of aging is capable of restoring a more youthful skeletal muscle profile. For this, we chose systemic overexpression of Klotho via AAV. AAV allows for consistent modulation of Klotho levels without the need for frequent re-administration and without the challenges of recombinant Klotho protein administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheikhi et al., 2019</xref>). Advanced clinical trials using a similar capsid construct are underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">George, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kishnani et al., 2019</xref>), demonstrating the potential translatability of this method. We found that AAV-Kl administration modulated all hallmarks of aging in old and oldest-old animals, although the magnitude of change was manifold times greater in the oldest-old mice. This enhanced response in oldest-old mice was not, however, accompanied by a greater therapeutic benefit. Instead, though we observed a significant increase in muscle function in old mice receiving AAV-Kl, intervention failed to produce a benefit in the oldest-old mice.</p><p>Observations of treatment resistance have been reported in advanced age and critically ill populations in other pharmaceutical treatment studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rennie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burd et al., 2013</xref>). In humans, dieting and exercise intervention studies reveal blunted muscle protein synthesis in an older population (greater than 60 years old) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breen and Phillips, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Durham et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, this coincides with the same stage in which we observed a tipping point in network entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The lack of beneficial response to treatment with increased age is hypothesized to stem from deficiencies in downstream anabolic pathways, that is ‘anabolic resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burd et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Glover et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burd et al., 2012</xref>). In order to identify potentially compromised signaling pathways in oldest-old mice that may preclude a therapeutic benefit of AAV-Kl administration, we compared KEGG pathway activation differences across treatment groups. Old and oldest-old mice displayed opposing responses to AAV-Kl in pathways associated with cellular structure, lipid membrane integrity, and intercellular communication. When we further probed age-dependent pathways that were responsive to Klotho treatment, we found that cytoskeletal signaling, calcium ion transport (cGMP-PKG signaling), and signaling for muscle adiposity (sphingolipid signaling) displayed biphasic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Overwhelmingly, the top GO terms for genes that were decreased by Klotho therapy in the old mice are potentially affected by aberrant FGF signaling, including genes associated with calcineurin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Soluble Klotho binds FGF23 to increase its affinity for FGFR1 and prevents its interaction with FGFR4 to reduce expression of the pathogenic calcineurin/NFAT transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ho and Bergwitz, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Han et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, FGF23/FGFR4 signaling is associated with muscle pathogenesis in the heart as well as renal fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hao et al., 2021</xref>), processes that, if active in skeletal muscle, could explain the decline in muscle quality over time. Our findings support the hypothesis that restoration of normal calcium signaling and calcineurin/NFAT interactome may be important in the development of therapeutics for sarcopenia. Although Klotho is well-known to regulate these pathways by promoting interactions with FGF23 and FGFR1 (70, 71), the age-dependency of Klotho treatment has not been shown.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>The top 25 GO terms associated with DE genes from old vs. old AAV-Kl treated mice.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Term</th><th valign="bottom">P-value</th><th valign="bottom">Adjusted P-value</th><th valign="bottom">Odds Ratio</th><th valign="bottom">Combined Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>negative regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter in response to stress (GO:0097201)</td><td>0.000331</td><td>0.09424241</td><td>13.1472045</td><td>105.3348</td></tr><tr><td>regulation of protein modification by small protein conjugation or removal (GO:1903320)</td><td>0.00023</td><td>0.07658759</td><td>9.8657932</td><td>82.66108</td></tr><tr><td>response to unfolded protein (GO:0006986)</td><td>5.3E-06</td><td>0.00896227</td><td>5.72185053</td><td>69.50717</td></tr><tr><td>response to chemokine (GO:1990868)</td><td>0.006044</td><td>0.307829996</td><td>13.1300353</td><td>67.07703</td></tr><tr><td>response to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GO:0097012)</td><td>0.006044</td><td>0.307829996</td><td>13.1300353</td><td>67.07703</td></tr><tr><td>regulation of histone deacetylase activity (GO:1901725)</td><td>0.006044</td><td>0.307829996</td><td>13.1300353</td><td>67.07703</td></tr><tr><td>negative regulation of vasculature development (GO:1901343)</td><td>0.006044</td><td>0.307829996</td><td>13.1300353</td><td>67.07703</td></tr><tr><td>regulation of respiratory system process (GO:0044065)</td><td>0.006044</td><td>0.307829996</td><td>13.1300353</td><td>67.07703</td></tr><tr><td>negative regulation of myeloid cell apoptotic process (GO:0033033)</td><td>0.006044</td><td>0.307829996</td><td>13.1300353</td><td>67.07703</td></tr><tr><td>cellular response to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor stimulus (GO:0097011)</td><td>0.006044</td><td>0.307829996</td><td>13.1300353</td><td>67.07703</td></tr><tr><td>regulation of microtubule nucleation (GO:0010968)</td><td>0.006044</td><td>0.307829996</td><td>13.1300353</td><td>67.07703</td></tr><tr><td>cellular response to chemokine (GO:1990869)</td><td>0.006044</td><td>0.307829996</td><td>13.1300353</td><td>67.07703</td></tr><tr><td>RNA stabilization (GO:0043489)</td><td>0.000787</td><td>0.169749244</td><td>7.17396343</td><td>51.27482</td></tr><tr><td>chaperone-mediated protein complex assembly (GO:0051131)</td><td>0.000787</td><td>0.169749244</td><td>7.17396343</td><td>51.27482</td></tr><tr><td>mitochondrial translation (GO:0032543)</td><td>1.36E-06</td><td>0.004970703</td><td>3.63077317</td><td>49.05655</td></tr><tr><td>3'-UTR-mediated mRNA destabilization (GO:0061158)</td><td>0.003735</td><td>0.29111327</td><td>8.75813296</td><td>48.95746</td></tr><tr><td>primary miRNA processing (GO:0031053)</td><td>0.003735</td><td>0.29111327</td><td>8.75813296</td><td>48.95746</td></tr><tr><td>cellular response to leucine starvation (GO:1990253)</td><td>0.003735</td><td>0.29111327</td><td>8.75813296</td><td>48.95746</td></tr><tr><td>endothelial tube morphogenesis (GO:0061154)</td><td>0.003735</td><td>0.29111327</td><td>8.75813296</td><td>48.95746</td></tr><tr><td>negative regulation of inclusion body assembly (GO:0090084)</td><td>0.003735</td><td>0.29111327</td><td>8.75813296</td><td>48.95746</td></tr><tr><td>mitochondrial gene expression (GO:0140053)</td><td>4.92E-05</td><td>0.025776303</td><td>4.79736196</td><td>47.58752</td></tr><tr><td>regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter involved in heart development (GO:1901213)</td><td>0.010022</td><td>0.41209955</td><td>9.84699647</td><td>45.32527</td></tr><tr><td>mitochondrial electron transport, ubiquinol to cytochrome c (GO:0006122)</td><td>0.002072</td><td>0.281362729</td><td>7.30242982</td><td>45.12396</td></tr><tr><td>mitochondrial translational elongation (GO:0070125)</td><td>8.63E-06</td><td>0.00896227</td><td>3.6976622</td><td>43.11427</td></tr><tr><td>mitochondrial translational termination (GO:0070126)</td><td>1.22E-05</td><td>0.00896227</td><td>3.59162667</td><td>40.63</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We also found that the sphingolipid signaling pathway was inhibited in old, but not in the oldest-old, mice following Klotho treatment.

Alterations in the sphingolipid signaling pathway could explain our observation of decreased lipid accumulation in old muscle following Klotho treatment, but a reversed trend in oldest-old mice. Further investigation to more deeply probe this possible mechanism is warranted. It is also possible that the increased lipid accumulation with Klotho treatment in oldest-old mice may be due to a dysregulation in mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johannsen et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, many of the DE genes in oldest-old Klotho-treated mice were related to mitochondrial translation and electron-transport pathways (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Metabolic dysregulation would also be consistent with the trend of intramuscular lipid accumulation, as disrupted carbohydrate metabolism could cause an intracellular buildup of stored lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johannsen et al., 2012</xref>).

These experiments were conducted in accordance with protocol 17080802 (University of Pittsburgh ARO: IS00017744). Experiments were performed using young (3–6 months), middle-aged (10–14 months), old (21–24 months), and oldest-old (27–29 months) male and female C57 BL/6J mice. Mice were obtained from the NIA Rodent Colony, Jackson Laboratories, and Charles River Laboratories.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Study rigor</title><p>All mice were housed in pathogen-free conditions under a 12 hr light and 12 hr dark cycle. Animals in the AAV portion of the study were housed and experimented on under stricter biosafety regulations (Biosafety level II). Animals with obvious health problems (i.e, tumors, malocclusion, etc.) were eliminated prior to inclusion into the study when possible and were excluded from endpoint analyses if pathologies were noted during experimentation. Given the large amount of variability in physical endurance capacity, animals were randomized into cohorts only if they met the criteria of falling into the 25th-75th percentile for the four-limb hang test (described below). This allowed for elimination of outliers that displayed baseline physical performance falling in the first and fourth quartiles, which may confound results. All animals meeting criteria for inclusion were then sorted by restricted randomization, ensuring comparable baseline physical performance across treatment groups. For in vivo experiments, each experiment was repeated across a minimum of two cohorts, and experimenters performing endpoint analysis were blinded to the experimental groups. Power analyses were performed a priori when possible, assuming a two-sided alternative hypothesis with alpha = 0.05% and 80% power (G*Power 3.1.9.2). Based on the prior findings from the laboratory on peak tetanic force in young and aged animals and after adjusting for unforeseen circumstances estimated at 20%, the final sample size was calculated to be 6–10 animals/group. Each endpoint presents data for biological replicates (individual animals). Some datapoints represent mean values calculated from technical replicates – multiple images captured from one animal sample. This is mentioned in the methods subsections below. The raw data for all experiments reported are included in the accompanying Source Data file.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cryopreservation and preparation of skeletal muscle tissue</title><p>Post euthanasia , the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of mice were carefully extracted and wet weight was measured using a standard balance. Immediately after weighing, TAs were frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled 2-methyl butane for one minute, and stored at −80°C. Slides for histological analyses were prepared using a Thermo Fisher CryoStarNX50 cryostat. Tissue was cut at 10 μm with the cryostat set at −20°C. Each slide captured equidistant tissue sections throughout the entire length of the TA.

For uninjured slides, regions of interest were randomly selected by navigating to an imaging site of normal nuclear density based on the DAPI channel and capturing an image. At least three images (technical replicates) were captured per slide (each slide contained tissues from one animal), and images were collected at ×20 magnification. Negative control slides were used to threshold for the signal intensity and to set the exposure time for individual channels. The exposure time was kept consistent for each set of stains based on the negative control. For injured tissues, the injury site was located by finding the localized areas of highest nuclear infiltration.

Next, Wiegert’s Hematoxylin working solution (Poly Scientific S216B) was added for 5 min followed by another tapwater rinse. Then, the slides were stained with Trichome Stain Solution (Sigma HT10516) for 5 min and rinsed with tapwater. Finally, the slides were dehydrated quickly through 95% ethyl alcohol, 100% alcohol (twice), cleared with Xylenes, and mounted with Clearvue Mountant (ThermoScientific 4211).

The samples were then washed with PBS three times and cut longitudinally into small pieces. The tissue pieces were submerged in post-fixation aqueous solution comprising of 1% osmium tetroxide, 1% Fe<sub>6</sub>CN<sub>3</sub> for 1 hr, following which they were washed in PBS three times. The tissues were then treated with aqueous 1% osmium tetroxide, 1% Fe<sub>6</sub>CN<sub>3</sub> for 1 hr. Samples were then washed with PBS three times and then dehydrated with a series of 30–100% ethanol. Following this, the samples were embedded in by inverting Poly/Bed 812 (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) embedding resin-filled BEEM capsules on top of the samples. The resin blocked were then cured twice—once overnight at 37°C, and next at 65°C for 2 days. After the curing procedure, the samples were peeled from the coverslip and cross-sectioned ultrathin on a Reichart Ultracut E microtome. Samples were submerged in uranyl acetate for 10 min and 1% lead citrate for 7 min. The investigators performing imaging were blinded to the hypotheses.

The four-limb hang test was used to measure muscular endurance non-invasively and, thus, characterize performance before and/or after treatment. Mice were suspended upside down from a steel mesh grid (1 cm x 1 cm squares) above a custom-built chamber (~30 cm high) with appropriate padding to prevent harm. Four limb strength was evaluated using a Hang Impulse (HI) score (<italic>bodyweight in grams*time spent hanging</italic>). The time spent hanging was recorded from the time of inversion until all paws are released from the grid. Prior to recorded trials, mice were acclimatized to the grid and the chamber for 5 min. Mice were subjected to five trials in one session with a rest of at least 5 min between trials. Sessions were conducted at roughly the same time of the day (between 10 am and 12 pm) and in the same progression across trials (i.e. the first mouse on session one was also the first on session two). Evaluation of performance was calculated as the average HI of three best trials. Baseline endurance capacity was evaluated prior to experimentation.</p><p>For muscle regeneration experiments, injured animals treated with AAV-GFP or AAV-Kl, hang tests were performed before and after AAV- injections, immediately prior to injury, and then again at 1, 7, and 14 days post-injury. For uninjured animals, hang tests were conducted prior to AAV injection, then again at 1, 7, and 14 days after injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In Vivo contractile testing</title><p>TA muscle strength of animals in the aged cohorts and treatment cohorts was evaluated using an in vivo testing apparatus (Model 809B, Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada). Anesthetized mice underwent surgery to expose the peroneal nerve for stimulation and the Achilles tendon was severed to prevent a counteracting response. The foot was secured onto a footplate in 20° of plantar flexion for maximal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Distefano et al., 2013</xref>). Initially, single twitch stimulation tests were conducted to measure the peak twitch, time to peak twitch, and the half-relaxation time. Shortly after, tetanic stimulations (350 ms train) at 10, 30, 50, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, and 200 Hz with 2-min intervals between contractions were induced to obtain the force-frequency curves. Post tetanic stimulation, animals were given a recovery period of 10 min before proceeding to the high-frequency fatiguing protocol wherein muscles were activated every four seconds by a stimulus train at 100 Hz for 7 min. After completion, force recovery was evaluated at 5 and 10 min timepoints. Results of both the single and tetanic stimulations were collected in torque (mN-m) and the absolute force values (mN) were extrapolated by dividing by the length of the footplate (0.03 m). Values were then normalized to physiological muscle cross-sectional area (CSA measured in mm<sup>2</sup>), as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooks and Faulkner, 1988</xref>.

Next, we created multiple gene lists by searching for different combinations of gene ontology (GO) terms on the MGI GO search database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Batch query forms were used to identify genes for each hallmark. A table of (genes) x (hallmarks) was formed by genes classified into different hallmarks of aging. Note that GO terms associated with multiple hallmarks of aging were accounted for in this process.</p><p>From this step onwards, we focused on each hallmark of aging, as opposed to a specific gene or a GO term. The goal of the study was to identify and target the genes associated with the hallmarks of aging with or without intervention. We created an R ShinyApp webpage for the research community to classify genes into corresponding hallmarks of aging and vice versa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sruthisivakumar.shinyapps.io/HallmarksAgingGenes/">https://sruthisivakumar.shinyapps.io/HallmarksAgingGenes/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>We performed RNA sequencing on gastrocnemius muscle collected from female mice injected with AAV-GFP and AAV-Kl.

For each sample, we generated a node-list and an edge-list. Absolute gene expression values were used to create the node-list, while the edge-list was generated with mouse PPI networks obtained from STRING database version 11.0. If the gene counts were zero, then the nodes were not considered part of the PPI network. This process was done for all the genes, as well as for only the genes classified into hallmarks of aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-2"><title>Network entropy interpretation</title><p>In the field of information theory, Shannon entropy is the measure of surprise of an outcome. For example, a fair coin toss has two equally probable outcomes. This would be the case of maximum surprise, or maximum Shannon entropy. On the other hand, if the coin is rigged, and probability of obtaining heads is 0.9 then one will not be as surprised to get heads. This is the case of lower Shannon entropy. When this concept is extrapolated to graph theory, we aimed to predict the presence or absence of an edge in the graph. If network entropy is high, this means that it is harder to predict the network connections with the knowledge one has. A higher network entropy is bound to happen when the knowledge one has about the system is insufficient or highly variable.</p><p>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution best representing the current state of knowledge on a system is the one that maximizes the Shannon entropy, given the prior knowledge about the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cimini et al., 2019</xref>). Using this method, we gain maximally unbiased information in the absence of complete knowledge. In the content of network biology, the ensemble of most probable network configurations are the ones that have maximum entropy, given certain constraints.</p><p>Our goal was to capture the change in gene expression distribution across age groups using a network entropy estimate, as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Menichetti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Menichetti and Remondini, 2014</xref>). We obtained nodelists from the RNA-seq experiment, and edgelists obtained from existing databases (e.g. STRING) that have PPI network. In addition, we accounted for relative gene expressions by weighting the edges of the network to incorporate the current knowledge we have about the PPI network connections. Hence, we hypothesized that changes in gene expressions will affect the number of nodes, number of edges and the edge weights–a phenomenon that could potentially be captured by the network entropy metric.</p><p>Conventionally, maximum entropy is used to predict the probability distribution. But in this study, we used network entropy values corresponding to the most probable ensemble of PPI networks. This allowed us to quantify the change in transcriptional noise and variation in gene expressions into a single integrative metric.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Network entropy calculation</title><p>Network entropy is a constraint-based optimization problem that is solved using Lagrangian multipliers. The objective function to maximize is the Shannon entropy of the network. A value of network entropy will correspond to a probability distribution for edges. There are two constraints for the optimization problem. The first constraint imposes a degree sequence of the network, whereas the second constraint imposes restriction on the edge weights of the network.

The animal was placed in a supine position and its paws were secured to spread out the torso. A small incision was made with scissors and forceps in the skin above the xiphoid process of the sternum and expanded to reveal the bottom of the rib cage. The peritoneum in the same area was then cut to reveal the underside of the diaphragm. The diaphragm was cut and cleared away with scissors, thus exposing the bottom of the heart. A clamp was used to hold the ribcage out of the way, and a 25 ½ G needle attached to a 1 mL insulin syringe was used to collect blood directly from the apex of the heart. Using this method, roughly 800 µL of blood could be collected from each animal. After collection, the animals were euthanized via cervical dislocation. The collected blood was allowed to clot in a 2 mL tube at room temperature for one-hour. Then, the blood was spun at 16,100 g for 15 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge. The serum was collected and aliquoted into 50 µL tubes and stored at −20°C until used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Circulating Klotho and FGF23 quantification</title><p>Blood collected from experimental and control animals was clotted at room temperature for 1 hr, after which it was spun at 16,100 G for 15 min in a fixed rotor centrifuge at 4°C in order to separate serum.

Briefly, blood serum samples and standards were diluted in PBS (1:25) and 100 µL of the samples were added in duplicates to a 96-well plate pre-coated with a biotin-conjugated antibody specific for Klotho detection. This plate was then incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Samples and standards were removed and 100 µL of biotin-conjugated antibody cocktail was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. The microplates were washed three times with washing buffer provided by the kit (2 min per wash), using an automated plate washer (BioTek 50TS). Following this, 100 µL of Avidin conjugated Horseradish-Peroxidase was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The plate was washed with buffer five times, following which 90 µL of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 20 min. A sulfuric acid-based stop solution was added to terminate the reaction and optical density of each well was measured with a Spectramax M3 plate reader (Molecular Devices) at a wavelength of 450 nm. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel by generating a 2P equation for concentration based on the standard curve and plotting the averaged absorbance values for each sample along this curve.</p><p>Any sample displaying evidence of hemolysis was not included in data analysis, as we have seen that hemolysis interferes with values.

Briefly, blood serum samples and standards (diluted 1:6 in sample diluent buffer) were added in duplicates to a 96-well plate pre-coated with antibody against FGF23 and incubated for 90 min at 37°C. The plate content was then discarded and the plate was blotted. Following this, a biotinylated anti-mouse FGF23 antibody was added to all wells and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. Next, the plate was washed three times with 0.01M PBS using the same plate washer as described above. A total of 100 µL of avitin-biotin-peroxidase complex was added to each well and incubated again for 30 min at 37°C. The plate was washed five more times, following which 90 µL of TMB substrate was added to each well and incubated in the dark for 20 min at 37°C. Finally, 100 µL of TMB stop solution was added and the plate was immediately read at 450 nm using the same plate reader as described above. Analysis was conducted as described above. Hemolyzed samples were not included, and each sample was frozen once prior to the experiment.</p><p>Eleven of the samples returned absorbance values lower than the lowest value of the standard curve. Rather than extrapolating and recording negative concentration values for these samples (which would not be biologically coherent), we assumed that these samples did not have detectable levels of FGF23. Thus, their concentration was recorded as zero. These samples have been marked with red symbols in the figure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-3"><title>Meso-Scale discovery (MSD) Klotho ELISA</title><p>Detection of circulating Klotho levels from mouse blood samples was performed by using an ELISA assay on the MSD platform. Standard-bind MSD plates (#L15XA-1, MSD) were coated with mouse Klotho capture antibody (#AF1819, R and D) at a final concentration of 4 µg/mL in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature. Subsequently, plates were washed three times using wash buffer (PBS + 0.05% Tween-20) at 300 µL/well followed by an incubation with 3% blocker A solution (R93BA-2, MSD) for 1 hr at room temperature. Dilutions of serum samples and murine recombinant Klotho standard (#1819 KL-050, R and D) were prepared in 1% blocker A solution and added to the MSD plate in a final volume of 25 µL/well after the plate was washed three times.

The doses tested were 1 × 10<sup>8</sup>, 3 × 10<sup>9</sup>, and 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> vg/mouse AAV-Kl compared with 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> AAV-GFP control. The final volume for injection was 100 μL per mouse. Three weeks after injection with AAV-GFP, AAV-Kl or DPBS, animals were sacrificed and blood samples were collected for the detection of circulating Klotho levels by MSD-ELISA. Livers were also collected to quantify AAV vector genomes. For vector DNA isolation flash-frozen liver samples, were homogenized in 900 μL of RLT buffer (79216, Qiagen), using a Precellys-24 homogenizer and ceramic bead tubes (KT03961-1-009.2, VWR) at 6000 rpm for 30 s. Homogenates were further processed by applying standard Phenol-chloroform extraction. Finally, vector DNA was purified by using the AllPrep DNA/RNA 96 kit (80311, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Mice were acclimated to treadmill (Columbus Instruments) running over 4 days. On day 1 they ran at 6 m/min for 20 min. Day 2 was at 8 m/min for 20 min. Day 3 was at 8 m/min for 20 min on a 15-degree decline. Day 4 was at 10 m/min for 20 min on a 15-degree decline. The mice then were given 1 day of rest after acclimation before the eccentric injury protocol, which consisted of running at 10 m/min for 60 min on a 15-degree decline. A slight electric shock and gentle prodding were used to ensure adherence. We also assessed exercise protocol adherence according to a previously established method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ríos-Kristjánsson et al., 2019</xref>) to ensure equal performance between groups. Mice that scored below 0.3 were excluded from further analysis due to their inability to complete the injury protocol. Other studies used longer runs and faster speeds to induce injury, but these previous studies were conducted in young mice. Old mice were not capable of running at such speeds and times. Still, to confirm the efficacy of the protocol, histology was conducted to visualize the extent of injury.</p><p>On the first day of acclimation, mice were randomized into two groups (n = 6 per group, repeated in two cohorts), one receiving AAV-Kl at 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> vg per mouse and one receiving the GFP control via tail vein injection as described above. The timing of administration was decided so that AAV injection would fall 5 days prior to muscle injury, similar to our cardiotoxin injury model. Seven days after the muscle injury protocol, contractile testing was conducted, mice were euthanized, and serum and TA muscle were collected. One mouse in the AAV-Kl group was removed from analysis for maximum specific tetanic force production due to an error in testing. TA muscles were sectioned, stained for DAPI and laminin, and imaged at 10x using a Zeiss Observer Z1. Centrally nucleated fibers were quantified using the MuscleJ macro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mayeuf-Louchart et al., 2018</xref>).

Shapiro-Wilk and Levene’s tests were initially performed to assess normality of data and equality of variances, respectively. If assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances were met, a Student’s t-test was performed while comparing two groups, or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with Tukey post-hoc comparison. When conditions for normality were not met in two group comparisons, the groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. A Welch’s test was applied when there were differences between the standard deviations of two groups. When conditions of normality or homogeneity were not met for comparisons of three or more groups, a Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc comparison was used All results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel Remondini (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Pius et al. seeks to comprehensively characterize the trajectory of murine muscle aging and to correlate that to the ability of Klotho to exert beneficial effects on muscle health. The authors present a comprehensive profiling of skeletal muscle aging at the histological, functional, and transcriptomic levels across the lifespan (young, middle, old, oldest old age) and network entropy as a measure of molecular dysfunction during aging. The authors identify a network entropy inflection point and find it correlate with the ability of Klotho delivery to attenuate age-related changes. Interestingly, network entropy does not further increase from old to oldest old and Klotho in oldest old fails to exert a benefit at that age. The study presents a large amount of work, particularly in compiling the various datasets and developing a novel entropy-based modeling to define the trajectory of murine muscle aging, which will certainly be of interest to the community of researchers studying the biology of aging. All four reviewers agreed that the study provides interesting insights into aging. However, as detailed below, various concerns were also raised, relating in large part to insufficient clarity in the current version with respect to the authors' methods and the limitations of their approach and data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. As the transcriptomes and network entropy analysis are the cornerstone of the authors' approach, it is essential that they provide clear and complete details regarding the experimental strategies and rationale underlying each analysis. In particular, detailed answers to the following key questions must be available in the present manuscript:</p><p>2. There were mixed reviews on the validity and advantage of the entropy network method: two positive and two negative reviews. The entropy network model was built on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Given that the authors used transcriptomes as input data, provide the validity of the methodology and discuss the limitation of the approach. For example, numerous reports show that the lack of positive linear correlation between protein levels and the amount of mRNA, e.g. Cell 165: 535-550; Molecular and Cellular Proteomics 1: 304-313, Scientific Reports Article number: 3272.</p><p>3. The authors should provide justification as to why the entropy change from 522 to 528 (only 1.1%, p=0.07) in Figure 3D is deemed meaningful and important.</p><p>4. pg 7 line 123-130 and Figure 3. From the figure it emerges that the first component of PCA seems to characterize aging progression: which are the genes mostly associated to this component? Further analysis (e.g. gene selection based on loadings, possibly after Factor Analysis) could help to emphasize these aspects and identify the key genes associated to aging progression. Moreover, if biologically relevant, these gene set could be characterized throughout the study in relation to aging progression and to the effects of Klotho. Further: did authors try other dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE, that in principle could identify other peculiar aspects within the data?</p><p>5. Methods section: more details about the analyzed network are required, e.g. which is the size of the networks used to estimate network entropy? Which are the main global features (e.g. link density, presence of disconnected components,.…). Moreover, there appears to be more than one network that has been analyzed (genes associated to hallmarks of aging in line 146, global PPI network on line 155). A clear description is needed, in the Methods or in Supplementary material. Further: in Figure1D and supplementary Figure S1 the Network entropy values appear with a &quot;confidence interval&quot; (in light blue). In the paper there are no references about how this uncertainty was estimated: is it standard deviation or standard deviation of mean? It is a 95% confidence interval or something else? Also for this point a clear description is requested.</p><p>6. In Figure 3, the gene perturbation data presentation is a bit odd; what would be much more helpful would be heat maps showing the progression of gene changes from young to old to oldest-old, and which of these are counter-regulated by Klotho over-expression, in particular, for the pathways shown to be linearly regulated with age, but counter-regulated by Klotho in the old. Figure 3G is redundant. Remove 3G and instead indicate the DEG numbers in each pie chart in Figure 3F. Figure 6C is also redundant. As in the Figure 3D, 3E and 3F, in Supplemental Figure 2B Old vs Young should be compared to Oldest-old vs Young age group, instead of comparing Oldest-old vs Old. For oldest-old it would be interesting to see what Klotho does. The authors get at this in figure 6D but it would important to show the actual degree of perturbation connected to the pathways shown.</p><p>7. It seems like the oldest-old Klotho vs oldest-old pathways go in the opposite direct as Old Klotho vs Old. Is that true of every pathway? it would be helpful to connect the gene expression changes to a mechanism.</p><p>8. There is a substantial literature on the skeletal muscle transcriptional studies throughout the lifespan. An example in mice (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2014.04.025), a very recent example in rats (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.08.043) and in humans (https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020115). Refer to the previous work, which are missing in the current manuscript.</p><p>9. The idea that &quot;molecular disorder&quot; underpins age-related muscle dysfunction is clever. Assuming the validity of the approach, an obvious question is whether the &quot;entropy&quot; approach used in this manuscript can be applied to the available datasets to validate the work and to compare differences across species. This translational component and general applicability is important to show and will increase the impact of this work.</p><p>10. There is no reference about repository of the RNA-seq data, which is mandatory for <italic>eLife</italic>. Otherwise authors should justify their decision about why not to make data accessible.</p><p>11. Would it be possible to generate an interactive online website tool to probe this dataset (and perhaps the others above), which includes the &quot;entropy&quot; analysis of molecular disorderliness performed here? This could be very useful to the scientific community and reduces the concern that the authors are under-utilizing their novel approach to gene expression analysis.</p><p>12. The baseline characterizations of aging are well-done and consistent with prior studies. Likewise, the experiments involving the over-expression of Klotho do not appear novel. Detailed answers to the following key questions must be available in the present manuscript to provide a novelty of the study:</p><p>13. The progressive underexpression of Klotho (as shown in Figure 4A) is much smoother than the growth in FGF23 (Figure 4B) that in the paper is claimed to be the major interactor of Klotho: is there any explanation for that? Maybe the group of direct (or second neighbor) interactors of Klotho (and of FGF23 if it is relevant) should be studied specifically, to characterize the surrounding environment of these genes and provide a deeper view of the possible processes associated to aging and to Klotho response. Moreover, it is shown a large difference between growth of FGF23 in oldest-old female as compared to male of the same age group (in female mice the growth starts earlier): can the authors try to explain why? (Maybe FGF23 interactome could provide further insight?)</p><p>14. More information on the effectiveness of the AAV is needed. What organs are being affected by this? How much over-expression of Klotho is there with AAV-Kl, and specifically how much in muscle? Explain why the AAV approach was used instead of Klotho protein supplementation, which seems to have been effective in the past and is a safer and more translatable approach.</p><p>15. The effects of Klotho are interesting; what would have been helpful would be some pharmacodynamic/pathway studies. Are the effects seen happening as a result of increased FGFR signaling? FGF23 levels go up with age, while Klotho levels go down. This may be a reaction to low FGFR signaling. When Klotho is given back, which are the key pathways that are noted to change? In other words, it would be helpful to connect the gene expression changes to a mechanism.</p><p>16. As a comment in the final discussion, since the results about mice treated with Klotho are stated as general, but transcriptomics profiling was performed only on female samples, it should be emphasized that these results could not be generalized independently of sex, since many differences have been observed between the two genders.</p><p>17. Following relevant issues emerge that require further analysis, that should not alter the overall results of the paper but in my opinion could reinforce them. Detailed answers to the following key issues must be provided, including justification as to why suggested experiments cannot be done:</p><p>18. Page 10 line 215; AAV-KL treatment rather decreased force in oldest-old group (Figure 5F and 5G). Given that Klotho over-expression in the oldest-old is perhaps detrimental, experiments should be undertaken to explore how increasing Klotho earlier in life influences regenerative and transcriptional responses later in life. If the positive attributes of Klotho, when applied to an &quot;unhealthy&quot; oldest-old environment, then become a negative stress, it is an idea that should be explored further. It would also be welcome to see how Klotho influences more translatable outcomes such as adaptability to exercise training, since the link between regenerative potential and age-associated sarcopenia is unclear.</p><p>19. For the mouse muscle IHC phenotyping, it is warranted to show other measures such as fiber type-specific CSA, quantification of ECM (via Sirius Red or Masson's), markers of denervation, as well as intramuscular adipose tissue infiltration (IMAT). Extending the analysis to a more oxidative/slow-twitch muscle such as the soleus would also be welcome, given that the TA mostly contains muscle fibers that aren't present in humans (Type IIB).</p><p>20. Further characterization of the AAV-Klotho regeneration experiments is warranted. Why is there less fibrosis in AAV-Kl? Are there fewer FAP/fibrogenic cells? Are there more satellite cells? Presenting collagen 4 intensity (Figure 4H) seems unorthodox. Please show Sirius Red or Masson's and normalized to area. In the aged AAV-Kl experiments, why is there less lipid accumulation, which appears to be specifically within (and not between) the muscle fibers? Was lipid accumulation between muscle fibers (IMAT) different? An Oil Red O analysis is warranted.</p><p>21. Serum levels of cholesterol and insulin of young mice (3-6 month) is necessary in Figure 4D to compare with those of old mice overexpressing Klotho.</p><p>22. As previously reported by the authors in Nature communication (2018), it would be interesting to compare the Klotho's function in the mitochondria of muscle progenitor cell, with the Klotho's function here identified.</p><p>23. To verify the author's suggestion in Discussion section, it is important to examine whether F2 or Kng2 plays a bifurcation role in old and oldest muscles.</p><p>24. The key experiment that seems to be missing is the manipulation of Klotho earlier in life to try and prevent the onset of &quot;molecular disorder&quot; later in life, especially since acute Klotho over-expression in the oldest old seemed to have the opposite effect.</p><p>25. A summary figure that highlight the main findings of this manuscript would be a welcome addition.</p><p>26. Abstract has no conclusions and does not properly reflect contents of the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61138.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We agree that the nonlinear relationship between gene expression and protein levels precludes one-to-one inferences regarding proteomic muscle changes over time. However, our goal was not to estimate protein levels from transcriptomic data. Instead, we use the PPI network as a means to quantify changes in the interactome of age-related genes. To do this, we map skeletal muscle RNA-seq data using experimentally-validated physical interactions. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a proxy to visualize the functional relationship between genes. On the other hand, edges in the gene co-expression network are based on solely correlation cutoffs, and, hence, may not necessarily represent meaningful interactions. As a result, we did not view the use of a gene co-expression network as an appropriate approach. Previous reports have similarly used the PPI interactome to elucidate how shifts in gene expression network properties may play a role in the onset of complex diseases (Banerji, Miranda-Saavedra et al. 2013, Wu, Xie et al. 2014, Yang, Zhang et al. 2016, Teschendorff and Enver 2017, Fan, Lin et al. 2018).</p><p>Despite the advantage of a PPI approach, we acknowledge limitations. Namely, in addition to the fact that mapping of genes to proteins is not one-to-one, there are also a number of proteins for which PPI information has not been documented. We have highlighted both the rationale of our approach as well as its limitations in the Discussion (lines 343-349).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should provide justification as to why the entropy change from 522 to 528 (only 1.1%, p=0.07) in Figure 3D is deemed meaningful and important.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a particularly intriguing question considering others have similarly observed that entropy changes in the context of stem cell differentiation, cancer, and aging are quite subtle (Park, Lim et al. 2016, Teschendorff and Enver 2017, Kannan, Farid et al. 2020).</p><p>From a mathematical perspective, it is not surprising that the change in entropy over time is relatively small given that the spatial network entropy represents the total number of possible configurations (i.e., flexibility of the system), which has a magnitude on the order of 10<sup>6</sup>. The entropy of the network is a reflection of the network architecture, which is dependent on the number of nodes, the number of edges, and the edge weights (i.e., the difference in gene expression). Since fundamental aspects of the network architecture, including the number of nodes and the number of edges, remains relatively stable over time, the change in the magnitude of network entropy represents only a small fraction of all possible configurations (~1.1%). However, this small percentage captures the change in expression of a large number of genes (~7600 genes), each of which have the potential to elicit a cascade of downstream phenotypic changes.</p><p>From a physiological perspective, there is growing evidence that very small-scale mRNA changes can lead to extreme changes in protein expression and cellular phenotype (Ruzycki, Tran et al. 2015, Cheng, Teo et al. 2016). In the context of cancer, for example, a single base mutation can drive extensive cellular remodeling that extends well beyond the predicted downstream responses, a so-called ‘butterfly effect’ (Hart, Zhang et al. 2015). Others have similarly shown that cells are highly sensitive to initial conditions (in our case, gene expression), and that very small changes in transcriptional regulation and equilibrium may exert potent downstream impacts on disease progression (Dorn 2013, Desi and Tay 2019). We have revised the manuscript to highlight these important points (lines 353-368).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. pg 7 line 123-130 and Figure 3.

To address this, first, we evaluated the loading of genes for PC1 and PC2. Interestingly, functional enrichment of top 25 genes associated with each component revealed that 9/25 genes (36%) in PC1, and 17/25 genes (68%) in PC2 are associated with hallmarks of aging. This is consistent with the fact that PC2 best distinguishes age groups (Figure 3B).</p><p>We then focused on the top 100 PC2 genes and performed functional gene ontology enrichment analysis (presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). These GO terms were predominantly associated with altered intercellular communication and nutrient sensing deregulation, two of the hallmarks of aging.</p><p>Next, we visualized the top 100 genes from PC2 loadings as a heatmap. The heatmap showing all gene trends is presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B. Fifteen genes have an increasing trend with aging progression, and 23 genes had a decreasing trend. A heatmap focusing only on these 38 up- and down-regulated genes is presented in Figure 3C. Nutrient sensing deregulation and altered intercellular communication were the two hallmarks most highly associated with the 38 genes displaying an aging progression trend. We have updated the Results sections to present these findings (lines 138-143).</p><p>Interestingly, the two hallmarks that emerge different with PC2 genes: altered intercellular communication and nutrient-sensing deregulation also relates to FGF23 signaling that is a known interactor of Klotho. We observed a novel age-dependent effect on FGF23 signaling with Klotho treatment. We have discussed this effect in comments 13 and 15 in greater detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further: did authors try other dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE, that in principle could identify other peculiar aspects within the data?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed t-SNE to complement the PCA presented in Figure 3B.

Interestingly, we found that FGF/ion transport/calcineurin/NFAT signaling were amongst the top GO terms for old vs old klotho, but not oldest-old vs oldest-old klotho (Figure 7C, Table 1). We describe this age-dependent mechanism in greater detail in response to comments 13 and 15.</p><p>We next evaluated genes associated with the top 3 pathways differentially responsive to Klotho according to age: regulation of actin cytoskeleton, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and sphingolipid signaling pathway. In old, but not oldest old, mice, the majority of genes comprising these pathways were associated with calcium ion transport and signaling. These are well-established pathways that are regulated by Klotho (Kuro-o 2019). However, the age-dependency of these pathways in response to Klotho has not been shown. Instead, we found that the major responses to Klotho in the oldest-old group related to mitochondrial and metabolism associated processes (Figure 7C, Table 2).

This translational component and general applicability is important to show and will increase the impact of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great idea. To compare network entropy changes over time, as suggested, we accessed archived transcriptomic datasets from male mice, as well as rats and humans.</p><p>The male mice transcriptomic data was obtained from Tabula Muris Senis limb muscle (Schaum, Lehallier et al. 2020). We excluded females due to insufficient sample size. Age grouping was done as in our manuscript, with 3-6 months as young, 12-15 months as middle-aged, 21-24 months as old, and 27 months as oldest-old. The spatial entropy obtained from limb muscle sequencing is presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 4A. Network properties are presented in Supplementary file 2 (Table 2C). The blue shaded region denotes standard deviation (n=6, 7, 6, and 4 respectively). Unlike females, we saw that entropy continued to increase from old to oldest-old timepoints, which we found interesting considering that male mice showed less severe sarcopenic declines at the oldest-old age. Also interesting, entropy was lowest at the middle-aged timepoint, then gradually increased.</p><p>The rat spatial entropy is obtained from the dataset provided in comment 8, gastrocnemius sequenced from aging male rats ranging from young to middle-aged to old. The blue shaded region denotes standard deviation (n=7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 8, and 8 respectively) (Figure 3—figure supplement 4B). (Shavlakadze, Morris et al. 2019). Network properties are presented in Supplementary file 2 (Table 2D). These youngest and oldest age groups are roughly equivalent to 20, and 55 years in humans, respectively (Tidball et al., Experimental Gerontology, 2021). RNA-seq data was not available at the oldest-old timepoint (the average lifespan of <italic>Rattus Norvegicus</italic> (Sprague Dawley rat) used in this study is close to three years). Since we had more time points in rats, we observed entropy decreased from young to middle-age, after which time it increased into old age, consistent with our mice data.</p><p>For humans, the dataset referenced in comment 8 was not available, and the corresponding author of the study did not respond to our request for the data . As an alternative, we used RNA-seq data from a recent unpublished study on aging skeletal muscle obtained from <italic>vastus lateralis</italic> (GSE164471) (Tumasian RA 2021). Similar to the mice and rat trajectory, in humans, entropy decreased from young adulthood into the fourth decade of life, after which time it increased, reaching a tipping point in the sixth decade of life, then decreasing slightly. This is consistent with studies that show that sarcopenic declines begin in the fourth decade of life (Walston 2012, Yazar and Olgun Yazar 2019). PPI network entropy obtained from all genes in human males with ages ranging from young to middle-aged to old to oldest-old, grouped as decades, namely, 20-29 years, 30-39 years, and so on till &gt;80 years old.

Still, we felt that it was important to first thoroughly characterize age- and sex-related changes in muscle phenotype and transcriptomic profile over time ranging from young to very old age (a characterization we could not find in the literature) so as to provide a solid foundation for the experimental studies that followed.</p><p>Along these lines, to the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have demonstrated the age-dependent ability of Klotho overexpression to attenuate sarcopenia, nor has previous work identified the biphasic gene expression profiles that accompany these disparate responses to Klotho intervention when comparing old and oldest-old mice.

Re-running the analyses with additional samples further confirmed the trend initially observed (Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, the increase in FGF23 is not as smooth as the decline in Klotho over time, a disconnect that is driven primarily by the female data. Males, on the other hand, display a relatively steady increase with age that coincides with steadily decreasing Klotho levels. We note that approximately 40% of the female population express exceedingly high levels of FGF23 at oldest-old age, whereas the remaining mice display a more linear increases in FGF23 compared to the other age groups. We posit that this discrepancy may be a result of varied hormonal status in aged female mice. Indeed, it has been reported that 25-40% female mice undergo menopause in older age, but shortly after, spontaneously regenerate their follicles, making them hormonally more similar to pre-menopausal mice (Review, Brinton RD, <italic>Endocrinology</italic> 2012). Since estrogen levels directly regulate circulating FGF-23 in both humans and rodents (Ix et al., <italic>Am J Kidney Dis</italic> 2011; Saki et al., <italic>Gynecologic Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine</italic> 2020), the variability in FGF-23 levels may be a result of some of the mice having a menopausal hormonal profile while others do not. Unfortunately, we do not have serum from these animals in order to measure estrogen levels. Instead, we have raised this important point in the text (Results, lines 202-207).</p></disp-quote><p>However, this does not fully clarify possible relationships/interactions between Klotho and FGF23. First, there is no linear interaction in transcriptional regulation of the two genes, as they are on separate chromosomes and are predominantly expressed in different tissues. However, FGF23 protein will increase in response to loss of Klotho or transgenic global overexpression of Klotho (Xiao et al., <italic>JCI Insigh</italic>t 2019). The important interaction between Klotho and FGF23 is at the protein level where they act as co-ligands for <italic>FGFR1</italic> (Chen, Liu et al. 2018). At the same time, Klotho reduces FGF23 interactions with FGFR4 (Han et al., <italic>J Mol Cell Cardiol</italic> 2020, Xiao et al., <italic>JCI Insigh</italic>t 2019). We discuss this interaction in the context of the observation that many of the genes in the GO terms that are decreased by AAV-Klotho in the old mice are related to inhibition of FGFR4/PLCγ/calcineurin/NFAT transcriptional program. This may mechanistically account for some, but not all, of the improvements of old muscle and reduced adiposity. On the other hand, top GO terms when comparing oldest-old and oldest-old Klotho were not related to inhibition of FGFR4/PLCγ/calcineurin/NFAT signaling. Instead, we saw no patterns in these GO terms, which is indicative of a dysregulated response Klotho intervention in the oldest-old animals. This has been added to Results (lines 285-294), and discussion (lines 400-412). These pathways also presented in Figure 7C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maybe the group of direct (or second neighbor) interactors of Klotho (and of FGF23 if it is relevant) should be studied specifically, to characterize the surrounding environment of these genes and provide a deeper view of the possible processes associated to aging and to Klotho response.</p></disp-quote><p>Primary interactors with Klotho include Fgf23 and Fgfr4, which did not display a change in mRNA levels following Klotho treatment. We also probed for effects of AAV-Klotho treatment on several interactors of FGF23 and Klotho (<italic>Fgf6</italic>, <italic>Fgfr4</italic>, <italic>Fgf22</italic>, <italic>Dmp1</italic>). Again, we observed no significant changes in the expression of these interactors (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). This suggests that the mechanism of Klotho in modulating function in the context of sarcopenia may be independent of transcriptional regulation of FGF23.</p><p>However, when we looked at the GO terms for pathways which were differentially expressed with Klotho treatment in old vs. oldest-old age groups, the changes in old were consistent with an inhibition of non-canonical FGF23 signaling through FGFR4/calcineurin/NFAT (Han, Cai et al. 2020). Importantly, this inhibition was not observed in the oldest-old age group. These results are presented in Figure 7C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. More information on the effectiveness of the AAV is needed. What organs are being affected by this? How much over-expression of Klotho is there with AAV-Kl, and specifically how much in muscle? Explain why the AAV approach was used instead of Klotho protein supplementation, which seems to have been effective in the past and is a safer and more translatable approach.</p></disp-quote><p>The main target organs for AAV8-mediated gene delivery in mice are the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. However, by using the liver-specific LP1 promoter, Klotho expression is limited to hepatocytes. Circulating Klotho levels of AAV-Kl treated animals were approximately 50-100-fold higher when compared to untreated or AAV-GFP treated control groups, as assessed by Klotho-specific ELISA measurements in serum samples (Figure 4E). To address the question of Klotho overexpression, we also quantified vector genomes in the liver to quantify expression and included this data in Figure 4D. Klotho expression was not expected in skeletal muscle due to the liver-specificity of the AAV construct. Nevertheless, we extracted Klotho expression in gastrocnemius from our RNA-seq data and confirmed that levels were unchanged with AAV-Kl treatment, seen in Figure 4F.</p><p>We selected an AAV approach in order to allow for robust and stable Klotho levels over a three-week time frame without the need for frequent re-administration of recombinant Klotho. Due to the observed challenges of recombinant Klotho production, which typically results in very low protein yields, thereby raising therapeutic obstacles. AAV8-based gene therapy circumvents this issue. Of note, similar approaches using various AAV capsid variants, including AAV8, are currently in advanced clinical trials in the context of hemophilia and glycogen storage diseases (George 2017, Kishnani, Sun et al. 2019), thereby underscoring the feasibility of AAV-based gene therapy approaches for the continuous expression of secreted therapeutic proteins. We have added a rationale for the use of AAV in the discussion (Page 17, lines 382-386).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. The effects of Klotho are interesting; what would have been helpful would be some pharmacodynamic/pathway studies. Are the effects seen happening as a result of increased FGFR signaling? FGF23 levels go up with age, while Klotho levels go down. This may be a reaction to low FGFR signaling. When Klotho is given back, which are the key pathways that are noted to change? In other words, it would be helpful to connect the gene expression changes to a mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>As a first step to address the potential effects of Klotho administration on FGFR activity, we conducted an ELISA for FGF23 in the serum of the 21-24-, and 27–29-month-old female mice that had been treated with AAV-Klotho or GFP, as in Figure 6. We found no significant difference in FGF23 levels with Klotho treatment versus the age matched GFP treatment group (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Klotho increases canonical FGF23 signaling by increasing the affinity of FGF23 to <italic>FGFR1</italic> by 20-fold (Ho and Bergwitz, <italic>J Mol Endocrinol</italic> 2021). At the same time, increased Klotho levels reduce interactions of FGF23 with FGFR4, which initiates the pathogenic calcineurin/NFAT transcriptional program (Ho and Bergwitz, <italic>J Mol Endocrinol</italic> 2021). Thus, the data suggest that, in old animals, the changes observed are not a result of increased FGFR signaling per se, but rather, a <italic>change in the receptor</italic> activated (FGFR4 to <italic>FGFR1</italic>) and subsequent downstream signaling by FGF23. These points are addressed in the results and in the discussion (lines 299-307, lines 400-412).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. As a comment in the final discussion, since the results about mice treated with Klotho are stated as general, but transcriptomics profiling was performed only on female samples, it should be emphasized that these results could not be generalized independently of sex, since many differences have been observed between the two genders.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to highlight this limitation (lines 314-315).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. Following relevant issues emerge that require further analysis, that should not alter the overall results of the paper but in my opinion could reinforce them. Detailed answers to the following key issues must be provided, including justification as to why suggested experiments cannot be done:</p><p>18. Page 10 line 215; AAV-KL treatment rather decreased force in oldest-old group (Figure 5F and 5G). Given that Klotho over-expression in the oldest-old is perhaps detrimental, experiments should be undertaken to explore how increasing Klotho earlier in life influences regenerative and transcriptional responses later in life. If the positive attributes of Klotho, when applied to an &quot;unhealthy&quot; oldest-old environment, then become a negative stress, it is an idea that should be explored further.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a very interesting line of investigation and one of potentially great clinical relevance. Our team carefully weighed the feasibility of conducting such experiments. Unfortunately, considering the time to perform dose-testing pilot studies and power analysis as well as time required to age the animals following intervention, we estimated such studies would require almost one year. As an alternative, we have added text to the Discussion highlighting the value of such work for future studies (lines 431-433).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be welcome to see how Klotho influences more translatable outcomes such as adaptability to exercise training, since the link between regenerative potential and age-associated sarcopenia is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>To probe the effect of Klotho on exercise response, we evaluated the effects of AAV-Klotho administration on muscle function of mice following an exercise-induced injury (Armand, Launay et al. 2003). Briefly, 22-month-old male mice were randomized into one of two groups and treated with either AAV-Klotho or AAV-GFP via tail vein injection. The AAV-Klotho dose used was the same used for the severe injury protocol. Mice were acclimated to a treadmill for 4 days, given one day of rest, then underwent an eccentric exercise protocol, which consisted of running at 10 m/min for 60 minutes at a 15-degree decline. Though we could not find published studies that utilized this protocol in aged mice, the eccentric treadmill model has been shown to induce exercise-related tibialis anterior damage in young (2 months old) mice (Parise, McKinnell et al. 2008). We ensured that all mice included in the analysis were able to complete the protocol by assessing running performance according to the method established by Ríos-Kristjánsson (Ríos-Kristjánsson, Rizo-Roca et al. 2019). Animals performing under a threshold of 0.35 were removed from analyses (n=2 from each treatment group). One week after the treadmill protocol, an investigator blinded to the treatment group performed in vivo contractile testing of the TA muscle. We repeated this study in duplicate (two cohorts of mice, n=6/group/cohort).</p><p>We found that mice treated with AAV-Klotho had a slightly greater force production than those treated with AAV-GFP, though the result was not significant (p=0.11 as determined by a linear mixed effects model and adjusting for cohort). While these results suggest a potentially positive effect on adaptability to exercise for AAV-Klotho administration, a power analysis revealed that 28 mice per group would be needed to detect statistically significant differences between groups. Given that the effect size of the AAV-Klotho intervention is small (roughly 9% force improvement), we did not test additional animals as the initial results suggest that intervention at the dose tested is not likely to be physiologically relevant. These results are described on lines 237-250 and presented in Figure 5M and Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. For the mouse muscle IHC phenotyping, it is warranted to show other measures such as fiber type-specific CSA, quantification of ECM (via Sirius Red or Masson's), markers of denervation, as well as intramuscular adipose tissue infiltration (IMAT). Extending the analysis to a more oxidative/slow-twitch muscle such as the soleus would also be welcome, given that the TA mostly contains muscle fibers that aren't present in humans (Type IIB).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed fiber-type staining of the TA muscle for each sex across age groups (Figure 1C, D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-G). Unfortunately, we did not have another muscle type, such as the soleus, available for quantification of fiber-type in a more oxidative muscle, and we did not have oldest-old mice available to repeat the protocol. However, our evaluation of the TA muscle across age groups revealed a shift in fiber characteristics and, specifically, a loss of the more oxidative TA type IIA and IIX phenotypes with age (Figure 1D). These findings are consistent with Augusto et al. and Giacomello et al. (2017, 2020).</p><p>We also quantified ECM using Masson’s trichrome staining. Results are presented in Figure 1D. Consistent with Collagen IV data, there was a significant increase in collagen deposition in the 27-29-month-old age groups of both sexes.</p><p>Additionally, we quantified both inter- and intramuscular adipose tissue using lipidtox staining, though no differences were observed according to age (Figure 1F, G).</p><p>Since we did not have tissues available for whole mount staining of the neuromuscular junctions available, as an alternative, we accessed the publicly available database of skeletal muscle transcriptome Tabula Muris Senis (Schaum, Lehallier et al. 2020) and quantified the change over time using well-established denervation genes <italic>Musk</italic>, <italic>Ncam1</italic>, and <italic>Runx1</italic> (Aare, Spendiff et al. 2016). We observed an increase with age for <italic>Musk</italic> and <italic>Runx1</italic> These data are presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2.

Further characterization of the AAV-Klotho regeneration experiments is warranted. Why is there less fibrosis in AAV-Kl? Are there fewer FAP/fibrogenic cells? Are there more satellite cells?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this question, we quantified and compared the ratio of fibrogenic cells (FAPs) to muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) across experimental groups. Briefly, mice were treated with AAV-GFP or AAV-Klotho, as in other experiments (n=9 per group). Five days following injection, mice received a bilateral TAs were injured via cardiotoxin injection. Three days after injury, mice were euthanized to capture the muscle at the height of its fibrotic response. TA muscles were then digested, and cells were sorted via flow cytometry. We observed a twenty-fold decrease in the ratio of FAPs:MuSCs with Klotho treatment, which we hypothesize contributes to the decreased fibrosis observed in histological sections. This data is presented in Figure 5F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Presenting collagen 4 intensity (Figure 4H) seems unorthodox.

Was lipid accumulation between muscle fibers (IMAT) different?

Intramuscular, but not intermuscular, lipid accumulation was significantly decreased in old female mice treated with AAV-Kl. Conversely, in oldest-old female mice, we found that intramuscular lipid <italic>increased</italic> with AAV-Kl treatment, while intermuscular lipid was unchanged. The results are presented in Figure 6C, G, M. The observation of increased intramuscular lipid in oldest-old mice treated with AAV-Kl is likely a reflection of myofiber metabolic changes (Johannsen, Conley et al. 2012), which is consistent with our findings in Table 2. We now address this in the discussion on lines 417-425.</p><p>We used LipidTox staining based-analysis instead of Oil Red O staining because LipidTox has been shown to be more specific to native lipid droplets in fixed tissue (Fam, Klymchenko et al. 2018). Whereas Oil Red O staining has been used as a gold standard for decades, due to its poor solubility in solutions other than ethanol or isopropanol, the abrasive staining procedure can disrupt the native lipid droplets in fixed tissues (Fam, Klymchenko et al. 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21.
