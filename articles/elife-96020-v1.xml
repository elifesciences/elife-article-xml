Although many previous comparative studies revealed genetic, brain structural and connectivity distinctness between human and other nonhuman primates, the brain evolutional mechanism is still largely unclear. Here, we proposed to embed the brain anatomy of human and macaque in the developmental chronological axis to construct cross-species predictive model to quantitatively characterize brain evolution using two large public human and macaque datasets. We observed that applying the trained models within-species could well predict the chronological age. Interestingly, we found the model trained in macaque showed a higher accuracy in predicting the chronological age of human than the model trained in human in predicting the chronological age of macaque. The cross-application of the trained model introduced an individual brain cross-species age gap index to quantify the cross-species discrepancy along the temporal axis of brain development and was found to be associated with the behavioral performance in visual acuity test and picture vocabulary test in human. Taken together, our study situated the cross-species brain development along the chronological axis, which highlighted the disproportionately anatomical development in human brain to extend our understanding of the potential evolutionary effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>brain cross-species age gap</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>cross-species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>62176044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiaojian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Innovation 2030-Brain Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021ZD0200900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiaojian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brain-Inspired Intelligence Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021ZD0200900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiaojian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005273</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202102AA100053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiaojian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Yunnan Fundamental Research Projects</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202201BE070001-004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jiaojian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel methodological strategy based on machine learning has been developed to study brain evolution across species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding the evolutionary effects on the neural system is a fundamental objective in comparative neuroscience. Compared with nonhuman primates (NHPs), the human brain has evolved dramatically to support the human unique specialized abilities such as language, thinking, sociality, and other high-order cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saxe, 2006</xref>). Due to higher similarities in brain homology, analogous socio-emotional behaviors, and genetics, the NHPs, particularly rhesus macaques, provide an excellent surrogate for investigating the brain evolution of the human lineage and its relationship to pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray and Barnes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Phillips et al., 2014</xref>). Unraveling evolutionary adaptations of the human brain is not only crucial to understand the neural substrates of human unique cognitive functions but also contributes to uncovering pathological mechanisms of the human brain disorders and developing effective therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nelson and Winslow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thiebaut de Schotten et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Previous comparative studies have found that primate evolution has remodeled the brain architectures in structures, functions, and wiring patterns. With the development of macroscopic MRI technique, comparative neuroimaging could directly evaluate brain structures, functions, and connectivity differences between humans and NHPs. The structural MRI revealed increased cortex expansion and hemispherical asymmetry in humans compared to NHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donahue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leroy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marie et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, human-specific functional brain areas or networks responsible for decision-making and attention emerging during human evolution were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mantini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neubert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 2015</xref>). Advances in diffusion tensor imaging allow direct comparisons of microstructure of fiber tracts, anatomical connectivity strength between brain areas and complex network organization between humans and NHPs. The increased myelination and fiber connections of arcuate fasciculus (AF) for language processing have been consistently found in humans compared to NHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balezeau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eichert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rilling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sierpowska et al., 2022</xref>). Complex network analysis based on macroscale structural connectivity network revealed different network hubs, and unique wiring properties of the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goulas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, we mapped the evolutionary and developmental connectivity atlas of language areas and revealed increased functional balance, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, functional integration, functional couplings, and better myelination of dorsal and ventral white matter language pathways in humans compared to macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). While these studies offer ample evidence of brain differences between humans and NHPs, it is important to acknowledge that quantifying evolutionary differences through spatial alignment comparisons may partially manifest the evolutionary effects on the human brain, considering the intrinsic evolutionary divergence between humans and macaques about 25 million years ago.</p><p>Except for the spatial alignment between the cross-species brains, mounting evidence has demonstrated the existence of brain development along the temporal axis for both humans and macaques in early life. Studies on early human brain development have shown that the sensory cortex tends to develop more quickly than the association cortex, and that language processing specialization occurs in the left hemisphere even during infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubois et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paus et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, cognitive control, emotional processing, and motivation are interdependent and mature during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christakou, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kilford et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the cortical surface area expands during puberty in rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ronan et al., 2014</xref>). Upon the phenomenon of the coexistence of brain development, it raises the question of whether we can conduct the cross-species comparison of the brain by comparing the phases of brain development. In other words, it would be necessary to establish a comparable relationship between brain anatomy and the phases of brain development. By doing so, it would add to our understanding of the (1) differences in the conserved and dominant human and macaque brain structure, function, and networks at corresponding developmental stages; and (2) directly quantify the disproportionate anatomical development and evolution in human and macaque brains at specific developmental stages.</p><p>To address the current research bottlenecks of comparative neuroscience lacking anaylsis of human and macaque developmental data along a chronological axis, we here propose a machine learning-based cross-species prediction model, that is, brain structure-based cross-species age prediction model, to quantitatively characterize brain evolutionary pattern along the temporal axis compared to traditional comparative statistical analyses. First, the gray matter volume (GMV) and microstructure of white matter tracts (fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusion (MD), axial diffusion (AD), and radial diffusion (RD)) were taken as features to train the prediction models and were used to predict ages for human and macaque, respectively. Then, the trained human and macaque prediction models were separately applied to predict the ages of macaque and human. Next, based on the macaque prediction model to predict human ages, we proposed a new concept of the brain cross-species age gap (BCAP) to quantify evolutionary differences. Finally, Pearson’s correlations were calculated to identify BCAP-associated brain areas, white matter tracts, and behavioral phenotypes.

We observed that the prediction model had good performances for intra-/inter- cross-species age predictions regardless of the number of features and sex. Interestingly, we found the imbalanced model performance in inter-species, which was the trained macaque prediction model to predict human ages, had higher accuracy than using the trained human prediction model to predict macaque ages. Based on the prediction model, we proposed the concept of the BCAP index to quantify the cross-species divergence along the temporal axis during the development and further revealed that BCAP was closely associated with visual acuity test and picture vocabulary test, indicating its potential behavioral significance. Finally, we used BCAP to investigate the evolution along with chronological axis and found that it was mainly associated with language-related white matter pathways and high-order cognitive functions. Taken together, we studied the cross-species brain development along with chronological axis to quantify the disproportionately anatomical development in the human brain, which may provide a new avenue for evolutionary research of the comparative neuroscience.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Brain structure-based cross-species age prediction model and the BCAP</title><p>The traditional comparative studies investigated brain evolution using statistical analyses by spatially aligning the brains between humans and NHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balezeau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gabi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goulas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rilling, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Given the intrinsic evolutionary differences of human compared to other NHPs, whether the identified differences could reflect the functional evolution along the time axis remains controversial. In this study, we developed a new approach of brain structure-based cross-species age prediction model and a novel perspective of chronological axis to investigate brain development and evolution. Prediction model could well predict ages for intra- and inter-species regardless of the number of features and sex effect, demonstrating the reliability and stability of the developed method. For the cross-species prediction, we found that the brain age gap (i.e., |Δ <sub>brain age</sub>|) between human actual ages and predicted human age using the macaque prediction model showed positive correlations with human actual age while the macaque brain age gap (i.e., |Δ <sub>brain age</sub>|) between macaque actual ages and predicted macaque ages using human prediction model showed negative correlations with the macaque actual ages, which indicated that the macaque prediction model could better predict the ages of young human participants while the human macaque prediction model could better predict the ages of the older macaques. By analyzing the prediction results corresponding to human and macaque along the timeline, we speculated that the early-developed brain functions are more conservative than the late-developed high-order cognitive functions during species’ brain evolution. The prediction errors for human ages gradually increased, indicating that advanced brain connection or activities emerge during development to boost evolutionary differences. Contrarily, the decreased prediction errors for macaque ages using the human model indicated that mature macaque brain may ape young human to some extent. Overall, these findings suggest that the intrinsic evolutionary principles of the brain are effectively captured from a perspective along the timeline with the predictive model we developed.</p><p>Although many previous studies have used cortical expansion index to quantitatively characterize brain evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hill et al., 2010</xref>), the findings about cortex expansion are inconsistent and even contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amlien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaplin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foster et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, there is still lack of a stable index to quantify evolution differences in an intuitive perspective. Based on the cross-species prediction model, we proposed the concept of the BCAP index to quantify brain evolution along with temporal axis. We observed that the BCAP is negatively correlated with visual acuity test while it is positively correlated with picture vocabulary test, indicating that BCAP indeed reflects the evolutionary behavioral phenotypes. In summary, the BCAP may provide an object index to quantify cross-species brain development and evolution along with chronological axis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The human- and macaque-specific structural features for intra- and inter-species age prediction</title><p>An interesting finding for the prediction features is that the highest proportion of human- or macaque-specific features are primarily located in white matter tracts and gray matter brain areas, respectively. We also observed that disproportionate anatomical development is exhibited in human and macaque brain during the adolescence. The human-specific features are closely related to brain development and mainly include white matter tracts of left AF, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), and SLF I, which are involved in language and complex motor tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacquemont et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rilling et al., 2011</xref>). The AF is an important language pathway connecting the key speech production region (Broca’s area) in the frontal lobe with the speech comprehension region (Wernicke’s area) in the posterior temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catani and Mesulam, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dick and Tremblay, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rilling et al., 2008</xref>).

The macaque-specific features are mainly distributed in gray matter areas of the prefrontal cortex and motor cortex, which are mainly involved in saccade or visually guided motor and general motor. In addition, some human- or macaque-specific features also were found in gray matter areas and white matter tracts, respectively. The human-specific gray matter features are mainly localized in the insula, basal ganglia, and sensory cortex, which play an important role in emotion, motor, and sensory information control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Draganski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menon and Uddin, 2010</xref>).

Thus, the evolution-associated right SLF II found in this study may be the underlying white matter pathway for attention.</p><p>Moreover, evolution-related gray matter brain areas, including ventrolateral, medial, centrolateral, dorsomedial, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, were also uncovered. These frontal cortical areas are involved in high-order cognitive functions, including cognitive control and executive, decision-making, planning, reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiser and Koenigs, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ray and Zald, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salzman and Fusi, 2010</xref>). The prefrontal cortex has been widely reported during evolution with the largest expansion, late myelination, and structural asymmetry in humans compared to other NHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smaers et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to evolution-associated gray matter areas and white matter tracts, we also found some gray matter areas of putamen, amygdala, and subgenual CCa and white matter tracts of forceps minor and OR are negatively correlated with the BCAP. These gray matter areas and white matter tracts mainly participate in motor, visual, and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murray, 2007</xref>). The negative correlation may suggest that these brain areas or white matter tracts are more predominant in macaque than in human. Taken together, using the BCAP index, we identify the evolution-associated brain areas and white matter tracts widely reported in previous studies and discovered that the human brain shows a greater proportion of development in language and higher-order cognitive functions through cross-species comparisons of brain development along with chronological axis, which demonstrated that the BCAP is an effective index for future studies to quantify brain evolution between species.</p><p>In conclusion, we proposed to embed the brain anatomy of human and macaque in the chronological axis for enabling the cross-species comparison using brain structure-based cross-species age prediction model on brain development. We demonstrated that the prediction model has good performances for cross-species age prediction, and the trained macaque model to predict human ages outperforms the trained human model to predict macaque ages. Moreover, we proposed the index of the BCAP to quantify brain evolution along with temporal axis and identified evolution-associated gray matter areas and white matter tracts consistent with previous reports. The linear regression model developed in this study is preferred over the nonlinear model in terms of parsimony, interpretability, and the underlying relationship between brain structure and age, although the nonlinear model may obtain better accuracy. Importantly, the linear regression model construction using human or macaque brain features allows for a more intuitive comparison to uncover the changing patterns during evolution. However, the existing limitation should be noted regarding the generalizability of our proposed approach for cross-species brain comparison. Our current model relies on homologous brain atlases, and the lack of comparable atlases for other species restricts its broader applicability. To address this limitation, future research should focus on developing prediction models that do not depend on atlases. For instance, 3D convolutional neural networks could be trained directly on raw MRI data for age prediction. These deep learning models may offer greater flexibility for cross-species applications once the training within species is complete. Such advancements would significantly enhance the model’s adaptability and expand its potential for comparative neuroscience studies across a wider range of species. Many studies have reported sex differences in developing human brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hines, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurth et al., 2021</xref>); however, whether macaque brains have similar sex differences as humans is still unknown. We used the machining learning method for cross-species prediction to quantify brain evolution and the established prediction models are stable even when only using male or female data, which may indicate that the proposed cross-species prediction model has no evolutionary sex difference. Although the stable prediction model can be established in either male or female participants for cross-species prediction, this indeed does not mean that there are no evolutionary sex differences due to the lack of quantitative comparative analysis. In the future, we need to develop a more objective, quantifiable, and stable index for studying sex differences using machining learning methods to further identify sex differences in the evolved brain. In addition, the macaque structural MRI data was preprocessed using SPM8, not the latest version of SPM12, which may affect the analysis accuracy. We will develop a well-established macaque brain structural MRI processing pipeline using CAT12 in SPM12 in future studies. Overall, we introduced a novel protocol and index to investigate and quantitatively characterize brain evolution and discovered disproportionate anatomical development and evolution involving language pathways and cognitive control for human and working memory function for macaque, which may promote the development of comparative neuroscience or neuroimaging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human subjects and MRI data acquisition</title><p>The used MRI and behavioral phenotypes data were accessed through the public Human Connectome Project-Development (HCP-D: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.humanconnectome.org">http://www.humanconnectome.org</ext-link>). A total of 370 healthy human subjects (170 males/200 females, age range of 8–14 years, mean and standard deviation of 11.1 ± 1.8 years) with high-quality structure MRI (sMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) were included in this study.

The VBM analyses for human subjects using a fully automatic procedure included the following steps: the T1 image was first segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid; the segmented images were then transformed to MNI space using high-dimensional DARTEL normalization and were modulated to account for volume changes. For macaque VBM analysis, the main procedures as follows: the skull of the structural T1 image was first manually stripped and then rotated to match the orientation of the INIA19 template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rohlfing et al., 2012</xref>), the skull-stripped T1 image was then automatically segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid and was registered to the INIA19 template using DARTEL-normalization; mean template images of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid were created and each individual GMV was transformed into the new mean gray matter template image.

The indices of GMV, FA, MD, AD, and RD were used as features to construct prediction models for humans and macaques. For cross-species prediction, we used homogeneous brain gray matter and white matter atlases to extract the same features for human and macaque. The brain gray matter and white matter were parcellated into 92 sub-regions or 42 sub-tracts in both human and macaque using regional map (RM) atlas and XTRACT cross-species atlas, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bezgin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warrington et al., 2020</xref>). For each human subject or macaque, a total of 260 features (168 features for white matter tracts [FA, MD, AD, RD for 42 tracts] and 92 features for GMV) were obtained. A linear regression model was adopted for intra- and inter-species age prediction. The linear regression model was built including the following three main steps: (1) feature selection: a total of two steps are required to extract the final features. The first step is preliminary extraction. First, all the human or macaque participants were divided into tenfold and ninefold and used for model training and onefold for model test. The preliminary features were chosen by identifying the significantly age-associated features with p&lt;0.01 while calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficients between all the 260 features and actual ages of the ninefold subjects. This process was repeated 100 times. Since we obtained not exactly the same preliminary features each time, we thus further analyzed the preliminary features using two methods to determine the final features: common features and minimum mean absolute error (min MAE). Common features are the preliminary features that were selected in all the 100 times during preliminary model training. The min MAE features were the preliminary features with the smallest MAE value during the 100 times model test for predicting age. After the above feature selections, we obtained two sets of features: 62 macaque features and 225 human features (common features) and 117 macaque features and 239 human features (min MAE). In addition, to further exclude the influences of unequal number of features in human and macaque, we also selected the first 62 features in human and macaque to test the model prediction performances. (2) Model construction: we conducted age prediction with linear model using tenfold cross-validation based on the selected features for human and macaque separately. The linear model parameters are obtained using the training set data and applied to the test set for prediction. The above process is also repeated 100 times. (3) Prediction: with the above results, we obtained the optimal linear prediction models for human and macaque. Next, we performed intra-species and inter-species brain age prediction, that is, human model-predicted human age, human model-predicted macaque age, macaque model-predicted macaque age, and macaque model-predicted human age. Three sets of features (62 macaque features and 225 human features; 117 macaque features and 239 human features; 62 macaque features and 62 human features) were used to test the prediction models for cross-validation and to exclude effects of different number of features in human and macaque. In the main text, we showed the results of brain age prediction, brain developmental, and evolutional analyses based on common features and the results obtained using the other two types of features are shown in the supplementary materials. The prediction performances were evaluated by calculating the Pearson’s correlation and MAE between actual ages and predicted ages.</p><p>To quantify potential evolutionary differences for the inter-/cross-species prediction models, Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the actual ages and the brain age gap (|Δ <sub>brain age</sub>|) defined as absolute value of actual age minus predicted age were calculated for both human and macaque.</p><p>To determine the feature distributions of the prediction models in human and macaque, we classify the used features of different measures (FA, MD, AD, RD, GMV) into shared/common, human-specific, and macaque-specific features. For each measure, the percentage of the three different types of features was computed. In addition, for each type of the features, the top five brain areas or white matter tracts and the corresponding correlation coefficients with ages are shown.</p><p>In addition, to test whether sex affects prediction results, we divided both human and macaque participants into male and female groups. The prediction models were separately trained in males and females and were applied to predict the ages of the corresponding group’s subjects.

To calculate BCAP, each human subject’s predicted age using human prediction model (denoted as P-age<sub>human-human</sub>) was first obtained. Then, the same human subject’s predicted age using monkey prediction model (denoted as P-age<sub>monkey-human</sub>) was also calculated. Next, the percentile rank of P-age<sub>human-human</sub> and P-age<sub>monkey-human</sub> was computed across all the subjects’ predicted P-age<sub>human-human</sub> and P-age<sub>monkey-human</sub>, respectively. Finally, the BCAP was defined as the percentile of P-age<sub>human-human</sub> minus the percentile of the P-age<sub>monkey-human</sub>.</p><p>To test whether BCAP could reflect behavioral phenotypes, Pearson’s partial correlation analyses between BCAP and 40 behavioral phenotypes, including Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire, Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire, Autism Spectrum Rating Scales, Behavioral Inhibition System, and Behavioral Activation System Scale, across all the human subjects were performed with actual ages as covariates. The significant level was determined using false family discovery (FDR) method with p&lt;0.05.</p><p>Finally, with the obtained BCAP for each human subject, Pearson’s correlation analyses between BCAP and GMV of each brain area, FA, MD, AD, and RD values of each white matter tract across all the human subjects were performed with actual ages as covariates to identify evolution-associated brain areas and white matter tracts. The significantly associated brain areas and white matter tracts were determined using the FDR method with p&lt;0.05.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Yanchao Bi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>While the reviewers were in general positive about the research and the paper, a number of issues were raised. Below are a few main points, which are considered essential revisions and the authors should address them point-by-point before we could recommend acceptance of the paper.</p><p>1) Clearly state the theoretical background and research questions.</p><p>2) Provide more detailed information and justification on methods. E.g., data sources; the specific implementation and validation of the Combat harmonization process; the training and testing approaches used to evaluate the age prediction models; the algorithm of the prediction model; why SPM 8 was used; the behavioral phenotypes used to test BCAP, and their correlation indices, and describe what the tests (e.g. Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System Scale, Child Behavior Checklist, etc.) involved.</p><p>3) Discuss potential confounding factors such as age and gender/sex differences.</p><p>4) Discuss limitations, e.g., the current study relied heavily on the use of homogenous brain gray matter and white matter atlases to conduct the cross-species analyses. Also, although the authors named their new method a &quot;cross-species&quot; model, the current study only focused on the prediction between humans and macaques. It would be better to discuss whether their method can also generalize to cross-species examination of other species.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is recommended that the authors explore different prediction models for different species.

In our study, we used VBM8 toolkit implemented in SPM8 for macaque gray matter volume (GMV) analyses for several reasons. First, SPM8 is more compatible than SPM12 for VBM8 toolkit. Second, in SPM12, the GMV analysis was completed using compatible toolkit of Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12). Although CAT12 toolkit has well-established pipeline for human brain MRI data analysis, there is lack of well-established pipeline for macaque. Third, we have tried to use CAT12 in SPM12 for macaque brain GMV analysis but failed. CAT12 not only needs the tissue probability maps (TPM) of gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid but also needs the TPM for brain skull to run. But now, there is lack of TPM for brain skull for all the available macaque templates. Thus, we still used our well established VBM8 pipeline for macaque MRI in this study (Wang et al., 2018). We will develop a well-established macaque brain structural MRI processing pipeline using CAT12 in SPM12 in future studies. As you said, this may be a limitation of our study, and we have added this point as a limitation in the revised manuscript. For details, please see page 16, line 4-6 with green bold font as the following sentences.</p><p>“In addition, the macaque structural MRI data was preprocessed using SPM8 not the latest version of SPM12, which may affect the analysis accuracy. We will develop a well-established macaque brain structural MRI processing pipeline using CAT12 in SPM12 in future studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide a brief description of the ComBat method for harmonization of data from different scanners, whether there are other methods available and why this was the most suitable one.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for your question. In our study, data harmonization with ComBat was used to remove variance contributed by gender and site differences for both the human and the macaque data. In detail, within each species, ComBat was separately applied to the voxel-wise grey matter volume and the DTI-derived indexes (i.e., FA, MD, and RD) with gender and scan sites as covariates. We conducted data harmonization analysis using ComBat toolkit in MATLAB software. Actually, there are a variety of other multisite harmonization methods, like global scaling, functional normalization and RAVEL. Compared with other methods, ComBat can enhance statistical estimation of site effects while preserving the position specificity of multi-site data and improve replicability when the data is age-related and is robust even in small samples (Eshaghzadeh Torbati et al., 2021a; Eshaghzadeh Torbati et al., 2021b; Fortin et al., 2017). Given that Combat has been widely adopted with good performance, we thus also used Combat method for data harmonization in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please use references to figure 4 when describing the set of features used to construct the models.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

We conducted Pearson correlation analyses between 40 behavioral phenotypic traits and BCAP to explore whether this index could reflect evolution-related behaviors. Specifically, the BIS/BAS scale (Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System Scale) was used to assess individual motivation towards avoiding unfavorable outcomes and approaching goal-oriented motivations. For example, items in the scale include statements such as &quot;When I am pursuing something I want, I feel excited and energized&quot; and &quot;Even if something bad is about to happen, I rarely feel afraid or nervous.&quot; Additionally, the CBCL (Child Behavior Checklist), completed by caregivers, assessed children's social competence and behavioral issues. For instance, it includes questions about the number of friends a child has and the frequency of nervous behaviors. Specific behavioral phenotype tests are online (HCP-D: http://www.humanconnectome.org).</p><p>And we added the information of behavioral phenotypes and Pearson’s correlations of BCAP and behavioral scale scores.
