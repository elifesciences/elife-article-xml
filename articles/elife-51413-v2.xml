engaged in distinct organ-specific functions but little is known about their characteristic gene expression profiles. RNA-Sequencing of the brain, lung, and heart endothelial translatome identified specific pathways, transporters and cell-surface markers expressed in the endothelium of each organ, which can be visualized at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rehmanlab.org/ribo">http://www.rehmanlab.org/ribo</ext-link>. We found that endothelial cells express genes typically found in the surrounding tissues such as synaptic vesicle genes in the brain endothelium and cardiac contractile genes in the heart endothelium. Complementary analysis of endothelial single cell RNA-Seq data identified the molecular signatures shared across the endothelial translatome and single cell transcriptomes. The tissue-specific heterogeneity of the endothelium is maintained during systemic in vivo inflammatory injury as evidenced by the distinct responses to inflammatory stimulation. Our study defines endothelial heterogeneity and plasticity and provides a molecular framework to understand organ-specific vascular disease mechanisms and therapeutic targeting of individual vascular beds.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Blood vessels supply nutrients, oxygen and other key molecules to all of the organs in the body. Cells lining the blood vessels, called endothelial cells, regulate which molecules pass from the blood to the organs they supply. For example, brain endothelial cells prevent toxic molecules from getting into the brain, and lung endothelial cells allow immune cells into the lungs to fight off bacteria or viruses.</p><p>Determining which genes are switched on in the endothelial cells of major organs might allow scientists to determine what endothelial cells do in the brain, heart, and lung, and how they differ; or help scientists deliver drugs to a particular organ. If endothelial cells from different organs switch on different groups of genes, each of these groups of genes can be thought of as a ‘genetic signature’ that identifies endothelial cells from a specific organ.</p><p>Now, Jambusaria et al. show that brain, heart, and lung endothelial cells have distinct genetic signatures. The experiments used mice that had been genetically modified to have tags on their endothelial cells. These tags made it possible to isolate RNA – a molecule similar to DNA that contains the information about which genes are active – from endothelial cells without separating the cells from their tissue of origin. Next, RNA from endothelial cells in the heart, brain and lung was sequenced and analyzed.</p><p>The results show that each endothelial cell type has a distinct genetic signature under normal conditions and infection-like conditions. Unexpectedly, the experiments also showed that genes that were thought to only be switched on in the cells of specific tissues are also on in the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels of the tissue. For example, genes switched on in brain cells are also active in brain endothelial cells, and genes allowing heart muscle cells to pump are also on in the endothelial cells of the heart blood vessels.</p><p>The endothelial cell genetic signatures identified by Jambusaria et al. can be used as “postal codes” to target drugs to a specific organ via the endothelial cells that feed it. It might also be possible to use these genetic signatures to build organ-specific blood vessels from stem cells in the laboratory. Future work will try to answer why endothelial cells serving the heart and brain use genes from these organs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endothelial heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>vascular biology</kwd><kwd>translatome</kwd><kwd>tissue specificity</kwd><kwd>systems biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL126516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rehman</surname><given-names>Jalees</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01-HL60678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Asrar B</given-names></name><name><surname>Rehman</surname><given-names>Jalees</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-HL007829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Asrar B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL90152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Asrar B</given-names></name><name><surname>Rehman</surname><given-names>Jalees</given-names><suffix>9965552</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18CDA34110068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Lianghui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Vascular endothelial cells in the brain, heart and lung exhibit tissue-specific heterogeneity and plasticity, expressing genes that were traditionally thought to be only expressed by the surrounding parenchymal tissue cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endothelial cells (ECs) line blood vessels in all tissues and organs, and they form a barrier which tightly regulates the trafficking of oxygen, metabolites, small molecules and immune cells into the respective tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao, 2013</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that the morphology of the microvascular endothelium or the expression of selected genes can vary when comparing the vasculature of multiple tissues, thus allowing ECs to take on tissue-specific EC functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Potente and Mäkinen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aird et al., 1997</xref>). Environmental signals from the tissue microenvironment including mechanical forces, metabolism, cell-matrix, cell-cell interactions, organotypic growth factors likely play an important role in regulating this endothelial heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Potente and Mäkinen, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The tissue-specific interaction between ECs and surrounding cells occurs as early as during development, when, for example, brain ECs instruct neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bussmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuoka et al., 2017</xref>). Such tissue-specific endothelial adaptations persist throughout adulthood when brain ECs form a highly selective barrier composed of specialized tight junctions to limit neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pozhilenkova et al., 2017</xref>). In the lung, ECs differentiate in parallel with epithelial cells to form gas exchange units which are in contact with the external environment and thus need to ensure a rapid immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jambusaria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rafii et al., 2016</xref>). Heart ECs, on the other hand, are specialized in a manner to ensure ready supply of fatty acids to voracious cardiomyocytes which rely on continuous supply of fatty acids as the primary fuel to generate ATP necessary for cardiac contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Potente and Mäkinen, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Identifying differences in the expression levels of selected genes in endothelial cells from different tissues or organs provides some insights into the molecular underpinnings of endothelial heterogeneity, however unbiased gene expression profiling is likely to yield a more comprehensive evaluation of the genes and regulatory pathways underlying endothelial heterogeneity. Microarray profiling has been used to identify paracrine factors and signaling pathways that characterize endothelial cells in different organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jambusaria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nolan et al., 2013</xref>). Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of endothelial cells has also provided a molecular atlas of the brain and lung vasculature at a single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>). The latter work has characterized transcriptomic signatures of distinct endothelial subpopulations. While single cell RNA-sequencing is ideally suited for identifying subpopulations within a single vascular bed, current single cell technologies are limited in their ability to detect the expression of individual genes in a given cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bacher and Kendziorski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kharchenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vallejos et al., 2017</xref>). The endothelial signatures defined using these transcriptomic approaches are potentially influenced by disassociation and isolation of endothelial cells, a process affecting cellular mRNA levels when cells are removed from their native niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haimon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rossner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sugino et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, conventional global mRNA and single cell mRNA transcriptomic profiling does not discriminate between the total mRNA pool and those mRNAs preferentially translated due to translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piccirillo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, to understand further the variegated nature of the endothelium, we used the RiboTag transgenic mouse model, in which LoxP mice express an HA-tag on the ribosomal Rpl22 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanz et al., 2009</xref>). These mice enable direct isolation of tissue-specific mRNAs undergoing translation without cell disassociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanz et al., 2009</xref>). Using an endothelial-specific RiboTag model, we show that organ-specific ECs have distinct translatome patterns of gene clusters during homeostasis. Since the circulating bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a key mediator of tissue inflammation and injury in patients with bacteremia and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cross, 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charbonney et al., 2016</xref>), we also exposed the RiboTag mice to LPS to induce systemic inflammatory injury and studied the organ-specific EC translatome response. We found that ECs express tissue-specific genes involved in vascular barrier function, metabolism, and substrate-specific transport. In addition, we found that ECs expressed genes thought to be primarily expressed in the surrounding tissue parenchyma, suggesting a previously unrecognized organ-specific endothelial plasticity and adaptation. To allow other researchers to explore the organ-specific EC translatome heterogeneity, we have generated a searchable database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rehmanlab.org/ribo">http://www.rehmanlab.org/ribo</ext-link>), in which users can visualize gene expression levels of individual genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimized platform to characterize organotypic endothelial heterogeneity</title><p>To precisely investigate the in-situ organ-specific EC molecular signature in brain, lung, and heart tissue we crossed the RiboTag mice (Rpl22<sup>HA/+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanz et al., 2009</xref>) with the endothelial-specific VE-cadherin-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sörensen et al., 2009</xref>) to generate RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> (<italic>Cdh5<sup>CreERT2/+</sup>; Rpl22<sup>HA/+</sup></italic>) mice. At 4 weeks post tamoxifen administration, ribosomes in the endothelial cells of all tissues expressed the HA tag, thus allowing for the specific isolation of mRNA undergoing ribosomal translation from ECs in the brain, heart and lung during homeostatic conditions. We also isolated brain, lung, and heart endothelial mRNA at several time points following systemic inflammatory injury, induced using a sublethal dose of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ranging from the acute injury phase at 6 hr post-LPS to the recovery phase at 1 week post-LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Log fold change (logFC) values were calculated between endothelial mRNA (immunoprecipitated by an anti-HA antibody) versus whole tissue mRNA (immunoprecipitated with control antibody, anti-RPL22) using quantitative PCR (qPCR). The analysis of the qPCR data confirmed enrichment of endothelial-specific RNA similar to what has been reported in other studies using the RiboTag model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeong et al., 2017</xref>) and also demonstrated minimal expression of RNA from other tissue-resident cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–1F</xref>).</p><p>After confirming the enrichment of endothelial RNA using qPCR, we performed global transcriptional profiling with RNA-Seq on the RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> brain, lung, and heart samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the RNA-Seq data for endothelial mRNA from brain, lung, and heart tissue from all time points showed a clear separation between the replicate brain, lung, and heart translatomes, indicating that ECs from each tissue demonstrated a distinct transcriptional identity at baseline that is maintained even in the setting of profound systemic inflammatory injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In order to identify the genes responsible for these distinct tissue-specific EC profiles, we performed a differential expression analysis on the RNA-Seq data. The differential expression analysis was concordant with the PCA and identified 1692 genes which were differentially expressed in brain ECs (versus ECs from the other two tissues), 1052 genes which were differentially expressed in lung ECs, and 570 genes which were differentially expressed in heart ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endothelial heterogeneity exists in classic endothelial functions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis of RNA-Seq data generated from brain, lung, and heart endothelial samples isolated from RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> mice displays the organ-specific in-situ endothelial clusters. (<bold>B</bold>) Differential expression analysis of 18,910 genes which are expressed in brain, lung, and heart endothelium at baseline identified tissue-specific differentially expressed genes.

For example, genes upregulated in brain ECs included T-box transcription factor (<italic>Tbx1</italic>) and the glucose transporter 1 (<italic>Slc2a1</italic>), genes upregulated in the lung endothelium included claudin 5 (<italic>Cldn5</italic>) and the Hes related family BHLH transcription factor with YRPW Motif 1 (<italic>Hey1</italic>), whereas heart ECs demonstrated upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (<italic>Kdr</italic>) and the endothelial cell surface expressed chemotaxis and apoptosis regulator (<italic>Ecsr</italic>).</p><p>We next focused on the tissue-specific upregulation of metabolic genes.

In contrast, fatty acid metabolism genes were most upregulated in heart ECs consistent with the heavy reliance of the heart on fatty acids to generate ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Heart ECs exhibited upregulation of 17 fatty acid metabolism genes whereas brain ECs and lung ECs only demonstrated upregulation of 9 and 4 metabolism genes, respectively.</p><p>Regarding solute transport genes, the brain endothelium showed the most specific upregulation of genes when compared to ECs of the other tissues, both in terms of number of transporters as well as the magnitude of upregulation. We found that 141 transporter genes were upregulated in brain ECs, whereas 43 and 44 genes were upregulated in lung and heart ECs, respectively. As seen in the heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), the expression levels of brain EC-specific transporters were far greater than those of lung and heart ECs, indicative of the central role of solute transport regulation in brain EC function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> endothelial mRNA purity</title><p>After confirming the efficiency of the RiboTag immunoprecipitation protocol using qPCR, we next sought to perform an unbiased and systematic analysis of the utility of the RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> model as a tool to study the organ-specific endothelial translatome heterogeneity.

The time-course of the brain endothelium specific endothelial genes were plotted to compare their kinetics to the lung and heart endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We found that selected genes which constitute the tissue-specific EC signature during homeostasis are modulated during inflammatory injury. For instance, the expression level of von Willebrand factor A domain containing protein 1 (<italic>Vwa1</italic>) which we found to be a brain endothelial gene during homeostasis decreases during early and late inflammation and then returns to baseline levels one-week post LPS injury, whereas its levels in lung and heart endothelium remain relatively low during the entire time course.

This is an important finding because it suggests that the lung endothelium experiences the most profound dysregulation of core endothelial genes following LPS injury. We also identified lung endothelial specific genes which are solely modulated in the lung endothelium during the inflammatory time course. For instance, the expression levels of forkhead-related transcription factor 1 (<italic>Foxf1</italic>) and tetraspanin8 (<italic>Tspan8</italic>) significantly decrease in the lung endothelium at 6 hr and 24 hr post LPS treatment and then gradually recover back to baseline levels, but both genes remain minimally expressed in the brain and heart endothelium.</p><p>The endothelial genes which were specifically upregulated in the heart endothelium at baseline do not appear to be affected to the extent that the brain and lung endothelium were during LPS stimulation. In the heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), a few genes such as Rho family GTPase 1 (<italic>Rnd1</italic>) and platelet glycoprotein (<italic>Cd36</italic>) undergo a robust change in expression during the time course. From our analysis, we found that the endothelial genes specific to the heart endothelium are much more abundant in the heart versus the other tissues. For example, caveolin 1 (<italic>Cav1</italic>) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (<italic>Kdr</italic>) maintained a high expression level in the heart endothelial samples during the entire LPS time course whereas in the brain and lung endothelial samples, we see significantly lower expression.</p><p>We next focused of the organ-specific endothelial glycolysis signature to investigate the tissue-specific dynamics of glycolytic genes. The brain endothelial basal translatome upregulated the greatest number of glycolytic genes compared to the lung and heart endothelium. Interestingly, when we analyzed the time course of these brain endothelial specific glycolysis genes, we found that they maintain similar levels during the progression and resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>). There were only three glycolysis-related genes which were upregulated in the lung endothelium. When we analyzed these three genes over time, we found that two of them remained stable whereas 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (<italic>Pfkfb3</italic>) was dynamic in all three tissues. Even though this glycolysis regulatory enzyme was specifically upregulated in the lung endothelium at baseline, we found that it was activated in all tissues during late inflammation/early repair and then returned to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the heart endothelium, we found that the upregulated glycolytic genes were not modulated during the LPS injury and recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The endothelium which lines the entire vasculature evolves in a tissue-dependent manner during embryonic development to control organ development, homeostasis, and tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustin and Koh, 2017</xref>). Under normal physiological conditions, the endothelium maintains a quiescent interface between the blood and tissue. During inflammatory stimulation, the endothelium becomes actively responsible for controlling blood flow, vascular permeability, leukocyte infiltration, and tissue edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pober and Sessa, 2015</xref>). Understanding the organotypic endothelial heterogeneity that exists at baseline as well as during the transition from the normal state to the inflammatory state is essential for understanding endothelial plasticity in homeostasis and tissue-specific responses to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaqour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dejana et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krenning et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malinovskaya et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The RiboTag strategy was originally applied to expression profiling of neurons and Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanz et al., 2009</xref>). Cell type specificity of the approach depends on the accuracy of the Cre driver that is combined with the <italic>Rpl22<sup>HA</sup></italic> allele. This aspect is highlighted in our study and we revealed the precision of the inducible system for achieving endothelial specificity. Our results demonstrate that the RiboTag approach provides a useful method to identify distinct molecular gene expression signatures of tissue-specific endothelium. Performing high-throughput gene expression analysis on the translatome using the RiboTag approach enabled us to establish tissue-specific molecular signatures underlying in situ endothelial heterogeneity. During homeostasis, we found that the endothelial translatome in each organ is uniquely characterized by a signature adapted to the surrounding parenchymal tissue. The metabolic adaptation of the endothelium is less surprising as the endothelium plays a critical role in supplying nutrients to the host tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malinovskaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamuro et al., 2016</xref>). The upregulation of the glucose transporter 1 (<italic>Slc2a1</italic>) in brain ECs is consistent with the massive glucose consumption of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schuenke et al., 2017</xref>), whereas the upregulation of the fatty acid metabolism genes <italic>Cd36</italic> and <italic>Fabp4</italic> in the heart likely reflects the importance of fatty acids to meet the bioenergetic demands of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elmasri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silverstein and Febbraio, 2009</xref>). Similarly, the upregulation of immune and stress response genes in the lung endothelium is expected due to the lung’s continuous exposure to environmental stressors and pathogens contained in the inhaled air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Soudi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaparakis-Liaskos and Ferrero, 2015</xref>).</p><p>However, the adaptation of the endothelium appears to extend far beyond the supply of metabolites and nutrients to the parenchyma. We surprisingly found that there exists a multidirectional molecular cross-talk of vessel wall cells with the cells of their microenvironment. In the brain endothelium, synapse organization and neurotransmitter transport genes such as <italic>Glul</italic> were highly enriched, which discloses the molecular mechanisms underlying how excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate can be transported among brain endothelial cells, neurons, and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hawkins, 2009</xref>). We also found that lung ECs expressed genes typically found in the lung epithelium such as Surfactant Protein C (<italic>Spc</italic>) and Mucin1 (<italic>Muc1</italic>), again indicative of a key interaction of the lung endothelium with the lung parenchymal epithelium. The upregulation of genes involved in cardiomyocyte contraction such as <italic>Myl2</italic> and <italic>Ckmt2</italic> again points to an unexpected adaptation of the cardiac endothelium to the surrounding cardiomyocytes, possibly suggesting a key role for the endothelium in modulating cardiac contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schnittler et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>Studying endothelial heterogeneity in response to the systemic inflammatory stress induced by LPS, we found that the endothelium in each tissue maintains a distinct organ-specific molecular identity. Brain and heart ECs express classical inflammatory adhesion molecules such as E-Selectin and P-Selectin, whereas lung ECs upregulate chemokines such as <italic>Cxcl1</italic> and <italic>Cxcl9</italic>. The gene expression shifts in the lung may also reflect the severe loss of lung endothelium recently observed during endotoxemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Merle et al., 2019</xref>). The marked upregulation P-Selectin in the heart and brain is especially interesting because P-Selectin is a key mediator of thrombosis and platelet aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Merle et al., 2019</xref>), and both the brain and heart are especially vulnerable to thrombotic events. During the later stage of inflammation at 24 hr, the inflammatory gene expression pathways across all tissues demonstrated significant upregulation of leukocyte migration and chemotaxis genes, suggesting that despite the persistent heterogenous signatures of the ECs in the respective organs, there is a broad shared program of inflammatory signaling pathways in response to systemic endotoxemia.</p><p>One of the requisites for targeted therapies is the need to deliver such agents to specific organs, thus underscoring the importance of leveraging organ-specific endothelial heterogeneity for such approaches. It has been suggested that vascular endothelial cells in different organs or disease states express specific markers, or ‘zip codes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Folkman, 1999</xref>), so that ligands directed against organ-specific vascular endothelial cell surface markers could be used to deliver effector molecules to specific vascular beds. To address this concept, we expanded our analysis by analyzing 1296 cell surface glycoproteins, including 136 G-protein coupled receptors and 75 membrane receptor tyrosine-protein kinases. This allowed us to establish EC surface markers that were specifically upregulated in in each vascular bed. Not only was this integrative analysis valuable for the establishment of EC ‘zip codes’ based on the organs they are derived from, but it may also provide insights about tissue-specific cell-cell contacts of ECs that allow them to interact with niche or parenchymal cells in each tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zamani et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Among the most intriguing findings of our study was the prominent ‘parenchymal’ signature of endothelial cells in each organ such as contractile genes in the cardiac endothelium and neurotransmitter transport or synaptic vesicle genes in the brain endothelium. A rank-based statistical analysis demonstrated that only selected genes of surrounding parenchymal cells were expressed in the endothelium of each organ. In the setting of a possible contamination, the most abundant genes expressed in the surrounding cells would also be the most abundant genes found in the cell of interest. That the rank order of parenchymal genes abundance in the endothelium differed from that found in the parenchyma suggests tissue-specific programming and adaptation of the endothelium.</p><p>To further address the concern of possible mRNA contamination by neighboring cells in the RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> data, we systematically analyzed two independent endothelial single cell RNA-Seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>), which can exclude contaminating tissue cells by examining the identity of each sequenced cell. We found that EC signature genes identified by our RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> approach such as the synaptic vesicle gene Snap47 and cardiac contractile gene Tropomyosin were also expressed in individual brain and heart ECs as identified by scRNA-Seq. Importantly, we found a substantial overlap of individual signature genes across our data and both scRNA-Seq datasets. Even though the approaches to obtain the data were so different, this is a remarkable degree of consilience. We used a genetic VE-cadherin-Cre to label endothelial ribosomes whereas the Tabula Muris scRNA-Seq dataset relied on mRNA markers of endothelial cells and Betsholtz dataset used Claudin5 lineage tracing combined with endothelial gene expression markers to identify individual ECs.</p><p>Although the bulk of scRNA-Seq tissue-specific genes were found in the Ribotag dataset, the converse was not true. Not all RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> signature genes were present in the single cell RNA-Seq datasets. We think this likely reflects the greater depth and sensitivity of Ribotag RNA-Seq because current single cell technologies are limited in their ability to detect the expression of individual genes in a given cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bacher and Kendziorski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kharchenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vallejos et al., 2017</xref>). Not all single ECs expressed parenchymal genes such as Tropomyosin or Snap47 but those expressing them did so at an even higher levels than what we found in the RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> data. The reason for this might be that RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> data represent an aggregate of all ECs in a tissue. It is therefore possible that the tissue adaptation of individual ECs may be most prominent in anatomically distinct ECs, for example those in close proximity to parenchymal cells such as neurons and astrocytes. Furthermore, if the expression of parenchymal gene signatures such as synaptic vesicle genes or cardiac contractile genes in the endothelium is dependent on environmental cues from neighboring cells or the extracellular matrix, the disassociation of the cells required for single cell RNA-seq may have further reduced mRNA levels of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haimon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rossner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sugino et al., 2006</xref>). Sequencing a larger number of individual ECs in these tissues may enable identification of additional EC subsets with the most prominent parenchymal signatures, and a single cell sequencing approach that preserves the anatomy of the tissue such as Slide-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodriques et al., 2019</xref>) may also be useful to address the in situ transcriptomic signature.</p><p>Using the RiboTag model, we were able to characterize the endothelial translatome profile from distinct tissues. Our analysis uncovered a previously unrecognized degree of endothelial plasticity and adaptation to the parenchymal tissues, raising intriguing questions about the role that the endothelium plays in modulating parenchymal tissue function that likely go far beyond the classically ascribed roles of supplying oxygen, metabolites and solutes. Further studies such as endothelial-specific deletion of neurotransmitter transport or cardiac contractile genes will be required to establish the functional roles of these tissue-specific genes expressed in the endothelium of each organ. Understanding the biological significance of endothelial plasticity and adaptation to the parenchyma will be important in providing a fuller picture of endothelial function during homeostasis and stress in each tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HA (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#: Ab9110;

For this reason, we assessed the mRNA purity of RiboTag endothelial samples isolated from whole tissue by comparing the gene expression levels of the endothelial-specific RiboTag samples to the gene expression levels of mRNA from whole tissue. We compared endothelial-specific RiboTag<sup>EC</sup> mRNA expression levels from brain, lung, and heart tissue to whole brain, lung, and heart mRNA expression levels.</p><p>We first acquired RNA-Seq data for whole brain, whole lung, and whole heart tissue from Array Express (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Athar et al., 2019</xref>). The three whole brain samples and three whole lung samples were downloaded from accession number E-MTAB-6081, while the three whole heart samples were downloaded from accession number E-MTAB-6798. Raw mRNA counts were processed, and batch corrected in a cohort including the 0 hr RiboTag brain, lung, and heart endothelial mRNA counts. The preprocessing and batch correction were performed in the same manner as described above.</p><p>To identify whether mRNA of tissue-resident cells was isolated during the RiboTag EC mRNA isolation procedure, we calculated a Kendall’s Tau rank coefficient between the most abundant genes in the RiboTag EC mRNA and whole tissue mRNA. The Kendall’s Tau rank coefficient, ranging between −1 and 1, allowed us to test whether there was contamination of mRNA from the whole tissue in the RiboTag EC samples. As the coefficient approaches −1, the rank of most abundant genes differs in both sets of samples; while, as the coefficient approaches 1, the rank of most abundant genes becomes identical. Using this test, we were able to infer that if the rank of the most abundant genes in the RiboTag EC sample and the whole tissue is identical, there is contamination of non-endothelial mRNA in the RiboTag EC mRNA samples.

Interestingly, endothelial cells were found to express genes that normally are associated with the parenchyma cells of the organ examined, speaking for a high degree of plasticity. In the revised version, the authors have addressed the remaining comments and criticisms. A key improvement is the inclusion an extensive comparison between their data and two published scRNA-seq data sets. The paper will be a useful resource for scientists interested in vascular biology.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Endothelial heterogeneity across distinct vascular beds during homeostasis and inflammation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers, who were uniform in their view. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Though the reviewers recognized the importance of endothelial heterogeneity and the utility of the RiboTag approach, the potential cross contamination issue raised by reviewer 3 was a particular key concern for all three reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have used RiboTag purification of protein encoding RNA to characterize bulk gene expression in Cdh5-Cre expressing endothelial cells from the brain, heart and lung. The methodology is sound and the results nicely presented. The major question raised is simply what is the value of this study for the field? There are technical and conceptual limitations that argue the value is limited. First, while the study addresses general, inter-organ endothelial heterogeneity between heart, lung and brain, the approach of bulk RNAseq fails to address the high level of intra-organ heterogeneity, i.e. differences between endothelial cells in arteries, veins, capillaries, venules etc. Given the strength of single cell sequencing to address both of these issues simultaneously, the value of this approach seems limited. Second, the authors do not draw significant new biological insights from the data they have harvested. They discuss general points such as the top 10 genes expressed in the bulk endothelial populations from the different organs, but what this means for organ function or organ-specific vascular function is not pursued or validated in any specific manner. Finally, the inflammatory studies are limited to responses to LPS, a stimulus that is certainly inflammatory but laboratory-based and not easily translated to actual disease states. Overall, this study could provide some value as a resource if an excellent and highly accessible website were designed to do this (e.g. the Betsholtz site for brain endothelial gene expression (http://betsholtzlab.org/VascularSingleCells/database.html); otherwise its value does not seem adequately significant compared to existing single cell-based databases that already exist.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript addresses the theme of heterogeneity of the tumor vasculature in lung, brain and heart. The authors sought to isolate cell-type specific ribosomes by Ribo-Tag methodology (Sanz et al., 2009), followed by RNA-seq.

The RiboTag approach circumvents intrinsic limitations of other gene expression analysis strategies, such as alterations due to tissue dissociation or flow cytometric sorting, but it involves immunoprecipitation, which can result in noise caused by pull-down of unspecific RNAs especially when expression of the tagged ribosomal protein is confined to a small fraction of cells. In this context, it is certainly critical to assess whether ECs indeed share the expression of genes with cells from the surrounding organ. The authors suggest that this applies to metabolic signatures and transporters but, for the example of brain ECs, also to genes related to &quot;neurotransmitter transport&quot; or &quot;synapse organization&quot;. Here, it is obviously puzzling that completely different cell types, namely neurons and ECs, would share very specialized transcripts relating to neuronal function. Fortunately, single cell RNA sequencing, which has its own limitations, can be used to confirm the observations made by the authors in an independent fashion and exclude cross-contamination effects seen in bulk sequencing or RiboTag data. Performing this test to the top RiboTag brain EC signature genes (Figure 3C) with the single cell database for heart and lung (http://betsholtzlab.org/VascularSingleCells/database.html; Vanlandewijck et al., 2018) shows that Ptgds is expressed by oligodendrocytes and fibroblasts but not ECs in brain. Atp1a2 is expressed by mural cells and fibroblasts but not by ECs. Ptn and Actb are widely expressed by many different cell types.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have used RiboTag purification of protein encoding RNA to characterize bulk gene expression in Cdh5-Cre expressing endothelial cells from the brain, heart and lung. The methodology is sound and the results nicely presented. The major question raised is simply what is the value of this study for the field? There are technical and conceptual limitations that argue the value is limited. First, while the study addresses general, inter-organ endothelial heterogeneity between heart, lung and brain, the approach of bulk RNAseq fails to address the high level of intra-organ heterogeneity, i.e. differences between endothelial cells in arteries, veins, capillaries, venules etc. Given the strength of single cell sequencing to address both of these issues simultaneously, the value of this approach seems limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that single cell sequencing can also be used to address inter-tissue and intra-tissue endothelial heterogeneity. In our studies, however, we were interested in identifying the endothelial translatome in vivo using the RiboTag approach driven by the endothelial specific VE-cadherin-Cre.</p><p>Therefore, the RiboTag provides a snapshot of the translatome in endothelial cells while residing in their physiological environment (i.e., in their context) without requiring tissue disaggregation and formation of single cell suspensions that disrupt cell function and gene expression (see van den Brink et al., Nature Methods 2017). The RiboTag method enriches for mRNAs undergoing translation whereas single cell RNA-seq analyzes total mRNA, including nuclear and cytosolic mRNA not undergoing translation. Therefore, the RiboTag approach is more suitable for identifying genes that are being actively translated into proteins whereas standard mRNA profiling (in bulk tissues or in single cells) identifies all mRNA, including mRNAs not undergoing translation. To clarify this point, we have revised the Introduction and included references highlighting the importance of translational regulation mechanisms which result in the preferential translation of certain mRNAs and which could not be ascertained by standard single cell RNA-seq.</p><p>Another difference between single-cell analysis and bulk RNA-Seq (whether total mRNA-Seq or ribosome-enriched mRNA-seq) is sequencing coverage. Our RiboTag RNA-seq approach detected 15,736 genes in the brain endothelium while endothelial single cell RNA-Seq analysis using the gold standard Smart-Seq approach such as that performed by the Betsholtz lab detected 8,116 genes in the brain endothelium. On the other hand, single cell RNA-Seq is suited for identifying functional endothelial subpopulations (such as arterial, venous, capillary subpopulations), which could not be identified by the RiboTag approach. Thus, RiboTag endothelial profiling serves as a complementary and equally important approach to single cell endothelial profiling strategies, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>In response, we have now edited and expanded multiple paragraphs in the Introduction to clarify the scope of our study and to inform the readers of the respective advantages of using RiboTag bulk RNA-Seq as well as scRNA-Seq based approaches to derive complementary insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the authors do not draw significant new biological insights from the data they have harvested. They discuss general points such as the top 10 genes expressed in the bulk endothelial populations from the different organs, but what this means for organ function or organ-specific vascular function is not pursued or validated in any specific manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a more comprehensive list of the differentially expressed genes beyond the top 10 genes shown in the main figures would be helpful to derive biological insights. In response, we have now included the full list of differentially expressed signature genes for each organ-specific endothelial tissue (Supplementary files 1-3), which will allow readers to use the data for biological studies of interest. We have also included a list of differentially expressed “parenchymal” (non-endothelial; i.e., not present in the current PanglaoDB database of endothelial cell genes) genes in each endothelial bed (Supplementary files 4-6).</p><p>Additionally, in Discussion (paragraph eight), we now emphasize the importance of performing endothelial-specific genetic deletion and mechanistic studies to ascertain the functional significance of the genes we identified in each vascular bed and how these endothelial genes may influence organ function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the inflammatory studies are limited to responses to LPS, a stimulus that is certainly inflammatory but laboratory-based and not easily translated to actual disease states.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that additional disease models to study the transcriptome response in each vascular bed will be of great value. However, we also want to highlight the translational relevance of the LPS model (which is central to understanding endotoxemia). Circulating LPS serves as a key mediator of disease in patients with bacteremia and sepsis (see Charbonney et al., 2016). Since our goal was to compare inflammatory transcriptomic responses in multiple vascular beds, we needed to induce systemic inflammation in a controlled manner. LPS administration induces the release of inflammatory mediators and immune cell activation, thus allowing us to establish the heterogeneity of endothelial responses resulting from systemic inflammatory stimulation. References emphasizing the resurgence of interest in clinically targeting LPS/endotoxemia are now cited in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this study could provide some value as a resource if an excellent and highly accessible website were designed to do this (e.g. the Betsholtz site for brain endothelial gene expression (http://betsholtzlab.org/VascularSingleCells/database.html); otherwise its value does not seem adequately significant compared to existing single cell-based databases that already exist.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our dataset would be a valuable resource for other researchers to query. Prior to the <italic>eLife</italic> submission we had made our data publicly available on NCBI GEO at the following link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE136848, but as the reviewer points out, researchers would benefit from a user-friendly visualization website that would not require downloading RNA-Seq datafiles from the public NCBI-GEO website.</p><p>In response, we have now generated a website http://www.rehmanlab.org/ribo that enables researchers to query and visualize the organ-specific endothelial translatome between distinct organ-specific endothelial tissues at baseline and during systemic inflammation.</p><p>We provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> screen shots of the website which is accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rehmanlab.org/ribo">http://www.rehmanlab.org/ribo</ext-link>. This will be especially of value to researchers who want to assess the heterogeneous expression of specific genes in the distinct vascular beds at baseline or dynamic changes in these genes following inflammatory injury.

The goal of our study was to comprehensively establish the baseline heterogeneity of the endothelium as well as the organ-specific endothelial responses to inflammation. We chose a translationally relevant disease model – endotoxemia which induces a systemic inflammatory response, thus allowing us to study the inflammatory response in each vascular bed in a standardized manner. We found that even in the setting of a profound systemic inflammatory disease, the baseline heterogeneity of each vascular bed was maintained. However, each endothelial bed exhibited a highly characteristic inflammatory response. Understanding baseline and inflammatory heterogeneity of the vasculature would be critical for new tissue-specific mechanistic insights as well as targeted therapeutics aiming to modulate inflammation in specific vascular beds opposed to a “shot-gun” approach that would indiscriminately modulate vascular inflammation in all tissues.</p><p>In response, the revised Discussion clarifies the scope of our work as well as the importance of future functional studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors have used genetically controlled RiboTag sequencing to analyze and compare the transcription profile of endothelial cells (ECs) from different organs.

This is important for establishing the complementary value of both approaches. The vascular biology field will greatly benefit from inclusive and comparative studies which utilize and are aware of the strengths of each approach. In response, we have performed the following extensive analysis to address the reviewer’s comments:</p><p>1) We have expanded our Introduction and Discussion sections to evaluate the parallel approaches available to study endothelial heterogeneity.</p><p>2) We have now included two new figures in the main manuscript (Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and have expanded the text of the manuscript in the Introduction, Results, and Discussion to address the concerns. We have also expanded our comparison of the signature genes identified by our VE-cadherin-Cre Ribotag approach to include both the Betsholtz single cell RNA Seq and the Tabula Muris single cell RNA Seq datasets. We to great satisfaction found a substantial overlap of individual genes across our data and the Betsholtz as well as Tabula Muris datasets. (Figure 5C-E, Results: subsection “Single-cell Endothelial Heterogeneity”)</p><p>Specifically, using the available scRNA-Seq endothelial datasets for all three organs we had analyzed in our RiboTag experiments, we first intersected the differentially expressed genes for each organ-specific endothelial population to identify the shared “signature” genes and pathways that were present with all three platforms (our RiboTag approach for brain, lung and heart ECs; the Betsholtz single cell studies which were performed on brain and heart ECs; the Tabula Muris single cell studies which were performed on brain, lung and heart ECs). We found that in the Tabula Muris and Betsholtz single cell RNA-Seq analysis of brain ECs, synapse organization, neurotransmitter transport, and regulation of ion transmembrane transport were also significantly enriched (Figure 5C), consistent with the brain EC-specific enrichment of neuronal signaling pathways identified by our RiboTagEC analysis. We also found that in lung ECs, the genes specifically upregulated in the Tabula Muris and Betsholtz single cell analyses were enriched for T cell activation, TGFβ signaling, and antigen processing and presentation (Figure 5D), consistent with what we had found using the RiboTagEC approach. Furthermore, we found that the heart EC marker genes enriched in the Tabula Muris single cell heart ECs (there were no heart ECs in the Betsholtz dataset) were involved in processes such as cardiac muscle contraction, myofibril assembly and proliferation (Figure 5E). By demonstrating that these signatures are present in three different and complementary approaches to tissue-specific EC profiling, we believe that it has substantially increased the robustness of our conclusions that ECs in distinct vascular beds express genes reflecting biological processes that define neighboring cells such as synaptic vesicle transport genes in brain ECs and cardiac contractility genes in heart ECs.</p><p>3) In response to the reviewer’s request to provide a broader, more comprehensive overview of the overlap, we further analyzed whether or not the top 50 genes identified by RiboTag were detected in single cell samples. For the brain, 80% of the top 50 brain EC specific genes in Tabula Muris single cell EC analysis were also present in the list of top 50 Ribotag brain EC genes and more than 50% of the top Betsholtz brain EC specific genes were present in the top 50 list of our Ribotag brain EC genes. Nearly 60% of the top lung endothelial specific genes in the Betsholtz data set were also found in the top 50 list of lung endothelial-specific genes in the RiboTag model. Nearly 50% of the top lung endothelial specific genes in the Tabula Muris data set were also found in the top 50 list of lung endothelial-specific genes in the RiboTag model. This is a remarkable overlap despite the analytic approaches being so different; we used a genetic VE-cadherin Cre to label EC ribosomes whereas Tabula Muris relied on mRNA markers of ECs such as CD31 and VE-cadherin and the Betsholtz group used a combination of Claudin5 endothelial lineage tracing and mRNA expression profiles to identify endothelial cells.(Figure 5F-G, Results: subsection “Single-cell Endothelial Heterogeneity”)</p><p>4) In response to the reviewer’s request to assess whether the parenchymal signatures (Supplementary files 4-6) we identified in the endothelial translatome were only driven by lowly abundant transcripts, we performed Spearman correlation analysis to compare organ-matched RiboTag bulk RNA-Seq data with scRNA-Seq data generated by the Betsholtz Lab and the Tabula Muris Compendium (Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1). One of the challenges for comparing bulk RNA-Seq and single cell RNA-Seq data is the profound difference in sequencing depth and coverage because single cell RNA-Seq by its very nature only identifies a comparatively low number of transcripts in a given cell. We therefore identified stable housekeeping genes that could be used as a reference point for comparing these three datasets (RiboTag, Betsholtz, Tabula Muris). This allowed us to compare the expression levels for each gene relative to the housekeeping gene. In each dataset, we first determined the fold change for all genes using the housekeeping gene, Sap30l (Supplementary files 7-9). Using these fold change values, we calculated correlation coefficients between the brain endothelial translatome and the single cell brain ECs from the Betsholtz and Tabula Muris datasets. We found that for all genes detected in the brain endothelium, the correlation between RiboTag and Betsholtz was 0.53 (Figure 6A).</p><p>We then specifically tested whether the “parenchymal” signature genes in the brain endothelium were correlated with the Betsholtz and Tabula Muris individual brain ECs. The correlation of the parenchymal gene expression between RiboTag brain EC samples and Betsholtz brain ECs was 0.31 (Figure 6B), indicating a correlation even in these parenchymal genes. Importantly, the abundance of the genes in the Betsholtz dataset (Figure 6B, y-axis) shows that they are not exclusively low abundance genes but instead comparable to the gene expression level distribution in the whole transcriptome (Figure 6A, y-axis)</p><p>Importantly, we now directly compare the expression levels of selected brain EC parenchymal genes such as the synaptosome associated protein 47 (Snap47) and synaptotagmin 11 (Syt11) which we found were expressed at similar or higher levels in the Betsholtz single cell brain ECs than in the RiboTag brain EC samples (Figure 6C).</p><p>We performed an identical analysis for the lung and heart endothelium (Figure 6D-I, Figure 6—figure supplement 1) and found that similar correlation values ranging between 0.37 to 0.68. Of note, the heart endothelial gene expression was the most correlated organ across the RiboTag EC and single cell heart EC platforms (Figure 6G-H). In the heart endothelium, we also found that individual genes representing the parenchymal signature such as the cardiomyocyte contractile protein Tropomyosin (Tpm1) are expressed at similar or higher levels in the single cell samples (Figure 6I).</p><p>5) As a resource, we are also now including the complete parenchymal signature for each tissue (Supplementary files 4-6) and the relative expression levels for all tissue-specific differentially expressed genes in each of the three datasets (Supplementary files 7-9) which directly address the reviewer’s concern about the abundance of the genes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
