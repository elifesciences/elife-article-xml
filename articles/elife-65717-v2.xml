Latrophilins are postsynaptic adhesion-GPCRs that engage in trans-synaptic complexes with presynaptic teneurins and FLRTs. In mouse CA1-region neurons, Latrophilin-2 and Latrophilin-3 are essential for formation of entorhinal-cortex-derived and Schaffer-collateral-derived synapses, respectively. However, it is unknown whether latrophilins function as GPCRs in synapse formation. Here, we show that Latrophilin-2 and Latrophilin-3 exhibit constitutive GPCR activity that increases cAMP levels, which was blocked by a mutation interfering with G-protein and arrestin interactions of GPCRs. The same mutation impaired the ability of Latrophilin-2 and Latrophilin-3 to rescue the synapse-loss phenotype in Latrophilin-2 and Latrophilin-3 knockout neurons in vivo. Our results suggest that Latrophilin-2 and Latrophilin-3 require GPCR signaling in synapse formation, indicating that latrophilins promote synapse formation in the hippocampus by activating a classical GPCR-signaling pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse formation</kwd><kwd>synapse specificity</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99-MH117235</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sando</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spatial restriction of GPCR signaling at nascent synapses by adhesion complexes drives excitatory synapse formation and specificity in the hippocampus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although many proteins that shape synaptic functions have been identified, little is known about how synapses are generated. Few proteins are known to be essential for synapse formation in vertebrates or invertebrates. Increasing evidence supports the notion that bi-directional trans-synaptic signaling by adhesion molecules promotes synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nusser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ribic and Biederer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araç and Li, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chubykin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Wit and Ghosh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Südhof, 2018</xref>). However, nearly all the candidate synaptic adhesion molecules that have been tested by rigorous genetic approaches are not required for synapse formation per se. Instead, some of these candidate synaptic adhesion molecules, such as SYG1 in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2004</xref>) or cadherins in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duan et al., 2018</xref>), direct neuronal processes to the correct position of future synapses. Other candidate synaptic adhesion molecules, such as neurexins and their ligands (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Südhof, 2018</xref>) or the SALM/Lrfn family (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lie et al., 2018</xref>), specify the properties of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Missler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>). A case in point are cerebellins, which connect presynaptic neurexins to postsynaptic GluD and DCC/neogenin adhesion molecules. Although deletion of cerebellin-1 or GluD2 causes robust parallel-fiber synapse loss in the cerebellum, synapses are only eliminated secondarily after they were established. Moreover, only a fraction of parallel-fiber synapses is lost, whereas all parallel-fiber synapses exhibit altered synaptic plasticity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuzaki, 2018</xref>). In other parts of the brain, cerebellin-1 and −2 deletions also do not hinder initial synapse formation, but impair synapse function and also lead to secondary synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seigneur and Südhof, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seigneur et al., 2018</xref>). Only few adhesion molecules appear to be actually required for the initial establishment of synapses. Among these molecules are two families of adhesion-GPCRs, latrophilins and BAIs, that are essential for establishing synapses in all brain regions in which they have been tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kakegawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sigoillot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sando et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Studying the mechanism of action of these adhesion-GPCRs offers an avenue for understanding the basic processes underlying initial synapse formation.</p><p>Adhesion-GPCRs characteristically contain large extracellular sequences with multiple potential ligand-binding domains and a canonical GAIN domain that is coupled to the seven-transmembrane region module characteristic of GPCRs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vizurraga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morgan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Folts et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Purcell and Hall, 2018</xref>). Most adhesion-GPCRs additionally have a long cytoplasmic region. The three mammalian latrophilins (Lphn1-3) follow the same design principle as other adhesion-GPCRs. They feature N-terminal lectin- and olfactomedin-like ligand-binding domains, a serine-threonine rich and ‘hormone binding’ domain of unknown function, and a canonical GAIN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sugita et al., 1998</xref>). These domains are attached to a classical seven-transmembrane region GPCR module, followed by a long cytoplasmic region that interacts at the C-terminus with the PDZ-domain of SHANKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kreienkamp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tobaben et al., 2000</xref>). The N-terminal lectin- and olfactomedin-like domains of latrophilins engage in transcellular interactions with multiple presynaptic ligands, including teneurins and FLRTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sugita et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">O'Sullivan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boucard et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple latrophilin isoforms are generally co-expressed in the same neurons. CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus co-express Lphn2 and Lphn3 that are targeted to distinct dendritic domains of the same neuron and are essential for formation of different excitatory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sando et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, Lphn2 and Lphn3 are redundantly required in the cerebellum for parallel-fiber synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The function of postsynaptic Lphn3 in hippocampal synapse formation requires intact binding sites for both presynaptic teneurins and FLRTs, indicating that latrophilins may mediate synapse specificity by acting as coincidence detectors that respond to two input signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sando et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Latrophilin-2 (Lphn2) and Latrophilin-3 (Lphn3) signal transduction mutants engage in teneurin- and FLRT-mediated intercellular interactions on the cell surface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain structures of wild-type and mutant Lphn2 and Lphn3.

An intrinsic GPCR signaling activity was suggested for several adhesion-GPCRs, including latrophilins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Purcell and Hall, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nazarko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ovando-Zambrano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scholz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araç et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kishore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liebscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vizurraga et al., 2020</xref>). However, few data exist for the physiological role of mammalian adhesion-GPCRs in general, and for their GPCR activity in particular. Whether latrophilins physiologically act as GPCRs remains unclear. Given the ubiquity of GPCRs in all cells, especially in neurons, and the relative non-specificity of GPCR signaling, a GPCR-signaling mechanism in synapse formation would be surprising and imply a tight spatial segregation of such signals in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellisdon and Halls, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, other potential mechanisms for the function of latrophilins in synapse formation are equally plausible, for example a pure adhesion mechanism. To address this question, we here examined the GPCR signaling functions of latrophilins in cultured neurons and in vivo, testing this question using multiple independent approaches for two different latrophilins to ensure validity. Our data show that latrophilin-dependent synapse formation requires their GPCR-signaling activity that may have been adapted to synapses as a unique intercellular junction by use of a high degree of spatial compartmentalization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and validation of Lphn2 and Lphn3 mutations</title><p>To examine whether latrophilins act as GPCRs in synapse formation, we generated three types of mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The <underline>Lphn3-ECD</underline> mutant deletes all transmembrane regions and cytoplasmic sequences of Lphn3 and attaches its extracellular domains to the membrane using a GPI-anchor, thereby preserving only the Lphn3 adhesion function and deleting all of its potential signaling capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gokce and Südhof, 2013</xref>). The <underline>Lphn2-T4L</underline> and <underline>Lphn3-T4L</underline> mutants contain an insertion of a T4 lysozyme (T4L) sequence into the 3<sup>rd</sup> intracellular loop of Lphn2 or Lphn3, which abolishes G-protein coupling and impairs arrestin signaling to these GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosenbaum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cherezov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thorsen et al., 2014</xref>). The <underline>Lphn3-ΔCt</underline> mutant truncates most of the cytoplasmic C-terminal sequences, thereby ablating cytoplasmic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Of these three types of mutants, the Lphn3-ECD mutant asks whether Lphn3 might simply act as an adhesion molecule, the Lphn2-T4L and Lphn3-T4L mutants test whether GPCR-signaling is involved in latrophilin function, and the Lphn3-ΔCt mutant examines the possible role of binding partners for the cytoplasmic tail, such as Shanks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kreienkamp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tobaben et al., 2000</xref>). All wild-type (WT) and mutant Lphn2 and Lphn3 proteins were encoded with an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag to enable their detection on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>We first investigated whether the Lphn2 and Lphn3 mutants are transported properly to the cell surface of transfected HEK293 cells, and whether they are competent to engage in the normal trans-cellular adhesion interactions of Lphn2 and Lphn3 with FLRTs and teneurins. To test this question, we measured the ability of the mutants to support cell-aggregation mediated by these interactions. We generated two populations of HEK293 cells that co-expressed either FLRT3 or teneurin-2 (Ten2) with EGFP, or WT or mutant Lphn2 or Lphn3 with tdTomato, using transfections with empty plasmid DNA as a control. We then mixed the two cell populations of HEK293 cells and measured cell aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boucard et al., 2014</xref>). The mutations had no effect on the surface transport of Lphn2 or Lphn3, nor did they impair the ability of Lphn2 or Lphn3 to form trans-cellular adhesion complexes with FLRT3 or Ten2, suggesting that the mutant latrophilins are folded and functional in protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We next expressed the WT and mutant Lphn2 and Lphn3 proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons by lentiviral delivery. Using immunocytochemistry for the surface FLAG-epitope present in all latrophilin proteins and for the dendritic marker MAP2, we visualized the surface transport and subcellular localization of WT and mutant Lphn2 and Lphn3 proteins in the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). All Lphn2 and Lphn3 proteins were localized to the cell surface of neurons, with no apparent difference in localization between WT and mutant proteins. Quantifications documented that all mutant proteins were as well expressed on the surface as WT proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Only the levels of the GPI-anchored Lphn3-ECD protein were slightly lower on the cell surface than those of the other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). We performed an additional control experiment to test if the fixation procedure used permeabilizes cells in the absence of detergent. Primary hippocampal cultures were infected with lentiviral FLAG-Lphn3 WT vs. uninfected controls at 3DIV and labeled for FLAG together with the intracellular excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein Homer1 at 12DIV. All conditions were subjected to the same fixation procedure utilized in our cell-surface labeling experiments (4% PFA/4% sucrose/PBS for 20 min at 4°C) followed by either permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min or non-permeabilization. Permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS exposed robust Homer1 signal, suggesting that our fixation procedure alone generates minor membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This control supports that our assay is sampling predominately surface FLAG-tagged protein in non-permeabilized conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Viewed together, these results show that the various Lphn2 and Lphn3 mutations do not impair their surface transport and extracellular ligand interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Lphn2 and Lphn3 are constitutively active GPCRs whose signaling is blocked by the T4L mutation</title><p>To test whether latrophilins exhibit GPCR activity and how such activity is altered by the Lphn2 and Lphn3 T4L mutations, we examined whether latrophilins alter cellular cAMP levels. We co-transfected HEK293T cells with the fluorescent cAMP indicator (‘pink Flamindo’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harada et al., 2017</xref>), EGFP as an internal fluorescence standard, Gαs (a G-protein) together with Gβ1γ2, and various WT and mutant Lphn2 and Lphn3 constructs.

Overexpressed PDE7b should eliminate all cytoplasmic cAMP, enabling us to estimate the background fluorescence signal.

However, a decrease in synaptic strength might be due to other causes than a loss of synaptic connectivity.

Quantitative retrograde monosynaptic rabies tracing allows in vivo analyses of synaptic connections formed by a specific postsynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sando et al., 2019</xref>). We employed a sparse rabies virus tracing strategy to assess the abundance of synaptic inputs onto hippocampal CA1 neurons of Lphn3 cKO mice expressing Cre without or with co-expression of WT Lphn3 or T4L Lphn3. Postnatal day 0 (P0) WT or Lphn3 cKO mice were sparsely infected monolaterally with low titer (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> IU/mL) lentiviruses expressing Cre or Cre together with WT Lphn3 or T4L Lphn3.

In addition, we show that Lphn3 requires its cytoplasmic sequences for supporting synapse formation. Based on these findings, we propose that latrophilins act in synapse formation by transmitting a GPCR-mediated signal, possibly by elevating cAMP. This is a surprising finding given that GPCRs are present in many neuronal subcompartments where they mediate multifarious regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanderson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scott et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torres-Quesada et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the latrophilin GPCR signal most likely is translated into specific organizational activities during synapse formation in a context- dependent manner, either via interactions of latrophilins with postsynaptic proteins such as SHANKs that are mediated by their cytoplasmic sequences, or via parallel signals induced by other trans-synaptic adhesion complexes.</p><p>Three lines of evidence support our conclusions. First, analysis of WT and mutant Lphn2 and Lphn3 in HEK293 cells demonstrated that WT Lphn2 and Lphn3 exhibit constitutively active GPCR activity that elevates cAMP levels, and that this activity is blocked by the T4L mutation, which is known to abolish GPCR signaling. Second, analysis of cultured neurons demonstrated that the Lphn2 and Lphn3 mutations do not impair surface transport of Lphn2 and Lphn3 or targeting to dendritic spines, but that the Lphn3 mutations abolish its ability to rescue the decrease in synapse formation induced by conditional KO of Lphn3. Lphn2 was not tested in these experiments because they are labor-intensive and it was more relevant to examine its function in vivo. Third, analysis of the in vivo activity of WT and mutant Lphn2 and Lphn3 using sparse postsynaptic deletions of these molecules in hippocampal CA1 neurons in conditional KO mice demonstrated that WT Lphn2 and Lphn3 restored only the loss of synaptic connectivity of their cognate synapses, but had no effect on those synapses for which these latrophilins normally are not required. More importantly, these experiments established that mutant Lphn2 and Lphn3 that is unable to mediate GPCR signaling is incompetent to rescue the conditional KO phenotype. Together, these lines of evidence show that Lphn2 and Lphn3 function in synapse formation as GPCRs.</p><p>However, the present study has inherent limitations. Most importantly, our results do not identify the nature of the GPCR signal that is activated by latrophilins in synapse formation. Latrophilins have been reported to increase or decrease cAMP levels in cells in a constitutive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nazarko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ovando-Zambrano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scholz et al., 2017</xref>). Our results support a function in increasing cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), but the physiological signaling activities of GPCRs are complex and what the precise type of signaling of latrophilins is in vivo may depend on the specific context. Although our results establish that latrophilins act as GPCRs in synapse formation, they do not reveal what type of GPCR signaling drives synapse formation. The notion that this signaling may consist of increases in cAMP is attractive since pharmacological blockage of cAMP signaling impairs induction of spine synapses by glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kwon and Sabatini, 2011</xref>), but no other evidence currently shows that cAMP signaling – or any other GPCR signaling – mediates synapse formation. Thus, this question remains a challenge for future studies that will require new tools and approaches.</p><p>Moreover, the role of the cytoplasmic sequences of latrophilins remains unclear. These long sequences contain multiple highly conserved regions, including a C-terminal PDZ-domain binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sugita et al., 1998</xref>). What the function of these sequences is remains uncharacterized, although it is tempting to speculate that these sequences confer context specificity to the general GPCR activity of latrophilins by binding to specific interacting partners. Such partners remain to be identified, although SHANKs are prime candidates since they are postsynaptic scaffolding proteins that bind to latrophilins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kreienkamp et al., 2000</xref>;

Sections were labeled with DAPI, washed with PBS, mounted and imaged using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 20x objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Imaging</title><p>Images were acquired using a Nikon A1 Eclipse Ti confocal microscope with a 10x, 20x, and 60x objective, operated by NIS-Elements AR v4.5 acquisition software. Laser intensities and acquisition settings were established for individual channels and applied to entire experiments. Image analysis was conducted using Nikon Elements, ImageJ, and Adobe Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>In vitro synapse imaging</title><p>Primary hippocampal cultures infected with lentiviruses encoding GFP-ΔCre or GFP-Cre with or without co-expression of indicated rescue cDNAs were immunolabeled for vGluT1 (guinea pig, Millipore Cat# AB5905; 1:2,000 ICC; in 488 channel), PSD-95 (mouse, Synaptic Systems Cat# 124011; 1:2,000 ICC; in 546 channel), and MAP2 (chicken, Encor Cat# CPCA MAP2; 1:2,000 ICC; in 647 channel). Images were collected as described above with a 60x objective at 0.1 µm/pixel resolution and 0.2 µm z-stack intervals. Overlapping vGLUT1/PSD-95 puncta were automatically quantified along measured distances of MAP2-labeled primary and secondary dendrites using Nikon NIS-Elements AR software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Cell aggregation assay</title><p>FreeStyle HEK293F cells (Life Technologies Cat# R79007) grown to a density of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in a 30 mL volume were co-transfected with 30 μg of either pCMV5-Emerald or pCMV5-tdTomato and 30 μg of the indicated construct using a FreeStyle Max reagent (Life Technologies Cat# 16447100). All cDNAs were encoded in the pCMV5 vector. FreeStyle HEK293F cells were grown at 37°C/8%CO<sub>2</sub> with shaking at 125 rpms. Transfected cells were mixed in non-coated 12-well plates at a 1:1 ratio 2-days post-transfection and subsequently incubated for an additional 2 hr. Live cells were imaged in 12-well plates using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope. Aggregation index was calculated using ImageJ, measuring the percentage of signal/frame occupied by cells forming complexes of two or more cells relative to the total signal of the frame.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistics</title><p>Experiments were performed in a blinded manner whenever possible by coding viral solutions. All data are expressed as means ± SEM and represent the results of at least three independent biological replicates. Statistical significance was determined using the two-tailed Student’s t-test, one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey tests for multiple comparisons, as indicated in the Figure Legends. Data analysis and statistics were performed with Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 8.0. All numerical data and statistical parameters within this study can be located in the Source Data file.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Irina Huryeva for technical assistance, and Shoji Maeda (Kobilka laboratory, Stanford University), Brian Kobilka (Stanford University) and Demet Arac (University of Chicago) for extensive discussions and advice.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All procedures strictly conformed to National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Mice and were approved by the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC) and institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC).

This work will inspire new research on compartmentalized GPCR signaling at the synapse.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Latrophilin GPCR Signaling Mediates Synapse Formation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Graeme W Davis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript was viewed as largely ready for acceptance “as is”. There are two related points, however, raised by two of the reviewers, that should be addressed. The first point concerns the “trafficking” of the mutant proteins to spines. There was discussion among the reviewers on this point and it was agreed that “trafficking” per se is a loaded term that might justify additional experimentation to quantify intracellular versus extracellular tagged proteins, among other variables. However, this would be tangential to the main conclusions of the work. The reviewers suggest a rephrasing of the text, referring to experimental “controls” for the presence of the transgenic proteins at spines, or some similar modification.</p><p>2) The reviewers thought that additional verification of the cellular assay for cell permeability in PFA treated samples was necessary. Is the PFA treated sample truly impermeable? This control could be performed easily. Alternatively, if the protocol has been routinely used and verified, this could be stated as such, though we think it in the interest of the authors to provide a quick experimental control here. One reviewer writes, &quot;A key argument is that only surface labeled latrophilin is visualized, but it is possible that 4% PFA itself permeabilizes neurons to some extent and some intracellular antigens may be stained. The methods sound as though surface labeling was done after PFA fixation, but uncertainty remains whether cells were fixed or not before surface labeling. Finally, the quantification of the signal itself is not described at all (in the Materials and methods or main text), and it is difficult to assess what the ratio of surface flag/Map2 signal means. The authors should clarify these concerns by better describing what was done and how the labeling was quantified. Additional controls for the surface labeling (for example that non-surface antigens in the same compartment – PSD-95 comes to mind – are not labeled under these conditions)&quot;</p><p>3) Some additional text corrections are noted:</p><p>– Introduction: Wang et al., 2020, is not listed in the reference list.</p><p>– Subsection “Lphn2 and Lphn3 function as GPCRs in the hippocampus in vivo” and Figures 4/5: the expression system for rescue is not described at all in the main text and figures. Maps of the 2A-mediated bicistronic expression in the figure and explanations in the text would make the experiment more understandable.</p><p>– Subsection “Lphn2 and Lphn3 function as GPCRs in the hippocampus in vivo” and on: the logic and approach of the retrograde tracing can be patched together from the cited literature, Materials and methods and figures, but it would be very helpful to add a couple of sentences on how this experiment was done and quantified. The description in the main text is so short that it cannot be followed by a broader audience.</p><p>– Figure 1 legend and other figure legends: no statistics are listed for Figure 1C and D, but they should be performed and listed. In general, how the statistics were done is difficult to understand from the information that is provided, and more precision in figure legends etc is necessary. For example, Figures 4B, E and 5B, E list ANOVA testing and four stars****, but there is no explanation what p-value the four stars**** stand for, and it is unclear whether the ANOVA result (for both variables and interaction) or the post-test result is reported (and if so, why).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65717.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript was viewed as largely ready for acceptance “as is”.

Also, definitively determining this would require extensive additional experimentation that would indeed be tangential to our main conclusions. These types of experiments would be further complicated by our previous observations (Sando, Jiang and Südhof, 2019) that different Lphn isoforms are present in non-overlapping populations of synapses even in neuronal cultures. Therefore, we rephrased the text to state that we detected the presence of mutant protein on the neuronal cell surface, rather than trafficking to dendritic spines. We feel this more accurately describes our data and still validates the utility of these mutants for our experimental purposes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers thought that additional verification of the cellular assay for cell permeability in PFA treated samples was necessary.

Some fixation methods such as methanol fixation are well-known to also permeabilize the cell membrane. We performed this control experiment exactly as requested by the reviewer, except we immunolabeled for the intracellular excitatory synaptic scaffold protein Homer1 (the reviewer suggested PSD-95) and also included the positive control of FLAG-WT Lphn3 overexpression via lentivirus. Please see updated Figure 1—figure supplement 1B for new experimental data addressing this point. We subjected 12DIV primary hippocampal cultures to our fixation procedure (4% PFA/4% sucrose/PBS for 20 minutes at 4°C), washed 3x with PBS, and either treated cells with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 minutes followed by blocking, or moved directly to blocking (non-permeabilized). We subsequently labeled for FLAG together with Homer1. We observed minor signal in the Homer1 channel in non-permeabilized conditions, although it is difficult to discern actual Homer1 signal vs. background. Permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS exposed a substantial amount of Homer1 signal, while FLAG-Lphn3 signal was indistinguishable between permeabilized and non-permeabilized conditions. Therefore, while we cannot exclude that our fixation procedure induces a minor degree of cell permeability, the vast majority of intracellular antigen is inaccessible in our fixation procedure alone. We edited the text to reflect this important point, and are grateful to the reviewers for suggesting this important experimental control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some additional text corrections are noted:</p><p>– Introduction: Wang et al., 2020, is not listed in the reference list.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying this oversight.
