These parasites express a homogeneous surface coat of variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs). They transcribe one out of hundreds of VSG genes at a time from telomeric expression sites (ESs) and periodically change the VSG expressed by transcriptional switching or recombination. The mechanisms underlying the control of VSG switching and its developmental silencing remain elusive. We report that telomeric ES activation and silencing entail an on/off genetic switch controlled by a nuclear phosphoinositide signaling system. This system includes a nuclear phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase (PIP5Pase), its substrate PI(3,4,5)P3, and the repressor-activator protein 1 (RAP1). RAP1 binds to ES sequences flanking VSG genes via its DNA binding domains and represses VSG transcription. In contrast, PI(3,4,5)P3 binds to the N-terminus of RAP1 and controls its DNA binding activity. Transient inactivation of PIP5Pase results in the accumulation of nuclear PI(3,4,5)P3, which binds RAP1 and displaces it from ESs, activating transcription of silent ESs and VSG switching. The system is also required for the developmental silencing of VSG genes. The data provides a mechanism controlling reversible telomere silencing essential for the periodic switching in VSG expression and its developmental regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antigenic variation</kwd><kwd>trypanosoma</kwd><kwd>telomere</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositides</kwd><kwd>allosteric regulation</kwd><kwd>telomere silencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIHR PJT-175222</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cestari</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2019â05271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cestari</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du QuÃ©bec - Nature et technologies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-NC-288072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cestari</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001805</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JELF 258389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cestari</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008582</institution-id><institution>McGill University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>130251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cestari</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003971</institution-id><institution>Islamic Development Bank Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>600042744</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Touray</surname><given-names>Abdoulie O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FRQNT-Ukraine postdoctoral fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BUKX:2022â2023 337989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kutova</surname><given-names>Oksana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CGS M fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loock</surname><given-names>Mira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nuclear phosphoinositide signaling controls telomeric gene repression and activation essential for switching expression of surface antigen genes and thus antigenic variation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antigenic variation is a strategy of immune evasion used by many pathogens to maintain persistent infections and entails changes in surface antigens to escape host immune clearance.

Only one VSG gene is transcribed at a time from a telomeric ES. Antigenic variation occurs via transcriptional switching between ESs or VSG gene recombination within ESs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cestari and Stuart, 2018</xref>). The active VSG gene is developmentally regulated, and its expression is silenced in parasites encountered in the tsetse fly vector, for example procyclic and epimastigote forms. Epimastigotes develop into transmissible metacyclic trypomastigotes, which re-activate VSG gene expression before infecting mammals. The coordinated activation and silencing of telomeric ESs is essential for the periodic switch in VSG gene expression during antigenic variation and VSG developmental regulation; however, the mechanisms underlying the control of this process remain unknown.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PIP5Pase activity is essential for VSG gene silencing and switching.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of bloodstream-form ESs (BES, top) and metacyclic-form ESs (MES, bottom).

RAP1 and PIP5Pase interact with other nuclear proteins, including nuclear lamina, nucleic acid binding proteins, and protein kinases and phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cestari et al., 2019</xref>). The involvement of phosphoinositide signaling in VSG expression and switching implied that signaling and regulatory processes have a role in antigenic variation linking cytosolic and nuclear proteins to control transcriptional and recombination mechanisms.</p><p>We report here that PIP5Pase, its substrate PI(3,4,5)P3, and its binding partner RAP1 form a genetic regulatory circuit that controls ES activation and repression. We show that RAP1 binds to silent telomeric ESs sequences flanking the VSG genes, and the binding is essential for VSG transcriptional repression. This association is regulated by PI(3,4,5)P3, which binds to the N-terminus of RAP1, acting as an allosteric regulator controlling RAP1-ES interactions. The system depends on PIP5Pase catalytic activity, which dephosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3 and prevents its binding to RAP1. Inactivation of PIP5Pase results in PI(3,4,5)P3 and RAP1 binding, which displaces RAP1 from ESs, leading to transcription and switching of VSGs in the population. Hence, PIP5Pase activity is required for RAP1 association with silent ESs and VSG gene transcriptional control. The regulatory system is essential for VSG developmental silencing, and temporal disruption of this nuclear signaling system results in VSG switching. The data indicate a molecular mechanism by which ESs are periodically turned on and off during antigenic variation and parasite development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PIP5Pase activity controls VSG switching and developmental silencing</title><p>To investigate the role of PIP5Pase activity in VSG gene expression and switching, we performed gene expression analysis in <italic>T. brucei</italic> bloodstream forms that exclusively express a wildtype (WT) or a catalytic mutant D360A/N362A (Mut) PIP5Pase; the latter is unable to dephosphorylate PI(3,4,5)P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cestari et al., 2019</xref>). The exclusive expression cells have the endogenous PIP5Pase alleles replaced by drug-selectable markers, a tetracycline (tet)-regulatable PIP5Pase allele introduced in the silent rDNA spacer, and a V5-tagged WT or Mut PIP5Pase allele in the constitutively expressed tubulin loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cestari et al., 2019</xref>). In the absence of tet, the cells exclusively express the WT or Mut PIP5Pase allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cestari et al., 2019</xref>). We performed RNA-seq after 24 hr exclusive expression of the WT or Mut PIP5Pase with Oxford nanopore sequencing (~500 bp reads) to distinguish the VSG genes expressed. The expression of the Mut PIP5Pase resulted in 1807 genes upregulated and 33 downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>,â¥2 fold change, p-value â¤0.01, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, all silent ES VSG genes were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>), consistent with their transcription. In contrast, there was a~10-fold decrease in the active VSG (VSG2) and ESAG mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>), implying decreased expression of the active ES (BES1) genes, perhaps resulting from competition among ESs for polymerase or factors required for their transcription. The remaining upregulated genes were primarily from silent subtelomeric arrays, largely VSG genes and pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>), indicating that PIP5Pase activity is also required for subtelomeric ES repression. Other upregulated genes included primarily retrotransposons, endonucleases, and RNA polymerases, but most chromosome core genes (Pol II and Pol III transcribed genes) were not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Re-establishing expression of WT PIP5Pase for 60 hr after its 24 hr withdrawal restored VSG monogenic expression. However, analysis of this population by VSG-seq revealed the expression of several VSGs other than the initially expressed VSG2 indicating a switch in VSG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, only a few VSGs were detected in cells expressing WT PIP5Pase by VSG-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To verify PIP5Pase role in VSG switching, we knocked down PIP5Pase for 24 hr (Tet -), then restored its expression (Tet +) and isolated clones by limit dilution and growth for 5â7 days (Figure S1). Analysis of isolated clones after temporary PIP5Pase knockdown (Tet -/+) confirmed VSG switching in 93 out of 94 (99%) analyzed clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The cells switched to express VSGs from silent ESs or subtelomeric regions, indicating switching by transcription or recombination mechanisms. Moreover, no switching was detected in 118 isolated clones from cells continuously expressing WT PIP5Pase (Tet +, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The data imply that PIP5Pase activity can control the transcription and switching of VSGs.</p><p>The active VSG gene is expressed in bloodstream forms but silenced during parasite development to the insect stage procyclic forms. To determine whether PIP5Pase is required for VSG developmental silencing, we generated procyclic conditional null cells expressing a tet-regulatable V5-tagged PIP5Pase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that PIP5Pase-V5 localizes in the nucleus of procyclic forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), as in bloodstream forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cestari and Stuart, 2015</xref>). Western analysis showed that PIP5Pase-V5 proteins were eliminated 72 hr after knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and growth arrest was detected after 5 days of knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Gene expression analysis showed a 5â15 log2-fold upregulation of all ES VSG genes at 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) at a time when cells are viable and dividing. The data indicate that VSG switching and developmental silencing depend on PIP5Pase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RAP1 bind to sequences flanking VSG genes in silent telomeric ESs</title><p>Because PIP5Pase and its substrate PI(3,4,5)P3 interact with RAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cestari et al., 2019</xref>), we postulated that VSG silencing might involve the regulation of RAP1âs repressive function. We showed that RAP1 binds telomeric or 70 bp repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cestari et al., 2019</xref>), but it is unknown if it binds to other ES sequences or genomic loci. We performed ChIP-seq with a cell line expressing an in-situ HA-tagged RAP1 and nanopore sequencing (~500 bp reads). We found that RAP1-HA binds primarily to silent ESs at the 70 bp and telomeric repeats, which are sequences upstream and downstream of the VSG genes in bloodstream-form ESs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>; p-values&lt;10<sup>â4</sup>).

However, RAP1-HA did not bind significantly to genes, including VSG genes or pseudogenes in the ESs or subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB and F</xref>). Notably, analysis of uniquely mapped reads showed that RAP1-HA was depleted from the active ES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with RAP1 having a repressive function. The RAP1-HA bound sequences are rich in TAAs and GTs, including the 70 bp (TTA)<sub>7</sub>(GT/A)<sub>9</sub> and telomeric (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but also T and G/T-rich sequences downstream of VSG genes.

Other poorly enriched RAP1-HA peaks in the subtelomeric regions reflect residual ES sequences from recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) PIP5Pase inactivation may result in the derepression of multiple ESs, of which one is selected for monogenic expression in the ESB by unknown mechanisms; however, it may involve proteins that associate with the active ES such as VEX1, VEX2, and ESB1. Recombination of VSG genes may also occur during this process. The remaining derepressed ESs return to repression once PI(3,4,5)P3 levels are depleted, for example PIP5Pase reactivation.

The Mut PIP5Pase expression results in local PI(3,4,5)P3 available for RAP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), whereas WT PIP5Pase dephosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3 into PI(3,4)P2, which cannot bind RAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cestari et al., 2019</xref>). The expression of Mut PIP5Pase abolished RAP1-HA binding to 70 bp, 50 bp, and telomeric repeats in all bloodstream and metacyclic ESs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâG</xref>). Notably, the decreased RAP1-HA binding to ESs correlates with increased expression of VSGs and ESAG genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâE</xref>, RNAseq), indicating that PIP5Pase controls RAP1 binding to ESs and thus VSG gene expression. The increased level of VSG and ESAG mRNAs detected in cells expressing Mut PIP5Pase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) may reflect increased Pol I transcription. It is possible that the low levels of RAP1-HA at the 50 bp repeats affect Pol I accessibility to the BES promoter; alternatively, RAP1 association to telomeric or 70 bp repeats may affect chromatin compaction or folding impairing VSG and ESAG genes transcription. The expression of Mut PIP5Pase also removed RAP1-HA peaks in subtelomeric regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which might impact subtelomeric chromatin organization and thus VSG expression and recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâF</xref>).

Hence, RAP1 dissociation from ESs is unlikely the result of PIP5Pase mutations affecting the complex integrity.

The system operates via PI(3,4,5)P3 regulation of RAP1-DNA binding and is controlled by PIP5Pase enzymatic activity. The system functions as an on/off genetic switch to control telomeric ES activation and silencing and indicates a mechanism to control the periodic switching of VSG genes during antigenic variation and VSG developmental silencing. The regulation requires PIP5Pase activity for continuous ES repression via dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P3. PIP5Pase temporary inactivation results in the accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 bound to the RAP1 N-terminus. This binding displaces RAP1 Myb and MybL domains from DNA, likely due to RAP1 conformational changes, allowing polymerase elongation through the VSG gene. PI(3,4,5)P3 acts as a typical allosteric regulator controlling RAP1-DNA interactions and, thus, VSG transcriptional repression.</p><p>Our data indicate that regulation of PIP5Pase activity and PI(3,4,5)P3 levels play a role in VSG switching. Other phosphoinositide enzymes such as PIP5K or PLC, which act on PI(3,4,5)P3 precursors, also affect VSG expression and switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cestari and Stuart, 2015</xref>), arguing that this system is part of a cell-wide signaling network and includes the transcriptional and recombination machinery. The finding of RAP1 binding to subtelomeric regions other than ESs, including centromeres, requires further validation. Nevertheless, it suggests a role for RAP1 repressing subtelomeric chromatin. Chromatin conformational capture analysis showed that subtelomeric regions and centromeres (many subtelomeric in <italic>T. brucei</italic>) have a high frequency of interactions forming the boundaries of genome compartments in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MÃ¼ller et al., 2018</xref>). Disrupting PIP5Pase activity affects RAP1 association with those regions and, thus, might impact long-range chromatin interactions. This organization may explain RAP1âs role in VSG recombinational switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nanavaty et al., 2017</xref>) and the transcription of subtelomeric VSGs upon PIP5Pase mutation, RAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afrin et al., 2020a</xref>) or NUP1 knockdowns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DuBois et al., 2012</xref>). Although we showed that C-terminal HA-tagged RAP1 protein has telomeric localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cestari and Stuart, 2015</xref>) and interactions with other telomeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cestari et al., 2019</xref>), we cannot rule out potential differences between HA-tagged and non tagged RAP1.</p><p>RAP1 and PIP5Pase interact and localize near the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cestari and Stuart, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cestari et al., 2019</xref>). RAP1 also associates with NUP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cestari et al., 2019</xref>), which knockdown derepresses silent VSG genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DuBois et al., 2012</xref>). PI(3,4,5)P3 and other phosphoinositides are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) and distributed to organelles, including the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cestari and Stuart, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). The scenario suggests a model in which RAP1 associates with silent telomeric ESs and lamina proteins at the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MÃ¼ller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cestari and Stuart, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DuBois et al., 2012</xref>), where regulation of silencing and activation might occur. The compartmentalization of silent ESs near the nuclear lamina may prevent the association of factors required for ES transcription, including chromatin-associated proteins and RNA processing factors. In contrast, the active ES is depleted of RAP1, a process that might involve ES mRNAs competition for RAP1 binding to ES DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaurav et al., 2023</xref>), and it is enriched in proteins that facilitate transcription, including VEX2 and ESB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faria et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LÃ³pez-Escobar et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, the active ES localizes in a compartment that favours efficient processing of VSG mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faria et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budzak et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, the active and silent ESs seem to occupy distinct subnuclear compartments and have specific associated proteins. Within this model, VSG switching may entail the inactivation of PIP5Pase, leading to reorganization of silent ES chromatin, for example RAP1 removal from ESs, ESs relocation away from the nuclear lamina, and perhaps changes in ES three-dimensional organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Once RAP1 is dissociated from ESs, other factors, such as ESB1 and VEX2, may associate with the silent ESs to initiate transcription. Although the requirements for establishing VSG monogenic expression are unknown, it may entail the successful association of factors with ESs for their transcription or recruitment to the ESB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Navarro and Gull, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faria et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>How the phosphoinositide signaling system is initiated to control VSG switching is unknown, but our data suggest an alternative non-stochastic model regulating antigenic variation. It is unknown if this signaling system regulates antigenic variation in vivo. Nevertheless, the data indicate that trypanosomes may have evolved a sophisticated mechanism to regulate antigenic variation that entails genetic and signaling processes, and such processes may be conserved in other pathogens that rely on antigenic variation for infection, for example <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic>, broadening opportunities for drug discovery. The allosteric regulation of RAP1 by PI(3,4,5)P3 denotes a mechanism for phosphoinositide regulation of telomere silencing.

To achieve this, <italic>T. brucei</italic> regularly expresses different VSGs as its major surface antigen. VSG expression sites are exclusively subtelomeric, and VSG transcription by RNA polymerase I is strictly monoallelic. It has been shown that <italic>T. brucei</italic> RAP1, a telomeric protein, and the phosphoinositol pathway are essential for VSG monoallelic expression. In previous studies, Cestari et al. (ref. 24) has shown that PIP5pase interacts with RAP1 and that RAP1 binds PI(3,4,5)P3. RNAseq and ChIPseq analyses have been performed previously in PIP5pase conditional knockout cells, too (ref. 24). In the current study, Touray et al. did similar analyses except that catalytic dead PIP5pase mutant was used and the DNA and PI(3,4,5)P3 binding activities of RAP1 fragments were examined. Specifically, the authors examined the transcriptome profile and did RAP1 ChIPseq in PIP5pase catalytic dead mutant. The authors also expressed several C-terminal His6-tagged RAP1 recombinant proteins (full-length, aa1-300, aa301-560, and aa 561-855). These fragments' DNA binding activities were examined by EMSA analysis and their phosphoinositides binding activities were examined by affinity pulldown of biotin-conjugated phosphoinositides. As a result, the authors confirmed that VSG silencing (both BES-linked and MES-linked VSGs) depends on PIP5pase catalytic activity, but the overall knowledge improvement is incremental. The most convincing data come from the phosphoinositide binding assay as it clearly shows that N-terminus of RAP1 binds PI(3,4,5)P3 but not PI(4,5)P2, although this is only assayed in vitro, while the in vivo binding of full-length RAP1 to PI(3,4,5)P3 has been previously published by Cestari et al (ref. 24) already. Considering that many phosphoinositides exert their regulatory role by modulating the subcellular localization of their bound proteins, it is reasonable to hypothesize that binding to PI(3,4,5)P3 can remove RAP1 from the chromatin.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89331.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript, Touray et al investigate the mechanisms by which PIP5Pase and RAP1 control VSG expression in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and demonstrate an important role for this enzyme in a signalling pathway that likely plays a role in antigenic variation in <italic>T. brucei</italic>.

However, the authors still haven't addressed some key scientific rigor issues, which are listed below:</p><p>1. It is critical to clearly state whether the observations are made for the endogenous WT protein or the tagged protein. It is good that the authors currently clearly indicate the results observed in vivo are for the RAP1-HA protein. However, this is not as clearly stated for in vitro EMSA analyses. In addition, in discussion, the authors simply assumed that the c-terminally tagged RAP1 behaves the same as WT RAP1 and all conclusions were made about WT RAP1.</p><p>There are two choices here. The authors can validate that RAP1-HA still retains RAP1's essential function as a sole allele in <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells (as was recommended previously). Indeed, HA-tagged RAP1 has been studied before, but it is the N-terminally HA-tagged RAP1 that has been shown to retain its essential functions. Adding the HA tag to the C-terminus of RAP1 may well cause certain defects to RAP1. For example, N-terminally HA-tagged TERT does not complement the telomere shortening phenotype in TERT null <italic>T. brucei</italic> cells, while C-terminally GFP-tagged TERT does, indicating that HA-TERT is not fully functional while TERT-GFP likely has its essential functions (Dreesen, RU thesis). Although RAP1-HA behaves similar to WT RAP1 in many ways, it is still not fully validated that this protein retains essential functions of RAP1. By the way, it has been published that cells lacking one allele of RAP1 behave as WT cells for cell growth and VSG silencing (Yang et al. 2009, Cell; Afrin et al. 2020, mSphere). In addition, although RAP1 may interact with TRF weakly, the interaction is direct, as shown in yeast 2-hybrid analysis in (Yang et al. 2009, Cell).</p><p>Alternatively, if the authors do not wish to validate the functionality of RAP1-HA, they need to add one paragraph at the beginning of the discussion to clearly state that RAP1-HA may not behave exactly as WT RAP1. This is important for readers to better interpret the results. In addition, the authors need to tune down the current conclusions dramatically, as all described observations are made on RAP1-HA but not the WT RAP1.</p></disp-quote><p>The results with RAP1-HA are consistent with previous knowledge of RAP1 interactions with telomeric proteins and DNA. Hence, the C-terminal HA-tagged RAP1 seems, by all measures, functional. Nevertheless, to make it clear for the reader, we added a note in the discussion, lines 244-246: âAlthough we showed that C-terminal HA-tagged RAP1 protein has telomeric localization (Cestari et al. 2015, PNAS) and interactions with other telomeric proteins (Cestari et al. 2019 Mol Cell Biol); we cannot rule out potential differences between HA-tagged and non tagged RAP1.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For a similar reason, the current EMSA results truly reflect how C-terminally His6-tagged RAP1 and RAP1 fragments behave.

It is also essential for the authors to clearly state in the discussion that the tagged RAP1 fragments bind DNA, but the current data do not reveal whether WT RAP1 binds DNA. In addition, the authors incorrectly stated that &quot;disruption of the MybL domain sequence did not eliminate RAP1-telomere binding in vivo&quot; (lines 165-166). In ref 29, deletion of Myb domain did not abolish RAP1-telomere association.
