MET activation relies on ligand binding to the extracellular receptor, which prompts dimerization, intracellular phosphorylation, and recruitment of associated signaling proteins. Mutations, which are predominantly observed clinically in the intracellular juxtamembrane and kinase domains, can disrupt typical MET regulatory mechanisms. Understanding how juxtamembrane variants, such as exon 14 skipping (METΔEx14), and rare kinase domain mutations can increase signaling, often leading to cancer, remains a challenge. Here, we perform a parallel deep mutational scan (DMS) of the MET intracellular kinase domain in two fusion protein backgrounds: wild-type and METΔEx14. Our comparative approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between a juxtamembrane segment and the kinase ⍺C-helix, pointing to potential differences in regulatory mechanisms between MET and other RTKs. Additionally, we have uncovered a β5 motif that acts as a structural pivot for the kinase domain in MET and other TAM family of kinases. We also describe a number of previously unknown activating mutations, aiding the effort to annotate driver, passenger, and drug resistance mutations in the MET kinase domain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>deep mutational scanning</kwd><kwd>receptor tyrosine kinase</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA239604</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collisson</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name><name><surname>Jura</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hanna Gray Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coyote-Maestas</surname><given-names>Willow</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep mutational scanning reveals interactions in the MET kinase domain that are critical for regulation and cancer-related signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RTKs are transmembrane proteins that play an essential role in the initiation and regulation of signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). Most RTKs are activated upon extracellular ligand binding, promoting a relay of intracellular phosphorylation events that drive signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). Mutations that allow RTKs to signal independent of ligand or other typical regulatory mechanisms are commonly identified in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duplaquet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saraon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Comoglio et al., 2018</xref>). The transition from physiological ligand-dependent to pathological ligand-independent signaling is exemplified by the RTK, MET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Kinase activity of MET is normally activated by dimerization due to the binding of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to the MET extracellular binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Linossi et al., 2021</xref>). The resultant signaling is crucial for pathways implicated in development and wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trusolino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Petrini, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kato, 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MET domain boundaries and deep mutational scan (DMS) experimental workflow.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain boundaries of the full-length MET receptor (MET) and TPR-MET fusion (TPR-MET).

In MET fusions, replacement of the extracellular domain (ECD) and transmembrane domain by an in-frame translocation generates proteins with constitutive oligomerization of the intracellular domain (ICD), and kinase domain (KD) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). While MET fusions are rare in patients, they are important tools in studying MET in cellular models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vigna et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pal et al., 2017</xref>). A more common mutation in cancer is METΔEx14, a splicing variant that skips the entire exon 14 coding region, resulting in a shorter ICD missing approximately half of the juxtamembrane domain (JM) upstream of the KD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kong-Beltran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frampton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The METΔEx14 variant maintains the ligand-binding ECD and is oncogenic in part due to a combination of increased ligand sensitivity and reduced degradation due to the loss of a Cbl ubiquitin ligase interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frampton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abella et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peschard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kong-Beltran et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, as in many RTKs, distinct cancer-associated missense mutations are increasingly mapped to the MET kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duplaquet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiara et al., 2003</xref>). Annotation of the status of these mutations as driver, passenger, or resistance mutations remains a significant challenge for the use of targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandes et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use deep mutational scanning (DMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fowler and Fields, 2014</xref>) to screen a nearly comprehensive set of MET kinase domain mutations. Previous DMS studies have identified potential activating mutations and provided insight into the allosteric regulation of other kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Persky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hobbs et al., 2022</xref>). A phenotypic and inhibitor resistance DMS in the Ser/Thr kinase ERK2, reported tumor-associated mutations enriched at recruitment domains, in addition to identifying mutations that confer resistance without direct drug-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenan et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, when compared across Ser/Thr kinases like ERK2 and BRAF, and Tyr kinases like EGFR and ABL1, screens against CDK4/6 highlighted a ‘pocket protector’ position near the ATP-binding site, and a generalizable allosteric, activating ‘keymaster’ position within the N-lobe of kinases as sites of drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Persky et al., 2020</xref>). DMS of the Tyr kinase, SRC, elucidated a coordinated role between the αF pocket and the SH4 domain to stabilize SRC’s closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahler et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover<bold>,</bold> mutations to SRC autoinhibitory regions were identified as general resistance hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty et al., 2021</xref>). DMS of an ancestral reconstruction of the Syk-family kinases, AncSZ, revealed mutations that improve bacterial protein expression, in addition to finding commonalities between AncSZ and eukaryotic Syk kinases at regulatory regions like the αC-β4 loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hobbs et al., 2022</xref>). Together, these studies have been critical in illuminating novel features across Tyr and Ser/Thr kinases, which we now build on for the RTK family with MET.</p><p>To identify residues that have a direct effect on kinase function, we leveraged the murine Ba/F3 cell line as a selection system. The Ba/F3 cell line has been used as a model to study RTK signaling because it exhibits: (1) undetected expression of endogenous RTKs including Met, (2) addiction to exogenous interleukin-3 (IL-3) for signaling and growth, and (3) dependence on exogenous kinase expression for growth in the absence of IL-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daley and Baltimore, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Warmuth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koga et al., 2022</xref>). IL-3 withdrawal, therefore, serves as a permissive signaling switch that allows for the effective readout of variants that alter kinase-driven proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melnick et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we used the TPR-fusion of the MET ICD (TPR-MET) to screen for potential activating and inactivating mutations in the KD. The TPR-MET fusion provides the advantage of studying MET’s kinase domain in a cytoplasmic, constitutively oligomerized, active, and HGF-free system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peschard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rodrigues and Park, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vigna et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujino et al., 2019</xref>). This system also affords enough dynamic range to identify mutations that cause increased proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melnick et al., 2006</xref>). We also assessed the impact of exon 14 loss (ΔEx14) on the MET kinase mutational landscape to better understand this oncogenic lesion. Our comprehensive interrogation of the MET kinase domain reveals novel regulatory regions and acts as a reference for rare activating mutations in both wild-type and ΔEx14 backgrounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Measurement of MET kinase domain variant activities in a wild-type intracellular domain</title><p>To perform a DMS in TPR-MET, we generated a site saturation mutagenesis DNA library of the MET KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our library also included the final alpha-helix of the JM region (⍺JM), which is resolved in most crystal structures, and is just upstream of the KD. Our variant library carried &gt;99% of all possible missense mutations from positions 1059–1345 of human MET, including two internal controls: a WT-synonymous substitution at each position and premature stop codons every eleven positions (24 total). These controls allow us to use deep sequencing to estimate the fitness of WT, null, and deleterious variants. The library was cloned into the TPR-fusion background containing the remaining JM (aa 963–1058), upstream of the ⍺JM and KD, and the complete C-terminal tail (aa 1346–1390) downstream of the KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We transduced the library into Ba/F3 cells using retrovirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).

Kinase domains have a conserved hydrophobic core with several motifs that are important for folding, stability, conformational transitions, and catalysis. The kinase domain is structurally composed of two ‘lobes,’ the N- and C-lobe, which together enclose the catalytic site. The N-lobe is a dynamic unit comprised of five β-sheets and the ⍺C-helix, while the C-lobe is a more rigid unit composed of seven ⍺-helices connected by loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kornev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kornev et al., 2008</xref>). Two hydrophobic ‘spines’ (the R- and C-spine) assemble across the lobes as the kinase transitions to an active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). In transitioning from an inactive to the active state, the kinase domain undergoes a conformational rearrangement, becoming catalytically poised through the phosphorylation of A-loop tyrosines 1234 and 1235 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Longati et al., 1994</xref>), and a stabilized inward C-helix conformation which supports a salt bridge between E1127 and K110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kornev et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our DMS results highlight that the conserved regulatory and catalytic motifs in MET are highly sensitive to mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). Catalytic site residues involved in either the chemical step of phosphate transfer or the conformational adaptation to ATP binding, such as K1110, E1127, D1222, and G1224, are intolerant of amino acid substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Residues surrounding the kinase ‘hinge,’ which are involved in coordinating the adenosine potion of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dar and Shokat, 2011</xref>), are more tolerant to mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This tolerance is especially prominent in residues that make backbone interactions with ATP. Variants in R-spine residues are enriched in LOF fitness values. This result speaks to the importance of residue identity, not just physicochemical characteristics in the function of MET. R-spine residues F1223 and H1202 are part of the catalytic DFG and HRD motifs and do not tolerate any mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). For R-spine residues M1131 and L1142 positions, only a small number of polar uncharged substitutions show WT-like fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). Surprisingly, the MET C-spine was only moderately sensitive to mutations, with most hydrophobic and polar uncharged amino acid substitutions showing WT-like fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In comparing the MET R- and C-spines to other RTK kinase domains through sequence alignments and residue conservation scores, we found the C-spine was highly conserved at positions 1092, 1108, and 1165 but less conserved at positions 1210, 1211, 1212, 1272, and 1276, potentially because these positions co-vary in residue identity across RTKs but pack into the same hydrophobic cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Interestingly, despite positions such as 1092 and 1165 showing high conservation, there was still tolerance for several hydrophobic and polar uncharged mutations, further indicating that key catalytic and regulatory motifs display varying sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). The R-spine and catalytic residues are more highly constrained, whereas C-spine and hinge residues can tolerate a greater number of semi-conservative mutations.</p><p>On balance, most solvent-exposed and loop regions were more permissive to mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). However, certain key regulatory elements stand out, with stronger mutational sensitivity than might be expected based on structural features alone. For example, the ⍺C-helix-β4 loop which is important in ⍺C-helix modulation and regulation in many kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yeung et al., 2020</xref>), showed LOF effects in agreement with the previously described ‘ΦxHxNΦΦx’ motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yeung et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, the glycine residues in the ‘GxGxxG’ motif of the P-loop, which gates ATP entry into the active site, were intolerant to substitutions. Two other relatively immutable sites included Y1234 and Y1235, in the activation loop (A-loop) of MET. The phosphorylation of these residues is required for stabilizing the A-loop in an extended conformation that enables substrate binding and efficient catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferracini et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Naldini et al., 1991</xref>). Collectively, this deep mutational scan confirms the importance of canonical kinase features and provides a reference point for discovering previously unexplored features of the MET kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Critical contacts between the ⍺JM and ⍺C helices provide insight into potential juxtamembrane regulation of MET</title><p>Given the importance of juxtamembrane (JM) regions in controlling the active-state of many RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hubbard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabail et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wybenga-Groot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiesner et al., 2006</xref>) and the prevalence of exon 14 skipping within the JM of MET in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2017</xref>), we were interested in how patterns of mutational sensitivity from the DMS could relate the JM to potential MET regulatory mechanisms. The MET JM (aa 956–1075) is predicted to be largely unstructured, but a small region (aa 1059–1070) that folds into an alpha helix (⍺JM-helix) that packs on top of the ⍺C-helix of the kinase domain, forming a hydrophobic interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Since we included ⍺JM-helix in the DMS library, we examined the pattern of substitutions for this region and the ⍺C-helix. We observed a hydrophobic preference along both the ⍺JM-helix and ⍺C-helix residues comprising this interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The adjacent ⍺JM-helix residue 1071 also strongly prefers hydrophobic residues. This residue does not interact with ⍺C-helix, but evidently plays an important role in maintaining interactions with a hydrophobic patch in the N-lobe that includes residues L1076, L1097, and V1158. This result indicates the importance of burying the hydrophobic surfaces of the N-lobe, and ⍺C-helix in particular, for maintaining an active kinase in the TPR-MET background.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Essential ⍺JM and ⍺C interactions were revealed through variant and structural analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ensemble of 93 MET kinase domain crystal structures available in the PDB.

The precedence for this idea comes from structural studies of RTK ICDs in the EGF, PDGF, EPH, and IR families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wybenga-Groot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiesner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabail et al., 2015</xref>).

In contrast, in FLT3 the JM packs against the catalytic cleft to stabilize an inactive KD confirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffith et al., 2004</xref>). To test if the active-state is linked to JM conformation, we compared the 93 crystal structures of the MET kinase domain with a modeled portion of its JM, as a MET pseudo-ensemble, and performed a local alignment to the ⍺JM-helix and ⍺C-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Despite large changes in the relative position of the C-lobe, corresponding to active and inactive structural hallmarks, there was little ⍺JM-helix conformational variability or dependence on the active/inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Rather, ⍺JM-helix consistently packed against ⍺C-helix and maintained the hydrophobic interface across all structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>).</p><p>To compare the MET ⍺JM-⍺C helix to other RTK JM-KD interactions, we compiled a set of human RTK kinase domain crystal structures that contain a modeled ⍺JM-helix, and have both active and inactive structures available in the PDB. Within this set, IR and KIT displayed large conformational variability of the ⍺JM-helix between active and inactive states, but MET stood out again in low conformational variability independent of the kinase conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Indeed, when we examined JMs and kinase domains in a protein sequence alignment of all RTK, we observed that while ⍺C-helix is conserved across RTKs, only MET (MET, RON), TAM (TYRO3, AXL, MER), and the RYK pseudokinase harbor a ⍺JM-helix with a hydrophobic sequence pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Together, the mutational sensitivity and structural conservation of MET’s ⍺JM-⍺C helix interface point to a model, that may be shared with RON and TAM family RTKs, where ⍺JM-⍺C helix contacts are maintained in both the active and inactive state and are important for TPR-MET stability and activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>β5 P1153 is a structural pivot for the MET kinase domain N-lobe</title><p>Although most regions of high sensitivity from the DMS impinge on well-described aspects of kinase activity, P1153 stood out as a previously unremarked upon position with extremely low tolerance to mutation in our DMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Indeed, relative to the WT MET receptor, P1153L expressed equivalently, but dramatically reduced signals for phosphorylation of the MET A-loop tyrosines, a marker of active MET signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To test whether this importance extended to another MET family member, the RON receptor, which also has proline residue at the equivalent position, we tested and observed similar results. Notably, in RON the equivalent proline mutation also significantly compromised receptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These experiments provided initial validation that the results from the TPR-MET construct would translate to a full-length MET receptor context, and indicated the family-specific functional importance of proline in this position, of the β4-β5 loop.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the structural environment of P1153. It packs in a hydrophobic cluster with the resistance-associated β3-αC helix ‘keymaster’ position (L1112 in MET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Persky et al., 2020</xref>) and F1124 of αC-helix. The hydrophobic packing around P1153 by F1124 and L1112 changes across MET active and inactive structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As the αC-helix adopts an active ‘in’ or inactive ‘out’ conformation, L1112 rotates inward toward the core of the N-lobe to replace F1124 and maintain the hydrophobic environment around P1153 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The maintenance of hydrophobic contacts across these conformational changes led us to re-examine the relative lack of sequence conservation of P1153 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We compiled a set of representative kinase domain structures from each RTK family, as well as those that have had DMS studies performed previously, and analyzed the Ramachandran angles of the analogous residue in the β4-β5 loop. Although most kinases have a non-proline amino acid at that position, the analogous residues cluster around or inside the proline-permissive contour of Ramachandran space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, while no other RTK family aside from MET and TAM family kinases have a proline at the β4-β5 loop position, most do have a proline exactly one position upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This shift occurs both in sequence and in structure, where the upstream proline does not participate in the hydrophobic pivot observed for P1153 in MET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). This analysis suggests that the MET and TAM families represent a subset of RTKs that have evolved the surrounding sequence to accommodate only proline in this structurally restrained region of the β4-β5 loop, explaining the immutability in our DMS experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mutational landscape of the MET kinase domain in the absence of the exon 14 coding region</title><p>Exon 14 skipping, which maintains the ECD and transmembrane region while truncating the ICD at the JM, is one of the most common driver mutations observed in MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2017</xref>).

Counter to expectations, we did not observe a discernible growth differential for TPR-METΔEx14 relative to TPR-MET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). It is important to note that exon 14 skipping normally occurs in the context of the full-length protein, not in fusions such as TPR-MET. Therefore, the lack of a growth rate difference may be due to the need for Cbl regulation to occur at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mak et al., 2007</xref>) or due to other aspects of the Ba/F3 system. Although the lack of a growth differential means an exon 14-specific mechanism cannot be fully addressed in this experimental format, KD mutational responses are still representative and comparable.</p><p>In analyzing the mutational landscape of the TPR-METΔEx14, we found that regions implicated in the TPR-MET DMS were similarly sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). For example, the P1153 β4-β5 loop site was also intolerant to mutations in TPR-METΔEx14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Similarly, the R- and C-spine were sensitive to physicochemical changes outside of hydrophobic and polar uncharged substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>With the caveats of membrane context and growth differentials in mind, to address exon 14 and juxtamembrane-driven differences between these two mutational landscapes, we calculated the absolute score difference between TPR-METΔEx14 and TPR-MET mutations (|METΔEx14 - MET|) and plotted the |ΔScore| in a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Overall, the two landscapes were largely similar with differences emerging mostly for specific mutations. To identify and structurally map specific mutations and structural regions with the most divergent responses, positions with a |ΔScore| that met our statistical criteria were filtered and structurally mapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). Through this analysis, the largest secondary structural difference continued to emerge as the αJM-helix, where MET is more sensitive to helix-breaking mutations such as proline than METΔEx14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). Of all αJM-helix positions, L1062 displayed the greatest difference in sensitivity between these two datasets, with the introduction of negative charge resulting in the largest loss-of-function effect for the TPR-MET kinase domain, but having a null effect in the TPR-METΔEx14 kinase domain. Other regions with strong differences include the αG and APE motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>To test whether this ⍺JM-helix and ⍺C-helix sensitivity difference translated to the full-length receptor, we introduced L1062D, a mutation at the ⍺JM-⍺C-helix interface, and S1122Q, an ⍺C-helix surface mutation, into the MET and METΔEx14 receptor backgrounds in HeLa cells lacking endogenous MET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Consistent with the results from the DMS screen, in unstimulated cells, we observed that a marker of MET activity, A-loop phosphorylation, was dramatically reduced in the MET receptor for L1062D, but less so in METΔEx14, relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, upon HGF treatment, L1062D in the METΔEx14 background exhibited a high degree of activity, but L1062D MET did not. An additional marker of active MET signaling, phosphorylation on p44/42 MAPK (ERK), was similarly responsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In contrast, S1122Q was expected to have a gain-of-function effect in the MET receptor and a loss-of-function effect in the METΔEx14 receptor. For this mutation we observed no difference relative to WT in A-loop phosphorylation at baseline or upon HGF stimulation, and unexpectedly a higher pERK signal in METΔEx14 than MET, indicating that probing multiple phosphorylation sites and MET-associate pathways may be important to understand in what way mutations affect MET phosphorylation and proliferation in the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that the correlation between DMS fitness in TPR-MET and acute A-loop phosphorylation in the MET receptor is not absolute. Since KD activity at a single time point was the only parameter we explored with the membrane-associated receptor, other aspects such as sustained signaling, recruitment of specific signaling adapters, or changes in MET regulation may be more consistent with the proliferative readout of the DMS. In addition, the inconsistency in the S1122Q result may be a specific feature of the dimerized, cytoplasmic TPR-MET signaling that is sensitive to interactions with the portion of the JM deleted by exon 14. Collectively, these results highlight that the ⍺JM-⍺C helix interface is sensitive to mutation and the presence or absence of exon 14 can alter this sensitivity. While the experimental parameters of this screen may limit how translatable some mutations are in a membrane-associated receptor or in non-proliferative conditions, the consistency of most residues between backgrounds provides increased confidence in the atlas of mutational effects on MET activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Analysis of cancer-associated and resistance mutations in MET and METΔEx14</title><p>To assess the ability of the DMS to classify driver, passenger, and resistance mutations, we first gathered all MET kinase domain mutations reported from clinical observations in cBioPortal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Most of these mutations have near WT-fitness levels, with a small number having GOF fitness effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, we further subdivided our observations based on annotations in cBioPortal as either ‘clinical, validated’ or ‘clinical, not validated.’ Notably, mutations in the ‘clinical, not validated’ category were outliers with lower fitness values, indicating that these are likely passenger mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). These results validate that the DMS recapitulates known oncogenic MET kinase variants and suggest that the screen can be used to help classify driver vs. passenger mutations.</p><p>Within our gain-of-function classifications, while we pick up on several mutations at positions that have been clinically detected and experimentally validated in previous studies in both libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>), we also found missense mutations that are GOF in the DMS that have not been reported clinically, potentially indicative of novel activating mutations. We classify these mutations as ‘not clinically observed, GOF.’ We hypothesized that these variants are more difficult to observe clinically because of the constraints of the genetic code. To test this idea, we calculated the Hamming distance between the WT MET codon and mutant codon for each position within our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). We found that most “clinical, validated” mutations had Hamming distances of 1–2 nucleotide substitutions from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). However, the most common Hamming distances for ‘not clinically observed, GOF’' codons shifted 2–3 changes away from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). These GOF mutations are dispersed throughout the structure of MET kinase and have distinct patterns depending on the presence or absence of exon 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These results suggest that the DMS can identify GOF mutations that require a larger genetic ‘leap’ than what is observed in natural populations. Furthermore, the relative paucity of ‘not clinically observed, GOF’' mutations at a Hamming distance of 1 suggests that clinical observations have nearly identified all possible activating MET mutations that require only a single nucleotide change. Collectively, this suggests that our atlas will be of particular use for deciding on driver status for rare mutations that require multiple nucleotide changes.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the distribution of fitness effects for clinically observed resistance mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duplaquet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saraon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujino et al., 2019</xref>). Resistance mutations, which are clustered around the active site, are also enriched towards higher fitness values than the background missense mutation distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). This result suggests that most of these mutations can pre-exist in the population even in the absence of selective pressure from an inhibitor. Mutations labeled as both GOF from our statistical filtering, and resistant from literature reports, may indicate an effect on the activity equilibrium of kinase, whereas resistance mutations that are labeled LOF in this screen, may only become beneficial in the presence of an inhibitor. For instance, Y1230C is a recurrent resistance mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardelli et al., 1998</xref>) that interrupts Pi interactions that stabilize inhibitors at the active site, but in the absence of an inhibitor is unfavorable in METΔEx14 and only mildly unfavorable in MET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that DMS has the potential to interpret the effects of resistance mutations, an area of active concern for patients being treated with MET inhibitors in the clinic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our parallel DMS of the MET kinase domain has revealed how mutations affect the allosteric regulation of MET in two clinically relevant juxtamembrane backgrounds. Auto-regulation via juxtamembrane segments is a common feature of RTKs like the EGF, PDGF, EPH, and IR families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hubbard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jura et al., 2009</xref>). We propose that MET is similarly regulated based on the distinct sensitivity of the interface of ⍺JM and ⍺C helices to mutations between TPR-MET and TPR-METΔEx14. Given that exon 14 is directly upstream of this region, it is possible that the making and breaking of contacts between the ⍺JM and ⍺C helices during kinase activation observed in other families has a distinct structural analog in MET. Rather than variable contacts between the JM and ⍺C-helix, as observed in other families, we hypothesize that the exon 14 region of the JM has active-state dependent contacts with the ⍺JM-⍺C unit. In this model, ⍺JM-⍺C helix moves in unison between active and inactive conformations, with the rest of the JM making contacts to ⍺JM that regulate the activity state. When exon 14 is skipped, these contacts are absent, tilting the equilibrium towards an active kinase conformation. This model could augment known mechanisms of METΔEx14 activity, most notably a lack of Cbl-mediated downregulation, to enhance the oncogenic potential of this variant.</p><p>Conclusively addressing the question of how exon 14 skipping activates MET is difficult in the TPR-fusion system that we have employed here. While soluble, cytosolic oligomerization occurs for MET fusion proteins observed in some tumors, using the TPR-fusion may not accurately model all of the changes found in other types of MET lesions, such as METΔEx14. Therefore, this strategy may underestimate the effects of regulatory mechanisms related to membrane engagement or ICD oligomerization. Nonetheless, the experimental parameters of this study based on cell proliferation allowed us to understand the mutational sensitivities of the kinase domain in a cytoplasmic and constitutively active environment.</p><p>Analyzing the mutational landscape with the TPR-MET fusion approach employed here has led to multiple new insights, some of which were also validated in the full-length MET receptor. For example, one of the most unexpected regions of mutational sensitivity was P1153 in the β4-β5 loop. Based on the observed proline sequence shift, β4-β5 loop conformational restraints, and conserved hydrophobic network around the β4-β5 loop position, we suggest that this proline residue is an evolutionary dead-end. In ancestral kinases, a proline could be adopted without a significant cost at the corresponding β4-β5 loop position due to this residue being positioned in proline-permissive Ramachandran space. After the drift of the surrounding hydrophobic residues, the sequence for these residues has adapted to the unique structural properties of proline, rendering it impossible to substitute for an alternative amino acid. Interestingly, evolutionarily distant kinases that do not have proline at this position exhibit inhibitor resistance mutations at this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Persky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Shah, 2017</xref>). In some distant kinases such as PDK1, this β4-β5, and αC-helix region is part of an allosteric binding site for inhibitors (the PIF pocket) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rettenmaier et al., 2014</xref>). Given that the proline pivot region is largely intolerant of mutations, this site could potentially be targeted for allosteric inhibitors to avoid the development of resistance mutations observed in the clinic for many other small molecule MET inhibitors.</p><p>In summary, our parallel DMS of MET and METΔEx14 has built an atlas of variant effects. Moreover, we identified a small number of unique sensitivities in each background, which provides hypotheses about the mechanism of exon 14 skipping in cancer. We also observed a number of strong GOF variants that have not been observed in the clinic. Strikingly, these variants are enriched in 2 and 3 nucleotide changes, suggesting that our DMS will be especially useful in classifying rare driver mutations and that the clinical population has essentially sampled most of the single nucleotide changes. These results comprise a valuable resource for classifying driver, passenger, and resistance mutations for MET and other RTKs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mammalian cell culturing</title><p>Ba/F3 cells were purchased from DSMZ (Cat.

Next, the two cloning vectors (pUC19_kozak-TPR-METΔEx14-IRES-eGFP and pUC19_kozak-TPR-MET-IRES-mCherry), were digested with PstI-HF(NEB) and NdeI-HF (NEB), phosphatase treated with rSAP (NEB), gel extracted to isolate the backbone, and DNA cleaned (Zymo). The variant library was ligated into each vector with a 1:3 (insert: vector) T4 ligation at 16 °C overnight (NEB). Ligations were DNA cleaned (Zymo), eluted in 10 uL of nuclease-free water, and electroporated into 50 μL MegaX 10 beta cells (Invitrogen). Transformations were then recovered in 1 mL of SOC for 1 hr at 37 °C. Post recovery, 10 μL cells were collected, serial diluted, and plated at varying dilutions (1:100, 1:1 k, 1:10 k, 1:100 k, 1:1 M) to evaluate transformation efficiencies. The remainder of the transformation was then propagated in 50 mL LB and Carbeniacillin at 37 °C to an OD of 0.5, and then midi-prepped (Zymo).</p><p>Amino acid variants were successfully synthesized by Twist Biosciences for all positions with the exception of 1194 and 1278. In addition, premature stop codons were not included in the synthesized Twist library. To include these missing positions and early stop control, we generated a ‘fill-in’ library. For positions 1194 and 1278, a forward primer for each amino acid mutation and a single reverse primer was designed for inverse PCR. An early stop codon ‘fill-in’ library was also generated to introduce one stop codon every 33 bases, evenly spaced throughout the gene. This resulted in one stop codon every 11 positions, or 24 total premature stops. Again, a single forward and reverse primer was designed for each stop codon mutation using inverse PCR. Mutations were introduced into wild-type pUC19_kozak-TPR-METΔEx14-IRES-eGFP and pUC19_kozak-TPR-MET-IRES-mCherry with the following NEB Q5 High-Fidelity conditions per reaction: 10 μL 5 X Q5 buffer, 5 ng template DNA, 2.5 μL 10 μM forward primer, 2.5 μL 10 μM reverse primer, 1 μL 10 mM dNTPs (2.5 μM each), 0.5 μL Q5 Polymerase, nuclease-free water to a final volume of 50 μL. The following thermocycler parameters were then applied: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s, 10 x cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 62 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 4.4 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. A 1% agarose diagnostic gel was run with 2 μL of each reaction to conform amplification. Then all PCR samples were pooled, DNA cleaned (Zymo), and eluted in 50 μL nuclease-free water, DPN1 was digested to remove the template (NEB), DNA was cleaned again and eluted in 12 μL nuclease-free water, PNK treated (NEB), and blunt-end ligated at 16 °C overnight with T4 ligase. Ligations were DNA cleaned the next morning (Zymo) and electroporated into MegaX 10 beta cells (Invitrogen). Transformations were recovered in 1 mL of SOC for 1 hr at 37 °C, plated at varying dilutions to estimate transformation efficiencies, propagated in 50 mL LB and Carbyinacillin at 37 °C to an OD of 0.5, and then midi-prepped (Zymo). The Twist-synthesized library was then pooled together with the 1278, 1194, and premature stop ‘fill-in’ libraries at equimolar concentrations to a total of 1 ug of DNA.</p><p>7 μg of each pooled library was restriction digested with MluI-HF (NEB) and MfeI-HF (NEB) to cut out variant libraries in the kozak-TPR-MET-IRES-mCherry and kozak-TPR-METΔEx14-IRES-eGFP backgrounds. Digests were gel extracted from pUC19 and DNA cleaned (Zymo). The empty, Puromycin resistant, retroviral expression vector MSCV (addgene) was also cut MluI-HF (NEB) and MfeI-HF (NEB), phosphatase treated with rSAP (NEB), and DNA cleaned. Isolated libraries were then ligated 1:1 (insert to vector) into the MSCV retroviral vector at 16 °C overnight with T4 ligase. Ligations were then DNA cleaned (Zymo) and electroporated into ElectroMAX Stbl4 Competent Cells (Thermo Fisher). Transformations were recovered in 1 mL of SOC for 1 hr at 37 °C and after recovery, 10 μL was serially diluted and plated to estimate transformation efficiencies, while the remainder was plated on bioassay dishes. Colonies were scraped from the bioassay dishes and midi-prepped for transfections (Zymo).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Variant library introduction into Ba/F3</title><p>The MSCV_kozak-TPR-MET-IRES-mCherry and MSCV_kozak-TPR-METΔEx14-IRES-eGFP variant libraries were transfected into Plat-E cells for retroviral packaging using Lipofectamine3000 (Invitrogen). Two T-175 flasks of Plat-E cells were prepared for each library in the absence of blasticidin and puromycin 24 hr prior to transfection such that they would be at 70–80% confluency at the time of transfection. On the day of transfection, each flask of Plat-E cells was gently washed with PBS to remove the culturing media, and replaced with 35 mL Opti-MEM. For the transfection, Opti-MEM was brought to room temperature and two pairs of DNA Lo-bind 5 mL tubes were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions for Lipofectamine3000 scaled to a T-175 format. A total of 46 μg DNA was used to transfect the libraries and package the virus in parallel: MSCV_TPR-MET-IRES-eGFP, MSCV_TPR-METΔEx14-IRES-mCherry. Each flask was incubated with the transfection reagents for 5 hr at 37 °C, 5% CO2; the transfection media was then replaced with 50 mL OptiMEM, 5% FBS, 1 x GlutaMax, and 2% Sodium Pyruvate (Gibco) for viral packaging. After 48 hr post-transfection, the viral supernatant was harvested, passed through a 0.45 μm filter to remove cell debris, then precipitated overnight with 1:4 Retro-X concentrator (TakaraBio) at 4 °C, then pelleted at 380xg for 45 min at 4 C, and resuspended in 5 mL of sterile, cold PBS and stored at 4 °C in 1 mL aliquots until transduced into Ba/F3 cells.</p><p>The concentrated virus was titered in Ba/F3 cells in a 6-well plate format.

Virus was added to wells at 0, 10 x, 20 x, and 40 x dilutions to determine the proper volume for a transduction MOI of 0.1–0.3. Cells were spinfected at 250xg for 60 min at room temperature, then incubated for 48 hr. The viral titer was calculated from the percent of fluorescent cells and viral dilution.</p><p>For the DMS viral transduction, 6 million cells were spinfected at an MOI of 0.1, in triplicate for a total of three biological replicates for each library, and incubated post spinfection in a 15 cm dish with 30 mL Ba/F3 media and 10 ng/L IL-3 for 48 hr.

A total of 6 million cells from each replicate was harvested and pelleted at 250 × g to serve as the ‘time point 0’ pre-selection sample (T0).</p><p>To begin the selection of each replicate for each library, two sets of 15 cm dishes were prepared with 2.0E5 cells/ml in 30 mL 90% RPMI, 10% HI-FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. One plate was kept free of IL-3 as the experimental IL-3 withdrawal condition, while the other plate was supplemented with 10 ng/mL IL-3 to provide the control condition. Three-time points post T0 were collected for each library replicate and condition for a total of four-time points (T0, T1, T2, T3). Time points were harvested every 48 hr across 7 days; 6 million cells were harvested for each condition and pelleted at 250 × g for 5 min; 2.0E5 cells/ml were split at every time point and maintained either in IL-3 or IL-3 withdrawal conditions.</p><p>The gDNA of each time point sample was isolated with the TakaraBio NucleoSpin Blood QuickPure kit the same day the cells were harvested. gDNA was eluted in a 50 μl elution buffer using the high concentration and high yield elution manufacturer’s protocol. Immediately after gDNA was isolated, 5 μg of gDNA was used for PCR amplification of the target MET KD gene to achieve the proper variant coverage. A 150 μl PCR master mix was prepared for each sample using the TakaraBio PrimeStar GXL system according to the following recipe: 30 μl 5 X PrimeStar GXL buffer, 4.5 μl 10 μM forward primer (0.3 uM final), 4.5 μl 10 μM reverse primer (0.3 uM final), 5 μg gDNA, 12 μl 10 mM dNTPs (2.5 mM each NTP), 6 μl GXL polymerase, nuclease-free water to a final reaction volume of 150 uL. The PCR master mix was split into three PCR tubes with 50 μl volumes and amplified with the following thermocycler parameters: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s, followed by 24 x cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 60 °C for 15 s, extension at 68 °C for 14 s, and a final extension at 68 °C for 1 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Library preparation and deep sequencing</title><p>After all time points were selected, harvested, and PCR amplified for both TPR-MET and TPR-METΔEx14 libraries, the target gene amplicon was isolated from gDNA by gel purification.

The target amplicons were gel excised and purified with the Zymo Gel DNA Recovery kit. To remove excess agarose contamination, each sample was then further cleaned using the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit. Amplicon DNA concentrations were then determined by Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen).</p><p>TPR-MET and TPR-METΔEx14 libraries were then prepared for deep sequencing using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep kit in a 96-well plate format (Illumina). Manufacturer’s instructions were followed for each step: tagmentation, indexing and amplification, and clean-up. Libraries were indexed using the IDT for Nextera Unique Dual Indexes Set C (Illumina). In this approach, the 861 bp amplicon (1190 bp total amplicon length with sequence flanking the target at the 5’ and 3’ ends for buffer), for each library is randomly cleaved by a transposome into ~300 bp fragments following a Poisson distribution, which allows for direct sequencing. Indexed libraries were quantified using the Agilent TapeStation with HS D5000 screen tape and reagents (Agilent). DNA concentrations were further confirmed with a Qubit dsDNA HS assay. All samples across both TPR-MET and TPR-METΔEx14 libraries (library, biological replicate, time point, IL-3 condition) were manually normalized to 10 nM and pooled.

The screen is conducted with a highly activated fusion oncoprotein - Tpr-MET - in which the MET kinase domain is fused to the Tpr dimerization element. The mutagenized region includes the entire kinase domain and an alpha-helix in the juxtamembrane region that is essentially part of the MET kinase domain. The DMS screen is carried out in two contexts, one containing the entire cytoplasmic region of MET, and the other with an &quot;exon 14 deletion&quot; which removes a large portion of the juxtamembrane region (but retains the aforementioned alpha-helix). The work provides a robust and essentially exhaustive catalog of the effect of mutations (within the kinase domain) on the ability the Tpr-MET fusion oncoproteins to drive IL3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells. Every residue in the kinase is mutated to every natural amino acid. Given the design of the screen, one would expect it to be a powerful tool for identifying mutations that impair catalytic activity and therefore impair IL3-independent proliferation. This is borne out by the data, which reveal many many deleterious mutations. The study reveals relatively few &quot;gain-of-fitness&quot; mutations, but this is not unexpected because it is carried out with an already-activated form of the MET kinase (the oncogenic Tpr-met fusion).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors take a very scholarly and thorough approach in interpreting the effect of mutations in light of available information for the structure and regulation of MET and other kinases. They examine the effect of mutations in the so-called catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) spines, the interface between the JM alpha-helix and the C-helix, the glycine-rich loop and other key elements of the kinase, providing a structural rationale for the deleterious effect of mutations. Comparison of the panoply of deleterious mutations in the TPR-met versus TPR- exon14del-MET DMS screens reveals an interesting difference - the exon14 deletion MET is much more tolerant of mutations in the JM alpha-helix/C-helix interface. The reason for this is unclear, however.</p><p>An important qualification of the study is that it was carried out with the already highly activated Tpr-Met fusion. As a consequence, it is not expected to reveal mutations that activate the kinase -- activate in the sense of promoting a switch between physiologically-relevant inactive and active states. Consistent with this, the authors note that gain-of-fitness mutations are rare in their screen, and those that are identified induce modest but significant increases in fitness.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91619.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Estevam</surname><given-names>Gabriella O</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Linossi</surname><given-names>Edmond</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Macdonald</surname><given-names>Christian B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Espinoza</surname><given-names>Carla A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Michaud</surname><given-names>Jennifer M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Coyote-Maestas</surname><given-names>Willow</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Collisson</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jura</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Estevam et al. reports new insights into the regulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET gained from two deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets. In this paper, the authors use a classic selection system for oncogenic kinase signaling, the murine Ba/F3 cell line, to assess the functional effects of thousands of mutations in the kinase domains of MET in two contexts: (1) fusion of the whole MET intracellular region to the dimerization domain TPR, and (2) the same fusion protein, but with exon 14, which encodes part of the juxtamembrane region of MET, skipped. Critically, exon 14 skipping yields a version of MET that is found in many cancers and has higher signaling activity than the canonical MET isoform. The authors extensively analyze their DMS data to very convincingly show that their selection assay reports on kinase activity, by illustrating that many functionally important structural components of the kinase domain are not tolerant of mutation. Then, they turn their attention to a helical region of the juxtamembrane region (αJM), immediately after exon 14, which is posited to play a regulatory role in MET. Their DMS data illustrate that the strength and mutational tolerance of interactions between αJM and the key αC helix in the kinase domain depends on the presence or absence of exon 14. They also identify residues in the N-lobe of the kinase, such as P1153, which are not conserved across tyrosine kinases but appear to be essential for MET and MET-like kinases. Finally, the authors analyze their DMS data in the context of clinically-observed mutations and drug-resistance mutations.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is exciting because it provides new insights into MET regulation in general, as well as the role of exon 14. It also reveals ways in which the JM region of MET is different from that of many other receptor tyrosinekinases. The exon 14-skipped fusion protein DMS data is somewhat underexplored and could be discussed in greater detail, which would elevate excitement about the work. Furthermore, some of the cell biological validation experiments and the juxtaposition with clinical data are perhaps not assessed/interpreted as clearly they could be. Some constructive suggestions are given below to enhance the impact of the manuscript.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The main strengths of this paper, also summarized above in the summary, are as follows:</p><p>(1) The authors very convincingly show that Ba/F3 cells can be coupled with deep mutational scanning to examine MET mutational effects. This is most clearly shown by highlighting how all of the known kinase structure and regulatory elements are highly sensitive to mutations, in accordance with a few other DMS datasets on other kinases.</p><p>(2) A highlight of this paper is the juxtaposition of two DMS datasets for two different isoforms of the MET receptor. Very few comparisons like this exist in the literature, and they show how small changes to the overall architecture of a protein can impact its regulation and mutational sensitivity.</p><p>(3) Another exciting advance in this manuscript is the deep structural analysis of the MET juxtamembrane region with respect to that of other tyrosine kinases - guided by the striking effect of mutations in the juxtamembrane helical region. The authors illustrate how the JM region of MET differs from that of other tyrosine kinases.</p><p>(4) Overall, this manuscript will provide a resource for interpreting clinically relevant MET mutations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The manuscript is front-loaded with extensive analysis of the first DMS dataset, in which exon 14 is present, however, the discussion and analysis of the exon 14-skipped dataset is somewhat limited. In particular, a deeper discussion of the differences between the two datasets is warranted, to lay out the full landscape of mutations that have different functional consequences in the two isoforms. Rather, the authors only focus on differences in the JM region. What are the broader structural effects of exon 14 skipping across the whole kinase domain?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback on our manuscript and our analysis of the exon 14 skipped mutational scanning data. The lack of a robust growth differential between the wild type MET intracellular domain and the exon 14 skipped isoform within the Ba/F3 system suggests that there is not a significant growth advantage related to exon 14 skipping, likely due to the constitutive activation of both constructs by the TPR domain, which also suggests that the assay is potentially less sensitive to nuanced JM-driven effects between these two isoforms, aside from the highly sensitive ⍺JM-helix. We also lose insight on membrane-related interactions imposed on the juxtamembrane that may be important to fully understand the differences between these two isoforms in the cytoplasmically-expressed context. Therefore, we can at most speculate exon 14 skipped related differences between these two datasets.</p><p>With these caveats in mind, to further address exon 14 and juxtamembrane-driven differences between these two mutational landscapes, we calculated the absolute score difference between TPR-METΔEx14 and TPR-MET (|METΔEx14 - MET|) and plotted the |ΔScore| in a heatmap. Overall, the two landscapes, as noted in the text, are largely similar with differences emerging mostly for specific mutations. Where we see the largest secondary structural difference continues to be the ⍺JM-helix, where MET is more sensitive to helix-breaking mutations such as proline. Again L1062 has the greatest difference in sensitivity between these two datasets for the ⍺JM-helix, with the introduction of negative charge resulting in loss-of-function for the TPR-MET kinase domain but having a null effect in the TPR-METΔEx14 kinase domain. Other positions with strong differences include the ⍺G and APE motif.</p><p>We have incorporated more detailed discussion in text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is unclear if gain-of-function mutations can actually be detected robustly in this specific system. This isn't a problem at face value, as different selection assays have different dynamic ranges. However, the authors don't discuss the statistical significance and reproducibility of gain- vs loss-of-function mutations, and none of the gain-of-function mutations are experimentally validated (some appear to show loss-of-function in their cellular validation assay with full-length MET). The manuscript would benefit from deeper statistical analysis (and discussion in the text) of gain-of-function mutations, as well as further validation of a broad range of activity scores in a functional assay. For the latter point, one option would be to express individual clones from their library in Ba/F3 cells and blot for MET activation loop phosphorylation (which is probably a reasonable proxy for activity/activation).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment on the statistical interpretations of gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations. In this study we classify GOF and LOF based on the following metrics:</p><p>(1) The difference between the missense mutation score and the wild type synonymous score for a given position must be smaller than the calculated propagated error, for both IL-3 withdrawal and IL-3 conditions</p><p>(2) Missense mutations must be ≥ ±2 standard deviations (SD) from the mean of wild type synonymous mutations</p><p>Given that our assay was conducted in a constitutively active kinase in the TPR-fusion context, gain-of-function mutations are expected to not only be rare, but also supersede baseline fitness. Within the IL-3 conditions, we expect that cells are not reliant or “addicted” to MET for growth proliferation. Nevertheless, due to the parallel nature of the screen, we can compare scores for variants in the IL-3 control and IL-3 withdrawal conditions to filter mutations that are solely exhibiting high fitness under selective pressure.</p><p>To identify these mutations we (1) calculated the propagation of error between IL-3 and IL-3 withdrawal scores for the same variant (2) calculated the absolute difference between IL-3 and IL-3 withdrawal scores for the same variant (3) filtered variants if the IL-3 withdrawal score was ≥ +2 SDs, the IL-3 score was ≤ 0, and the absolute score difference between IL-3 and withdrawal conditions was larger than the propagated error.</p><p>In analyzing mutations within the IL-3 withdrawal conditions, applying our statistical metrics, we find 33 mutations within the MET library, and 30 in the METΔEx14 library, that have a score of ≥ +2 SD and low propagated error. By increasing our boundary to ≥+2.5 SD, we can classify mutations with even higher confidence, identifying 10 mutations within the MET library, and 9 in the METΔEx14 library (Supplemental Data Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In light of point 2, above, much of the discussion about clinically-relevant gain-of-function mutations feels a bit stretched - although this section is definitely very interesting in premise. A clearer delineation of gain-of-function, with further statistical support and ideally also some validation, would greatly strengthen the claims in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have provided additional analysis and details on gain-of-function (GOF) classification in Supplemental Data Figure 5 and the overlap between GOF and clinically associated mutations in Supplemental Data Figure 8. Within our gain-of-function classifications, we pick up on several mutations at positions that have been clinically detected and experimentally validated in previous studies in both libraries (D1228, G1163, L1195), and show that GOF mutations also have low variance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe a deep mutational scanning (DMS) study of the kinase domain of the c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase. The screen is conducted with a highly activated fusion oncoprotein - Tpr-MET - in which the MET kinase domain is fused to the Tpr dimerization element. The mutagenized region includes the entire kinase domain and an alpha-helix in the juxtamembrane region that is essentially part of the MET kinase domain. The DMS screen is carried out in two contexts, one containing the entire cytoplasmic region of MET, and the other with an &quot;exon 14 deletion&quot; which removes a large portion of the juxtamembrane region (but retains the aforementioned alpha-helix). The work provides a robust and essentially exhaustive catalog of the effect of mutations (within the kinase domain) on the ability of the Tpr-MET fusion oncoproteins to drive IL3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells. Every residue in the kinase is mutated to every natural amino acid. Given the design of the screen, one would expect it to be a powerful tool for identifying mutations that impair catalytic activity and therefore impair IL3-independent proliferation, but not the right tool for identifying gain-of-function mutations that operate by shifting the kinase from an inactive to active state (because the Tpr-Met fusion construct is already very highly activated). This is borne out by the data, which reveal many many deleterious mutations and few &quot;gain-of-function&quot; mutations (which are of uncertain significance, as discussed below).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors take a very scholarly and thorough approach to interpreting the effect of mutations in light of available information for the structure and regulation of MET and other kinases. They examine the effect of mutations in the so-called catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) spines, the interface between the JM alpha-helix and the C-helix, the glycine-rich loop, and other key elements of the kinase, providing a structural rationale for the deleterious effect of mutations. Comparison of the panoply of deleterious mutations in the TPR-met versus TPR- exon14del-MET DMS screens reveals an interesting difference - the exon14 deletion MET is much more tolerant of mutations in the JM alpha-helix/C-helix interface. The reason for this is unclear, however.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Because the screens were conducted with highly active Tpr-MET fusions, they have limited power to reveal gain-of-function mutations. Indeed, to the extent that Tpr-MET is as active or even more active than ligand-activated WT MET, one could argue that it is &quot;fully&quot; activated and that any additional gain of fitness would be &quot;super-physiologic&quot;. I would expect such mutations to be rare (assuming that they could be detected at all in the Ba/F3 proliferation assay). Consistent with this, the authors note that gain-of-function mutations are rare in their screen (as judged by being more fit than the average of synonymous mutations). In their discussion of cancer-associated mutations, they highlight several &quot;strong GOF variants in the DMS&quot;. It is unclear what the authors mean by &quot;strong GOF&quot;, indeed it is unclear to this reviewer whether the screen has revealed any true gain of function mutations at all. A few points in this regard:</p><p>(1) More active than the average of synonymous mutations (nucleotide changes that have no effect on the sequence of the expressed protein) seems to be an awfully low bar for GOF - by that measure, several synonymous mutations would presumably be classified as GOF.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that any mutation above the average synonymous would not be a robust assessment and thus why we statically filtered mutations in our entire analysis. To this point, and that of Reviewer 1, we have further outlined our statistical definitions. In classifying mutations as GOF or LOF, the following parameters were used:</p><p>(1) The difference between the missense mutation score and the wild type synonymous score for a given position must be smaller than the calculated propagated error, for both IL-3 withdrawal and IL-3 conditions</p><p>(2) Missense mutations must be ≥ ±2 standard deviations (SD) from the mean of wild type synonymous mutations</p><p>Therefore, only variants at the tail-ends of the mutational distribution were assessed, and further filtered based on propagation of error. For this reason, a “strong GOF” mutation as noted in this study is one that improves the fitness of an already active kinase. As pointed out, within our analysis, these are very rare occurrences, and in focusing on cancer-associated mutations we find that the variants that meet these statistical parameters require a larger genetic “leap” in the codon space. Overall, we have also changed our language in reference to GOF mutations in text.</p><p>We hope this concern has been addressed in the new Supplemental Data Figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the +IL3 heatmap in supplemental Figure 1A, there is as much or more &quot;blue&quot; indicating GOF as in the -IL3 heatmap, which could suggest that the observed level of gain in fitness is noise, not signal.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope this concern has been addressed in the previous responses and new Supplemental Data Figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) And finally, consistent with this interpretation, in Supplemental Figure 1C, comparing the synonymous and missense panels in the IL3 withdrawal condition suggests that the most active missense mutations (characterized here as strong GOF) are no more active than the most active synonymous mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope this concern has been addressed in the previous responses and figures above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My other major concern with the work as presented is that the authors conflate &quot;activity&quot; and &quot;activation&quot; in discussing the effects of mutations. &quot;Activation&quot; implies a role in regulation - affecting a switch between inactive and active conformations or states - at least in this reviewer's mind. As discussed above, the screen per se does not probe activation, only activity. To the extent that the residues discussed are important for activation/regulation of the kinase, that information is coming from prior structural/functional studies of MET and other kinases, not from the DMS screen conducted here. Of course, it is appropriate and interesting for the authors to consider residues that are known to form important structural/regulatory elements, but they should be careful with the use of activity vs. activation and make it clear to the reader that the screen probes the former. One example - in the abstract, the authors rightly note that their approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between the JM segment and the C-helix, but then they go on to assert that this points to differences in the regulation of MET and other RTKs. There is no evidence that this is a regulatory interaction, as opposed to simply a structural element present in MET and indeed the authors' examination of prior crystal structures shows that the interaction is present in both active and inactive states.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, and we completely agree that the distinction between “activity” and “activation” is important and that we can at most speculate and propose models for effects related to activation from this screen. We have edited the text to reflect these distinctions. In respect to activation and the second point, we believe the screen highlights the ⍺JM-C interface as a critical structural region, which <italic>may</italic> have a role in regulation based on the paradigm of juxtamembrane regulation in RTKs, the presence of a similar interface in TAM family kinases, the co-movement of the ⍺JM-helix and ⍺C-helix between active and inactive conformations in the structural ensemble, and the observation that within the TPR-METΔEx14 library there is a greater tolerance for mutations at interface positions than TPR-MET. We hope that are follow-up studies that directly probe the ⍺JM-C interface in respect to the entire juxtamembrane to truly say if/ what role this conserved motif plays in regard to MET function. We have changed the language of the text to reflect how these differences contribute to our proposed model, rather than any unintended assertion on direct regulatory effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Suggested major points to address:</p><p>(1) Although the authors show that several key functional residues in the kinase domain are highly sensitive to mutation, it would be nice if the authors further established a clear connection between kinase activity and enrichment in the Ba/F3 assay. Specifically, it is unclear to what extent there is a correlation between the extent of enrichment/depletion and kinase activity - is a larger activity score necessarily indicative of higher kinase activity? This is partly validated by the P1153L mutation autophosphorylation western blots in Figure 4B, but this correlation is somewhat undermined by the data in 5F. Autophosphorylation data (or phosphorylation data on a direct downstream substrate) for a few mutants would really solidify what the activity score is truly reporting. This might also clarify the extent to which the difference between the two screens can be interpreted, and the extent to which gain-of-function can be interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>The Ba/F3 assay was carefully chosen for its addiction to exogenous IL-3, which serves as a permissive signaling switch. Any mutation that prevents TPR-MET/ΔEx14 from properly functioning is therefore dampening its signaling ability. Nevertheless, it is possible that some mutations with high scores are truly improving activity and others are sustaining activity through more stable interactions than the wild type kinase domain or with downstream signaling partners, which would require careful biochemical dissection outside the scope of this study. To address these points, we now refer to the mutation score simply as “score” rather than “activity score” and further discuss these caveats in text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Overall, the exon 14-skipped dataset is under-discussed in the paper. The comparison of the two datasets is where most deep insights are likely to be found, and so a more thorough analysis/discussion of this dataset would really elevate the significance of the paper. For example, there appear to be a very large number of mutations that have divergent effects in the two screens (everything along the dashed lines in Figure 5D), but it's unclear where most of these mutations lie on the structure. It would be helpful if the residues with divergent mutational effects between the two screens (Supplementary Figure 5E) were mapped onto a structure of the JM-KD construct.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, new analysis has been added to the supplement, showing the score differences between MET and METΔEx14 mutations as a heatmap (Supplemental Data Figure 7A). Within this analysis we further applied our statistical filtering methods and structurally mapped positions with the greatest differential scores to show where divergent effects cluster (Supplemental Data Figure 7D). Consistent with our previous reports, the ⍺JM-helix and ⍺C-helix show the largest cluster of divergent effects, in addition to sites such as the ⍺G and APE motif. Further discussion of these points have been added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Based on the observations that αJM-αC interactions seem to be less strictly required in the exon 14 mutant, the hypothesis that exon 14 skipping merely removes a Cbl docking site seems largely unsatisfactory. There seems to be more direct structural alterations that could explain this change, but these are not really discussed or speculated on. Related to this, while L1062 mutations are more tolerated, as the authors showed in both the mutational heatmap and the cellular experiments, its binding counterpart L1125 still seems to be somewhat immutable based on the heatmaps. So, more hypothesis/exploration of how exon 14 skipping affects MET KD structure would be a nice addition to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that loss of the Cbl docking site is an insufficient model to capture the full nature of JM regulation and exon 14 skipping effects, which was a major incentive for this study. The outstanding ⍺JM-⍺C-helix sensitivity also excites us because it points to a potential regions of the JM that potentially is involved in kinase activity through ⍺C-helix interactions, much like the CDK models and other RTK-JM interactions. We observed that the ⍺JM-⍺C helix retain contact, and propose that the ⍺JM-⍺C helix move in unison between active and inactive conformations. However, it is possible that a more complicated mechanism might also exist, where there is a larger degree of maintenance of these contacts in a homodimer. For instance, in Figure 3G, if you compare the ⍺JM-helix conformations, in both RON and AXL there is more distance and a pivot away from the ⍺C-helix. It’s is possible that there are shared mechanisms between the MET and TAM families that could further elucidate exactly how these ⍺JM-helices interact with the kinase domain during the activity transitions and what biophysical role JM truncations play.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The discussion about mutations S1122Q and L1062D is a bit confusing and incomplete. From the DMS data, it appears that L1062D should be mildly gain-of-function for the exon 14 deletion variant and very loss of function for wild-type MET. In the validation HeLa cell experiments L1062D is loss-of-function in both contexts, but a mention of this discrepancy is omitted. Then, when the discordance between DMS and HeLa cell experiments is observed again for S1122Q, it is explicitly called out for activation-loop phosphorylation, but then there is no mention of the fact that HGF stimulation leads to greater pERK levels for S1122Q in the exon 14 deletion context (the opposite of the DMS result). The Erk phosphorylation discrepancy should be mentioned. It is entirely reasonable, as the authors suggest, that there are differences between full-length MET and the TPR fusions, but the enhanced Erk phosphorylation by the S1122Q mutation is surprising (and intriguing!). This section could use some re-analysis/re-writing and further discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. As noted L1062D shows slight GOF in METΔEx14 but LOF in MET. The blots show expression of L1062D and S1122Q in the full length receptor in the absence and presence of HGF stimulation. L1062D is loss of function for both contexts only in -HGF conditions, but shows expression in phosphorylated METΔEx14, but not MET. For S1122Q, indeed there is a stronger pERK signal in the METΔEx14, which highlights how probing all regions of phosphorylation (A-loop and C-tail) and many MET-associate pathways (ERK, AKT) may be important to understand in what way these mutations are affect MET phosphorylation and proliferation. We have included this point in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Related to the previous point, one other thing to consider here is that perhaps gain-of-function mutations are simply not detectable in this particular DMS assay. The authors state that GOF and LOF are defined as 2 standard deviations from the mean of the WT-synonymous distribution. How many mutations are actually designated to be GOF based on this criterion? Are those GOF mutations as reproducible as the LOF mutations? It would be worthwhile to separately analyze the variance in activity scores for every loss-of-function mutation and gain-of-function mutation. It seems likely that loss-of-function scores are a lot more reproducible than gain-of-function ones, suggesting that the most apparent gain-of-function signal is just noise in the assay. The few outliers to this point (true gain-of-function mutations) may be some of the ones discussed in Figure 6. If this is true, it would lend confidence to the claims associated with Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>In analyzing and classifying both GOF and LOF mutations, error was a main filtering parameter. Each fitness score, calculated by Enrich2, is representative of the slope across time points and biological replicates for the read frequency of the mutation. The associated standard error (SE) reflects the variance for each mutation within the scoring framework (Rubin et al., 2017). Mutations were then further filtered based on low propagated error, calculated by comparing the standard error (SE) of each missense mutation to the SE of the respective wild type synonymous mutation. Therefore, mutations were only classified as GOF or LOF if there was low error, in addition to the other score filters previously described. We have plotted the classified GOF mutations with their respective SE in the newly incorporated Supplemental Data Figure 8C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In the discussion of panels 6C and 6D, the assertion is that the &quot;clinical, not validated&quot; category has more mutations that are low-fitness outliers than the &quot;clinical, validated&quot; category. From the graphs, it's actually hard to tell if this is the case for two reasons: (1) the way the graphs are normalized, (to the largest value in each histogram), you cannot compare bar heights (and thus number of mutations) between two histograms on the same graph. (2) Just looking at the shapes of the distributions, or considering maybe the mean or median values, it's unclear whether the &quot;validated&quot; and &quot;not validated&quot; populations are actually different from one another.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important indication, and we have added analysis showing the distribution and number of clinically-associated mutations within our libraries without normalization in the main text and in Supplemental Data Figure 8A-B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) This sentence in the last results section is somewhat unclear: &quot;GOF resistance mutations may indicate an effect on the equilibrium of kinase activation, whereas LOF resistance mutations likely affect inhibitor-protein interactions directly.&quot; The first part makes sense, but it is not totally obvious how one can infer anything about inhibitor-protein interactions from mutations that are LOF with respect to kinase activity. Related to this, how are LOF mutations selected in the presence of an inhibitor? Is the assumption here that the mutation might totally abrogate inhibitor binding but only slightly impair the kinase? Perhaps this could be explained a bit more.</p></disp-quote><p>Here, the idea we wanted to get across is that there are two models that can explain how a mutation can contribute to resistance: shift the activity equilibrium at baseline or directly impair drug effects and restore baseline activity. Mutations that are labeled resistant and GOF, favor the first model. Mutations that are labeled resistant and LOF, favor the second model. In the presence of an inhibitor, which is in the scope outside of this study, LOF mutations would be sensitive to the inhibitor (ie WT-like and sensitive).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Some additional details of the library preparation and sequencing should be given in the methods section. It appears that the variable region of the library is roughly 275 amino acid residues long, which means &gt;800 bases. How was this sequenced? From the methods, it sounds like all of the variants were pooled into a single library, but then sequencing was done using a 300x300 paired-end Illumina kit, which would not cover the length of the whole variable region. Was the library actually screened in segments as sub-libraries and then separately sequenced? Alternatively, was the whole library screened at once, and then different segments were amplified out for sequencing? If the latter approach is used, this could yield confounding results for counting wild-type variants that have the parent wild-type coding sequence. For example, if you amplify your kinase library in three segments after a single selection on the whole library, and you sequence those three segments separately, you might find a read that appears as wild-type in the part you amplified/sequenced but has a mutation in a region that you did not sequence. If this approach is taken, the counts for the wild-type sequence would be inaccurate, in which case, how is the data normalized with WT as a reference? Regardless of the method used, some more details should be provided in the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we used the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina), which uses a tagmentanation approach that randomly fragments our 861 bp amplicon into ~300 bp fragments with a transposase, resulting in a Poisson distribution of fragment sizes. This allows for direct sequencing of all amplicons and libraries with an SP300 paired-end run, which we ran on two lanes of a NovaSeq6000. Samples are demultiplexed and processed by our analysis pipeline with a lookup table that associates the unique dual index to the specific sample (library, time point, biological replicate, IL-3 condition).</p><p>The TPR-MET and TPR-METΔEx14 libraries were prepared in parallel throughout the entire experiment, from cloning to virus generation to transductions, screening, cell harvesting, sequencing prep, and sequencing. In other words, the TPR-MET and TPR-METΔEx14 were transduced into their own, respective batch of cells for each biological replicate, then selected and screened on the same day for each replicate and time point. Each library and condition (time point, biological replicate, IL-3 condition) was prepared in parallel but still an independent sample. At the stage of tagmentation, each sample was arrayed, where each well corresponds to a library, biological replicate, and time point. At the stage of sequencing, samples across the two libraries were normalized to 10mM (library, biological replicate, time point, IL-3 condition) then pooled together and all run on two lanes of the same NovaSeq6000 flow cell.</p><p>PCR and sequencing bias was one of the most important parameters for us, which is why we performed tagmentation in parallel and sequenced everything on the same run. We have added extra details to the methods and hope that we have clarified your questions on this matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggested minor points to address:</p><p>(1) TPR (as in TPR-MET fusion) is not defined in the text when it is first mentioned. And it wasn't immediately clear that this is not a membrane-associated domain (Figure 5E makes this way more obvious than Figure 1B does). Perhaps this could be made more explicit in the text or in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated a new schematic in Figure 1B to better illustrate the TPR-fusion constructs used within this study. The usage of the TPR-fusion is first mentioned in the introduction, paragraph 4, and revised the main-text to delineate the usage of the TPR-fusion more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 2G, it would be helpful if the wild-type amino acid residue was listed underneath the position number in the two graphs (even though those residues are also highlighted in 2H).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this recommendation, we have added the wild type amino acid next to the position number in the x-axis label.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For Supplementary Data Figure 2, is it possible to calculate conservation scores at each position using some kind of evolutionary model, rather than relying on visual inspection of the sequence logo? Can one quantitatively assert that the C-spine is less conserved than the R-spine overall, or can this only be said for certain positions? Related to this, in comparing Figure 2G to Supplementary Data Figure 2, it is interesting that there isn't any obvious correspondence between mutational tolerance and conservation within the C-spine. For example, 1165 seems to be the most conserved position in the C-spine, but several substitutions are tolerated at this position, just like 1210, which is one of the least conserved positions in the C-spine. Finally, it's very likely that positions 1165, 1210, 1272, and 1276 co-vary, given that they all pack into the same hydrophobic cluster. This might be why they appear less conserved. These last few points might be worth discussing briefly if the authors want to relate mutational tolerance to evolutionary conservation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this recommendation. To better quantitatively determine C-spine versus R-spine conservation, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of all RTK kinase domain sequences to properly identify corresponding R- and C-spine locations, as previously done in generating the spine logos, then used the bio3D structural bioinformatics package in R to calculate the conservation score of each residue position by amino acid “similarity” with a blosum62 matrix (Supplemental Data Figure 2B). In concordance with the logos, we find that C-spine positions 1092, 1108, 1165 have the highest conservation scores, even compared to some R-spine mutations. We also see across the alignment that indeed, C-spine positions 1165 1210,1211,1212, and 1272, and 1276 co-vary within RTK families. We have revised the text to reflect these points, and more specifically discuss position-level conservation rather than generalizing conservation for the C- and R-spines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) On Page 7 of the merged document, there appear to be some figure labeling errors.

Rather, the normalization appears to be to the bin with the largest number of mutants in it, which is given a value of 1. This difference is really critical to how one visually inspects the overlaid histograms.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Here, the intention was to aid in the visualization of the distribution of cancer-associated and resistance associated mutations, which is a much smaller population compared to the whole library and becomes easily masked. We originally applied a “stat(ncount)” function in R, which as noted scales the data and sets the peak to 1, which only applied to the clinical and cancer-associated mutations plotted. Now, to better compare distributions, normalization has been removed, instead opting to overlay the distributions of all missense mutations and the subset of clinical mutations directly with their own y-axis scale. This modification has been made throughout Figure 6 panels, hopefully improving interpretability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>A few thoughts/suggestions:</p><p>(1) Regarding kinase regulation, the &quot;closing of N- and C-lobe&quot; upon activation is an often mentioned component of activation, and I'm sure is true in many cases, but it is not a general feature of kinase activation.</p></disp-quote><p>The text has been updated - we removed the description of N- and C-lobe closure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) With respect to the inactive state of MEK, the DFG-flipped structure discussed here is almost certainly an inhibitor-induced conformation. Again, DFG-flip is often discussed as a mechanism of kinase regulation, and while in some kinases this might be the case, more often it is a drug-induced or drug-stabilized inactive conformation. The SRC/CDK-like inactive conformation in 2G15 is more likely a physiologically relevant inactive state. (or even better, the ATP-bound inactive state structure 3DKC, which exhibits a somewhat different SRC/CDK-like inactive conformation).</p></disp-quote><p>The PDB 3R7O structure was chosen as the main representation because it was the clearest representation of a wild type structure with an aligned R- and C- spine, solvent-exposed, phosphorylated activation loop. Although 3DKC is bound to ATP, this structure is still in an inactive conformation and has stabilizing mutations (Y1234/F, Y1235D) and an atypical alpha helix structure in the activation loop. However, we agree the SRC/CDK-like inactive conformation is an important representation and we have incorporated our structural mapping on 2G15 in the new supplemental figures with further details on statistical analysis and comparison of libraries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Following the comments above, I would describe the process of activation in a simpler way (in any case, it is peripheral to the work described here). Something along the lines of &quot;phosphorylation on tyrosines XX and XX induces rearrangement of the activation segment and promotes and stabilizes the inward active position of the C-helix.&quot; Can go on to mention that this forms the E1127/K1110 salt bridge.
