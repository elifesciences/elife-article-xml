of agency, or experience of control over our actions and their outcomes. As humans, we can report on this experience through judgments of agency. These judgments often occur under noisy conditions. We examined the computations underlying judgments of agency, in particular under the influence of sensory noise. Building on previous literature, we studied whether judgments of agency incorporate uncertainty in the same way that confidence judgments do, which would imply that the former share computational mechanisms with metacognitive judgments. In two tasks, participants rated agency, or confidence in a decision about their agency, over a virtual hand that tracked their movements, either synchronously or with a delay and either under high or low noise. We compared the predictions of two computational models to participants’ ratings and found that agency ratings, unlike confidence, were best explained by a model involving no estimates of sensory noise. We propose that agency judgments reflect first-order measures of the internal signal, without involving metacognitive computations, challenging the assumed link between the two cognitive processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>agency</kwd><kwd>metacognition</kwd><kwd>uncertainty</kwd><kwd>confidence</kwd><kwd>computational model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>337619223 / RTG2386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constant</surname><given-names>Marika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Constant</surname><given-names>Marika</given-names></name><name><surname>Filevich</surname><given-names>Elisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Israeli Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISF 1169/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salomon</surname><given-names>Roy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Explicit judgments of agency incorporate uncertainty by reflecting first-order measures of a noisy signal, but they do not correspond to second-order metacognitive measures of the noise in a signal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Attributing ourselves agency, or causation of our actions and their outcomes, is central to our experience of moving intentionally. Previous research has suggested that agency depends on a comparison between the predicted and observed consequences of our actions, resulting in a prediction error signal if they do not match. Under this widely accepted comparator model of agency, it is the prediction error signal that leads to our feeling of agency (FoA), which we assess in order to make judgments of agency (JoAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carruthers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frith et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haggard, 2017</xref>). There are several sources of noise to these signals, and agency processing, much like other perceptual processing, occurs under varying degrees of uncertainty. Noisy agency signals are suggested to play a role in clinical cases involving striking disruptions to agency, such as in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corlett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fletcher and Frith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore and Fletcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>), so it is critical to understand precisely how agency signals change with uncertainty, in both healthy and clinical populations.</p><p>Some existing models of agency have suggested that noise affects the comparator signal because the latter is the result of a cue integration process, in which the motor and sensory information are integrated and weighted by their reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore and Fletcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moore and Haggard, 2008</xref>). In line with these models, participants’ FoA, as measured by an implicit temporal binding effect, has been found to rely less on cues that are noisy or imprecise, and more on more informative cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolpe et al., 2013</xref>). Further, one recent study put forward a possible computational model in which FoAs are affected by sensory noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legaspi and Toyoizumi, 2019</xref>). However, work on uncertainty in lower level agency processing has not addressed the role of noise in the formation of JoAs. It is not clear that explicit JoAs incorporate noise in the same way as lower level FoAs, as JoAs are generally considered to be at a higher level of the processing hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallagher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haggard and Tsakiris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Explicit JoAs could incorporate noise in two main ways. One alternative is that JoAs are simply reports of FoAs, that do not involve secondary assessments of their reliability. A second alternative is that JoAs monitor the uncertainty of the first-order signal through computations that include a secondary assessment of the sensory uncertainty. The crucial difference between these two alternatives is whether JoAs require an estimate of the precision of the first-order signal, or can be determined without any information about it. This kind of second-order representation of the precision of a first-order signal is a defining feature of what has been called a metacognitive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shea, 2012</xref>). Accordingly, metacognitive judgments are often operationalized as confidence ratings following discrimination responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fleming and Lau, 2014</xref>), and these second-order metacognitive ratings have been shown to monitor the uncertainty of the perceived internal signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Gardelle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Navajas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rausch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanders et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spence et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the literature, JoAs have sometimes been considered to be metacognitive reports about otherwise first-order agency signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carruthers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Metcalfe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Metcalfe and Greene, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miele et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Potts and Carlson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Terhune and Hedman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wenke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zalla et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is unclear if the link to metacognition is merely conceptual, or whether JoAs result from second-order uncertainty representations, and are computationally comparable to other metacognitive judgments. Here, we commit to a definition of metacognition as a process that involves second-order uncertainty monitoring computations, to test the link between JoAs and metacognition in this narrow but computationally tractable sense.</p><p>We propose that for agency judgments to be metacognitive in a computational sense, they should monitor the noise in the perceived prediction error signal, incorporating a second-order judgment of the uncertainty of one’s agency processing. We examined this by setting up a two-criterion test. The two criteria refer to behavioral and computational measures, respectively. The first criterion for JoAs to be computationally metacognitive was for sensory noise to influence JoAs in a secondary way, beyond just altering their variance across trials. We expected the effect of the delay to become smaller in high perceptual uncertainty trials, leading JoAs to be less extreme, as compared to trials with lower uncertainty. This would suggest that the reliability of the signal was estimated and factored in for each rating, against the simpler alternative that the rating was made on the basis of a linear readout of the less reliable signal. We examined this by assessing the effects of noise and delay on explicit agency ratings, using a sensory noise manipulation orthogonal to the delay.</p><p>This first criterion formed our pre-registered hypothesis and was necessary, but not sufficient, for JoAs to be considered metacognitive. It therefore served as a prerequisite for the second criterion: Agency and confidence judgments should show similar sensitivity to internal estimates of the sensory noise, suggesting the involvement of second-order uncertainty monitoring following the same computational principles. We assessed this by contrasting two computational models against distributions of JoA data, one that would reflect metacognitive monitoring of noise and an alternative model that would not. We found that JoAs satisfied the first, but not the second criterion: Sensory noise did indeed influence JoAs, but this influence did not reflect any second-order noise monitoring, suggesting that JoAs may not be metacognitive in the computational sense.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Each participant completed two tasks: A confidence-rating task, consisting of a two-interval forced choice (2IFC) followed by a confidence rating on a scale from 1 to 6; and an agency-rating task consisting of a JoA on an equivalent scale. Both tasks used the same basic stimuli, namely, a movement of participants’ index finger tracked by a LEAP Motion infrared tracker and displayed on the screen as a virtual hand movement either in synchrony or with small temporal delays. In both tasks, we manipulated sensory noise in the same way, by changing the illumination of the scene. We created two conditions (low and high sensory noise) by displaying the virtual hand under bright, high-contrast illumination or under dim, low-contrast illumination respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This change in illumination, a manipulation that was orthogonal to the stimulus intensity, effectively changed the reliability of the mapping between the external and internal signal without affecting the stimulus.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Confidence task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sensory noise conditions.

For only one of the two movements, we added a temporal delay to the virtual hand shown on the screen (in the other interval, the virtual hand was displayed to match the participant’s hand movement in real time). Participants then discriminated in which interval they felt more agency over the movement of the virtual hand, and rated confidence in their response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We assumed that participants compared their degree of control over the virtual hand in the two movements to solve the task, and rated confidence in this comparison. This paradigm brings agency into a standard framework for studying metacognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, under this operationalization, we can define correct responses to the 2IFC discrimination task as those where participants report that they felt more agency for the stimulus without any added delay, allowing us to quantify discrimination accuracy. If the illumination manipulation served to increase sensory noise in the intended way, we expected lower discrimination accuracy under high sensory noise compared to low noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macmillan and Creelman, 1991</xref>). Further, based on previous work using similar confidence paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bang and Fleming, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Gardelle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spence et al., 2016</xref>), and a normative model of confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanders et al., 2016</xref>), we predicted an interaction between sensory noise and accuracy on confidence, in particular with confidence decreasing in high noise following correct trials and increasing in high noise following incorrect trials. To test the effect of the illumination manipulation, we first built a logistic regression model on response accuracy, including sensory noise as a fixed effect, and by-participant random intercepts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for the explicit model syntax). As expected, we found a main effect of Noise, revealing significantly lower accuracy in the high-noise compared to the low-noise condition (Mdiff = 10%, SE = 1.4%, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 97.60, p &lt; 0.001, BF<sub>10</sub> = 1.78 ✕ 10<sup>20</sup>, OR = 1.55, 95% CI [1.42, 1.70]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Syntax for the linear mixed-effects models used.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Task</th><th align="left" valign="top">Hypothesis</th><th align="left" valign="top">Model formula</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Confidence Task</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sensory noise influences response accuracy</td><td align="left" valign="top">logit(Response Accuracy)~ Noise + (1 | Participant)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Confidence Task</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sensory noise influences confidence following correct decisions</td><td align="left" valign="top">Confidence~ Response + Response Accuracy*Noise + (1 | Participant)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Agency Rating Task</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sensory noise influences the effect of delay on JoA</td><td align="left" valign="top">JoA ~ Delay*Noise + (Delay:Noise | Participant)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Then, we built a linear mixed-effects model on confidence to test the second prediction (an interaction effect between sensory noise and response accuracy). The model included the interaction between response accuracy and noise level and each factor as fixed effects, as well as by-participant random intercepts. We also included response identity (first or second interval) as a fixed effect, as presentation order could have biased confidence ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jamieson and Petrusic, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeshurun et al., 2008</xref>). In line with our predictions, we found a significant interaction between Noise and Response Accuracy on confidence, F(1,8858) = 14.43, p &lt; 0.001, BF<sub>10</sub> = 2.19, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.0016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with a stronger difference in confidence between correct and incorrect trials under low noise (Mdiff<sub>Correct-Incorrect</sub> = 0.58, SE = 0.044) compared to high noise (Mdiff<sub>Correct-Incorrect</sub> = 0.34, SE = 0.042). In addition to the interaction effect, we found that confidence following incorrect decisions was lower in the high-noise compared to the low-noise condition. Although we expected confidence following incorrect decisions to increase under high noise, the ‘double-increase’ confidence pattern seen here has also been shown in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler and Ma, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rausch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rausch et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, we found a significant main effect of Response, F(1,8872) = 82.64, p &lt; 0.001, BF<sub>10</sub> = 5.71 ✕ 10<sup>14</sup>, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.0092, with pairwise comparisons revealing significantly higher confidence ratings when participants reported feeling more agency over the stimulus in the second interval, compared to the first (Mdiff = –0.27, SE = 0.030), t(8872) = –9.09, p &lt; 0.001. These results were also all confirmed by repeating this analysis with ordinal models (Appendix 2).</p><p>In order to further ensure that participants’ confidence ratings reflected metacognitive processing, especially given relatively low accuracy under high noise, we checked that their metacognitive efficiency (M-Ratio) was above-chance in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; see Appendix 3 for full analysis). Together, these results suggest that the illumination manipulation affected sensory noise as we intended, and influenced metacognitive confidence judgments as previous studies have shown.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Agency-rating task</title><p>On each trial of the agency-rating task, participants made a single movement of their index finger and watched the virtual hand model either move synchronously with their movement (25% of trials) or with a delay of either 70, 100, or 200 ms. After every movement, participants rated their agency on a scale from 1 to 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By adding sensory noise to the perceived sensory outcome of the movement (namely, the virtual hand movement), we added noise to the comparator signal that participants assessed with their JoAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We then formulated a two-criterion test to assess whether JoAs are computationally metacognitive, and hence involve second-order estimates of the noise. The first — behavioral — criterion was that mean JoAs should depend on both delay and sensory noise. This would suggest that sensory noise influences agency ratings beyond just increasing their variability, with agency ratings instead including an indication of the signal’s precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Alternatively, if the mean JoA per delay does not depend on the sensory noise level, this would indicate that JoAs are simply a first-order report of the perceived comparator signal, with mean JoA reflecting the mean of the comparator signal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The second criterion of our test, if the first criterion was met, was at the computational level, for agency ratings to involve underlying metacognitive computations such as those involved in confidence, in particular, the second-order monitoring of sensory noise. To test this, we compared two computational models built based on the results of the first criterion, a Second-order agency model that involves metacognitive processing, and an alternative First-order model that does not.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Agency-rating task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental paradigm. Cued by the offset of the fixation cross, participants made one finger movement on each trial, with their hand out of sight. On the screen, participants saw either a virtual hand moving in synchrony with their own, or with an additional delay/temporal lag. Participants then made a judgment of the degree of agency they experienced. (<bold>B</bold>) Sketch of noise dependency prediction. By decreasing the illumination of the scene, the high-noise condition adds sensory noise to the observed outcome, and hence to the comparator signal, computed as the mismatch between predicted and observed outcomes. This environmental noise, independent of the delay, leads to a noisier mapping between the actual delay in the environment and the perceived internal signal. According to the comparator model, this internal delay signal is then compared to the representation of the predicted outcome, leading to the internal comparator signal. The internal comparator signal is represented as the bottom-most red (low uncertainty) and blue (high uncertainty) probability distributions. Points reflect the perceived signals on single trials. If the JoA is a readout of the comparator signal on each trial, though the variance would increase with noise, the mean JoA will not depend on noise, but will reflect the mean of the comparator signal distribution. Alternatively, if JoAs monitor the noisiness of the comparator signal, mean JoA will depend on noise. In other words, JoAs would be a function not only of a noisy signal (x), but of the noisy signal and the noise itself (σ). (<bold>C</bold>) Interaction effect result.

We therefore excluded from the following analyses any participants for whom discrimination accuracy in the high-noise condition was not lower than in the low-noise condition in the confidence task. We note that all the results described below remain largely the same, and the conclusions unchanged, when we include the data from all participants in the analyses (see Appendix 1). We predicted that if sensory noise affected JoAs similarly to metacognitive processes, we would observe a significant interaction between Noise and Delay on JoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This would be the first of our two criteria. In particular, if uncertainty led to a metacognitive scaling of JoAs, similarly to confidence-weighted agency ratings, we would expect to see less extreme JoAs under high noise, with low certainty pulling ratings closer to the decision criterion. We investigated this using a linear mixed-effects model on JoAs that included the interaction between noise level and delay as fixed effects, and allowed for by-participant random effects of the interaction, and random intercepts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We found a significant interaction effect between Noise and Delay, F(1,52) = 61.16, p &lt; 0.001, BF<sub>10</sub> = 3.78 ✕ 10<sup>6</sup>, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.54, 95% CI [0.35, 0.67], with a less extreme negative slope across delay values in the high-noise condition (β<sub>High</sub> = -5.93, SE = 0.69), compared to low-noise (β<sub>Low</sub> = -9.84, SE = 0.77) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that JoAs met our first criterion. We also found a significant main effect of Delay, F(1,39) = 132.05, p &lt; 0.001, BF<sub>10</sub> = 14486.52, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.77, 95% CI [0.64, 0.85], replicating previous findings that showed increasing delays of the virtual hand movement to lead to lower JoAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krugwasser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stern et al., 2020</xref>). We found this effect of JoAs decreasing with delay for the majority of participants (37 out of 40) included in this analysis in both conditions, indicating that participants were able to make meaningful ratings, even in the high-noise condition. We also repeated these analyses with ordinal models, which confirmed our results (Appendix 2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Exploratory analyses</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Computational modeling</title><p>We found in our behavioral analysis that the mean JoA depended on both delay and noise, meeting our first criterion for JoAs being metacognitive. This allowed us to move on to our second test-criterion and investigate whether there are strictly metacognitive computations underlying agency judgments. In order to test our second criterion, namely, whether JoAs can be explained by the same computations as confidence, we compared two possible models of agency ratings (the Second-order model and the First-order model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), that differed in their predicted distributions of JoAs across noise conditions and delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Both models could in principle account for the observed interaction effect between noise and delay on JoA, satisfying the first criterion. However, only the Second-order model required participants to be able to reflect on the noise of their own sensory processing. The Second-order model assumed that agency ratings behave like confidence as described by Bayesian-confidence models, namely as the posterior probability that a decision is correct, given the strength of the internal evidence and the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Navajas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanders et al., 2016</xref>). The computation of this probability requires the observer to have second-order access to estimate their own sensory noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), beyond just adopting precision-weighted cues from the lower level. So, in this model, JoAs are metacognitive because they require a representation of the precision of the first-order agency signal.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Models and Predictions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two models of JoAs. In the Second-order model of agency, JoA reflects the posterior probability of the detection decision being correct, given the choice and internal evidence. The Gaussian distributions are probability distributions of the internal comparator signal. The dashed colored lines indicate the criteria, or the thresholds on the internal signal axis that delineate the different JoA values. These are spaced linearly in probability space, so their positions on the internal signal space change with noise level. The solid colored lines show the expected JoAs as a function of internal signal strength. In the First-order model of agency, JoA reflects a first-order estimate of delay compared to the criterion, not based on noise. However, the criteria are spread evenly across the range of signals within each noise level, such that they interact with noise level only due to a rescaling of ratings. The solid colored lines show the predicted JoA as a function of internal signal strength. Note that this function is linear but still interacts with noise, due to the rescaling.

This First-order model accounts for the observed relationship between noise and JoAs by considering that participants might simply treat the noise conditions independently. In practical terms, this implies that participants judged agency in low-noise trials relative to one another, and high-noise trials relative to one another. Although our design aimed to prevent this by interleaving the conditions, it is still possible that participants did this to some extent, as our noise manipulation was visually very apparent. Critically, this condition-dependent scaling is achieved without making any estimates of the sensory noise of the conditions. The only role noise plays in this model is to make the conditions distinguishable from one another such that participants might treat them independently and use the rating scale accordingly. This means that in each condition, the maximum of the scale, or a ‘6’, refers to the maximum agency experienced only within trials of that condition. Therefore, in the First-order model, a ‘6’ may differ between conditions in terms of the actual strength of the agency experience. In contrast, in the Second-order model, a JoA of ‘6’ would always reflect the same perceived level of certainty about the agency decision and hence the same agency experience, since JoAs combine the evidence strength and sensory noise.</p><p>We compared the two models in their ability to account for the distributions of JoAs per delay and noise level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) at the group level (with pooled data) and at the single-participant level. We also measured protected exceedance probabilities (PEPs) to assess the probability that each model was the most frequently occurring one in the population, adjusted for the ability to reject the null hypothesis (that the models are equally likely in the population). To compare the models, we first found the best fitting parameter values for each model — low noise σ<sub>L</sub>, high noise σ<sub>H</sub>, decision criterion (c), and the mapping parameter, or the number of ratings to be considered as ‘Yes’ responses (NRYes), for both models, as well as the scale range parameter (s) for the First-order model — using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and then performed a Bayesian-information criterion (BIC) comparison. Following standard recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Raftery, 1995</xref>), we required a minimum BIC difference of 2 in order to consider one model a better explanation of the data than the other. To perform the Bayesian model selection and calculate the PEPs, we used the ‘bmsR’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lisi, 2021</xref>) with model evidence computed from the Akaike weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Penny, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rigoux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stephan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wagenmakers and Farrell, 2004</xref>). We also performed a model recovery analysis across the set of winning parameter values of each model across participants, confirming that the models were distinguishable from one another over the entire relevant parameter space (see Appendix 4).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Agency model fits and results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model fits.

It is possible that JoAs adopt the effect of uncertainty at the first-order level, by taking a direct readout of the variable lower level signal. However, it is also possible that JoA computations involve a second-order estimate of the noise of first-order signals, which we would take to be a metacognitive computation. Here, we tested whether JoAs are metacognitive in a computational sense by examining whether they involve the same second-order uncertainty monitoring computations as metacognitive confidence ratings, or whether they can only be said to be metacognitive at a broad conceptual level. We found that uncertainty did not affect agency ratings in the same way as it does confidence ratings, suggesting that any effect of noise is better considered as an influence on first-order signals, without involving metacognitive noise estimates.</p><p>By combining two tasks, we brought JoAs into a standard metacognitive framework and compared them to confidence ratings following a 2IFC decision. We examined how discrimination accuracy and confidence changed with sensory noise in the confidence-rating task, to first confirm that the sensory noise manipulation had the intended effect. Observing the expected effects of sensory noise on confidence allowed us to consider whether JoAs in the agency-rating task responded to sensory noise in a computationally analogous way. We reasoned that, if this were the case, JoAs would satisfy two criteria: First, they would depend on the precision of the comparator information, reflecting more than just a readout of the perceived signal. Second, this dependence on noise would reflect underlying metacognitive computations such as those involved in confidence, in particular, second-order estimates of one’s own sensory noise. The JoAs satisfied the first of the test-criteria. We found that noise did indeed influence mean JoA across delays, indicating that the noise condition is factored into JoAs. However, because the noise manipulation changed the display in a visually obvious way, this information about the condition could have influenced judgments in a way that did not reflect participants making metacognitive estimates of the noise of their own processing. The second test-criterion investigated precisely this possibility.</p><p>To assess the second criterion, we compared two computational models. As a prerequisite, both models satisfied the first test-criterion. We contrasted a Second-order agency model, which included metacognitive noise estimates, with a First-order model that did not imply metacognitive processing. We tested these models in their ability to fit participants’ JoAs as well as confidence judgments, to understand the computations underlying both. In the case of confidence, the model comparison revealed that participants' judgments were best explained by the Second-order model, confirming the metacognitive computations underlying them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kepecs and Mainen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyniel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pouget et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanders et al., 2016</xref>). In striking contrast, this model comparison against participants’ agency ratings revealed that JoAs were better explained by the First-order model as compared to the Second-order agency-model. The First-order model accounted for the observed behavioral relationship between JoA and noise by assuming that participants compared trials only to other trials within the same condition, and set condition-specific maxima of their rating scales accordingly. It would be an interesting direction for future work to test how JoAs depend on sensory noise under a noise manipulation that is not easily detectable, to investigate if the behavioral relationship we observe between noise and JoAs is limited to cases in which participants can treat the manipulation conditions as independent contexts, as our models suggest.</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that while JoAs can be influenced by sensory noise, this influence is not indicative of metacognitive processing, and JoAs may better reflect first-order assessments of agency signals. We therefore argue that greater care should be taken when discussing agency within a metacognitive context, as the assumptions made about agency judgments being metacognitive do not hold on a computational level. Although this work used confidence as a benchmark for metacognitive processing, the computation of interest is second-order monitoring of the precision of one’s processing, which has become the narrower focus of recent metacognition work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fleming and Lau, 2014</xref>). While JoAs may still satisfy broad definitions of metacognition, our results suggest that they may not satisfy this narrower definition that is associated with a concrete computational view. In this sense, these results may help specify and clarify the assumed relationships between explicit agency judgments and metacognition. At the same time, they may add to our understanding of how JoAs respond to uncertainty — similarly to first-order perceptual judgments — which is critical for interpreting agency reports, especially in certain clinical cases involving agency disruptions.</p><p>Importantly, we also found that participants can make metacognitive confidence judgments <italic>about</italic> agency decisions, but that subjective agency ratings do not share these computations, despite the same basic agency task and noise manipulation. The use of 2IFC agency tasks with confidence has recently been proposed as a promising step toward a more reliable and complete investigation of agency processing, both in healthy and clinical populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, using a virtual hand, we extended this approach into a more proximal form of embodied agency, closer to agency over the body itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christensen and Grünbaum, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dogge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stern et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wen, 2019</xref>), and provided an initial step in demonstrating that participants can meaningfully monitor the accuracy of these agency decisions. We suggest that confidence judgments about agency should be considered as the metacognitive level of an agency processing hierarchy, with agency judgments as explicit first-order judgments. This also brings agency in line with recent motor metacognition research that considers agency-like judgments such as decisions of which trajectory was caused by one’s movement to be the first-order motor judgments, followed by metacognitive confidence ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbuzova et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although we suggest that JoAs do not imply metacognitive uncertainty monitoring, the dependence of agency ratings on the noise condition should not be overlooked and may be highly relevant both for future experimental design and in the interpretation of explicit agency reports. This finding is in line with multifactorial accounts of JoAs as involving a variety of both internal and external cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>), and with the expanding empirical work investigating a range of contextual effects on agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minohara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wen, 2019</xref>). Our work also fits within cue integration theories of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore and Fletcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Synofzik et al., 2013</xref>), with the delay information being weighted less heavily when the signal is made less precise. Further, these results are relevant to empirical work examining cue integration in agency, as they suggest that having a perceivable manipulation such as reduced visibility in order to add noise to feedback cues may itself act as an additional factor influencing agency judgments, which should be accounted for in design and analysis.</p><p>These findings also complement recent work that has aimed to find computational models of agency, but has focussed on low-level FoA and implicit measures such as temporal binding effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legaspi and Toyoizumi, 2019</xref>). Here, we bring explicit agency judgments into a Bayesian and SDT framework, implementing formal computational models that could be used to further assess computations underlying different JoAs. Our findings support the suggestions of previous work that, while Bayesian confidence computations may underlie pre-reflective FoA, explicit JoAs reflect a different computational mechanism, and factor in different contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legaspi and Toyoizumi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wen, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Taken into the context of two-step models of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Synofzik et al., 2008</xref>), our results suggest that sensory noise information may influence lower level, perceptual agency signals by making them more variable, and that these more variable signals then feed into higher level JoAs, but that estimates of the noise do not contribute as an additional cue to inform the JoAs. Hence, higher order agency states remain naive with regard to how noisy the lower level signals are. This could illuminate agency processing deficits in clinical cases which might involve perceptual agency cues becoming very noisy due to low level processing deficits. If explicit JoAs do not consider this uncertainty (as our findings indicate), this could lead to extreme agency reports despite unreliable evidence and inaccurate agency inferences. This is in line with work on agency misattributions in schizophrenia suggesting that they may be due to particularly noisy low level agency information, possibly due to dysregulated neurotransmitter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corlett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fletcher and Frith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore and Fletcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>By combining an agency rating task with an agency discrimination and confidence task, we were able to consider JoAs against the benchmark of metacognitive confidence judgments, while keeping the basic stimuli and noise manipulations the same in both cases. However, the tasks still differed on the nature of the ratings: Ratings in the agency task were about the feeling of agency over a single movement, whereas ratings in the confidence task were about the accuracy of the decision in the 2IFC task. Importantly, we note that the findings that we describe here do not rely on a comparison between tasks. The confidence task merely served as a positive control task to ensure that our noise manipulation had the expected effect on a metacognitive judgment and that the second-order model we built best predicted the results of computations we knew to be higher-order.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our conclusions about the computations underlying the JoAs are limited by the manipulations used in the task. First, we manipulated noise externally, not directly internally, and only added noise to the perceived delay signals, rather than motor or somatosensory cues. We additionally did not manipulate action selection noise, which has been shown to influence agency independently of the comparator signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wenke et al., 2010</xref>). More research will be necessary to understand whether our conclusions also apply to these other sources of noise in agency processing.</p><p>Further, our conclusions hold for the agency manipulation we used, namely altering the timing of the action outcome. But, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other kinds of agency manipulations. This approach is prevalent in the literature, so our findings are directly applicable to agency as it is commonly measured in experimental situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blakemore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farrer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stern et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wen et al., 2015b</xref>). More conceptually, the efficacy of delay manipulations has been argued to be valid for the study of more proximal agency over the body, and in external agency cases in which the timing of the outcome is well-established with precise expectations, but has been called into question as a device to truly affect sense of agency over the effects of our actions on the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wen, 2019</xref>). Our virtual hand manipulation allows us to get close to this proximal body agency while still using a delay manipulation, and, even if viewed as an external outcome, the timing of the virtual hand movement is tightly linked to our precise expectations about the timing of our own movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krugwasser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stern et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stern et al., 2021</xref>). Previous work using this virtual hand agency paradigm has also validated the approach of introducing delay in the visual feedback against other measures of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krugwasser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stern et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our results should also be considered in the context of the particular agency rating scale we used, as this will constrain participants’ rating behavior. Similar agency scales are commonly used in agency research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dewey and Knoblich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Imaizumi and Tanno, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kawabe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Metcalfe and Greene, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miele et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sato and Yasuda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stern et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Voss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wen et al., 2015a</xref>), so the results presented here are relevant to understand the computations of agency ratings discussed in the existing literature. Thus, our results suggest that the JoAs measured in the literature do not indicate metacognitive computations. On the basis of these results, we concur with recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) that suggests that a 2IFC task on agency followed by a confidence judgment may be more adequate to measure a metacognitive component of agency processing. Future work could apply a similar modeling approach in order to understand whether other types of agency judgments, for example ones explicitly discriminating between self and other agents, show the same first-order behavior. Future work could also further investigate another simplifying assumption made here in our models, namely that trials in which, due to internal noise, participants experienced a negative delay, would be associated with strong evidence for agency. While this is a reasonable assumption in our task, where participants knew that the virtual hand tracked their hand movement and likely dismissed the possibility that the virtual hand moved prior to them, it may need to be adapted to fit other, more ecologically valid cases of agency processing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here, we investigated whether the role of uncertainty in explicit JoAs is computationally metacognitive. The results suggest that JoAs can be influenced by sensory noise, but that this effect is best considered as a contextual cue that can impact participants’ use of the rating scale (at least when detectable in the environment), rather than as the result of a second-order noise monitoring computation. We therefore suggest that JoAs best reflect first-order comparator signals, with the metacognitive level of agency processing being second-order confidence judgments about one’s agency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The experiment was pre-registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://osf.io/pyjhm">osf.io/pyjhm</ext-link>), and we describe deviations from the pre-registered plan.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We pre-registered a sample size of 32 participants (based on power estimates from similar tasks).

This allowed us to compare the effect of noise on JoAs and confidence. Importantly, we manipulated sensory noise orthogonally to the decision variable, as done by previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bang and Fleming, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Gardelle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spence et al., 2016</xref>), which allowed us to precisely examine effects of noise without altering the true degree of control that the participants had over the virtual hand movement.</p><p>Prior to starting the experiment, participants completed the Edinburgh handedness scale. We then did a short thresholding procedure to set the illumination level that would be used in the high-noise condition of the main tasks. The baseline illumination levels were set in the Unity environment with a directional light intensity of 0 in the high-noise condition and 0.001 in the low-noise condition, but the brightness of the screen was then further thresholded in order to account for differences in eyesight and lighting conditions in the room. Participants placed their right hand on the table, under the LEAP tracker, and held it still. On each trial, participants first saw a fixation cross, followed by two consecutive presentations (separated by a flashed gray screen) of the virtual hand on the screen in the dark illumination condition, and in one case, it was artificially enlarged. Participants then discriminated which of the two intervals contained the larger hand. We ran this in blocks of 10 trials. If participants responded less than 70%, or more than 80% correctly in a block, or if they reported discomfort from straining to see the hand, we manually adjusted the brightness setting of the computer display. This rough thresholding procedure took approximately 5 min. The brightness was, however, further adjusted if participants reported not being able to see the virtual hand movement during the training or at the beginning of the task. The brightness was only re-adjusted prior to the confidence task for one participant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Agency-rating task</title><p>All participants performed the agency-rating task first so that subjective ratings would not be biased by the structure or ratings of the confidence task. Because the two tasks employed a very similar rating scale, we wanted to make sure that agency ratings corresponded to how they are collected in the literature and not that, for example, participants interpreted the agency scale as the confidence scale. This was important, as our main research question examined the computations underlying ratings in this task, whereas our confidence task served as a positive control for a known metacognitive judgment. On each trial, participants began with their right hand resting on the table, palm facing up, with fingers extended. They saw a fixation cross (for 1.5 s), then the virtual hand appeared and they had 2 s in which to flex and extend their index finger once. The virtual hand displayed their movement either in real time, or with an added delay of either 70, 100, or 200 ms. Participants then rated their agency over the virtual hand movement on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest). We explained that the term ‘agency’ referred to how much control they had over the movement of the virtual hand, and they were asked to focus specifically on the timing of the movement. Agency ratings were made using arrow keys to move a cursor, which started at a random position on the six-point scale each trial. Additionally, error trials in which there was a glitch of the virtual hand (such as flipping or contorting), participants saw no virtual hand, or participants made the wrong hand movement, could be marked using the Space key. Overall, 2.4% of trials were marked as errors in the confidence task, and 1.9% were marked as errors in the agency rating task.</p><p>To achieve the high-noise condition, the virtual hand was displayed under dark, low-contrast illumination, using a directional light intensity of 0 in the Unity environment. In the low-noise condition, the virtual hand was displayed under brighter, higher contrast illumination using a directional light intensity of 0.001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The noise conditions as well as the four delay levels were counterbalanced and randomly distributed across each block. There were 60 trials per delay level and lighting condition, for a total of 480 trials, split across six blocks. Prior to this task, participants completed a short training consisting of 20 trials and including both noise conditions and all delays, but they never received any feedback regarding any task. The agency-rating task took approximately 45 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Confidence-rating task</title><p>After the agency-rating task, participants did a confidence-rating task. Participants again flexed and extended their right index finger under the LEAP motion tracker, while looking at the virtual hand on the screen. In contrast to the agency-rating task, they made two consecutive movements, each cued by the appearance of the virtual hand, and separated with a blank gray screen. They then decided which virtual hand movement they had more agency over, and rated their confidence in their response from 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest). The difference in delay levels between the movements in each trial was staircased, with one of the two movements always having no delay and the other being adjusted according to an online 2-down-1-up staircasing procedure aiming to achieve an overall accuracy of approximately 71%. Only the low-noise condition was staircased, and the delays of the high-noise condition were set to match those of the low-noise. Participants made their decision and then confidence rating using the arrow keys, and an error trial could be marked during either the decision or confidence rating.</p><p>We manipulated noise in the same way as in the agency-rating task, and this was fully counterbalanced with which movement was the delayed one, with these factors randomly distributed across each block. The noise condition was always the same for both consecutive movements within a trial, so in this task, the sensory noise in the environment led to an internal comparison of the two noisy delay signals, and confidence was modeled as monitoring the noise of this discrimination. There were 100 trials per noise condition, for a total of 200 trials across five blocks. Prior to this task, participants completed another short training consisting of 10 trials, but only in the low-noise condition, to adjust to the new movement and response structure. The confidence task took approximately 45 min. At the end of the session, participants completed an informal debriefing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis</title><p>We removed any trials marked as errors, and any trials with reaction times shorter than 100ms or longer than 8 s for any decision or rating.</p><p>We tested our main hypotheses using the ‘lme4’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>) to build linear mixed-effects models. All models included by-participant random intercepts, and the model for the agency-rating task included random effects for the interaction of interest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). All hypotheses were tested using two-tailed tests and an alpha level of 0.05, and additionally using Bayes factors, which we computed with the ‘BayesTestR’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Makowski et al., 2019</xref>) using default priors. To compute Bayes factors for the logistic mixed-effects analyses, we built Bayesian models with the ‘brms’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bürkner, 2017</xref>). For each of these Bayesian regressions, we ran 4 chains of 15,000 iterations, including 5000 burn-in samples for a total of 40,000 effective samples, and ensuring a R-hat close to 1. Effect sizes for results of the linear mixed-effects analyses were computed as η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> using the ‘effectsize’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Shachar et al., 2020</xref>), with 95% confidence intervals reported when possible (large sample sizes resulted in some confidence intervals of width zero, and hence uninterpretable). The results of our linear mixed-effects analyses on confidence and JoAs were confirmed using ordinal models, built using the ‘ordinal’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To analyse metacognitive ability from the confidence task, we measured metacognitive efficiency (M-Ratio) using the HMeta-d′ toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fleming, 2017</xref>). In this analysis, for the MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo method) procedure we used three chains of 15,000 iterations with an additional 5000 for adaptation, thinning of 3, and default initial values from JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler). We also ensured that R-hat was approximately one for all sampling.</p><p>As a deviation from the pre-registered analyses, we included our second test-criterion and computational modeling analyses, and excluded instead some planned analysis of the variability of ratings, as, in hindsight, we reasoned that this would not help to clarify the link between agency and metacognition. To perform the Bayesian model selection and get the PEPs, we used the ‘bmsR’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lisi, 2021</xref>), computing model evidence using Akaike weights from the MLE analysis and using 10<sup>6</sup> samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Modeling</title><p>To test whether JoAs reflect metacognitive computations, we compared two computational models which could both account for the observed effect of noise on agency ratings. Both are based on signal detection theory and a comparator model of agency, with the amount of delay between the real movement and virtual hand movement as the signal. However, under one model (the Second-order model) agency ratings involve a second-order assessment of sensory noise in the same way that confidence judgments do; whereas under the other model (the First-order model), agency is based on only first-order estimates of the internal signal strength. Under the First-order model, the observed behavioral effect of noise results from participants scaling their ratings independently for each condition, without the need for metacognitive estimates of the noise level.</p><p>Under both models, JoAs result from a Yes/No decision of whether participants felt agency over the virtual hand movement, and this is scaled into a rating according to a function of the strength of the evidence. Modeling JoAs as involving this binary detection decision allowed us to examine whether agency ratings follow the computations involved in decision confidence, and is also in line with work treating agency as a binary judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukushima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spaniel et al., 2016</xref>). We assume that participants set an internal decision criterion (c) which determines whether they detected a delay — thus judging a disruption in their agency —, or whether they detected no delay and therefore judged themselves to have agency over the virtual hand movement. Then, the different agency ratings are modeled as additional criteria on either side of (c). We model agency ratings as getting more extreme as the perceived signal (x) gets further from the decision criterion in either direction, or in other words, as evidence supporting the agency decision increases. This predicts that perceived delays that are very long relative to the decision criterion would lead to a ‘No’ decision with strong evidence, and in turn low JoAs, whereas perceived delays that are very short would lead to a ‘Yes’ decision with strong evidence, and high JoAs. Crucially, the two models differed in the function of internal evidence (<italic>f</italic>(x)) that determined the agency ratings, and in particular in the way this function was affected by sensory noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Agency ratings in the Second-order model</title><p>The Second-order model assumed that agency ratings scale as a function of internal evidence in the same way as confidence, namely scaling with the posterior probability of being correct, given a choice and the internal signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanders et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, in this model, the agency rating is computed by estimating the probability that the agency detection was correct, given the perceived signal and detection decision. Because this probability computation depends on the level of sensory noise, the Second-order model predicts that noise will be factored into participants’ JoAs.</p><p>In both models, we obtained the criterion values that split the continuous range of possible <italic>f</italic>(x) values into equidistant bins. For the Second-order model, because confidence reflects a probability, it is naturally bounded to 1. So for the Second-order model (with a 3:3 mapping, see below) this amounted to finding the criterion values that would lead to confidence levels of ⅓, ⅔, and 1. To estimate the positions of the criteria on the internal signal axis, we followed an analytical solution that defines confidence as<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Φ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="2em"/><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo fence="true" stretchy="true" symmetric="true"/></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Φ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="2em"/><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo fence="true" stretchy="true" symmetric="true"/></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>which we implemented, for convenience, as in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Navajas et al., 2017</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>Φ</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="|" open="|" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This confidence measure can be interpreted as the perceived probability that the true delay signal was on the same side of the decision criterion as the internal signal, hence making the decision correct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Function of internal evidence as estimated by each of the models tested.</title><p>Agency as a function of evidence strength computations in each model.

According to this model, participants do not use the full distribution of internal signals in their assessment and hence do not make any metacognitive assessment of the precision of their evidence, but rather provide a rating that varies linearly as a function of the internal evidence, according to<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mfenced close="|" open="|" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Unlike the Second-order model, ratings in this linear model are not inherently bounded at 1, as <italic>f</italic>(x) could be as high as any arbitrarily high internal signal (x). Therefore, in order to find criterion placements that divide the continuous range of <italic>f</italic>(x) values into equidistant bins, we needed to approximate a maximum. We assumed that participants bound their ratings based on the range of delays they experience throughout the experiment. Because we cannot know the true range of perceived delays, we approximated the most extreme perceived delays as the most extreme external signals plus a multiple of the noise, the freely fit <italic>scale range</italic> parameter (s). Based on the idea that participants rescaled their agency criteria according to the noise condition that they observed, accounting for the observed behavioral interaction effect, (s) acted as a multiple of the noise within a given condition. Hence, the scale range on low-noise trials would be from -sσ<sub>L</sub> to [200+ sσ<sub>L</sub>] but the scale range on high-noise trials would be from -sσ<sub>H</sub> to [200+ sσ<sub>H</sub>]. However, critically, this noise parameter is not part of the internal JoA computation that we propose takes place in the brain, which does not involve estimates of the noise at all. It is only used by us, as experimenters, to guide an approximation of the range of perceived delays across the experiment, which we do not have external access to. Fitting this parameter allowed us to obtain the maximum <italic>f</italic>(x) value as the maximum distance between (c) and either bound of the scale, and then divide the continuous <italic>f</italic>(x) values into equidistant bins just as we did with the Second-order model. However, due to the different <italic>f</italic>(x) computations, in this case the bins were equal linear distances on the internal signal axis, not equal probability bins as in the Second-order model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, although the agency ratings do depend on the noise level due to the rescaling in this model, this does not involve participants making an assessment of the precision of their evidence, but just reflects participants considering each trial relative to a maximum that is different between illumination conditions. In other words, it would require less extreme evidence to lead to a ‘1’ in the low-noise condition than a ‘1’ in the high-noise condition.</p><p>Once we found criterion locations for each noise condition for each model, we calculated the probability of each rating for any given alteration and noise level.

We fit this parameter, NRYes, defined as the number of ratings used for ‘Yes’ decisions, with a minimum of one rating used for each decision. If NRYes is two, for example, this would suggest participants used ratings of ‘5’ and ‘6’ to indicate detections of agency, and ratings of ‘1’ to ’4’ to indicate disturbances to their agency.

Specifically, if the noise manipulation that we used had the intended effect of making internal representations noisier, we expected accuracy in the high-noise condition to be lower than in the low-noise condition of the confidence task. However, we also ran the agency rating task analyses on the full dataset, without removing participants, and this had no significant impact on our conclusions. We ran the LME model on JoAs including the interaction between noise level and delay, and allowing for random effects per participant of the interaction, and random intercepts, without excluding any participants.

We did this by computing metacognitive efficiency (M-Ratio), which accounts for differences in first-order task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maniscalco and Lau, 2012</xref>), using the HMeta-d′ toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fleming, 2017</xref>) for all participants.

Importantly, we did not aim to compare metacognitive ability between conditions, but instead only confirmed that participants showed above-chance metacognitive performance in both conditions, suggesting in turn that confidence ratings were meaningful.

We built a mixed logistic regression model on Response Accuracy including Confidence and Noise as well as their interaction as fixed effects, and random Confidence slopes and random intercepts per participant (see below for model syntax). Metacognitive performance was estimated by considering the effect of confidence as a measure of how well confidence ratings tracked accuracy. We found a significant main effect of Confidence (χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 45.75, p &lt; 0.001, BF<sub>10</sub> = 1.24 ✕ 10<sup>9</sup>), which confirmed that participants’ confidence ratings tracked their accuracy and were hence meaningful, despite the difficult task.

We took the winning parameters for each model for each participant and simulated 20 datasets with each parameter set. This generated 800 simulated datasets per model, covering all of the relevant parameters of our real participants. We then fit both models to those 1,600 simulated datasets and performed BIC comparisons as we did in our real data. We required a minimum BIC difference of 2 for one model to be considered a better fit, just as we did in our main modeling analyses. This revealed the Second-order model to be the better fitting model for 776 out of 800 of the datasets simulated with the Second-order model, suggesting it to be correctly recovered 97.00% of the time overall. Similarly, the First-order model was the better fitting model for 799 out of 800 of the datasets simulated with the First-order model, being correctly recovered 99.88% of the time overall. The mean BIC difference from models fit to 20 repetitions of each participant’s relevant parameter set for each model are shown in the figure below. The mean ΔBIC (from the 20 repetitions) was above the minimum cutoff of 2, favoring the correct model, for all participants’ parameter settings, for both models.

Because we aimed to compare JoAs and confidence ratings in terms of their underlying computations, our main modeling analysis fit the two models to confidence ratings without using any of the additional information available, and subjecting the analysis to the same assumptions as with agency ratings. This involved freely fitting the noise levels, and assuming optimal decision criteria, as we did in the agency task. Here, we repeated the group-level analysis using the calculated decision criterion and noise difference.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Valentin Wyart as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Valerian Chambon (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see below, all reviewers agree that the general approach you developed for your study of judgments of agency – combining experimental tasks with explicit computational modeling – is a clear strength of your study. The finding that sensory noise is monitored differently for judgments of agency and confidence judgments is interesting, and novel. However, there are different issues – in particular conceptual ones regarding the definition of metacognition but also experimental ones regarding the relation between the two tasks (and their associated judgments) you have used in your work. The essential revisions below have been discussed among reviewers and should be addressed in a point-by-point response. The individual reviews are also provided below for your information (please check all revisions regarding typos and concerns regarding the presentation of the results), but they do not require point-by-point responses. This is based on your responses to the essential revisions that we will evaluate your revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A first conceptual issue concerns the definition of metacognition in the study. It appears currently quite loosely defined, which is a problem for a study which makes specific claims about the distinction between metacognition and the sense of agency. In the present version of the manuscript, a metacognitive process appears to mean &quot;being about first-order signals&quot;. But this loose definition is not satisfying when thinking about the rescaling model used to explain judgments of agency – which is seen as non-metacognitive. Indeed, this rescaling model still requires agents to track something about internal noise corrupting first-order signals, which would qualify it as metacognitive. A clear and unambiguous definition of metacognition should be provided upfront in the revised manuscript to avoid conceptual confusions.</p><p>For example, the authors argue their Bayesian model is a metacognitive one, because it requires the observer to have second-order access to an estimate of their own sensory noise. But even though the Bayesian model in this paper clearly incorporates an estimate of the noise/uncertainty in the signal, not all representations of noise are second-order or metacognitive. For example, Shea (2012) has noted that in precision-weighted Bayesian inference models throughout neuroscience (e.g., Bayesian cue combination, also discussed in this paper) the models contain noise estimates but the models are not metacognitive in nature. For example, when we combine a noisy visual estimate and a noisy auditory estimate, the Bayesian solution requires you account for the noise in the unimodal signals. But the precision parameters in these models do not necessarily refer to uncertainty in the agent's perceptions or beliefs, but uncertainty in the outside world. Similarly, in the Bayesian model proposed in this study, it is not clear why we should think of the uncertainty parameter as something metacognitive (e.g., about the agent's internal comparator representations) rather than something about the outside world (e.g., the sensory environment is noisy). This should be clarified and discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Shea (2012) Reward prediction error signals are meta-representational. Nous, DOI: 10.1111/j.1468-0068.2012.00863.x</p><p>2) The present manuscript suggests that judgments of agency are subject to only one source of internal noise, the comparator. While it is understandable, given that the task is not likely to be associated with significant action selection (motor) noise, it is possible that this design choice has penalized the hypothesis of metacognitive monitoring of uncertainty by judgments of agency. This would require having a task design that manipulates selection difficulty (and thus selection noise), to see whether judgments of agency are sensitive to selection noise – which would potentially make them metacognitive (since judgments of agency would reflect second-order measures of this selection noise). It is indeed well known that selection noise affects judgments of agency (see, e.g., Wenke et al., 2010), independently of any comparison between predicted and observed signals. While we are not requiring you to perform additional experiments, this prior work and the limitations of the current study along these lines should be explicitly discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Related to this issue, the validity of using an action-outcome delay task to generate broad conclusions about the nature of judgments of agency appears currently limited. In the task used in the study, the experience of agency depends <italic>only</italic> on interval detection, i.e., sensitivity to temporal contiguity. But while this is a popular approach in the field, the temporal contiguity actions and outcomes is only one of the cues that influence judgments of agency. Recent authors (e.g., Wen, 2020) have suggested that this manipulation may be problematic for a number of reasons. In similar types of paradigm, Wen (2020) notes that agents are able to accurately judge their control over action outcomes that are substantially delayed (e.g., well over 1000 ms) and thus it is possible that tasks manipulating action-outcome delays are biasing participants to report variance in the delays they experience rather than their actual experience about what they can and cannot control. Indeed, in the Methods section, the authors note participants were asked to &quot;focus specifically on the timing of the movement&quot; of the virtual hand, which may make this concern particularly salient. The judgment of agency made by participants can thus be reframed in this task as &quot;did I detect a delay?&quot;, which limits the generalizability of the findings to many other situations where judgments of agency are not restricted to delay detection.</p><p>In practice, these concerns require an explicit discussion in the manuscript. You should at least consider explicitly whether your findings indicate that <italic>sensorimotor delay judgements in particular</italic> (rather than judgments of agency in general) are non-metacognitive. This alternative, more focused interpretation of the findings, is by no means uninteresting, but it has a somewhat narrower theoretical significance for the key debate used to frame the study (&quot;do agency judgements monitor uncertainty in a metacognitive way?&quot;). Arguments against this alternative (more specific) account should be provided in the discussion to support the interpretation that you have chosen to put forward (that judgments of agency in general are non-metacognitive). It is important that the title and framing of the paper remains as close as possible to what the findings of the study are.</p><p>Wen (2020). Does delay in feedback diminish sense of agency? A Review. Consciousness and Cognition, DOI: 10.1016/j.concog.2019.05.007</p><p>3) The relationship between the confidence task and the judgment of agency task is not entirely clear. Indeed, the confidence task measures confidence about a discrimination based on judgments of agency, whereas the judgement of agency task is about directly inferring agency from one stimulus. Therefore, the confidence task reflects by design a higher-order judgement about judgements of agency and, in this task setting, the judgments of agency appear to be treated experimentally as first-order judgements. It is unclear whether this choice of task design has triggered in itself the difference in computations underlying confidence and judgments of agency, and whether alternative task settings could show similar computations for the two types of judgments. This does not disqualify the main finding of the study, which is about determining which kind of computations underlie judgments of agency, but it is very important to discuss specifically the relation between the two judgments in this particular task, and how this relation may have something to do with the obtained findings. Further experimental work could – in principle – quash these worries – e.g., by manipulating agency in a different way but demonstrating the same effects of noise on confidence but not agency judgements. We are not requesting you to carry out these additional experiments, but they should be set as critical next steps for addressing the limitations of the current study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I find the research question itself really interesting, but I wonder if the authors are arguing against a strawman (&quot;agency judgements are often assumed to be metacognitive&quot;). That agency judgements are assumed to be metacognitive is certainly true according to the references cited in the article (Metcalfe and Miele) but I am not sure that this is a widespread view in the field. To my knowledge, agency judgements are often described as high-level, post-hoc, reflexive or retrospective, but none of these qualifications imply that JoAs are metacognitive per se. More recent references suggesting that indeed JoAs are metacognitive might be needed here.</p><p>2. The discussion elaborates on what metacognition is (cognition about cognition, a process that involves 2nd order uncertainty monitoring computations, etc.) but I think a real definition of what a metacognitive process/representation/computation is would be needed in the introductory section, which lacks such a definition.</p><p>Is &quot;being about&quot; a first-order signal (whether that signal is perceptual, motor or memory-related) the minimum condition for something to be labelled &quot;metacognitive&quot;?</p><p>3. The task is a relatively simple motor task with little motor or premotor noise – in the sense that it does not specifically involve motor preparation or selecting a motor program from alternatives. This premotor/selection noise has been repeatedly shown (e.g. Wenke et al., 2010) to affect JoA, independent of any comparison between predicted and observed signals. Thus, according to this alternative hypothesis, the noise/uncertainty that feeds into participants' JoA does not come from a noisy comparator, as assumed in this paper, but comes directly from the action selection/preparation circuits – i.e. is due to competition between the selected and alternative action program and/or to blurred boundaries between alternative motor plans (e.g. Nachev 2005; Cisek, 2007)</p><p>For reasons of parsimony, which I can fully understand, the present study suggests that the JoA is subjected to only one source of internal noise, the comparator.</p><p>I wonder to what extent this choice penalizes the hypothesis of (metacognitive) monitoring of uncertainty by the JoA. Is it possible that participants' JoAs are more sensitive to internal selection noise than to comparator noise? This may require replicating the same task by manipulating the selection noise and measuring whether the agency reports reflect second-order measures of this selection noise. Note that I am not asking here for this experiment to be carried out, but perhaps the authors can comment on this.</p><p>4. A question of clarification: perhaps I missed something in the manuscript, but what is the internal noise that JoAs monitor? Logically, it should be the noise arising from the <italic>comparison</italic> between the first-order sensory signals (predicted and observed), a comparison that gives rise to the agentive experience itself. And if so, I am not sure I understand clearly what the source of the noise monitored by the confidence reports in the task is: is it the noise arising from the <italic>comparison</italic> between the two agentive experiences (which are themselves each the product of a noisy comparison between predicted and observed sensory signals)? Is it then reasonable to assume that this comparison, which gives rise to the confidence report, somehow inherits the noise from the <italic>first-order</italic> comparison that gives rise to the agentive experience?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I was a bit confused about the rationale behind the first criterion which JoA's have to meet in order to be considered metacognitve. It was unclear to me how the JoA's are hypothesized to be influenced by the sensory noise exactly, beyond just making them noisier? Is there a fundamental reason to expect agency ratings to increase or decrease in noisier conditions which we would expect a priori? Expecting 'an effect on agency ratings' sounds rather vague. The results show that the effect of the delay becomes smaller during high noise conditions, which makes a lot of conceptual sense. Maybe pre-empting this somehow before the results will make things a bit clearer?</p><p>The contrasting two models elegantly reflect different underlying psychological strategies and are very well designed and implemented. However, I feel like the explanations of the models in the main text are still relatively technical and potentially hard to understand for readers unfamiliar with these specific types of models. I think adding a few extra sentences per model explaining the models in more psychological terms would help (e.g. 'second-order access to estimate their own sensory noise' -&gt; add something like 'i.e. be able to reflect on how noisy their own sensory processing is' and 'rescaling depending on the noise condition' -&gt; 'e.g. give less extreme agency judgments under high noise conditions').</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In line with these comments above, I would suggest that the authors amend the manuscript to make it clear how detecting action-outcome delays relates to agency detection mechanisms in general – ideally with a persuasive rebuttal of the kinds of concern that Wen (2020) provides. Without a strong reason to believe that action-outcome delay detection is directly measuring the agency detection process (which Wen, 2020 etc. give us cause to doubt), the generality of these conclusions seems potentially limited, and the broadbrush conclusions currently offered might need to be moderated accordingly.</p><p>At the same time, I think the authors should also be explicit about what they mean by a 'metacognitive computation'. The real novelty of their approach seems to be getting into the nitty gritty of what different computational models would predict. But if the authors agree with me that models can have uncertainty parameters without being metacognitive, then more needs to be done to justify why the Bayesian model is a metacognitive one. Of course, the authors may disagree with me, but a strong rebuttal of this concern and an explanation for why uncertainty parameters entail metacognition would be an important addition to the paper.</p><p>I have a few other points the authors might consider useful and which might help orient a reader:</p><p>1. The authors discuss in places that their tasks bring agency judgements into a &quot;standard metacognition framework&quot;. But there are some important disanalogies. For example, in a perceptual metacognition task there is a clearly correct Type 1 answer (e.g., stimulus was present or absent) whereas the question posed in these tasks does here does not have an objectively correct answer. Regardless of the stimulus delay, the correct answer is always &quot;I was the agent&quot;, so really the task is looking at variance in Type 1 and Type 2 judgements which is separate from the ground truth (i.e., they are always the agent on every trial). This strikes me as an important difference from the standard metacognition framework as it is applied to perception or memory judgements, and may thus be worth flagging explicitly to a reader.</p><p>2. The Gaussian schematics of the models in Figure 2, Figure 3 etc. are a bit opaque without describing what the underlying variable is. Making it clear these show a probabilistic representation of sensorimotor delays would make these more intelligible.</p><p>3. The authors split the paper into 'confirmatory' and 'exploratory' analyses. I understand why, given their pre-registration, but my personal feeling was this disrupted the flow of the paper somewhat, since it means the reader sees the confidence task, then the agency task, then a model of the agency data, then a return to the confidence task. Grouping the sections by task (e.g., confidence task/ confidence model/ agency task/ agency model) might build up the authors conclusions more naturally since it establishes 'what is metacognition like?' before then asking 'is agency like that?'. Of course, this is just a thought, and doesn't change the substance of what is presented.</p><p>4. In Figures that show model predictions or simulated data (e.g., Figure 3) I think it could be helpful to show simulated/predicted data in the same format as the original data displays (e.g., matching the plots of how data is shown in Figure 2c). This would make it easier for the reader to compare qualitative differences between the simulated and real data, and between each of the models. (Admittedly, this is done in Figure 4, but the granularity of the presentation is hard to translate back up to the big picture patterns observed in the experiments).</p><p>5. In standard use 'noise' is something added to stimuli to make discriminations harder. Here the signal strength is actually reduced by dimming the virtual lights, rather than adding a noise mask etc. Labelling the conditions as something like 'Signal strength – High/Low' (reversed accordingly) might be more appropriate.</p><p>6. p.22 &quot;pre-reflexive FoA&quot;.

As we understand it, this comment raises four key questions: (1) what is our definition of metacognition, (2) how is our Bayesian model metacognitive, (3) how is our Rescaling model non-metacognitive, (4) does our Bayesian model involve the monitoring of truly internal signals.</p><p>1. What is our definition of metacognition?</p><p>We agree that clear definitions of metacognition and also agency are generally important and in the case of our manuscript, even more so. In the new version of the Introduction, we now mention explicitly that “…we commit to a definition of metacognition as a process that involves second-order uncertainty monitoring computations.”</p><p>We have also further clarified our definition of metacognition in the Introduction of the manuscript (pg. 3).</p><p>2. How is our Bayesian model metacognitive?</p><p>In line with the definition of metacognition that we commit to above, we completely agree with the reviewers that noise can have an influence that is not second-order. In fact, both of our models (Rescaling and Bayesian) include a role of noise in agency at the first-order level by adding variance to the delay signals, which we do not consider to be metacognitive. To call JoAs “metacognitive” we required them to exhibit evidence that they involve a second-order numerical estimate of the noise. The reviewers reference the work of Shea (2012). Thank you for pointing us towards this paper, it has helped us to further clarify how to best describe our models. In this, Shea gives a nice example of two contrasting roles of noise, one metacognitive and one not:</p><p>“Suppose I read 16°C on the slightly unreliable thermometer outside the window. If a friend then tells me it is 20°C outside, I will revise my estimate based on both sources of evidence, perhaps to an average of 18°C. If instead of telling me about the weather, she tells me about the thermometer—that it under-reads by 2°C—then I would also revise my estimate to 18°C. In the first case I am relying on my friend for some evidence she has about the world and forming a conclusion based on both sources of evidence. In the second case I am relying on her for some evidence about the accuracy of my first estimate, and revising that estimate accordingly.”</p><p>In the second case of this example, it is the second-order representation about the accuracy of the thermometer that makes it metacognitive. This mirrors the computation of our Bayesian model, assessing the perceived probability of being accurate in ones’ agency decision, and then scaling the JoA accordingly. However, we note that in Shea’s example the information about the thermometer focusses on bias rather than variance. Moving to the second point, our Bayesian model assumes that in forming JoAs, the brain takes the lower level agency signals, already impacted by noise, computes the perceived probability of the response being correct, and uses this to scale the agency rating. This use of the secondary representation of the precision of the agency signals is what fits it to our definition of a metacognitive process.</p><p>3. How is our Rescaling model non-metacognitive?</p><p>In contrast to the Bayesian model, the Rescaling model assumes that the brain takes the lower level agency signals, already impacted by noise, and just groups all the ‘light’ trials into six even bins and all the ‘dark’ trials into six even bins, in order to give ratings on the six-rating scale. This does not require any estimate of the accuracy or noise of the agency signals, but just relies on direct linear readouts of the perceived delays. The only reason a noise parameter factors into our implementation of the Rescaling model is to approximate the full range of perceived ‘light’ and ‘dark’ trials as experimenters, but the brain’s JoA computation proposed by this model requires no noise parameter.</p><p>4. Does our Bayesian model involve the monitoring of truly internal signals?</p><p>We argue that it is reasonable to assume that agency ratings result from the monitoring of noise in an internal signal for the following reasons:</p><p>First, building off a comparator model of agency, we assume that in our task agency signals are a result of the comparison between the external outcome feedback and the internal prediction representation, hence the agency signals first arise internally, at this comparison stage. While we realize that the noise is still being manipulated externally, our Bayesian agency model involves an assessment of the perceived probability of being correct based on the prediction error signal. So, the noise being monitored in the model is the noise at the stage of internal comparison to the prediction representation. Second, we used a noise manipulation that is orthogonal to the delay. With this design, the delay signal is itself not altered in the environment, with delay always being the same externally, but rather the mapping between the external delay signal and the internal representation is made noisier. We have clarified this point in the manuscript (pg. 5, 10 Figure 2 legend). Third, we followed the methods in other perceptual metacognitive literature that adds noise to the external environment in order to manipulate internal processing noise (Bang and Fleming, 2018; Gardelle and Mamassian, 2015; Spence et al., 2016). We have additionally added this external noise manipulation as a limitation, indicating that future work could investigate this research question using other ways of manipulating noise (pg. 23-24).</p><p>We have now renamed the models: We call the Bayesian model the Second-order model instead, to stress that the defining factor of this model is its second-order nature, and not its Bayesian computation. In contrast, we call the Rescaling model the First-order model. Additionally, we have clarified the distinction between the metacognitive Second-order model and non-metacognitive First-order model in both the model descriptions (pg. 34-35), Introduction (pg. 3) and Results (pg. 13-14). Note that we will continue to refer to the models by their original names in this response letter, but have changed them in the manuscript.</p><p>In short, this comment raised four important and connected questions. Briefly summarized, we answered these by arguing that (1) metacognition involves second-order noise monitoring, (2) the Bayesian – now called Second-order – model is metacognitive not by virtue of involving Bayesian computations but by virtue of relying on second-order estimates of the variance of first-order signals; whereas (3) the Rescaling now called First-order – model does not rely on these noise estimates. Finally, we argue that (4) the noise monitored in the Bayesian model is of the internal signal because agency judgments are made on an internal signal that depends on the internal prediction representations.</p><p>Bang, D., and Fleming, S.

It is important that the title and framing of the paper remains as close as possible to what the findings of the study are.</p><p>Wen (2020). Does delay in feedback diminish sense of agency? A Review. Consciousness and Cognition, DOI: 10.1016/j.concog.2019.05.007</p></disp-quote><p>This concern, regarding the generalizability of our findings to cases beyond delay manipulations, is certainly important. Part of our rationale for using an action-outcome delay task was its prevalent use in the field (Blakemore et al., 1999; Faivre et al., 2020; Farrer et al., 2013; Kalckert and Ehrsson, 2012; Krugwasser et al., 2019, 2021; Stern et al., 2020, 2021; Wen et al., 2015b). We are focussed on understanding whether JoAs, particularly as they are measured in the literature, involve metacognitive processing like they have been suggested to. Because of the dominance of this agency manipulation, we argue that our research question is central and applicable to a wide range of agency work.</p><p>With regard to whether we can generalize conclusions to judgments of agency more broadly, we understand and agree with the concerns raised by Wen (2019). However, there are some additional arguments that Wen makes that support the idea that our task effectively manipulates agency. First, it is suggested that delay is indeed an effective manipulation for disrupting agency over one's own body. With our use of the LEAP Motion Controller and virtual hand, and with the participants’ real hand obscured from view, our paradigm brought the action-outcome delay task into the realm of body agency. Though the virtual hand movement is still in the external world, this is similar to tasks such as those with video feedback of a rubber hand, discussed in this section of Wen’s review. Other work using the same LEAP paradigm as ours has also found clear correlations between different agency measures, including between this delay manipulation and spatial and anatomical alterations (Krugwasser et al., 2019; Stern et al., 2020). Further, even within situations of agency over the environment, Wen points out that delay will be more effective in cases with well-established and immediate expected outcomes, such as when turning on a light in contrast to pressing a button for an elevator. The timing of the virtual hand movement in our task is well-established and would involve a very narrow window of flexibility, hence we argue that delay should be effective at disrupting the feeling of agency.</p><p>We have added a discussion of this issue in the limitations section of the manuscript (pg. 24).</p><p>Blakemore, S.

Indeed, the confidence task measures confidence about a discrimination based on judgments of agency, whereas the judgement of agency task is about directly inferring agency from one stimulus. Therefore, the confidence task reflects by design a higher-order judgement about judgements of agency and, in this task setting, the judgments of agency appear to be treated experimentally as first-order judgements. It is unclear whether this choice of task design has triggered in itself the difference in computations underlying confidence and judgments of agency, and whether alternative task settings could show similar computations for the two types of judgments. This does not disqualify the main finding of the study, which is about determining which kind of computations underlie judgments of agency, but it is very important to discuss specifically the relation between the two judgments in this particular task, and how this relation may have something to do with the obtained findings. Further experimental work could – in principle – quash these worries – e.g., by manipulating agency in a different way but demonstrating the same effects of noise on confidence but not agency judgements. We are not requesting you to carry out these additional experiments, but they should be set as critical next steps for addressing the limitations of the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>The confidence task was indeed higher-order by design. This was intentional: we designed a task that would serve as a positive control for a metacognitive judgment. With this task, we made sure that the Bayesian model we built best predicted the results of computations we knew to be higher-order.</p><p>Importantly, the nature of the metacognitive control task does not affect our conclusions about the computations underlying agency judgements. These are purely based on the agency task alone, not on the comparison of the two tasks.</p><p>We have clarified this in the following sentences of the manuscript (pg. 23):</p><p>“However, the tasks still differed on the nature of the ratings: Ratings in the agency task were about the feeling of agency over a single movement, whereas ratings in the confidence task were about the accuracy of the decision in the 2IFC task. Importantly, we note that the findings that we describe here do not rely on a comparison between tasks. The confidence task merely served as a positive control task to ensure that our noise manipulation had the expected effect on a metacognitive judgment and that the second-order model we built best predicted the results of computations we knew to be higher-order.”</p><p>Separately, this point raises the concern that a different agency task structure might itself influence results. In other words, had we designed a different agency task, the conclusion that JoAs are not metacognitive may have been different. We agree with this possibility and include it as a limitation (pg. 24-25). However, our aim was to examine whether the types of agency judgments that are collected in the field involve metacognitive computations, as they are sometimes assumed to. For this reason, we chose to examine a form of agency judgment readily used in empirical work (Dewey and Knoblich, 2014; Imaizumi and Tanno, 2019; Kawabe et al., 2013; Metcalfe and Greene, 2007; Miele et al., 2011; Sato and Yasuda, 2005; Stern et al., 2020; Voss et al., 2017; Wen et al., 2015a). We agree that, when forced into certain higher-order task structures, metacognitive monitoring of agency signals does occur. In fact, this is demonstrated by our confidence task, in which we show participants’ ability to make metacognitive judgments about their agency decisions. This does not impact our conclusion that agency judgments in themselves, as they are often collected in the field, do not inherently include metacognitive processing. Future work could continue to examine this question using other agency tasks, which we now expand on as a prospective direction (pg. 25).</p><p>Dewey, J. A., and Knoblich, G. (2014).

I find the research question itself really interesting, but I wonder if the authors are arguing against a strawman (&quot;agency judgements are often assumed to be metacognitive&quot;). That agency judgements are assumed to be metacognitive is certainly true according to the references cited in the article (Metcalfe and Miele) but I am not sure that this is a widespread view in the field. To my knowledge, agency judgements are often described as high-level, post-hoc, reflexive or retrospective, but none of these qualifications imply that JoAs are metacognitive per se. More recent references suggesting that indeed JoAs are metacognitive might be needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the encouraging feedback about our research question. We have now reframed the motivation behind our study (pg. 2-3). We hope that this framing maintains the justification for the research question of whether agency judgments are metacognitive without needing to motivate it purely based on this assumption in the literature. In addition, we have added more recent references to support that this assumption is still present in agency work (pg. 3).</p><p>With our new framing we highlight that, while previous studies have examined the role of uncertainty in lower level FoAs, it remains unclear how JoAs monitor uncertainty. We examine the two main possibilities for how this might occur: JoAs might simply adopt the influence of noise that already took place in lower level agency signals, or there might be secondary noise monitoring that occurs. We consider the second option to be metacognitive processing, and we clarify the reasoning for this (pg. 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The discussion elaborates on what metacognition is (cognition about cognition, a process that involves 2nd order uncertainty monitoring computations, etc.) but I think a real definition of what a metacognitive process/representation/computation is would be needed in the introductory section, which lacks such a definition.</p><p>Is &quot;being about&quot; a first-order signal (whether that signal is perceptual, motor or memory-related) the minimum condition for something to be labelled &quot;metacognitive&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed in response to the Essential Revisions (1) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The task is a relatively simple motor task with little motor or premotor noise – in the sense that it does not specifically involve motor preparation or selecting a motor program from alternatives. This premotor/selection noise has been repeatedly shown (e.g. Wenke et al., 2010) to affect JoA, independent of any comparison between predicted and observed signals. Thus, according to this alternative hypothesis, the noise/uncertainty that feeds into participants' JoA does not come from a noisy comparator, as assumed in this paper, but comes directly from the action selection/preparation circuits – i.e. is due to competition between the selected and alternative action program and/or to blurred boundaries between alternative motor plans (e.g. Nachev 2005; Cisek, 2007)</p><p>For reasons of parsimony, which I can fully understand, the present study suggests that the JoA is subjected to only one source of internal noise, the comparator.</p><p>I wonder to what extent this choice penalizes the hypothesis of (metacognitive) monitoring of uncertainty by the JoA. Is it possible that participants' JoAs are more sensitive to internal selection noise than to comparator noise? This may require replicating the same task by manipulating the selection noise and measuring whether the agency reports reflect second-order measures of this selection noise. Note that I am not asking here for this experiment to be carried out, but perhaps the authors can comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed in response to the Essential Revisions (2) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. A question of clarification: perhaps I missed something in the manuscript, but what is the internal noise that JoAs monitor? Logically, it should be the noise arising from the comparison between the first-order sensory signals (predicted and observed), a comparison that gives rise to the agentive experience itself. And if so, I am not sure I understand clearly what the source of the noise monitored by the confidence reports in the task is: is it the noise arising from the comparison between the two agentive experiences (which are themselves each the product of a noisy comparison between predicted and observed sensory signals)? Is it then reasonable to assume that this comparison, which gives rise to the confidence report, somehow inherits the noise from the first-order comparison that gives rise to the agentive experience?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a correct interpretation, we ask whether JoAs monitor internal noise arising from the comparison between the prediction and observed outcome. Then in the confidence task, we test whether confidence involves a monitoring of the noise of the comparison between these two comparator signals. This is in line with the assumptions of detection and discrimination confidence tasks, in which the former involve monitoring the noise of a single sensory stimulus, and the latter involves monitoring the noise of a comparison between two sensory stimuli. In the tasks used here, this lower level “sensory signal” is the comparator signal, which we capture as a prediction error signal. We have clarified this in the legend of Figure 2 and in the following sentence (Methods, page 30): “The noise condition was always the same for both consecutive movements within a trial, so in this task, the sensory noise in the environment led to an internal comparison of the two noisy delay signals, and confidence was modeled as monitoring the noise of this discrimination.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I was a bit confused about the rationale behind the first criterion which JoA's have to meet in order to be considered metacognitve. It was unclear to me how the JoA's are hypothesized to be influenced by the sensory noise exactly, beyond just making them noisier? Is there a fundamental reason to expect agency ratings to increase or decrease in noisier conditions which we would expect a priori? Expecting 'an effect on agency ratings' sounds rather vague. The results show that the effect of the delay becomes smaller during high noise conditions, which makes a lot of conceptual sense. Maybe pre-empting this somehow before the results will make things a bit clearer?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified (Results, pg. 11) how precisely we would expect the sensory noise to influence JoAs behaviourally, beyond just making them noisier, and why we predict this a priori. We also appreciate the suggestion to pre-empt the result of high noise decreasing the effect of delay and have included this (Introduction, pg. 4): “We expected the effect of the delay to become smaller in high perceptual uncertainty trials, leading JoAs to be less extreme, as compared to trials with lower uncertainty.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The contrasting two models elegantly reflect different underlying psychological strategies and are very well designed and implemented. However, I feel like the explanations of the models in the main text are still relatively technical and potentially hard to understand for readers unfamiliar with these specific types of models. I think adding a few extra sentences per model explaining the models in more psychological terms would help (e.g. 'second-order access to estimate their own sensory noise' -&gt; add something like 'i.e. be able to reflect on how noisy their own sensory processing is' and 'rescaling depending on the noise condition' -&gt; 'e.g. give less extreme agency judgments under high noise conditions').</p></disp-quote><p>We first thank the reviewer for the encouraging feedback about our modeling approach, and also for this good suggestion. We have now included more intuitive descriptions of the computations that each model includes (pg. 13-14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In line with these comments above, I would suggest that the authors amend the manuscript to make it clear how detecting action-outcome delays relates to agency detection mechanisms in general – ideally with a persuasive rebuttal of the kinds of concern that Wen (2020) provides. Without a strong reason to believe that action-outcome delay detection is directly measuring the agency detection process (which Wen, 2020 etc. give us cause to doubt), the generality of these conclusions seems potentially limited, and the broadbrush conclusions currently offered might need to be moderated accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing us to the important issues discussed in the paper by Wen (2019). This has been addressed in response to the Essential Revisions (2) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At the same time, I think the authors should also be explicit about what they mean by a 'metacognitive computation'. The real novelty of their approach seems to be getting into the nitty gritty of what different computational models would predict. But if the authors agree with me that models can have uncertainty parameters without being metacognitive, then more needs to be done to justify why the Bayesian model is a metacognitive one. Of course, the authors may disagree with me, but a strong rebuttal of this concern and an explanation for why uncertainty parameters entail metacognition would be an important addition to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree that models can have uncertainty parameters without entailing metacognition, and we have clarified and addressed this in response to the Essential Revisions (1) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have a few other points the authors might consider useful and which might help orient a reader:</p><p>1. The authors discuss in places that their tasks bring agency judgements into a &quot;standard metacognition framework&quot;. But there are some important disanalogies. For example, in a perceptual metacognition task there is a clearly correct Type 1 answer (e.g., stimulus was present or absent) whereas the question posed in these tasks does here does not have an objectively correct answer. Regardless of the stimulus delay, the correct answer is always &quot;I was the agent&quot;, so really the task is looking at variance in Type 1 and Type 2 judgements which is separate from the ground truth (i.e., they are always the agent on every trial). This strikes me as an important difference from the standard metacognition framework as it is applied to perception or memory judgements, and may thus be worth flagging explicitly to a reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer that the confidence task is not analogous to a standard metacognitive task.</p><p>Here, we assume that each of the two intervals (or movements) in the 2IFC task lead to participants experiencing two different levels of control. This assumption is rooted in the literature on agency, where introducing a delay between the expected and observed effects of an action leads to decreased agency (Blakemore et al., 1999; Faivre et al., 2020; Farrer et al., 2013; Kalckert and Ehrsson, 2012; Krugwasser et al., 2019, 2021; Stern et al., 2020, 2021; Wen et al., 2015b). Therefore, there is in fact an objectively correct answer in the discrimination task: It is reasonable to assume that participants experienced more control over the movement presented in the interval with the shortest delay. In fact, this was one of the motivating factors behind using a 2IFC task instead of a detection task, in which participants would instead be asked if they were the agent. However, we agree that an interesting future direction would be to examine this in different agency tasks, for example one in which participants are asked to discriminate between two actions, one caused by them and one by a different agent. While less well-controlled, this paradigm might get closer to the experience of loss of agency. We now mention this in the limitations section of the manuscript.</p><p>Blakemore, S. J., Frith, C.

The authors split the paper into 'confirmatory' and 'exploratory' analyses. I understand why, given their pre-registration, but my personal feeling was this disrupted the flow of the paper somewhat, since it means the reader sees the confidence task, then the agency task, then a model of the agency data, then a return to the confidence task. Grouping the sections by task (e.g., confidence task/ confidence model/ agency task/ agency model) might build up the authors conclusions more naturally since it establishes 'what is metacognition like?' before then asking 'is agency like that?'. Of course, this is just a thought, and doesn't change the substance of what is presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it might be intuitive to group the analyses by task. However, the logic of our analyses progresses from the behavioural analyses of the confidence task as a manipulation check, to the agency analyses for comparison. The agency analyses include both the behavioural and computational sections, as we assess our two criteria for JoAs being metacognitive. This was the flow that we wanted to capture. The confidence modeling at the end of the Exploratory Analyses was added as an additional validation of our modeling approach, to ensure that models give the predicted results for a known metacognitive judgment. Grouping by task (with the confidence task first) would involve describing this confidence modeling prior to the description of the agency models that we developed, which we think would make the paper difficult to follow. Alternatively, with the agency task described first, we would only be able to refer to the behavioural results of the confidence task after having presented the agency modeling, despite the confidence results serving as an important validation of our manipulation.</p><p>At the same time, we understand the reviewer’s point about the order of the results being confusing. To make the grouping into behavioural and then computational analyses clearer, we have now moved the Metacognitive Ability results to the description of the behavioural confidence task results under Confirmatory Analyses. However, we have also moved the full description of this Metacognitive Ability analysis to Appendix 3 due to word count constraints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figures that show model predictions or simulated data (e.g., Figure 3) I think it could be helpful to show simulated/predicted data in the same format as the original data displays (e.g., matching the plots of how data is shown in Figure 2c). This would make it easier for the reader to compare qualitative differences between the simulated and real data, and between each of the models. (Admittedly, this is done in Figure 4, but the granularity of the presentation is hard to translate back up to the big picture patterns observed in the experiments).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an intuitive way to capture the model predictions, and had indeed included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> in an earlier version of our manuscript. However, we included these two specific models in our analyses because they were both able to account for the interaction effect we show in Figure 2c (and not, for example, a simpler model where agency ratings reflect the internal signal strength with no rescaling). Hence, by design, there are no qualitative differences between the models at this level of granularity. This is why we display the model predictions on the distribution of ratings in Figure 3 to highlight their differences, rather than to show that both could capture the observed behavioural effect.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72356-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In standard use 'noise' is something added to stimuli to make discriminations harder. Here the signal strength is actually reduced by dimming the virtual lights, rather than adding a noise mask etc. Labelling the conditions as something like 'Signal strength – High/Low' (reversed accordingly) might be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that, in our paradigm, the signal strength corresponds to the delay between the actual and virtual hand movements. Therefore, increasing signal strength would imply increasing the degree of delay. Because we intentionally use a manipulation that is orthogonal to the delay signal, we want to avoid referring to it as ‘Signal Strength’. We have instead labeled them as ‘Noise’ conditions to be consistent with other perceptual metacognition literature.</p><p>We realize that the literature presents various ways of manipulating discrimination performance, including adding noise and decreasing contrast or visibility.
