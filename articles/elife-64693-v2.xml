associate with dense sympathetic neurites in mouse inguinal subcutaneous white fat (iWAT), little is known about when and how this patterning is established. Here, we applied whole-tissue imaging to examine the development of sympathetic innervation in iWAT. We found that parenchymal neurites actively grow between postnatal day 6 (P6) and P28, overlapping with early postnatal beige adipogenesis. Constitutive deletion of <italic>Prdm16</italic> in adipocytes led to a significant reduction in early postnatal beige adipocytes and sympathetic density within this window. Using an inducible, adipocyte-specific <italic>Prdm16</italic> knockout model, we found that <italic>Prdm16</italic> is required for guiding sympathetic growth during early development. Deleting <italic>Prdm16</italic> in adult animals, however, did not affect sympathetic structure in iWAT. Together, these findings highlight that beige adipocyte-sympathetic neurite communication is crucial to establish sympathetic structure during the early postnatal period but may be dispensable for its maintenance in mature animals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mammals have two types of fatty tissue: white fat that mainly stores energy, and brown and beige fat, also known as thermogenic fat, which burns energy to generate heat. In humans, brown fat is associated with potent anti-obesity and anti-diabetes effects. A better understanding of how this type of fat develops and functions could lead to therapeutic strategies to treat these conditions.</p><p>Adult human brown fat is similar to rodent inducible brown fat, also known as beige fat. In adult mice, beige fat cells need stimulation from the environment to form. Cold can lead to the generation of beige fat cells by activating a part of the nervous system known as the sympathetic nervous system. In order for this cold-induced formation of beige fat cells to take place, nerves from the sympathetic nervous system must first innervate the fatty tissue. Beige fat cells themselves are important for establishing this innervation, but it was not well understood when and how this occurs.</p><p>To study the role of beige fat cells in the establishment of nerve innervation, Chi et al. used genetically modified mice whose beige fat cells are removed when they are treated with an antibiotic called doxycycline. If mice that had not been genetically modified were treated with doxycycline, they developed beige fat cells soon after birth, and these cells shortly became densely innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. However, if the mutant mice were treated with doxycycline around birth, these mice could not make beige fat cells during the treatment and failed to develop dense innervation even when they grew older. These results showed that beige fat cells that form soon after birth are necessary to establish sympathetic nervous system innervation. But are beige fat cells required to maintain this innervation as the mice grow older? To test this, Chi et al. removed them after the innervation was fully established. These mice maintained their innervation, showing that beige fat cells appear to only be required during the establishment of innervation.</p><p>Understanding how the sympathetic nervous system establishes its connection to fat so cold can stimulate beige fat formation is a first step to finding new treatments for conditions such as diabetes or obesity. Exploring the timing that underlies the interactions between the sympathetic nervous system and beige fat cells may provide therapeutic targets in this direction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>beige adipocytes</kwd><kwd>sympathetic nerves</kwd><kwd>whole tissue clearing</kwd><kwd>whole tissue imaging</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007028</institution-id><institution>Leona M. and Harry B.

White adipose tissue enables the safe storage and rapid mobilization of energy in response to nutritional needs, while brown adipose tissue defends body temperature by dissipating energy as heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>). In modern times, however, excess high-calorie foods, a sedentary lifestyle, and thermal comfort have contributed to an overexpansion of white fat and a relative paucity of brown fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heymsfield and Wadden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2018</xref>). This has resulted in a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated diseases including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and many types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kopelman, 2000</xref>). Obesity now affects over 40% of adults in the United States and over 600 million adults worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">CDC, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">The GBD 2015 Obesity Collaborators, 2017</xref>). Excess adiposity is at the center of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, and obesity-related medical care costs the United States health care system nearly $150 billion each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">CDC, 2020b</xref>). Addressing this public health emergency will therefore require new approaches based on a deeper understanding of the tissues and pathways involved in energy homeostasis.</p><p>The crucial role of adipose tissue in energy balance has driven great interest in investigating this tissue as a target for the treatment of obesity. While white adipocytes store excess energy, thermogenic brown and beige adipocytes convert lipids and glucose into heat, thereby increasing energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>). Unlike classical brown adipocytes which are thermogenic in basal conditions, murine beige adipocytes, which resemble human brown adipocytes in their molecular signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shinoda et al., 2015</xref>), reside in white adipose depots and need to be activated by external stimuli such as the sympathetic nervous system to drive thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang and Seale, 2016</xref>). Recent studies have shown that activation of thermogenic adipocytes in both rodents and humans is associated with increased whole-body energy expenditure, improved glucose homeostasis, and enhanced insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cypess et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Seale et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Virtanen et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting a new approach to defend against obesity.</p><p>The sympathetic nervous system plays a key role in enhancing thermogenic function of brown and beige adipocytes. Although located in distinct fat depots, both brown and beige adipocytes are surrounded by dense sympathetic neurites, termed parenchymal innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blaszkiewicz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilherme et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wirsen, 1964</xref>). Norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter released by these parenchymal neurites, activates β-adrenergic signaling in thermogenic adipocytes, resulting in enhanced thermogenesis and lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsieh and Carlson, 1957</xref>). The important role of sympathetic stimulation in thermogenesis has driven great interest in understanding the structural and molecular details of sympathetic control of thermogenic adipocytes. Adipocyte-derived factors have been shown to act on the sympathetic nervous system to regulate its structure and activity. Recent studies have identified S100B and TGFβ1 in brown adipocytes as important molecular determinants of sympathetic innervation in brown fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, it remains largely unclear how beige adipocytes, which are embedded in white fat depots, modulate their sympathetic innervation. Assisted by a whole-adipose immunolabeling and clearing method, called Adipo-Clear, we recently found that the density of sympathetic parenchymal neurites in close apposition to beige adipocytes is dependent on PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16), the transcriptional determinant of beige adipocyte identity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2018b</xref>). Specifically, deletion of <italic>Prdm16</italic> in adipocytes led to ablation of beige adipocyte function and dramatically reduced parenchymal innervation density, suggesting that beige adipocyte-associated factors regulate the structure of sympathetic innervation. As neural projections and circuits can be regulated during development and by physiological stimuli in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glebova and Ginty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>), it is important to determine when the sympathetic innervation surrounding beige adipocytes is established.</p><p>Using 3D whole-tissue imaging, we have begun to decipher the timing of the interactions between sympathetic neurites and beige adipocytes in mouse inguinal subcutaneous white fat (iWAT). We found that sympathetic parenchymal innervation in iWAT actively grows during the early postnatal period. Interestingly, we observed that the establishment of dense parenchymal innervation closely follows the development of early postnatal beige adipocytes. To our surprise, using an inducible, adipocyte-specific <italic>Prdm16</italic> knockout mouse model, we found that <italic>Prdm16</italic> in beige adipocytes is required for sympathetic axon growth during early development, but not necessary for maintaining sympathetic structure in adulthood.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sympathetic innervation of iWAT is established during early postnatal development</title><p>To better understand adipocyte-sympathetic neurite interactions, we investigated whether the association between beige adipocytes and dense sympathetic innervation is developmentally determined. We first mapped the developmental timing of the sympathetic nervous system in iWAT using Adipo-Clear coupled with light sheet fluorescent imaging. Given that iWAT undergoes active tissue morphogenesis during late embryonic and early postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), we first performed whole tissue immunostaining and imaging in iWAT isolated from postnatal day (P) two mice using an antibody targeting tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a maker for sympathetic fibers, which acts as the rate-limiting enzyme in the catecholamine biosynthesis pathway. At this stage, adipocytes appeared fully vascularized and organized into distinct lobular structures, as shown by the endothelial cell marker PECAM (also known as CD31) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C and F</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2015</xref>). While we could detect TH-positive (TH+) signals resembling nerve fascicles as well as fibers wrapping around large blood vessels, dense parenchymal innervation in close apposition to adipocytes, which was reported in adult iWAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>), was not obvious at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>).</p><p>At P6, more distinct features of sympathetic innervation in iWAT were observed: (a) travelling in parallel within nerve fascicles and (b) wrapping around main blood vessels in a dense mesh-like morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Upon further analyzing the innervation pattern across the entire tissue, we observed that these structures were all interconnected to form a continuous sympathetic network. Specifically, we found several convergence points where TH+ nerve fibers within a nerve fascicle deviated from the bundle and merged with the innervation of the central blood vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>), suggesting that sympathetic fibers leave the nerve fascicle and wrap around the main blood vessel as the first order of innervation. Subsequently, the main blood vessel innervation extended around branching arterioles and venules as the second order of innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Lastly, discrete nerve fibers became apparent at the terminals of the second-order innervation to project into tissue parenchyma, where adipocytes are located. Notably, the majority of these nerve fibers appeared to follow capillaries to arrive in the tissue parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G–J</xref>). Although nerve endings were visible in the tissue parenchyma at P6, we did not observe any extensive innervation surrounding adipocytes. In addition, both the dorsolumbar and inguinal regions of iWAT showed similar innervation patterns at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). The results from P2 and P6 samples indicate that the sympathetic axons in iWAT first grow along the vasculature before reaching the tissue parenchyma, consistent with previous findings showing that developing sympathetic axons follow the vasculature to reach their target organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glebova and Ginty, 2005</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sympathetic innervation of iWAT is established during early postnatal development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic view of iWAT.

We analyzed the localization of beige adipocytes using an antibody against uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a widely accepted marker for thermogenic adipocytes, and compared their distribution in relation to the sympathetic parenchymal innervation in iWAT using whole-tissue imaging.

In line with the imaging results, <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA expression showed a gradual increase from P6 to P14 in the inguinal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To our surprise, although we observed more extensive UCP1+ adipocytes in the inguinal region at P21 and P28 by imaging, <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA levels peaked around P12-P16, with the expression level at P14 being fourfold and eightfold higher than that of P21 and P28, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

These quantitative transcriptional data suggest that the beige adipocytes arising in the inguinal region of iWAT during early postnatal development may exhibit peak thermogenic potential around 2–3 weeks of age and gradually become less active as animals mature. On the other hand, all thermogenic genes showed significantly lower mRNA expression in the dorsolumbar region compared to the inguinal region at most time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Of note, <italic>Prdm16</italic>, the transcriptional coregulator that determines beige adipocyte phenotype, showed a consistent 1.5- to twofold increase in mRNA levels in the inguinal relative to the dorsolumbar region across all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Other transcriptional regulators of beige adipocyte development, such as <italic>Cebpb</italic> and <italic>Ppargc1a</italic>, showed similarly consistent regional differences (around 1.5-fold for <italic>Cebpb</italic> and twofold for <italic>Ppargc1a</italic>) during early development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Taken together, these data suggest that adipocytes from the two regions of iWAT are equally differentiated, but the inguinal region may harbor more beige progenitor cells or mature adipocytes with the potential to emerge as beige adipocytes.</p><p>When we overlaid the UCP1 and TH signals, we observed a dramatic overlap between the presence of dense parenchymal innervation and beige adipocytes, particularly from P10 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>), strongly suggesting that early postnatal beige adipocytes are associated with the signals enabling sympathetic axon growth.</p><p>Additionally, as room temperature is considered a mild cold stress to mice, particularly in developing animals that do not have their adult fur pattern, it is possible that early postnatal beige adipocytes arise as a result of cold-induced sympathetic stimulation. When mice were born and raised at a warmer temperature (30°C), at which cold-induced sympathetic firing is minimized, early postnatal beige adipocytes and sympathetic neurites arise in iWAT with the same patterning as that of room temperature-housed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3K–L</xref>). In addition, a recent study using genetic sympathetic ablation showed that early postnatal beige adipocytes develop normally in the absence of sympathetic innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2020b</xref>).

To examine whether the perinatal deletion of <italic>Prdm16</italic> led to changes in downstream thermogenic gene expression, we analyzed mRNA levels of thermogenic markers that are induced by cold in wild-type iWAT. Since we have consistently observed that the inguinal region of iWAT is enriched in both early postnatal and cold-inducible beige adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2018b</xref>), we hereafter focused on analyzing changes in the inguinal region. As expected, the control inguinal regions exhibited robust increases in the entire panel of thermogenic markers following 2 days of cold exposure (e.g. 35-fold induction in <italic>Ucp1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

It is possible that the decreased neurite density in i<italic>Prdm16</italic><sup>KO</sup> was due to a simple scaling effect; that is, the neurites appear more sparse because the adipocytes are larger in size. To rule out this possibility, we also calculated neurite density by factoring in adipocyte density from each tissue volume, and still observed a significant 52.8% decrease in density following perinatal <italic>Prdm16</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>).</p><p>Similar to our previous findings with the c<italic>Prdm16</italic><sup>KO</sup> model, perinatal <italic>Prdm16</italic> knockout in adipocytes did not significantly affect thermogenic or adipogenic markers in iBAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>).

Dense sympathetic parenchymal innervation is observed in both iBAT and the inguinal region of iWAT, where beige adipocytes are primarily located; however, sparse innervation is found in eWAT and the dorsolateral region of iWAT, an area of the tissue that is devoid of beige adipocytes even under long term cold stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dichamp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huesing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Murano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). The strong association between thermogenic adipocytes and dense sympathetic neurites as well as the association between white adipocytes and sparse innervation suggests that adipocyte type may determine the density of sympathetic parenchymal innervation. Indeed, when beige-to-white adipocyte identity change was achieved by adipocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Prdm16</italic>, the density of sympathetic parenchymal innervation was significantly reduced in the inguinal region of iWAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2018b</xref>). Although many previous studies have attempted to define the relationships between sympathetic neurite density and beige adipocytes, when and how such relationships are established has remained unclear.</p><p>Here, we delineated key stages of sympathetic nervous system development in iWAT using whole tissue imaging. Specifically, we observed that sympathetic parenchymal innervation in close apposition to adipocytes is established between P6 and P28. Importantly, the appearance of UCP1+ beige adipocytes precedes the emergence of dense parenchymal neurites during early postnatal development. We further demonstrated that both early postnatal beige adipocytes and dense parenchymal neurites depend on <italic>Prdm16</italic> expression in adipocytes. Using an inducible <italic>Prdm16</italic> deletion model, we identified an early critical period during which beige adipocytes modulate sympathetic axon growth. However, <italic>Prdm16</italic> deletion in adult mice did not alter the sympathetic structure.</p><p>Assisted by whole-tissue images, our study carefully examined the growth of sympathetic axons in iWAT. We observed that sympathetic fibers travel in nerve fascicles to arrive at iWAT, and then depart from nerve fascicles to reach main blood vessels within iWAT. By P6, the sympathetic innervation on blood vessels demonstrated a dense mesh-like structure, resembling that of mature iWAT. However, dense parenchymal innervation surrounding adipocytes, which several studies have characterized in mature iWAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>), is not established at P6. Instead, we observed sparse discrete sympathetic fibers and small vessels in congruence within the tissue parenchyma, a common phenomenon in sympathetic nerve fiber development where vasculature serves as a guide to direct developing fibers to reach their targets, such as the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nam et al., 2013</xref>). Subsequently, from P10 until P28, dense parenchymal innervation becomes obvious where clusters of UCP1+ beige adipocytes are located.</p><p>Although beige adipocytes emerge in white fat depots of adult mice following cold challenge, we observed strong beige adipogenesis during early postnatal development, similar to the ‘peri-weaning’ beige adipocytes reported in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2020b</xref>). Using high-resolution whole tissue imaging focusing on the inguinal region of iWAT, we detected scattered UCP1+ adipocytes at P6, subsequent emergence of small UCP1+ adipocyte clusters at P10, and an expansion to almost all lobules from P14 to P28. On the other hand, beige adipogenesis is delayed in the dorsolumbar region, where small clusters of beige adipocytes are not detected until P14. It will be of interest to investigate the mechanisms driving the preferential localization of early postnatal beige adipocytes. Although beige adipocyte recruitment in adult mice requires sympathetic stimulation, early postnatal beige adipocytes develop normally in mice born and raised at thermoneutrality with minimal sympathetic activity as well as in mice with genetic sympathetic ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2020b</xref>). Interestingly, we found several genes involved in the transcriptional control of beige adipocyte determination and function to have higher expression levels in the inguinal than the dorsolumbar region throughout early development, suggesting adipocytes or their progenitors in different regions may exhibit unique properties. Additionally, as early postnatal beige adipocytes first emerge close to the core of the inguinal region, other tissue structures such as blood or lymph vessels that are found in the same area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>) may play a role in promoting early beige adipogenesis.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the whole-tissue UCP1+ patterns at P21 and P28 closely resemble that of adult mice following cold exposure. In addition, the thermogenic gene expression of early postnatal beige adipocytes diminishes as mice mature. It is possible that early postnatal beige adipocytes gradually become inactivated during maturation, and cold challenge re-activates the same cells in adult mice. Follow-up studies will be needed to examine the fate of early postnatal beige adipocytes. Of note, emerging studies have described additional beige adipocytes that rely on pathways other than UCP1 to dissipate heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikeda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kazak et al., 2015</xref>). Thorough characterization of these beige adipocytes using specific markers will be needed to delineate their development and fate.</p><p>Using constitutive and inducible adipocyte-specific <italic>Prdm16</italic> deletion models, we ablated early postnatal beige adipocyte function and found that this dramatically reduced parenchymal sympathetic neurites in iWAT. Our findings suggest that early postnatal beige adipocytes may express PRDM16-dependent neurotrophic factors that stimulate sympathetic axon growth or downregulate inhibition cues. Recent studies have unveiled important roles of brown adipocyte-derived factors, such as S100B and TGFβ1, in regulating sympathetic innervation in iBAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). As beige and brown adipocytes share similarities, it is possible that these factors may also affect sympathetic innervation in iWAT. Interestingly, <italic>S100b</italic>, but not <italic>Tgfb1</italic>, showed a regional pattern at the mRNA level during early iWAT development, with higher expression in the inguinal region in a PRDM16-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>). This result suggests that S100B may be one of the potential cues in regulating iWAT sympathetic development. It is also likely that sympathetic neurites are indirectly regulated by additional beige adipocyte-associated cell types, such as immune or stromal cells. Follow-up studies will need to evaluate the role of S100B and other potential factors in modulating sympathetic axon growth during early iWAT morphogenesis.</p><p>Our studies using an inducible adipocyte-specific <italic>Prdm16</italic> deletion model indicated a critical developmental window for the interactions between beige adipocytes and sympathetic nerve terminals. Restricted <italic>Prdm16</italic> deletion during early tissue morphogenesis resulted in a lasting reduction in parenchymal neurite density. However, <italic>Prdm16</italic> deletion in fully mature mice failed to alter sympathetic neurite density. These results indicate that sympathetic neurites in iWAT respond to signals from beige adipocytes or associated cells during early development. However, when the innervation pattern is fully established, such signals are no longer required for maintaining the innervation level during adulthood. In line with this, we have previously shown that cold-induced beige adipocytes do not promote sympathetic neurite outgrowth in adult iWAT when equivalent tissue regions are compared. Taken together, our data suggest that sympathetic neurite density is regulated by local cues from beige adipocytes during a specific developmental window and exhibits limited plasticity once the pattern is established.</p><p>Of note, a recent study demonstrated leptin-mediated central regulation of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, chronic leptin treatment acting on hypothalamic neurons was found to rescue the defect in sympathetic innervation in iBAT and iWAT of adult leptin-deficient mice. It is possible that the central and local regulation of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue acts with different timing and through distinct mechanisms. Interestingly, the sympathetic axon growth period we observed (P10-P21) largely overlaps with a postnatal leptin surge (P8-P20) reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2020a</xref>). Future studies are needed to uncouple central (leptin surge) and local (beige adipocyte-associated factors) effects to fully understand how adipose sympathetic innervation is regulated by each mechanism. It is also worth noting that current studies rely on neurite morphological changes such as length to characterize sympathetic growth or remodeling. As adipocyte size dramatically changes in response to caloric excess or deprivation, sympathetic neurite density may appear different even without active remodeling. A better understanding of sympathetic neurite structural change will be assisted by identifying markers specific to actively remodeling neurites.</p><p>Thermogenic adipocytes have been demonstrated to provide metabolic benefits that may combat obesity and associated metabolic diseases. As thermogenic adipocytes are primarily induced by sympathetic stimulation, many studies have turned to the sympathetic nervous system in search of novel therapeutic targets for enhancing thermogenic adipocyte function. Our studies here demonstrated a critical developmental window during which beige adipocytes regulate sympathetic neurite density, providing fundamental knowledge about the development of the sympathetic nervous system in mouse subcutaneous white fat and providing a framework for future attempts to target this pathway for therapeutic benefit.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this article, Chi et al. provide a detailed description of the development and patterning of murine inguinal white adipose tissue. This area of study, while of critical importance in understanding the dynamics of adipose tissue innervation and systemic metabolism, has suffered from a dearth of experimental evidence despite the ever-increasing interest in adipose thermogenesis being adapted for therapeutic purposes in humans. This study provides key information regarding the timing of adipose innervation in relation to beige adipogenesis, as well as careful quantification of neurite densities with appropriate normalization strategies. These data will be informative for future studies involving sympathetic regulation of adipose function. The finding that perinatal beige adipogenesis, which is driven by the primary beige adipogenic transcription factor PRDM16, is critical for establishing the network of parenchymal neurites present in adult mice is of particular interest as it further suggests a relatively fixed sympathetic tone in adult mice.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Strictly speaking, <italic>Prdm16</italic> is inactivated in all adipocytes (Adipoq+); however, the claim is that beige adipocytes drive the innervation. A fairly convincing case is made that it's the beige adipocytes, but can the authors rule out that white adipocyte <italic>Prdm16</italic> is regulating this process. Is <italic>Prdm16</italic> only expressed in UCP1+ adipocytes of the iWAT depot? This should be discussed/addressed.</p><p>2) The Spiegelman group has recently reported that TGFβ1 and <italic>S100b</italic> are determinants of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue. Are these factors involved in the early development of the innervation patterning? It is not essential that new neurotrophic factor be unveiled in this study, but consideration should be made for the known regulators.</p><p>3) Prior papers have suggested a more dynamically regulated sympathetic arborization network within the adult mouse iWAT, such as via a dramatic induction of innervation following chronic leptin administration in adult Ob/Ob mice (PMID: 28918935). Additionally, another study on iWAT innervation showed a dramatic decrease in innervation following diet-induced obesity by a high-fat diet (PMID: 32699414). Given the relatively fixed patterning that the authors have shown is established in the critical window of development immediately following birth, do the authors believe that these studies present contradictory findings regarding the plasticity of adult iWAT innervation?</p><p>4) Can the compromised innervation in perinatal <italic>Prdm16</italic><sup>KO</sup> mice be naturally rescued/compensated for as animals age? Or is the defect in innervation permanent? The answer may speak to whether the neonatal period is the only critical time window to fully establish iWAT thermogenic capacity. Data on this point would be helpful but is not strictly required.</p><p>5) The authors describe placing the early postnatal mice at thermoneutrality (30 <sup>o</sup>C) in order to observe the development of the sympathetic arborizations independent of the minor cold stress of room temperature. However, given the fact that these pups lack the same amount of fur as adult mice, the true thermoneutral point for these mice may be notably higher than 30 <sup>o</sup>C, and thus some cold stress still exists and the conclusion that this increase in innervation is a developmentally hard-wired program may not be fully substantiated. The authors should confirm the thermoneutral point for these pups by observing the relationship between pup body temperature and ambient temperature, and, if necessary, reconduct the experiment at a higher ambient temperature.</p><p>6) In Figure 2 it appears that the perinatal emergence or UCP1 positive beige adipocytes staining in WT animals is conspicuously denser around the central lymph node (This area seems to correspond with what is referred to as the &quot;core&quot; in the text). Is this an accidental observation or is there reason to believe that innervation or vascularization around the lymph node or lymph vessels may provide important trophic signals to drive PDRM16 , UCP1, CD36 and TH innnervation?

Based on the apparent specialization of UCP1 density around the core (near the lymph node) and diminished density as one radiates outward form the core, this peri-lymph node region may be quantitatively different and more dense compared to other regions farther away. Thus, the present relative UCP1 and PRDM16 mRNA level statistics at days greater that p14 may be artificially low, depending on exactly how the authors sample or average over the entire depot post day 14. This may be in part because the depot itself grows and its extremities extend farther and farther away from the central lymph node at days after p 14, so there might be an artificial &quot;diluting &quot; of relative UCP1 mRNA and PRDM16 reported.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64693.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Strictly speaking, Prdm16 is inactivated in all adipocytes (Adipoq+); however, the claim is that beige adipocytes drive the innervation. A fairly convincing case is made that it's the beige adipocytes, but can the authors rule out that white adipocyte Prdm16 is regulating this process. Is Prdm16 only expressed in UCP1+ adipocytes of the iWAT depot? This should be discussed/addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. While this question would be best answered by directly visualizing the localization of PRDM16-expressing adipocytes in iWAT, we could not find any PRDM16 antibody suitable for immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry in adipose tissue. Therefore, as an alternate approach, we made use of the regionality in iWAT to isolate predominantly beige vs. white regions from this depot and analyzed <italic>Prdm16</italic> mRNA and protein levels in these regions (Figure 3—figure supplement 2I and J). As shown in our current and previous work (Chi et al., 2018), the inguinal region is enriched with early postnatal and cold-induced beige adipocytes in adults, whereas the dorsolateral region is mostly devoid of early postnatal beige adipocytes and remains UCP1-negative even following prolonged cold exposure in adulthood. These observations suggest that the inguinal and dorsolateral regions can be considered as beige and white regions of iWAT, respectively.</p><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 2I, we performed qPCR on the two regions isolated from control and c<italic>Prdm16</italic><sup>KO</sup> mice at postnatal day 14. A detailed description about regional dissection is included in the Materials and methods section. The control dorsolateral region showed significantly lower expression of <italic>Prdm16</italic> mRNA than the control inguinal region. Importantly, <italic>Prdm16</italic> mRNA levels in the control dorsolateral region were indistinguishable from those in c<italic>Prdm16</italic><sup>KO</sup> dorsolateral or inguinal regions, suggesting that the wild-type dorsolateral region naturally expresses very low levels of <italic>Prdm16</italic> mRNA with levels indistinguishable from <italic>Prdm16</italic> knockout samples.</p><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 2J, we further assessed PRDM16 protein levels across multiple fat depots of adult mice. Consistently, the dorsolateral region exhibited a considerably lower level of PRDM16 compared with the inguinal region in wild-type iWAT, while there was no detectable PRDM16 in the iWAT of <italic>cPrdm16<sup>KO</sup></italic> mice or wild-type eWAT. Although there was still a minimal level of PRDM16 protein in the dorsolateral region of iWAT, this can be attributed to the small number of beige adipocytes in the dorsolateral region. Altogether, with the <italic>Prdm16</italic> mRNA and protein assessments in the different regions of iWAT, we believe that <italic>Prdm16</italic> is minimally expressed in white adipocytes in iWAT, and thus feel that its deletion in white adipocytes contributes minimally to the changes in sympathetic innervation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Spiegelman group has recently reported that TGFβ1 and S100b are determinants of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue. Are these factors involved in the early development of the innervation patterning? It is not essential that new neurotrophic factor be unveiled in this study, but consideration should be made for the known regulators.</p></disp-quote><p>In the publications you allude to above, the roles of <italic>S100b</italic> and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> in regulating sympathetic innervation were mainly investigated in iBAT. Since beige and brown adipocytes share similarities, it is possible that these factors may also regulate sympathetic innervation of beige adipocytes in iWAT. Based on our observations, potential candidates that regulate the growth of sympathetic neurites in iWAT during early development may exhibit a PRDM16-dependent regional pattern. We performed qPCR to assess the mRNA levels of <italic>S100b</italic> and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> in the inguinal and dorsolateral regions isolated from control and c<italic>Prdm16</italic><sup>KO</sup> mice at postnatal day 14. Interestingly, <italic>S100b</italic>, but not <italic>Tgfb1</italic>, is enriched in the control inguinal region in a PRDM16-dependent manner (Figure 5—figure supplement 2F), suggesting <italic>S100b</italic> may play a role in regulating sympathetic growth in beige adipocytes. Additional experiments are required to examine the function of <italic>S100b</italic> and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> in sympathetic development during early iWAT morphogenesis. Importantly, sympathetic axonal growth has been shown to be regulated by multiple factors in other organ systems, such as heart (Kimura et al., 2012). It is likely that follow-up mechanistic studies can uncover additional proteins important for sympathetic innervation establishment in iWAT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Prior papers have suggested a more dynamically regulated sympathetic arborization network within the adult mouse iWAT, such as via a dramatic induction of innervation following chronic leptin administration in adult Ob/Ob mice (PMID: 28918935). Additionally, another study on iWAT innervation showed a dramatic decrease in innervation following diet-induced obesity by a high-fat diet (PMID: 32699414). Given the relatively fixed patterning that the authors have shown is established in the critical window of development immediately following birth, do the authors believe that these studies present contradictory findings regarding the plasticity of adult iWAT innervation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. Our current studies focus on sympathetic development in iWAT. Our results support that early sympathetic axon growth is guided by beige adipocyte-associated molecules, and that such molecules are not responsible for maintaining sympathetic innervation of iWAT outside the critical developmental window. On the other hand, the reduced sympathetic neurite density following high-fat diet feeding may be due to a form of axon degeneration. Axon growth and degeneration are distinct phenomena that usually occur through different mechanisms. While axon growth is regulated by neurotrophic and axon guidance molecules (Glebova and Ginty, 2005), axon degeneration may be caused by metabolic alterations or mechanical injury (Coleman, 2005). It will be interesting for future studies to examine mechanisms and physiological consequences of reduced sympathetic neurite density in adipose tissue during the progression of obesity.</p><p>It has recently been reported that leptin deficient mice also show dramatically reduced sympathetic neurite density in iBAT and iWAT, while chronic leptin treatment stimulates adipose sympathetic axon growth by acting on neurons in the hypothalamus in adult mice (Wang et al., 2020). These results unveiled an important central (or top-down) pathway that regulates sympathetic neuron properties, which is possibly acting upon a different time frame than target tissue-derived cues. Additional studies are needed to unravel the contribution of central vs. local regulation of adipose tissue sympathetic innervation. Taken together, we believe that sympathetic axon degeneration in diet-induced obesity and leptin-stimulated axonal regrowth in ob/ob mice are distinct phenomena, and therefore not necessarily contradictory to our findings on the critical time window for local/target tissue-derived regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Can the compromised innervation in perinatal Prdm16<sup>KO</sup> mice be naturally rescued/compensated for as animals age? Or is the defect in innervation permanent? The answer may speak to whether the neonatal period is the only critical time window to fully establish iWAT thermogenic capacity. Data on this point would be helpful but is not strictly required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an important point. To assess potential rescue of the innervation defect following perinatal deletion of <italic>Prdm16</italic>, we performed the same perinatal deletion of <italic>Prdm16</italic> (E14 to P21) but let animals reach 8 weeks of age on a chow diet, hereafter referred to as i<italic>Prdm16</italic><sup>KO</sup> (perinatal, 8wk) (Figure 4—figure supplement 4A). As iWAT continues to expand in young adult mice (from 5-week-old to 8-week-old), we reasoned that newly developed adipocytes during iWAT expansion might also affect the sympathetic innervation pattern. Consistent with the results from the i<italic>Prdm16</italic><sup>KO</sup> (perinatal, 5wk) experiment, we observed significantly reduced expression of <italic>Prdm16</italic> and other thermogenic genes at the mRNA level in i<italic>Prdm16</italic><sup>KO</sup> (perinatal, 8wk) relative to control (Figure 4—figure supplement 4B-D). Importantly, TH<sup>+</sup> fibers appeared substantially sparser in i<italic>Prdm16</italic><sup>KO</sup> (perinatal, 8wk) than control. These data demonstrate that the innervation defect resulting from perinatal ablation of <italic>Prdm16</italic> persists during a natural period when iWAT continues to actively grow. However, it is possible that sympathetic innervation may grow back as mice age further. Future studies will be necessary to examine this biology in aged mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors describe placing the early postnatal mice at thermoneutrality (30 <sup>o</sup>C) in order to observe the development of the sympathetic arborizations independent of the minor cold stress of room temperature. However, given the fact that these pups lack the same amount of fur as adult mice, the true thermoneutral point for these mice may be notably higher than 30 <sup>o</sup>C, and thus some cold stress still exists and the conclusion that this increase in innervation is a developmentally hard-wired program may not be fully substantiated. The authors should confirm the thermoneutral point for these pups by observing the relationship between pup body temperature and ambient temperature, and, if necessary, reconduct the experiment at a higher ambient temperature.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. It is not our intention to argue that the development of sympathetic innervation is independent of cold stress with this thermoneutral experiment. We only wish to use these data to support the argument that emergence of early postnatal beige adipocytes may be spontaneous rather than induced by sympathetic stimulation. This same phenomenon has been examined in Wu et al., 2020. In this study, mice with genetic denervation of the sympathetic nervous system developed early postnatal UCP1+ adipocytes similar to the control group, supporting that sympathetic activation is not required to recruit these cells. We modified this section in the revised manuscript to make this point more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 2 it appears that the perinatal emergence or UCP1 positive beige adipocytes staining in WT animals is conspicuously denser around the central lymph node (This area seems to correspond with what is referred to as the &quot;core&quot; in the text). Is this an accidental observation or is there reason to believe that innervation or vascularization around the lymph node or lymph vessels may provide important trophic signals to drive PDRM16 , UCP1, CD36 and TH innnervation? Have the authors examined any lymph vessel specific markers or approaches could be targeted to the WAT lymph node or its supply to directly challenge this suggestion?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the “core” region of iWAT, which is close to the inguinal lymph node and the main blood vessel that travels through the inguinal portion of iWAT, may contain important cell types or trophic factors that promote beige adipocyte recruitment and the subsequent establishment of sympathetic innervation. To visualize lymphatic vessels in iWAT, we performed imaging using an antibody targeting lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1), a well-recognized marker for lymphatic endothelial cells in various tissue types (Podgrabinska et al., 2002; Potente and Mäkinen, 2017). In addition to the lymph node, we observed that LYVE1 staining labeled cell-like and vessel-like structures in iWAT (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-E). The LYVE1+ vessel originating from the lymph node is likely a lymph vessel. Importantly, this vessel lies adjacent to the main blood vessel that is heavily innervated by TH<sup>+</sup> fibers and travels through the inguinal region (Figure 5—figure supplement 2D-E). Although we agree that blood and lymph vessels in this region may elaborate important factors to drive iWAT patterning, our current imaging data can neither support nor refute the reviewer’s question on causality. Further experiments that manipulate lymph vessels and associated cell types within the adipose tissue will be required to address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) On a related note, Figure 2—figure supplement 1: The authors remark on the apparent reduction in relative UCP1 mRNA levels in inguinal adipose tissue after p14 (and to some degree PRDM16, yet NOT relative mRNA levels for most other adipose beiging-related markers). Based on the apparent specialization of UCP1 density around the core (near the lymph node) and diminished density as one radiates outward form the core, this peri-lymph node region may be quantitatively different and more dense compared to other regions farther away. Thus, the present relative UCP1 and PRDM16 mRNA level statistics at days greater that p14 may be artificially low, depending on exactly how the authors sample or average over the entire depot post day 14. This may be in part because the depot itself grows and its extremities extend farther and farther away from the central lymph node at days after p 14, so there might be an artificial &quot;diluting &quot; of relative UCP1 mRNA and PRDM16 reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We have now included a detailed description of our dissection method and additional figures to illustrate depot boundaries or “extremities”. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1F-H, we presented images containing UCP1 and tissue autofluorescence signals that correspond to iWAT samples of P14, P21, and P28 mice. The tissue autofluorescence signals outline tissue boundaries following dissection. Among the three time points, the proportion of UCP1 signal within the tissue boundary is the lowest at P14. This suggests that qPCR results of <italic>Ucp1</italic> at P14 may be an underestimation and argues against a dilution of <italic>Ucp1</italic> signal at later timepoints. However, quantitative mRNA or protein analysis of bulk tissue pieces cannot directly address the changes of <italic>Ucp1</italic> levels in early postnatal beige adipocytes over time. Future studies may involve single cell or single nuclei RNAseq to track <italic>Ucp1</italic> content within individual cells over the developmental time course.</p><p>References:</p><p>Coleman M. 2005.
