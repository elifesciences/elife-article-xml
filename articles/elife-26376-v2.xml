Ribosome localization determines the local capacity for protein synthesis, which is particularly important in polarized cells, such as neurons. The observation of polysomes in the base of dendritic spines in rat dentate gyrus neurons provided crucial early evidence for local translation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steward and Levy, 1982</xref>). Aberrant local protein synthesis disrupts neuronal plasticity in models for neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auerbach et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the importance of local translation is highlighted by unique localization of specific mRNAs. For example, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α(CaMKIIα) mRNA is localized to dendrites via a <italic>cis</italic> regulatory element in its 3’-UTR, and removal of this element impairs long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2002</xref>); β-actin mRNA is localized to the growing tip of an axon, the growth cone, where its polarized translation is important for growth cone turning towards an attractant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yao et al., 2006</xref>). Despite their potential impact on local translation, mechanisms underlying ribosome localization <italic>in vivo</italic> are largely unexplored, partly due to the limited tools to visualize ribosomes in live multicellular organisms. One striking example of ribosome localization is that dendritic ribosomes associated with the netrin receptor, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC), are stalled and inactive, and released upon netrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tcherkezian et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Electron microscopy (EM) studies have long provided essential evidence for ribosomes, beginning with the discovery of ~20 nm diameter electron-dense particles rich in nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Palade, 1955</xref>). Individual ribosomes (monosomes) are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or free in the cytosol, while mRNA-bound polysomes appear as beaded strings in EM images. To support the identity of ribosomes, EM analyses are often complemented by electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI) of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) phosphorus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koenig and Martin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Korn et al., 1983</xref>), nucleic acid-binding dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Glazer and Rye, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koenig and Martin, 1996</xref>), ribosomal RNA antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koenig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lerner et al., 1981</xref>), ribosomal protein antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elkon et al., 1985</xref>), or antibodies for proteins involved in translation, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tcherkezian et al., 2010</xref>). These methods have been used to identify clustered ribosomes, often termed plaques, in squid neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martin et al., 1998</xref>), goldfish Mauthner cell axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koenig and Martin, 1996</xref>), and mammalian peripheral axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koenig et al., 2000</xref>). The limitation of the aforementioned studies on ribosome localization is that they required tissues and/or cells to be fixed and therefore limited in their ability to address the mechanism of ribosome localization.</p><p>Until now, <italic>in vivo</italic> live imaging studies of functional ribosomes remain limited because labeling ribosomal proteins with a fluorescent protein presents challenges, compared to other organelles. First, as dozens of ribosomal proteins assemble into an RNA-rich macromolecule complex, there are limited sites for fluorescent protein tagging without interfering with ribosome function. Second, the expression level of ribosomal proteins is tightly controlled. Methodologies for live imaging of ribosomes largely rely on overexpression of ribosomal proteins tagged with fluorescence proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buxbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolls et al., 2002</xref>), which can cause cellular defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Warner and McIntosh, 2009</xref>). For example, overexpression of ribosomal subunit S29 causes apoptosis in primary cultured thymocytes of rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khanna et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, overexpressed ribosomal proteins may not be incorporated into endogenous ribosomes, generating artifactual signals. Tagging ribosomal proteins at endogenous loci can solve this issue, but has been reported only in unicellular organisms. In bacteria, endogenous ribosomal protein S2 has been labeled with YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref>). In yeasts, endogenous loci of ribosomal proteins have been tagged with GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). For multicellular organisms, such as mice, knock-in of HA-tagged RPL22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sanz et al., 2009</xref>) or BAC transgenic expression of eGFP-tagged RPL10a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heiman et al., 2008</xref>) has been used for ribosomal profiling of translational status. However, these reagents do not allow direct visualization of endogenous ribosomes in living tissues. A third challenge is the abundance of ribosomes in all tissues, potentially interfering with visualization of ribosomes in specific subcellular compartments, such as axons and dendrites. Thus, methods to visualize endogenous ribosomes in specific tissues in multicellular organisms have not been established and, as a result, few studies have addressed mechanisms controlling ribosome localization.</p><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)</italic> is ideally suited for visualizing protein and organelle localization <italic>in vivo</italic> because it is transparent and genetically tractable. Furthermore, candidate and forward genetic screens allow dissection of regulatory mechanisms. Here, we developed an approach using split GFP to visualize endogenous ribosomes in a tissue-specific manner. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, we found that ribosome localization is compartmentalized and displays dynamic changes during development and after axon injury. Loss of function of the Uncoordinated-16 (<italic>unc-16</italic>), encoding JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3), causes mislocalization of ribosomes. We further performed a forward genetic screen for mutants altering ribosome localization. Our analysis revealed roles of neuronal tubulins and the <italic>mec-15</italic> (<italic>mec</italic>hanosensory abnormality-15) encoding a F-box protein that functions as a regulator of tubulins, for proper ribosome localization. These findings support the utility of our approach for visualizing ribosomes in specific tissues and suggest that UNC-16/JIP3 and microtubules have specific roles in neuronal ribosome localization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualization of ribosomes using functional GFP-tagged ribosomal proteins</title><p>To visualize ribosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>, we selected ribosomal proteins whose N- and/or C-termini are on the surface of ribosomes, based on structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shem et al., 2011</xref>). We initially used standard multi-copy transgenes to overexpress GFP-tagged ribosomal proteins (see Materials and Methods). However, we noticed that such overexpression caused a variety of cellular defects, such as abnormal morphologies of axons and cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and aggregates of ribosomal proteins in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Reasoning that tagged ribosomal proteins should be functional and expressed at the levels comparable to endogenous ones, we then focused on ribosomal small subunit protein 18 (<italic>rps-18</italic>) or large subunit protein 29 (<italic>rpl-29</italic>), for which genetic null mutations were available. Homozygous <italic>rps-18(ok3353)</italic> mutants (<italic>rps-18(0),</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) exhibited early larval arrest.

To circumvent these challenges, we devised a strategy using self-assembling split GFP; when the first ten β-strands (GFP1-10) and the last β-strand (GFP11) coexist, they irreversibly assemble and produce green fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cabantous et al., 2005</xref>). We reasoned that GFP11-tagged endogenous proteins could be visualized by expressing GFP1-10 under the control of a tissue-specific promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Importantly, we found that a single-copy expression of GFP11::RPS-18 (<italic>juSi94[GFP11::rps-18]</italic>) completely rescued larval arrest and sterility of <italic>rps-18(0) </italic>(<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref></italic>). This is probably because GFP11 is much smaller (16 amino acids), compared to GFP (237 amino acids), supporting our interpretation for partial impaired function of the GFP::RPS-18. We then expressed GFP1-10 in specific tissues, such as epidermis, muscles, or neurons to visualize GFP11::RPS-18 expression in the <italic>juSi94; rps-18(0)</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and see below). Since the binding between GFP11 and GFP1-10 is irreversible, it is possible that the reconstituted GFP::RPS-18 is not fully functional in contexts where ribosome activity is locally required or sensitive to dosage. Nonetheless, the subcellular fluorescence pattern revealed by this split-GFP transgenic approach was similar to that from the single-copy expression of GFP::RPS-18 or of RPL-29::GFP. Here, we call this approach <underline>R</underline>ibosome <underline>I</underline>maging <underline>B</underline>ased <underline>O</underline>n <underline>S</underline>plit GFP (RIBOS). We denote tissue-specific RIBOS, namely, <italic>juSi94[GFP11::rps-18]; rps-18(0); juEx or juIs[Pgene-GFP1-10],</italic> where P<italic>gene</italic> is a tissue-specific promoter, as ‘P<italic>gene</italic>-RIBOS’ for simplicity.</p><p>We first evaluated RIBOS signals in non-neuronal tissues. In adult epidermis-specific P<italic>col-19</italic>-RIBOS, we observed signals in the epidermal cytosol excluded from reticular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Epidermis). Although RPS-18 is expressed in the whole body, fluorescence was not observed in any other tissues, such as intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Intestine), suggesting that GFPP11::RPS-18 did not have fluorescence. Worms expressing P<italic>col-19</italic>-GFP1-10 transgene alone also did not show fluorescent signals compared to P<italic>col-19</italic>-RIBOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and Materials and Methods). To address whether GFP11::RPS-18 was incorporated into endogenous ribosomes, we measured Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) of P<italic>col-19</italic>-RIBOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). If GFP11::RPS-18 is incorporated into a large organelle or complex, such as the ribosome, the half time of fluorescence recovery (t<sub>1/2</sub>) should be larger, and the mobile fraction should be smaller than those of a free cytosolic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2001</xref>). We used GFP-tagged Initiation Factor 4E (eIF4E) homologs, IFE-2::GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Song et al., 2010</xref>) and IFE-4::GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dinkova et al., 2005</xref>), as controls because their diffuse distribution implied lack of association to specific protein complex or organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Photobleached GFP11::RPS-18 showed a longer recovery time and smaller mobile fraction than IFE-2::GFP and IFE-4::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–1H</xref>). Furthermore, the recovery curve, t<sub>1/2</sub>, and mobile fraction of GFP11::RPS-18 were comparable to that of the ribosomal large subunit, RPL-29::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–1H</xref>), suggesting that fluorescence recovery was not affected by splitting GFP, and that RPS-18 and RPL-29 were incorporated into a complex with a similar mobility, likely the ribosome.</p><p>Body wall muscle-specific P<italic>myo-3</italic>-RIBOS revealed that besides strong somatic signals, fluorescence was observed in the muscle arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), an elaborate postsynaptic structure extending to the nerve cord to receive inputs from presynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dixon and Roy, 2005</xref>). Such RIBOS signals were consistent with the distribution of ribosomes in muscle arms as found in electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

P<italic>unc-25</italic>-RIBOS labeled ribosomes in the GABAergic dorsal D-type (DD) and ventral D-type (VD) motor neurons. In the first larval (L1) stage, we found that ribosomes colocalized with presynaptic markers, RAB-3, in the ventral cord, corresponding to the presynaptic terminals of DD motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). At late L1 to L2 stage DD neurons remodel their pre-synaptic specializations from the ventral cord to the dorsal cord, in a phenomenon known as DD remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">White et al., 1978</xref>). Concurrent with DD remodeling, the VD neurons form presynaptic specializations along the ventral cord. From L2 to older larvae, we observed P<italic>unc-25</italic>-RIBOS signals in the ventral cord, which were excluded from VD presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We severed the proximal axonal process of PLM mechanosensory neurons by laser axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). Around 6 hr after axotomy, microtubules are reorganized, leading to the formation of a growth cone, and severed axons start regrowing around the same time, resulting in average regrowth about ~100 µm after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012</xref>).

In mammals, large molecules are excluded from the axons of mature neurons by the axon initial segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Song et al., 2009</xref>).

Fluorescent signals representing ribosomes were punctate in the neuronal processes in motor and mechanosensory neurons, and change during development or after axon injury. Furthermore, our analyses revealed roles for JIP3/<italic>unc-16</italic> and microtubules in regulating ribosome distribution in neurons.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Endogenous protein labeling in specific tissues</title><p>We have developed a reliable method to label endogenous proteins in specific tissues using split GFP. Our studies highlight the importance of maintaining ribosomal protein expression at levels close to endogenous. <italic>C. elegans</italic> ribosome biogenesis seems to be tightly regulated so that the total amount of ribosomal proteins is balanced as in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaczanowska and Rydén-Aulin, 2007</xref>) because copy numbers of endogenous <italic>rps-18</italic> or <italic>rpl-29</italic> affected the expression level of single-copy-inserted GFP-tagged ribosomal proteins. This regulation likely exists because imbalanced expression of ribosomal proteins results in cellular defects, as we showed using high-copy transgenes. Overexpression of tagged proteins can also cause signal artifacts, which are a common concern for visualizing proteins in live cells. For example, to avoid the artifact by overexpressing PSD-95, a postsynaptic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">El-Husseini et al., 2000</xref>), recombinant antibody-like proteins called FingRs have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gross et al., 2013</xref>). Tissue-specific expression of GFP-tagged FingRs can visualize an endogenous protein without tagging. However, this method requires the generation of optimal FingRs with mRNA display; moreover, excess GFP-FingRs can produce background signals. The advantage of split GFP is that neither GFP1-10 nor GFP11 is fluorescent. In contrast to antibody-based methods, however, the split GFP method requires genetic alteration of the endogenous locus. With recent advances in genome engineering with the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) method, it is feasible to tag the endogenous locus with a fluorescent protein in various organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>). To avoid interfering with the function of endogenous proteins, it is desirable to keep the tag as small as possible. GFP11 satisfies this requirement because it has only 16 amino-acids. Endogenous protein labeling brings another challenge in that widespread endogenous expression in many tissues might prevent visualization in a tissue of interest, as is the case for the ribosomal proteins. GFP11 can also provide tissue specificity.</p><p>To maximize RIBOS signals, we found it necessary to introduce the <italic>rps-18(0)</italic> background and to saturate GFP11::RPS-18 with excess GFP1-10. The saturation could be achieved by using multi-copy GFP1-10 transgenes because we found that decreasing the copy number of integrated GFP1-10 transgenes did not change the intensity of RIBOS signals (data not shown). Given that <italic>rps-18</italic> is an abundant ribosomal protein, we expect that we should be able to saturate most GFP11-tagged endogenous proteins using multi-copy expression of GFP1-10. To further increase the signals, a tandem GFP11 tag might be used. This is a similar idea to the SunTag approach, in which fluorescently tagged antibodies recognize tandem peptide tags in a targeted protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tanenbaum et al., 2014</xref>). A tandem split GFP approach may have an advantage over SunTag because an excess amount of split GFP does not produce background, unlike fluorescently tagged antibodies. Recently, split GFP has been used as a versatile tool for endogenous protein visualization in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kamiyama et al., 2016</xref>). In multicellular organisms, it provides the additional advantage of tissue- or cell-specificity as demonstrated in this study. Thus, the split-GFP-based approach can be broadly applied to visualize any endogenous protein in specific cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dynamic and cell-specific ribosome localization</title><p>In non-neuronal tissues, ribosomes existed throughout the cytosol even in a fine structure like muscle arms. In contrast, ribosomes were mostly restricted in the soma in neurons. Moreover, neuronal ribosomes showed distinct localization, such as at the branch point of PLM mechanosensory neurons and at presynaptic terminals of motor neurons at the L1 stage animals. Moreover, we found that ribosome localization changed during development. These distribution patterns were different from other protein translation-related components, such as initiation factors and RNA granules. Together, our results suggest that neuronal ribosome localization is actively regulated.</p><p>Using electron microscopy, we have further demonstrated the presence of ribosomes at the presynaptic terminals of motor neurons in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In contrast to postsynapses and axons, the evidence of the existence of ribosomes at presynaptic terminals has been limited. However, some studies have shown the functional importance of local translation at presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaumont et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martin et al., 1997</xref>). In squid synaptosomal fractions and optic nerve endings, ribosomes have been observed by electron energy loss spectroscopic microscopy and conventional EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crispino et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martin et al., 1998</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic> ribosome-like black dots were occasionally observed in the presynaptic terminals in the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolls et al., 2002</xref>). Our study provided more definitive morphological evidence for the existence of ribosomes at mature presynaptic terminals by using electron tomography, in which three-dimensional morphologies are more clearly visualized than conventional EM studies. RIBOS markers only visualized ribosomes in the presynaptic terminals at the L1 stage but not at the adult stage, probably because the low density (a few ribosomes per synapse) was below the detection limit for a fluorescent protein.</p><p>Since a low abundance of ribosomes at presynaptic terminals could not be detected by RIBOS, the punctate signals observed along the mechanosensory axon were likely to be clusters of ribosomes. This cluster resembles the plaque-like ribosomes in the vertebrate axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koenig, 2009</xref>), suggesting that clustering of ribosomes may be a common feature throughout evolution. The ribosome puncta did not seem to be associated with transported vesicles because they were static over periods of a few minutes. However, ribosome distribution changed during development and after axon injury. This suggests that ribosome localization may rely on slow axonal transport, known to control the distribution of many cytoskeletal components and cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic> mechanosensory neurons, mRNA of a transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (<italic>cebp-1</italic>), is localized to the axon and locally translated in an axon-injury-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yan et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed RIBOS signals and monosomes in the electron micrographs after axon injury. Although monosomes have been thought to be translationally inactive, recent ribosome profiling data suggest that they can be active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heyer and Moore, 2016</xref>). In rat dentate gyrus, the number of the spines associated with polysomes increased several days after lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steward, 1983</xref>). Increased number of axonal ribosomes after injury is also shown in rat motor axons of ventral spinal roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2001</xref>) and sciatic nerve axons in the Wallerian degeneration slow mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Court et al., 2008</xref>). These studies highlight that the dynamic nature of ribosome distribution after nerve injury may be conserved throughout evolution.</p><p>In this study, we focused on RPS-18 as a representative protein for the ribosome function because we could rely on the rescue of the <italic>rps-18(0)</italic> mutant phenotypes as a proxy to assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of the functional protein. Recent work in mice has shown tissue-type heterogeneity of ribosome composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simsek et al., 2017</xref>). Rpl38 knock-out mice show tissue-specific patterning defects, due to selective reduction on translation of mRNAs for some Hox genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kondrashov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xue et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> not all ribosomes contain RPS-18, and therefore, that our approach may tag only a subset of ribosomes. Future studies will improve and extend the RIBOS approach to address this issue by systematically tagging different ribosomal proteins with GFP11 using CRISPR-based knock-in to endogenous locus of ribosome genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ribosomes distribution is regulated by <italic>unc-16</italic> and microtubules</title><p>Through candidate and forward genetic screens, we have identified UNC-16 and microtubules as regulators of ribosome distribution in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mechanosensory neurons.</p><p>UNC-16 is a member of the conserved JIP3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Byrd et al., 2001</xref>). These proteins act as an adaptor between cargos, for example mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) components, and kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koushika, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Whitmarsh, 2006</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>unc-16</italic> was originally isolated by its uncoordinated movement and later shown to display mislocalized synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Byrd et al., 2001</xref>). In cholinergic motor neurons, UNC-16 was found to restrict membranous organelles, such as Golgi and endosomes to cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edwards et al., 2013</xref>). Our data show that UNC-16 regulates distribution of a large molecular complex, ribosomes. In contrast to the increased axonal endosomes and Golgi in <italic>unc-16</italic> mutants, ribosomes were increased in the presynaptic terminals and decreased along the proximal axon. Since UNC-16 localizes to the proximal axon in mechanosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edwards et al., 2013</xref>), these results might imply that UNC-16 restricts the ribosomes into the soma at the proximal axon.</p><p>Although both ribosomes and microtubules are well characterized cellular components, the connection between them has not been well appreciated. Both EM studies and biochemical evidences show that ribosomes can interact with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suprenant, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suprenant et al., 1989</xref>). Microtubule disruption by nocodazole treatment makes ribosomes move into the neurites in chicken sensory neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baas et al., 1987</xref>). We observed ribosomes at the cutting site after axon injury. This might be because an altered state of microtubule after axon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chisholm, 2013</xref>) allowed ribosomes to move into the axon. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> mechanosensory neurons, the number of growing microtubules increases three hours after axon injury, followed by consistent microtubule growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012</xref>). We also observed fewer numbers of microtubules at the injury site by EM. Mitochondria observed at the cutting site may locally supply energy for translation and microtubule dynamics. These data are consistent with a hypothesis that microtubules restrict the ribosomes into the neuronal soma in unstressed conditions in mature neurons. We observed that ribosome distribution in the soma was also disrupted in the microtubule mutants. In neuronal soma, ribosomes are dynamically exchanged between two states: free in the cytosol or bound to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jan et al., 2014</xref>). This compartmentalized protein synthesis ensures the efficient targeting of transmembrane and secreted proteins to the ER. The balance between ER-bound and free ribosomes is important because in nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, ribosomes are mistargeted to the ER, resulting in disrupted protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gamerdinger et al., 2015</xref>).

Fifty nanometer-thick serial sections were cut with a diamond knife from anterior part of worm after posterior pharyngeal bulb with an ultramicrotome ULTRACUT UCT (Leica), collected onto pioloform coated slot grids and stained for 5 min in 70% methanol with 2.5% uranyl acetate, followed by washing for 3 min in Reynold’s lead citrate. Serial images from dorsal and ventral nerve cords were collected with a digital camera with 2688×2672 pixel resolution (Gatan) and DigitalMicrograph acquisition software (Gatan) on a transmission electron microscope JEOL-1200 EX (JEOL) at magnification of 10,000 × at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. All digital images were imported into the series with Reconstruct 3D reconstruction software and realigned for accurate 3D measurements and visualizations. Ribosomes were defined as electron-dense objects with an approximately 20 nm diameter, which are not continuous on serial sections. Information about membranes, microtubules, mitochondria, and ribosomes, was created by manually tracing the profiles of the same objects on the serial image sections with Graphire3 Pen Tablet input hardware (Wacom). After tracing the profiles on the sections, the 3D scenes were rendered and saved as a 360-degree bitmap images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electron tomography</title><p>Resin blocks containing N2 young adult worms were prepared as described above. The 300–350 nm-thick sections from anterior part of worm were cut with a diamond knife and an ultramicrotome ULTRACUT UCT (Leica), collected onto copper folding mesh grids without a supporting film, and stained on both sides for 10 min in 70% methanol with 2.5% uranyl acetate, followed by washing for 5 min in Reynold’s lead citrate. Colloidal gold particles (15 nm in diameter) were deposited on both sides of the sections for 5 min to serve as fiducial cues. For stability in the beam, the sections were coated with carbon on both sides. Series of images from synapses in the ventral nerve cord were collected with a digital camera with 3488×3488 pixel-resolution (GATAN) and Serial EM acquisition software on an intermediate-voltage electron microscope JEOL-4000 EX (JEOL) at magnification of 25,000×at an accelerating voltage of 400 kV. To minimize shrinkage of the sections during the tilt series and reduce the effects of within-tilt-series variation on the subsequent back projection, the sections were pre-irradiated for 15 s at each tilt angle before image acquisition. Series of 61 images were acquired by rotating the sample from −60 to +60 degrees around an axis perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope in 2-degree increment with a computer-controlled goniometer. The grid was then rotated 90 degrees in plane and another tilt series was collected. Pixel size of the tilt series acquisition images was 0.607 nm per pixel. The tilt-series images were aligned using IMOD software. Then, IMOD or TxBR software was used to create the final alignments and back projections resulting in three-dimensional volumes (tomograms). The tomograms were opened in IMOD software and saved as snapshot images. Objects were traced by the same method as for serial reconstruction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Genetic screen and mapping</title><p>The forward genetic screens to look for ribosome distribution defects were carried out using P<italic>mec-4</italic>-RIBOS strain with <italic>glo-4</italic> mutant background (CZ19298), which was introduced for better visualization of the fluorescent signals for the screen by reducing gut autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hermann et al., 2005</xref>). After treating worms with 50 mM EMS using a standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brenner, 1974</xref>), one or four F<sub>1</sub> animals were transferred to individual plates. F<sub>2</sub> animals were mounted on slides using M9 and subjected to visual inspection under the Zeiss Axioplan 2 as described above. Eight mutant worms were recovered from 1400 haploid genomes.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Microtubule-dependent ribosome localization in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, Yishi Jin and colleagues introduce an elegant method to observe ribosome localization in vivo: RIBOS. In RIBOS, one GFP β-sheet is fused to a ribosomal protein subunit and complemented with the remainder of the split GFP, which is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The observed axonal localizations are validated using electron microscopic tomography. The authors demonstrate the usefulness of their approach by studying axon injury, which recruits ribosomes as expected, and by characterizing transport factors necessary for ribosomal localization in a small candidate screen, as well as an unbiased EMS screen. While the latter can certainly be enlarged – which would go beyond the scope of this paper – it clearly shows the power of the approach. Importantly, evidence of ribosome localization in axons of mature brain has been limited and therefore this manuscript indirectly strengthens the importance of axonal protein synthesis in matured axons. In addition, the authors provide evidence that microtubules might be important for the generation of a barrier in the proximal axon.</p><p>This is an original method that meets a demand for techniques to study ribosome localization in vivo. The experiments are carefully conducted and analyzed, and the Materials and methods section is detailed enough to allow other researchers to adopt RIBOS for their work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use only indirect methods to demonstrate that GFP11::RPS-18 is incorporated into ribosomes. A biochemical approach, such as polysome profiling, should be performed to answer this question more directly, and to determine how much (if any) GFP11::RPS-18 is or is not part of ribosomes, leading to false positive RIBOS signals.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors need to at least discuss one potential pitfall of the method: in the target cells, the investigated ribosomal protein is irreversibly reconstituted to contain a full GFP tag. The sterility of the GFP-tagged strain suggests that the fusion protein does not function for some special purposes. Therefore, it is possible that some (local?) translation is inhibited also by the reconstituted GFP fusion, or that ribosomal protein molecules that have been recruited to that particular function cannot be reconstituted with GFP, i.e., this special translation cannot be observed.</p><p>2) Ribosome composition is regulated developmentally and differs between tissues. Any method that relies on ribosomal protein tagging will necessarily only label a subset of ribosomes. An analysis of how many ribosomes in the studied <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons contain RPS-18 is needed to determine how representative for total -as opposed to RPS-18 containing- ribosome localization RIBOS is. The same issue should at least be discussed in relation to the reported developmental and injury induced changes in the axonal RIBOS signal.</p><p>3) Although differences in recovery times of the FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>/G) seem obvious, statistical analysis should be provided to assess those differences. Additionally, recovery curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref> should be plotted together to better appreciate the difference between rpS18 and eIF4E (IFE-2 and IFE-4) mobility. Finally, it needs to be discussed that the mobile fraction/phase is rather different between rpS18 and eIF4E.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, panels A and C show only one of the developmental stages analyzed. The authors should provide representative images of both larva and adult stages for comparison.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> there is an increase in RIBOS signal distal to the injury site at 12 h (pointed out with an arrow in 5). Is this the regrowing axon – the text states that the axons regrow only at 24h – or is it the severed distal part of the axon?</p><p>6) Statistical analysis for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B, D and F</xref> should be added.</p><p>7) The increase in co-localisation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> is not so evident. If the authors think this point is important (I think it can be deleted without any important loss for the paper), the% co-localization should be quantified.</p><p>8) The decrease in fluorescence intensity of the free RFP cannot be taken as an indication of reduced translation (subsection “A forward genetic screen identified roles for tubulins in ribosome distribution”, last paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). There are too many other factors influencing this read-out.

A biochemical approach, such as polysome profiling, should be performed to answer this question more directly, and to determine how much (if any) GFP11::RPS-18 is or is not part of ribosomes, leading to false positive RIBOS signals.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that our evidence for GFP11::RPS-18 incorporation into ribosomes is indirect. We had planned to perform polysome profiling and detect RPS-18 distribution by Western blotting. However, antibodies recognizing <italic>C. elegans</italic> RPS-18 are not available. We found two commercially advertised anti-human RPS-18 antibodies; unfortunately, the delivery of these antibodies was back ordered, and we received them only a week ago. At this moment, we do not yet know if these antibodies could be proven to have specificity for <italic>C. elegans</italic> RPS-18. Additionally, we are not aware of the feasibility of tissue-specific isolation of polysomes from <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Therefore, we cannot estimate the time required and outcome of the polysome profiling experiment.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, the authors need to at least discuss one potential pitfall of the method: in the target cells, the investigated ribosomal protein is irreversibly reconstituted to contain a full GFP tag.

It is possible that reconstituted GFP11::RPS-18 and GFP1-10 may not be fully functional. We revised text as suggested:</p><p>“Since the binding between GFP11 and GFP1-10 is irreversible, it is possible that the reconstituted GFP::RPS-18 is not fully functional in contexts where ribosome activity is locally required or sensitive to dosage.”</p><p><italic>2) Ribosome composition is regulated developmentally and differs between tissues. Any method that relies on ribosomal protein tagging will necessarily only label a subset of ribosomes. An analysis of how many ribosomes in the studied C. elegans neurons contain RPS-18 is needed to determine how representative for total -as opposed to RPS-18 containing- ribosome localization RIBOS is. The same issue should at least be discussed in relation to the reported developmental and injury induced changes in the axonal RIBOS signal.</italic> </p><p>We indeed thought about tissue- and developmental-dependency of ribosome composition when developing our method. We had surveyed the expression pattern for several ribosomal protein genes, such as <italic>rpl-1, rpl-12, rpl-14</italic>, and <italic>rpl-15</italic>; we found that like <italic>rps-18</italic> and <italic>rpl-29,</italic> these ribosome genes were ubiquitously expressed in all somatic tissues. These observations are consistent with published information on other ribosomal genes from RNAi knockdown studies. The apparent ubiquitous expression of GFP::RPS-18 and the lethal and sterile phenotypes of <italic>rps-18(0)</italic> mutants are indications that RPS-18 is likely to be a component of most, if not all, ribosomes. We agree that some types of ribosomes could contain specific proteins, or that some ribosomal proteins may only be essential in certain cell types. We believe that our present study provides a starting point for such issues to be addressed in vivo. In the revised manuscript, we have included following discussion:</p><p>“In this study, we focused on RPS-18 as a representative protein for the ribosome function because we could rely on the rescue of the rps-18(0) mutant phenotypes as a proxy to assess the in vivo activity of the functional protein. […] Future studies will improve and extend the RIBOS approach to address this issue by systematically tagging different ribosomal proteins with GFP11 using CRISPR-based knock-in to endogenous locus of ribosome genes.”.</p><p><italic>3) Although differences in recovery times of the FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>/G) seem obvious, statistical analysis should be provided to assess those differences. Additionally, recovery curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref> should be plotted together to better appreciate the difference between rpS18 and eIF4E (IFE-2 and IFE-4) mobility. Finally, it needs to be discussed that the mobile fraction/phase is rather different between rpS18 and eIF4E.</italic> </p><p>In the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, 1G and H</xref>, we combined previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref> as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, and provided the statistical analysis for the comparison of t<sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and mobile fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The figure legend and main text are revised accordingly.</p><p>“If GFP11::RPS-18 is incorporated into a large organelle or complex, such as the ribosome, the half time of fluorescence recovery (t<sub>1/2</sub>) should be larger and the mobile fraction should be smaller than those of a free cytosolic protein (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2001)”</p><p>“Photobleached GFP11::RPS-18 showed a longer recovery time and smaller mobile fraction than IFE-2::GFP and IFE-4::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F-1H</xref>). Furthermore, the recovery curve, t<sub>1/2</sub>, and mobile fraction of GFP11::RPS-18 were comparable to that of the ribosomal large subunit, RPL-29::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F-1H</xref>), suggesting that fluorescence recovery was not affected by splitting GFP, and that RPS-18 and RPL-29 were incorporated into a complex with a similar mobility, likely the ribosome.”.</p><p>Legends for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F, 1G</xref>, and 1H:</p><p>“(F) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was plotted for juEx5809[Pcol-19-IFE-2::GFP], <italic>juEx5811[Pcol-19-IFE-4::GFP],</italic> Pcol-19-RIBOS, and <italic>juSi123[RPL-29::GFP]; rpl-29(0)</italic>.

The authors should provide representative images of both larva and adult stages for comparison.</italic> </p><p>We have included an RIBOS image at the adult stage in panel B (previously panel C) for comparison. We did not include an L1 image to Panel A, because this panel is for comparing RIBOS and the negative control.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> there is an increase in RIBOS signal distal to the injury site at 12 h (pointed out with an arrow in 5). Is this the regrowing axon – the text states that the axons regrow only at 24h – or is it the severed distal part of the axon?</italic> </p><p>The arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is showing the tip of regrowing axon 12 hours after axotomy, which could be distinguished from the distal axon based on the z-plane. The regrowth starts about 6 h after injury. We clarified this point in the revised text.</p><p>“Around 6 hours after axotomy, microtubules are reorganized, leading to the formation of a growth cone, and severed axons start regrowing around the same time, resulting in average regrowth about ~100 µm after 24 hours (Chen et al., 2011; Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012).”</p><p>“We also observed weak RIBOS signals in the regrowing tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).”</p><p><italic>6) Statistical analysis for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B, D and F</xref> should be added.</italic> </p><p>We added statistical analyses using Fisher’s exact test in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7B and 7D</xref>.

If the authors think this point is important (I think it can be deleted without any important loss for the paper), the% co-localization should be quantified.</italic> </p><p><italic>8) The decrease in fluorescence intensity of the free RFP cannot be taken as an indication of reduced translation (subsection “A forward genetic screen identified roles for tubulins in ribosome distribution”, last paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). There are too many other factors influencing this read-out. Please revise the text accordingly.</italic> </p><p>We deleted the paragraph discussing preferential ribosome localization to the ER in the previous manuscript including <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, 7F</xref> and Figure 7—figure supplement 3). Our work does not attempt to address whether there is preferential localization of ribosomes in the ER, but focuses on a new method to visualize ribosomes in live animals. We consider possible ER localization in the revised Discussion.</p><p>“We observed that ribosome distribution in the soma was also disrupted in the microtubule mutants. […] Mislocalization of ribosomes in microtubule mutants may suggest that microtubules are components to prevent mistargeting ribosomes in the soma.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
