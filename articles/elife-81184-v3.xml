There is a critical need to find new multiple myeloma vulnerabilities and therapeutic avenues. Herein, we identified and explored a novel multiple myeloma target: the fatty acid binding protein (FABP) family. In our work, myeloma cells were treated with FABP inhibitors (BMS3094013 and SBFI-26) and examined in vivo and in vitro for cell cycle state, proliferation, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular metabolism (oxygen consumption rates and fatty acid oxidation), and DNA methylation properties. Myeloma cell responses to BMS309403, SBFI-26, or both, were also assessed with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and proteomic analysis, and confirmed with western blotting and qRT-PCR. Myeloma cell dependency on FABPs was assessed using the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap). Finally, MM patient datasets (CoMMpass and GEO) were mined for <italic>FABP</italic> expression correlations with clinical outcomes. We found that myeloma cells treated with FABPi or with <italic>FABP5</italic> knockout (generated via CRISPR/Cas9 editing) exhibited diminished proliferation, increased apoptosis, and metabolic changes in vitro. FABPi had mixed results in vivo, in two pre-clinical MM mouse models, suggesting optimization of in vivo delivery, dosing, or type of FABP inhibitors will be needed before clinical applicability. FABPi negatively impacted mitochondrial respiration and reduced expression of MYC and other key signaling pathways in MM cells in vitro. Clinical data demonstrated worse overall and progression-free survival in patients with high <italic>FABP5</italic> expression in tumor cells. Overall, this study establishes the FABP family as a potentially new target in multiple myeloma. In MM cells, FABPs have a multitude of actions and cellular roles that result in the support of myeloma progression. Further research into the FABP family in MM is warrented, especially into the effective translation of targeting these in vivo.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer for which only a few treatments are available. Currently, only about half the patients with multiple myeloma survive for five years after diagnosis. Because obesity is a risk factor for multiple myeloma, researchers have been studying how fat cells or fatty acids affect multiple myeloma tumor cells to identify new treatment targets.</p><p>Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are one promising target. The FABPs shuttle fatty acids and help cells communicate. Previous studies linked FABPs to some types of cancer, including another blood cancer called leukemia, and cancers of the prostate and breast. A recent study showed that patients with multiple myeloma, who have high levels of FABP5 in their tumors, have worse outcomes than patients with lower levels. But, so far, no one has studied the effects of inhibiting FABPs in multiple myeloma tumor cells or animals with multiple myeloma.</p><p>Farrell et al. show that blocking or eliminating FABPs kills myeloma tumor cells and slows their growth in a dish (in vitro) and in some laboratory mice. In the experiments, the researchers treated myeloma cells with drugs that inhibit FABPs or genetically engineered myeloma cells to lack FABPs. They also show that blocking FABPs reduces the activity of a protein called MYC, which promotes tumor cell survival in many types of cancer. It also changed the metabolism of the tumor cell. Finally, the team examined data collected from several sets of patients with multiple myeloma and found that patients with high FABP levels have more aggressive cancer.</p><p>The experiments lay the groundwork for more studies to determine if drugs or other therapies targeting FABPs could treat multiple myeloma. More research is needed to determine why inhibiting FABPs worked in some mice with multiple myeloma but not others, and whether FABP inhibitors might work better if combined with other cancer therapies. There were no signs that the drugs were toxic in mice, but more studies must prove they are safe and effective before testing the drugs in humans with multiple myeloma. Designing better or more potent FABP-blocking drugs may also lead to better animal study results.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myeloma</kwd><kwd>fatty acid binding protein</kwd><kwd>FABP</kwd><kwd>FABP5</kwd><kwd>RNA-Seq</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Myeloma</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31CA257695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Connor S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37CA245330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reagan</surname><given-names>Michaela R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R50CA265331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fairfield</surname><given-names>Heather</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103449</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dragon</surname><given-names>Julie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54GM115516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reagan</surname><given-names>Michaela R</given-names></name><name><surname>Fairfield</surname><given-names>Heather</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM121301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vary</surname><given-names>Calvin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-19-037-01-LIB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reagan</surname><given-names>Michaela R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRG-16-191-33</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reagan</surname><given-names>Michaela R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The fatty acid binding protein (FABP) family of proteins plays a role in multiple myeloma cell survival and disease progression in vitro and in silico, and thus blocking the FABPs could have anti-cancer effects and prove beneficial for myeloma patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fatty acid binding protein (FABP) family members are small (12–15 kDa) proteins that reversibly bind lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hotamisligil and Bernlohr, 2015</xref>).

MYC inhibition alone dramatically reduced cell numbers at 72 hr, as expected, and FABP inhibition had less of an effect on MM cells when MYC was already inhibited (seen by a slope of ~0 for the black lines) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). This suggests that much of the effect of FABPi is through decreased MYC signaling, although the strong effect of the MYC inhibitor makes this difficult to determine unhesitantly. Similar results were seen at 24 and 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>FABPi impair MM cell metabolism, mitochondrial function, and cell viability</title><p>Having observed effects of the inhibitors on metabolic processes such as mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation in the proteomic data, we next assessed mitochondrial function and metabolic changes using a Cell Mito Stress Test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After 24 hr treatments, all FABPi treatments decreased basal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and OCR dedicated to ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity were decreased with SBFI-26 and combination treatments, suggesting FABP inhibition reduces the ability of MM cells to meet their energetic demands.</p><p>To determine the effects of FABPi on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) specifically, we treated tumor cells with etoxomir, an FAO inhibitor, with or without the combination FABPi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The combination of FABPi alone again strongly reduced mitochondrial respiration in most of the parameters assessed. Interestingly, etoxomir treatment caused a slight, but significant reduction in OCR when it was administered, demonstrating some reliance of MM cells on FAO for mitochondrial respiration. However, the FABPi had a much greater effect on MM mitochondrial respiration than etoxomir alone, suggesting that FABPi treatment inhibited mitochondrial respiration through another mechanism. Also, since maximal respiration was decreased in the Etox +FABPi combination compared to FABPi alone, it appears that FABPi treatment does not completely block FAO when used alone. Overall, the data demonstrate that mitochondrial respiration is inhibited by FABPi. To assess whether metabolic dysfunction could be caused by damaged mitochondria, we utilized tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) staining and flow cytometric analysis to assess mitochondrial transmembrane potential. GFP<sup>+</sup>/Luc<sup>+</sup>MM.1S cells treated with BMS309403 or the combination (BMS309403 +SBFI-26) had decreased TMRE staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that BMS309403 damages MM cell mitochondria.</p><p>We next investigated if reactive oxygen species (ROS), a major byproduct of the electron transport chain, were changing in MM cells after FABPi treatment.

Targeting the FABP family may be a new, efficacious method to inhibit MM progression that necessitates further investigation. FABP inhibition induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of proliferation of numerous MM cell lines in vitro, while having negligible effects on non-MM cells. In vivo, FABP inhibition caused no weight loss or other overt toxicities, supporting similar findings in other pre-clinical oncology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Jameel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosquet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herroon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mukherjee et al., 2020</xref>). Further analysis and experiments are still needed (e.g. histological analysis of major organs and quantification of serum toxicity markers) before targeting FABPs can be translated to humans. Myeloma cell proliferation also decreased with genetic knockout of <italic>FABP5,</italic> although FABP signaling compensation may have occurred via upregulation of <italic>FABP6</italic>. Clinical datasets and DepMap analyses also demonstrated the importance of the FABPs, specifically <italic>FABP5,</italic> and perhaps <italic>FABP6,</italic> in MM. A recent publication also analyzed patient datasets and similarly found correlations between high FABP5 expression and worse MM patient survival, and between <italic>FABP5</italic> mRNA levels and different immune microenvironment properties, suggesting a role for FABP5 in immunomodulation, an important hypothesis that we have not yet further explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jia et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>FABP inhibition decreased expression of genes and pathways related to ER stress, XBP1, and the UPR. For example, <italic>EIF5B</italic> was downregulated by all FABPi in proteomic analysis and RNA-Seq. <italic>EIF5B</italic> is a translation initiation factor that promotes the binding of subunits and antagonizes cell cycle arrest via modulations of p21 and p27, and depletion of <italic>EIF5B</italic> could contribute to activation of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ross et al., 2019</xref>). eIF5B has been implicated as a oncoprotein that aids in managing ER stress and evading apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ross et al., 2019</xref>). Myeloma cells constitutively activate the UPR to protect themselves from ER stress-induced death that would otherwise result from the continuous production and secretion of immunoglobulins. Therefore, the inhibition of the protective UPR appears to be one mechanism by which FABP inhibition damages MM cells. We also observed decreased <italic>XBP1</italic> expression and decreased XBP1 pathway activation with FABPi. Based on studies demonstrating the IRE/XBP1 pathway is required for differentiation and survival of MM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">White-Gilbertson et al., 2013</xref>), this could be a driver of the decreased UPR and MM cell death resulting from FABPi.</p><p>Interestingly, decreased UPR and XBP1 signaling could result from decreased MYC expression directly, since MYC directly controls IRE1 transcription by binding to its promoter and enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). While others have shown that BMS309403 reduces UPR in skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosquet et al., 2018</xref>), this has not previously been shown in tumor cells before now. As a transcription factor, c-MYC can act as an activator or repressor through either direct binding to regulatory regions, or through chromatin modulation. A MYC activation signature is seen in 67% of MM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chng et al., 2011</xref>), and this signature influences the progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to MM. Targeting MYC in MM cells by knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2021</xref>) or treatment with a small molecule inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holien et al., 2012</xref>) induces cell death; however, the importance of MYC in many healthy cell types make targeting it difficult. Thus, our study represents a novel approach to reducing MYC by targeting the FABP family. This work also builds upon data that myeloma cells exhibit aberrant amino acid, lipid, and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Steiner et al., 2018</xref>), and data revealing the importance of metabolic enzymes in myeloma tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2021</xref>) and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lipchick et al., 2021</xref>) by demonstrating the role of FABPs in MM cell metabolism and mitochondrial integrity. In sum, we demonstrated that FABPs are a new protein family potentially important in MM.</p><p>Herein we demonstrated the pivotal role of FABPs in myeloma cell survival in vitro and in clinical datasets. However, in vivo results were mixed, and followup analysis needs to be performed before clinical work can be initiated, such as optimizing doses or delivery mechanisms and determing if any effects in vivo were due to the early drug administration (which could affect homing). More systemic analysis of mice, such as testing immune cell effects that could reduced efficacy of FABPi, is also needed since FABPi alter a plethora of phenotypes across the body, including glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosquet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shibue et al., 2015</xref>) – all of which have potential implications for myeloma disease progression. Demonstration of efficacy of FABPi on established MM tumors in vivo, as well as effects of FABPi on primary MM cells, which we were not able to obtain in our laboratory, must also preceed clinical translation. Lastly, an assessment of the FABPi effects on tumor cells in vivo (e.g. effects on proliferation markers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen or Ki67) or apoptosis) would be reveal in vivo effects of FABPi.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of FABPs result in reduced growth, decreased UPR and MYC signaling, decreased metabolism, and induction of apoptosis in myeloma cells in vitro.

Mice were randomized based on weight and body parameters, then treatments then began 3 X/week with either 5 mg/kg BMS309403, 1 mg/kg SBFI-26, the combination (5 mg/kg BMS309403 +1 mg/kg SBFI-26), or the vehicle (5% DMSO), intraperitoneally (n=12/group), based on safe doses reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Jameel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Body parameters were assessed with piximus at day 1 and 30. In a second cohort of SCID-Beige mice (n=10/group, randomized by weight), a near identical experimental schema was followed, except body parameters were not assessed. In a second animal model, 10–12 week old mice (both sexes, mixed equally between groups) of KaLwRij/C57Bl6 mice (from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) were injected with 1x10^6 GFP<sup>+</sup>/Luc<sup>+</sup> 5TGM1-TK cells IV by a blinded investigator, randomized by weight, and treated as in the SCID-Beige model with 5 mg/kg BMS309403 (n=9) or vehicle (n=8). Mice were frequently weighed and monitored for clinical signs of treatment-related side effects. “Survival endpoints” were mouse death or euthanasia as required by IACUC, based on body conditioning score including weight loss and impaired hind limb use. Survival differences were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methodology. For bioluminescent imaging, mice were injected with 150 mg/kg i.p. filter-sterilized D-luciferin substrate (VivoGlo, Promega) and imaged after 15 min in an IVIS Lumina LT (Perkin Elmer, Inc; Waltham, MA). Tail vein injector was blinded in all studies; BLI technician was blinded in second SCID-Beige study. Data were acquired and analyzed using LivingImage software 4.5.1. (PerkinElmer). Body parameters (BMD, BMC, Lean Mass, and Fat Mass) were measured with PIXImus duel-energy X-ray densitometer (GE Lunar, Boston, MA, USA). The PIXImus was calibrated daily with a mouse phantom provided by the manufacturer. Mice were anesthetized using 2% isoflurane via a nose cone and placed ventral side down with each limb and tail positioned away from the body. Full-body scans were obtained and DXA data were gathered and processed (Lunar PIXImus 2, version 2.1). BMD and BMC were calculated by extrapolating from a rectangular region of interest (ROI) drawn around one femur of each mouse, using the same ROI for every mouse, and lean and fat mass were also calculated for the entire mouse, exclusive of the head, using Lunar PIXImus 2.1 software default settings.

We have now completed the suggested experiment, a combination study of increasing doses of BMS309403 or SBFI-26 in the presence of a Myc inhibitor, 10058-F4. As now demonstrated in Figure 4E,F, FABP inhibitors are less effective in the presence of the Myc inhibitor. Thus, we have added a new Results section as follows:</p><p>“To test if MYC inhibition was a major cause of the FABPi effects on MM cells, we then pharmacologically inhibited MYC and tested a range of doses of FABPi. MYC inhibition alone dramatically reduced cell numbers at 72 hours, as expected, and FABP inhibition had less of an effect on MM cells when MYC was already inhibited (seen by a slope of ~0 for the black lines) (Figure 4E, F). This suggests that much of the effect of FABPi is through decreased MYC signaling, although the strong effect of the MYC inhibitor makes this difficult to determine unhesitantly. Similar results were seen at 24 and 48 hours (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>In addition, we investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in FABP inhibition. We found that inhibition of FABPs lead to an increase in ROS, especially superoxide, which we have now added to the manuscript as Figure 5A,B and in Supplementary files.</p><p>Although not in our manuscript, we would like to share the data, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, where we recovered the FABP inhibitor-driven increase in ROS with N-acteyl cysteine (NAC) using doses described in the literature for this type of work. However, NAC also elicited a strong anti-myeloma effect on its own so the combination did not rescue the apoptosis that was induced with the FABP inhibitors (data not shown). More studies will need to be conducted to examine if there is an antioxidant that rescues the ROS induction without adding to the apoptotic phenotype of FABP inhibition. At this point, we have not been able to prove or conclude that FABPi-induced ROS drive any of the phenotypes we observed in MM cells, and thus we have not written that as a mechanism in our manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81184-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It is important to have a good understanding of FABP expression, beyond RNASeq data.

To better understand FABP expression in myeloma cells and cells of similar lineage, we investigated both gene and protein expression levels of FABPs in the cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE). The Results section now includes our finding as follows “FABP5 consistently showed the expression in haematopoetic/lymphoid lineage lines within the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) at the gene level (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) and protein level (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) (“DepMap 22Q2 Public,” n.d.; Ghandi et al., 2019; Nusinow et al., 2020). In MM cell lines specifically, <italic>FABP5</italic> was the most highly expressed at the gene level (Figure 1B) and FABP5 and FABP6 were the most highly expressed at the protein level (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).” We also included CoMMpass patient data in Figure 8—figure supplement 1 that indicates FABP3, 4, 5, and 6 are expressed within myeloma patient cells. All data highlight FABP5 as the highest expressed FABP family member.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The mechanism is weak. While a detailed mechanistic study is beyond the scope of this study, a better understanding of FABP family expression both at baseline and in response to FABP inhibition is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their observation.</p><p>To better understand the expression of FABP family members at baseline, we utilized RNA-Seq and Mass Spectrometry proteomics from the Broad Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) to investigate gene and protein expression of the FABP family members in a large swath of malignant cells of similar lineage. We found that <italic>FABP5</italic> was the predominant FABP family member expressed, followed by <italic>FABP6</italic> in the RNA-Seq gene expression data from 215 cell lines of hematopoietic and lymphoid lineage (Figure 1 figure supplement 1B), 30 of which were myeloma cell lines specifically (Figure 1B). In addition, FABP5 and FABP6 were also consistently the highest proteins expressed in the CCLE proteomics dataset in cells of hematopoietic/lymphoid lineage (Figure 1 figure supplement 1C) and MM cells specifically (Figure 1 figure supplement 1D). We also included CoMMpass patient data (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A) that indicate FABP3, 4, 5, and 6 are expressed within myeloma patient cells. All data highlight FABP5 as the highest expressed FABP family member.</p><p>In addition, we investigated the level of expression for the individual family members with qRT-PCR (Figure 1 figure supplement 7C). We examined the relative expression of <italic>FABP3, 4, 5,</italic> and <italic>6</italic> with qPCR in MM.1S, RPMI-8226, and OPM-2 and found that <italic>FABP5</italic> was indeed the predominant family member expressed in our three human MM cell lines and determined that there was no significant effect on the expression of these family members after 24-hour treatment with 50 µM BMS309403, 50 µM SBFI-26, or the combination, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of FABP5 in MM cells does not induce compensation by other FABP family members, at least at this time point. Future studies should examine the expression of FABP family members in myeloma cells over time and in response to different microenvironments and treatments, since expression of <italic>FABP3, FABP4, FABP5, FABP6</italic> was detected in primary patient samples.</p><p>To test the mechanism of action of FABPi, we did the following. We generated Myc inhibitor, (10058-F4), plus FABP inhibitor cell response data in vitro that suggest that FABPs signal through the Myc pathway. We predicted that if Myc is indeed downstream of FABP signaling, as we expect from our RNA-Seq, proteomics, and western blot data, that when the Myc inhibitor (10058-F4) was combined with FABP inhibitors, there would be little to no additive or synergistic effect of the two drugs. However, if the inhibitors were working through different mechanisms, we would observe some synergistic or additive effect. In Figure 4E, we show that BMS309403 alone exerted a consistent and near linear decrease in MM.1S cell number as doses increased, consistent with our prior data demonstrating a 50% decrease in cell number with the 30 µM dose of BMS309403 relative to vehicle control, and an approximate 80% decrease in response to 50 µM. We observed a &gt;50% decrease in cell number when 10058-F4 was added to the cells alone (combined with vehicle), with a minimal effect of the addition of BMS309403 at the majority of doses. Similar effects were observed when SBFI-26 was added to 10058-F4 in Figure 4F. Additional data are provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. These data suggest that the effects of the Myc inhibitor are likely acting downstream of the FABP inhibitors.</p><p>We additionally explored reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. Inhibition of FABPs led to an increase in ROS, including superoxide specifically, (Figure 5A,B; Figure 5 supplement 4-6). We tried to reverse the increase in ROS using an antioxidant, to test the effects of ROS in MM cells, but the antioxidant, N-acteyl cysteine (NAC), was very toxic to the myeloma cells, so we were not able to state that ROS generation was a mechanism of FABP inhibitor effects on MM cells irrefutably.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Despite performing a very comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolic profile of myeloma cells treated with FABPi, the authors did not identify the mechanisms(s) responsible for the decreased cell number. Studies investigating the role of MYC- or UPR-related genes in the response to FAPBi would increase the significance of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers comment. Since our original submission, we have further tested the role of Myc in the response to FABP inhibition. In an additional cell line, we found that there was a trend towards a decrease in Myc protein level at 48h with combination treatment in 5TGM1-TK cells. In addition, we used a Myc inhibitor, 10058-F4, in combination with various doses of either BMS309-403 or SBFI-26 and found that there was no synergistic effect of the inhibitors, as we described to Review 2 above. Together, our data suggest that inhibition of Myc signaling is one mechanism of action of the FABP inhibitors.</p><p>In addition, we investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in FABP inhibition in multiple myeloma. Using three cell lines, MM1S, RPMI-8226, and U266, we investigated total ROS with CellROX, and superoxide, with MitoSOX over 72 hours of FABP inhibitor treatment. We were additionally able to rescue the induced ROS effect with N-acetyl cysteine, an antioxidant, but this did not inhibit apoptosis from occurring with FABP inhibitor treatment, as we described above to Reviewer 2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
