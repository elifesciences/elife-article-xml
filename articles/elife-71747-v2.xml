physically connected. It is not well understood how neuromodulatory systems accomplish these tasks. Here, we show that the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> NLP-12 neuropeptide system shapes responses to food availability by modulating the activity of head and body wall motor neurons through alternate G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) targets, CKR-1 and CKR-2. We show <italic>ckr-2</italic> deletion reduces body bend depth during movement under basal conditions. We demonstrate CKR-1 is a functional NLP-12 receptor and define its expression in the nervous system. In contrast to basal locomotion, biased CKR-1 GPCR stimulation of head motor neurons promotes turning during local searching. Deletion of <italic>ckr-1</italic> reduces head neuron activity and diminishes turning while specific <italic>ckr-1</italic> overexpression or head neuron activation promote turning. Thus, our studies suggest locomotor responses to changing food availability are regulated through conditional NLP-12 stimulation of head or body wall motor circuits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuropeptide</kwd><kwd>cholecystokinin</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>local search</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS093492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francis</surname><given-names>Michael M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>340318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beets</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Research Foundation Flanders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0C0618N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beets</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Investigation of neuromodulatory control of ethologically conserved area-restricted food search behavior shows that NLP-12 stimulation of the head motor circuit promotes food searching through the previously uncharacterized CKR-1 GPCR.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuromodulators serve critical roles in altering the functions of neurons to elicit alternate behavior. Disruptions in neuromodulatory transmitter systems are associated with a variety of behavioral and neuropsychiatric conditions, including eating disorders, anxiety, stress and mood disorders, depression, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailer and Kaye, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kormos and Gaszner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pomrenze et al., 2019</xref>). To achieve their effects, neuromodulatory systems may act broadly through projections across many brain regions or have circuit-specific actions, based on the GPCRs involved and their cellular expression. A single neuromodulator may therefore perform vastly different signaling functions across the circuits where it is released. For example, Neuropeptide Y (NPY) coordinates a variety of energy and feeding-related behaviors in mammals through circuit-specific mechanisms. NPY signaling may increase or decrease food intake depending upon the circuit and GPCR targets involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West and Roseberry, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Due to the varied actions of neuromodulators across cell types and neural circuits, it has remained challenging to define how specific neuromodulatory systems act in vivo to elicit alternate behaviors. Addressing this question in the mammalian brain is further complicated by the often widespread and complex projection patterns of neuromodulatory transmitter systems, and our still growing knowledge of brain connectivity.</p><p>The compact neural organization and robust genetics of invertebrate systems such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> are attractive features for studies of neuromodulatory function. Prior work has shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> NLP-12 neuropeptides are key modulatory signals in the control of behavioral adaptations to changing environmental conditions, such as food availability or oxygen abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hums et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oranth et al., 2018</xref>). The NLP-12 system is the closest relative of the mammalian Cholecystokinin (CCK) neuropeptide system and is highly conserved across flies, worms, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janssen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peeters et al., 2012</xref>). CCK is abundantly expressed in the mammalian brain; however, a clear understanding of the regulatory actions of CCK on the circuits where it is expressed is only now beginning to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballaz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee and Soltesz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishimura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 1980</xref>). Like mammals, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes two putative CCK-responsive G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (CKR-1 and CKR-2), though, prior to the present study, direct activation by NLP-12 peptides had only been demonstrated for the CKR-2 GPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frooninckx et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janssen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peeters et al., 2012</xref>). The experimental tractability of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, combined with the highly conserved nature of the NLP-12/CCK system, offers a complementary approach for uncovering circuit-level actions underlying neuropeptide modulation, in particular, NLP-12/CCK neuropeptide signaling.</p><p>Sudden decreases in food availability or environmental oxygen levels each evoke a characteristic behavioral response in <italic>C. elegans</italic> where animals limit their movement to a restricted area by increasing the frequency of trajectory changes (reorientations), a behavior known as local or area-restricted searching (ARS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hills et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hums et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oranth et al., 2018</xref>). ARS is a highly conserved adaptive behavior and is evident across diverse animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marques et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paiva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sommerfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weimerskirch et al., 2007</xref>). ARS responses during food searching in particular are rapid and transient. Trajectory changes increase within a few minutes after food removal, and decrease with prolonged removal from food (&gt;15–20 min) as animals transition to global searching (dispersal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calhoun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hills et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hums et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oranth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wakabayashi et al., 2004</xref>). The clearly discernible behavioral states during food searching present a highly tractable model for understanding the contributions of specific neuromodulatory systems. NLP-12 neuropeptide signaling promotes increases in body bending amplitude and turning during movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hums et al., 2016</xref>), motor adaptations that are particularly relevant for ARS. Notably, <italic>nlp-12</italic> is strongly expressed in only a single neuron, the interneuron DVA that has synaptic targets in the motor circuit and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White et al., 1997</xref>). Despite the restricted expression of <italic>nlp-12</italic>, there remains considerable uncertainty about the cellular targets of NLP-12 peptides and the circuit-level mechanisms by which NLP-12 modulation promotes its behavioral effects.</p><p>Here, we explore the GPCR and cellular targets involved in NLP-12 neuromodulation of local food searching. Our findings reveal a primary requirement for NLP-12 signaling onto SMD head motor neurons, mediated through the CKR-1 GPCR, for trajectory changes during local searching. In contrast, NLP-12 signaling through both CKR-1 and CKR-2 GPCRs contribute to NLP-12 regulation of basal locomotion, likely through signaling onto head and body wall motor neurons. Our results suggest a model where NLP-12 signaling acts through CKR-1 and CKR-2 to coordinate activity changes across head and body wall motor circuits during transitions between basal and adaptive motor states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NLP-12/CCK induced locomotor responses require functional CKR-1 signaling</title><p>To decipher mechanisms underlying NLP-12 regulation of local food searching, we sought to identify genes required for NLP-12-mediated locomotor changes, in particular, the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) responsible for NLP-12 signaling. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes closely related CKR-1 and CKR-2 (<underline>C</underline>holecysto<underline>k</underline>inin-like <underline>R</underline>eceptors 1 and 2) GPCRs with sequence homology to the mammalian Cholecystokinin receptors CCK-1 and CCK-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janssen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peeters et al., 2012</xref>). Prior work demonstrated that NLP-12 activates CKR-2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>). Further, genetic studies provided evidence that NLP-12 signaling mediates functional plasticity at cholinergic neuromuscular synapses through CKR-2 modulation of acetylcholine release from motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, however, deletion of <italic>ckr-2</italic> does not strongly affect local search behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>). As functional roles for the CKR-1 GPCR have not been previously described, we sought to determine whether CKR-1 may be acting either alone or in combination with CKR-2 to direct NLP-12 regulation of local searching. We first isolated a full-length <italic>ckr-1</italic> cDNA identical to the predicted <italic>ckr-1</italic> sequence. As expected, we found the <italic>ckr-1</italic> locus encodes a predicted protein containing seven transmembrane domains and sharing strong similarity to the CCK-like GPCR family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To define potential roles for CKR-1 and CKR-2 in local searching, we took advantage of a strain we had previously generated that stably expresses high levels of the NLP-12 precursor [<italic>nlp-12</italic>(OE)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>nlp-12</italic> in this manner elicits exaggerated loopy movement, increased trajectory changes, and enhanced body bend amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Figure 6C, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The average amplitude of bending is increased approximately threefold in comparison to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and body bends are more broadly distributed over steeper angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). These overexpression effects are constitutive, offering experimental advantages for pursuing genetic strategies to identify signaling mechanisms. We investigated the requirement for CKR-1 and CKR-2 in the locomotor changes elicited by <italic>nlp-12</italic> overexpression using available strains carrying independent deletions in each of these genes. The <italic>ckr-2</italic> deletion (<italic>tm3082</italic>) has been characterized previously and likely represents a null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peeters et al., 2012</xref>). The <italic>ckr-1</italic> deletion (<italic>ok2502</italic>) removes 1289 base pairs, including exons 3–7 that encode predicted transmembrane domains 2–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>) and therefore also likely represents a null allele. <italic>ckr-1</italic> and <italic>ckr-2</italic> single gene deletions each partially reversed the effects of <italic>nlp-12</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,D</xref>, 6C), indicating that both CKR-1 and CKR-2 GPCRs are active under conditions when NLP-12 peptides are present at high levels. Notably, <italic>ckr-1</italic> deletion showed slightly greater suppression of <italic>nlp-12(OE</italic>) phenotypes compared with <italic>ckr-2</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>, 6C). Combined deletion of <italic>ckr-1</italic> and <italic>ckr-2</italic> largely reversed the locomotor changes produced by NLP-12 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B,D</xref>, 6C), indicating that the GPCRs act in a partially redundant manner. Our genetic analysis of <italic>nlp-12</italic> overexpression confirms a role for the CKR-2 GPCR in NLP-12-elicited motor adaptations, and importantly, provides first evidence implicating the previously uncharacterized CKR-1 GPCR in NLP-12 modulation of motor activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NLP-12/CCK induced locomotor responses require functional <italic>ckr-1</italic> signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative movement trajectories of wild-type (black), <italic>nlp-12(OE</italic>) (red), <italic>nlp-12(OE);ckr-1(lf</italic>) (blue), <italic>nlp-12(OE);ckr-2(lf</italic>) (orange), and <italic>nlp-12(OE);ckr-1(lf);ckr-2(lf</italic>) (green) animals during forward runs (30 s) on NGM agar plates seeded with OP50 bacteria. <italic>nlp-12(OE</italic>) refers to the transgenic strain (<italic>ufIs104</italic>) stably expressing high levels of wild-type <italic>nlp-12</italic> genomic sequence.

Specifically, we monitored worm movement during a 35-min period immediately after removal from food and quantified turning behavior during the first (0–5, local searching, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) and last (30–35, dispersal, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) five minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Post hoc video analysis proved most reliable for measuring turning behavior during local searching. We quantified changes in trajectory (reorientations), that resulted in a change of &gt;50° in the direction of movement, executed either through forward turns or reversal-coupled omega turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For wild type, we noted an increase in reorientations immediately following removal from food compared to animals maintained on food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>), we found that deletion of <italic>nlp-12</italic> significantly decreased reorientations immediately following removal from food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). In particular, we noted a significant reduction in the forward reorientations of <italic>nlp-12</italic> mutants, but no appreciable effect on reversal-coupled omega turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Deletion of <italic>ckr-2</italic> produced no appreciable effect on reorientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>); however, single deletion of <italic>ckr-1</italic> decreased reorientations to a similar level as observed for <italic>nlp-12</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). Similar to <italic>nlp-12(lf</italic>), we found that <italic>ckr-1(lf</italic>) significantly impacted forward reorientations, but did not affect reversal-coupled omega turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Combined deletion of <italic>ckr-1</italic> and <italic>ckr-2</italic> provided no additional decrease beyond that observed for single <italic>ckr-1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). In addition, combined deletion of <italic>nlp-12</italic> and <italic>ckr-1</italic> did not further decrease reorientations compared with either of the single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>).

Single <italic>ckr-1</italic> deletion or combined <italic>ckr-1</italic> and <italic>ckr-2</italic> deletion also abrogated DVA-elicited increases in reorientation behavior, while single <italic>ckr-2</italic> deletion produced more variable responses that were not clearly distinguishable from control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Our photostimulation experiments provide direct evidence that NLP-12 release from the DVA neuron promotes reorientation behavior, and, in addition, provide evidence for central involvement of NLP-12 signaling through the CKR-1 GPCR in directing reorientations. While NLP-12 expression has also been recently reported in PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tao et al., 2019</xref>), expression of <italic>nlp-12</italic> under a PVD specific promoter (<italic>ser-2prom3</italic>) did not restore reorientations in <italic>nlp-12(lf</italic>) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>), pointing toward DVA as the primary source of NLP-12 in promoting reorientations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Elevated CKR-1 signaling enhances turning and body bending in an <italic>Nlp-12</italic> dependent manner</title><p>To further define the role of CKR-1, we next asked whether increased CKR-1 signaling would be sufficient to induce local search-like behavior.

The amplitude of body bends during movement also increased by approximately threefold in <italic>ckr-1</italic>(OE) animals compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These increases in bending angles and body bend depth were returned to wild-type levels by <italic>nlp-12</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), offering support that NLP-12 peptides are the major CKR-1 ligands required to elicit these characteristic changes in movement.

We focused our analysis on body bending amplitude because this was the most easily quantifiable aspect of movement to be modified by <italic>ckr-1</italic> overexpression. Transgenic strains where pan-neuronally expressed <italic>ckr-1</italic> (<italic>rgef-1</italic> promoter) was injected at high concentration displayed increased body bending amplitude, similar to overexpression using the native promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Surprisingly, <italic>ckr-1</italic> overexpression in cholinergic (<italic>unc-17β</italic> promoter) or GABAergic (<italic>unc-47</italic> promoter) ventral nerve cord motor neurons did not elicit an appreciable change in body bend depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

In contrast, <italic>ckr-1</italic> overexpression in GABAergic neurons, including RMED and RMEV (<italic>unc-47</italic> promoter), did not produce an appreciable effect. Likewise, <italic>ckr-1</italic> overexpression in RIV, RIG, NSM, AIA, AIB, or amphid neurons failed to significantly enhance body bend depth.

Here, we show that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NLP-12 neuropeptide system, closely related to the CCK system in mammals, shapes adaptive behavior through modulation of motor circuits dedicated to control of either head or body wall musculature. We demonstrate that NLP-12 modulation of these circuits occurs through distinct GPCRs, CKR-1 and CKR-2, that primarily act on either head or body wall motor neurons, respectively. Under basal conditions, we suggest that NLP-12 modulation of the body wall motor circuit predominates, influencing the depth of body bends during sinusoidal movement through CKR-1 and CKR-2 GPCRs located on body wall motor neurons. NLP-12 activation of head motor neurons through CKR-1 becomes predominant in the absence of food, promoting reorientations. We propose that changes in food availability reconfigure functional connectivity in the NLP-12 system by differentially engaging GPCRs across the head and body wall motor circuits. Intriguingly, the involvement of two GPCRs in nematode NLP-12 signaling is reminiscent of the organization of the CCK system in rodents, which relies on signaling through CCK1 and CCK2 GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janssen et al., 2009</xref>).

Our findings may point toward similar utilization of specific CCK-responsive GPCRs to coordinate activity across mammalian brain circuits.</p><p>NLP-12 neuropeptides act as key modulators in a range of <italic>C. elegans</italic> behaviors. Local search responses to varying oxygen levels and decreased food availability both involve NLP-12 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hums et al., 2016</xref>).

However, the mechanisms by which NLP-12 peptides exert their influence over these diverse behavioral responses have remained unclear. Our work addresses these mechanistic questions by defining roles for CKR-1 and CKR-2 GPCRs during basal locomotion and ARS. ARS is a complex motor behavior, involving rapid trajectory changes that serve to maintain the animal within a restricted area of their immediate environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calhoun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hums et al., 2016</xref>). Reorientations during searching are produced through high angle forward turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broekmans et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999</xref>) and reversal-coupled omega turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 2005</xref>). We previously demonstrated a requirement for NLP-12 in promoting reorientations during local searching. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>). Our analysis here shows that loss of <italic>nlp-12</italic> also has modest effects on body posture during normal exploratory movement, indicating NLP-12 regulation of motor targets under basal conditions. Intriguingly, the behavioral requirement for NLP-12 is far more apparent during local searching compared with basal locomotion, suggesting enhanced involvement of NLP-12 signaling for performance of local searching. Similar observations about NLP-12 involvement in chemotactic responses to varying oxygen levels suggested a model for graded NLP-12 regulation of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hums et al., 2016</xref>). Based on our observations, we speculate that increased engagement of head motor neurons through CKR-1 activation may be a generalizable mechanism for dynamic NLP-12 regulation of behavior over changing external conditions.</p><p>Prior studies had implicated the CKR-2 GPCR in NLP-12 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janssen et al., 2008</xref>), but roles for CKR-1 had not been previously described. Our genetic analyses and heterologous expression studies firmly establish CKR-1 as a functional target for NLP-12 signaling with an activation profile similar to CKR-2. CKR-2 shows slightly broader expression compared with CKR-1, but both GPCRs are expressed across a variety of neuron classes, including many that do not receive direct synaptic inputs from DVA. We noted very little overlap in CKR-1 and CKR-2 expression, consistent with the idea that the two GPCRs serve distinct roles in modulating behavior. NLP-12 activation of CKR-2 stimulates neurotransmission through coupling with <italic>egl-30</italic> (G<sub>αq</sub>) and <italic>egl-8</italic> (PLCβ) likely by DAG interaction with the synaptic vesicle priming factor UNC-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). Given the sequence homology between CKR-1 and CKR-2, it seems likely that CKR-1 also functions to positively regulate neuronal activity through <italic>egl-30</italic>. In support of this idea, we found that SMD-specific CKR-1 overexpression and SMD neuron photostimulation produced qualitatively similar behavioral effects. The DVA neuron makes a single synapse with SMDVL (Worm wiring). While it is possible that this single synapse accounts for NLP-12 elicited behavioral changes during local searching, it seems likely that extrasynaptic signaling to other SMD neurons also contributes.</p><p>Prior studies have indicated SMDs are cholinergic and their stimulation is sufficient to produce Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in head/neck muscles, consistent with proposed roles in head bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2016</xref>). Prior studies of worms immobilized using microfluidic chips and freely moving animals noted anti-phasic activity between SMDD and SMDV neurons and opposing head/neck musculature during head bending (or head casting) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yeon et al., 2018</xref>). Our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging studies did not offer sufficient cellular resolution to directly address this point. However, combined with our silencing, photostimulation and CKR-1 overexpression experiments, our SMD Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging provides strong evidence that NLP-12 activation of CKR-1 modulates functional connectivity between SMD neurons and their partners. Physiological regulation of SMD activity is complex and involves reciprocal connections with RIA interneurons, reciprocal signaling with RME motor neurons, as well as proprioceptive feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ouellette et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yeon et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, inhibitory signaling from the GABAergic RME neurons onto the SMDs is implicated in modulation of head bending amplitude to optimize head bends for forward movement. While the precise role of NLP-12 modulation of SMD activity remains unclear, one intriguing possibility is that NLP-12-elicited increases in SMD activity uncouple the SMDs from RME inhibitory regulation, perhaps promoting large amplitude head swings that couple to forward reorientations during searching. We propose that elevated SMD activity is permissive for reorientations to occur, perhaps acting in concert with SMD proprioceptive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yeon et al., 2018</xref>) or other neurons implicated in the regulation of head movement and turning, such as SMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oranth et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, selective <italic>ckr-1</italic> overexpression using the <italic>odr-2(16</italic>) or <italic>flp-22∆4</italic> promoters increased body bend depth, raising the question of how altered SMD activity might translate into increased body bending. Recent work suggests an interesting functional coupling between the activity of SMD neurons and ventral cord B-type motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2020</xref>). B-type motor neurons are suggested to act as a distributed central pattern generator for the propagation of body bends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). CKR-1 activation of SMDs may therefore influence body depth directly by altering body wall motor neuron excitability through a gap junction connection between VB1 and SMDVR or through neuromuscular synapses located in the sub-lateral processes.</p><p>The similar potency of NLP-12 peptides for activating CKR-1 and CKR-2, suggests that differential contributions of these GPCRs during basal locomotion and search responses do not arise due to dramatic differences in NLP-12 potency to activate each receptor. This raises important questions about how a bias toward CKR-1 modulation of the head motor circuit during local searching may occur. We envision that NLP-12 regulation of the SMD neurons acts in parallel with other neural pathways previously shown to promote reversals during local searching. For example, olfactory information about food availability is conveyed by sensory neurons such as AWC and ASK to premotor interneurons (AIA, AIB, AIY) and ultimately transformed into patterns of motor neuron activity that drive reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hills et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ouellette et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>). The SMD neurons also receive synaptic information from this circuit (e.g., through synaptic connections from the AIB and RIM neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">White et al., 1997</xref>), raising the possibility that a pathway activated by food removal may enhance SMD sensitivity to CKR-1 activation. In this case, SMD neurons may be a site for integration of information encoding reversals and forward reorientations during local searching. A shift to CKR-1 modulation of head neurons during searching could also be triggered by dopaminergic stimulation of DVA. Prior work implicated dopaminergic signaling from PDE neurons in the regulation of NLP-12 and motor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oranth et al., 2018</xref>). In this case, elevated levels of NLP-12 secretion, perhaps from release sites in the nerve ring region, would be predicted to bias the system toward enhanced activation of the SMD neurons and elicit increased turning. Notably, PDE also regulates an antagonistic peptidergic circuit, mediated by FLP-1 neuropeptides, through inhibitory connections with AVK interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oranth et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting potentially more distributed behavioral regulation.</p><p>Our studies of the nematode NLP-12 system offer new mechanistic insights into neuropeptide modulation of behavior. Our findings provide a key first step in defining roles for two NLP-12-responsive GPCRs in coordinating motor control across changing conditions. We propose that the NLP-12 system conditionally engages GPCRs expressed in head or body motor neurons to modify specific features of locomotion, most notably reorientations during searching and body bend depth during basal locomotion. Brain CCK has been increasingly implicated as a key regulator in diverse aspects of behavior, including feeding, satiety, memory, nociception, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballaz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandra and Liddle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liddle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyasaka and Funakoshi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lajtha and Lim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rehfeld, 2017</xref>).

After 1 min, animals were repicked without bacteria and transferred to an unseeded behavior assay plate. Digital movies were captured over the first 5 min (local search) and after 30 min (dispersal) following removal from food. Reorientations were manually scored post hoc from monitoring movement direction, over sequential frames (~200 frames for forward reorientations, ~ 600 frames for reversal-coupled omega turns) from the start of the reorientation (original trajectory) to when the animal completed the reorientation (new trajectory) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A forward reorientation was scored after animals moved a minimum of 3 s (~100 frames @30 fps) along a new trajectory.

Trajectory changes where animals initially performed head bends &gt;50°, but then resumed the original path of movement or altered immediate trajectory &lt;50° were not scored as reorientations. Trajectory changes were quantified (in degrees) using the angle tool (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health) to measure the angle between the original and new trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Animals were allowed to acclimate for 30 s prior to tracking. Movement features were extracted from 5 min of continuous locomotion tracking (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). Worm tracker software version 2.0.3.1, created by Eviatar Yemini and Tadas Jucikas (Schafer lab, MRC, Cambridge, UK), was used to analyze movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yemini et al., 2013</xref>). Worms were segmented into head, neck, midbody, hips, and tail. The body bend angle is angle measured at the midbody vertex, between the neck and hip skeleton vertices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Head bend angles were measured as the largest bend angle prior to returning to a straight, unbent position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Absolute midbody bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and head bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) angles were quantified. Single worm tracking affords higher resolution and allows for rich quantification of relatively subtle postural changes. However, the continuous tracking of animals was difficult to achieve using this approach during the numerous steep turns performed during ARS, or with NLP-12 or CKR-1 overexpression. Post hoc analysis of videos to measure body bending (as described above) proved most reliable.</p><media id="video9" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-71747-video9.mp4"><label>Video 9.</label><caption><title>Representative 20-s video showing single worm tracking of wild-type animal during basal locomotion on food to analyze body bending and head bending.</title><p>Video has been sped up 4×.</p></caption></media></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>SMD ablation</title><p>Conditions for cell ablation by miniSOG activation were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu and Chisholm, 2016</xref>.

Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) at 60–80% confluency and grown overnight at 37°C. After 24 hr, they were shifted to 28°C overnight. On the day of the assay, transfected cells were collected in bovine serum albumin (BSA) medium (DMEM/F12 without phenol red with L-glutamine and 15 mM HEPES, Gibco, supplemented with 0.1% BSA), at a density of 5 million cells per ml, and loaded with 5 µM coelenterazine h (Invitrogen) for 4 hr at room temperature. Compound plates containing synthetic peptides in DMEM/BSA were placed in a MicroBeta LumiJet luminometer (PerkinElmer). After loading, the transfected cells were added at a density of 25,000 cells/well, and luminescence was measured for 30 s at a wavelength of 469 nm. After 30 s, 0.1% triton X-100 (Merck) was added to lyse the cells, resulting in a maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> response that was measured for 30 s.

Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the reviewers find your work very interesting and acknowledge its importance in understanding the role of cholecystokinin signaling in differentially controlling aspects of locomotion behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we think that in its current form it lacks further mechanistic insights into how ckr-1 signaling controls SMD activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Ramachandran et al. provide a <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavioral genetics study focused on the worm cholecystokinin-like neuropeptide-receptor system. They show that nlp-12 neuropeptides released from the DVA neuron fulfil a dual role in controlling body posture as well as head-bending mediated area restricted search (ARS). Previous work showed that DVA controls body posture via nlp-12 signaling to ckr-2 receptor in ventral cord motor neurons. Moreover, nlp-12 signaling was implicated in ARS; but the exact circuit mechanisms and targets of nlp-12 remained elusive. The present work shows in a pretty straight forward way that ckr-1 in SMD head motor neurons is the missing link. In worms, ARS is composed of quiet complex body movements including high angle turns during the worm's forward crawling state. Nlp-12 and ckr-1 mutants show reduced head bending during ARS, while overexpression leads to a stark ectopic ARS like behavior. The authors convincingly show that SMDs are the site of action for ckr-1 and implicated in ARS. They show both requirement and sufficiency of SMDs for ARS like behaviors. The regulation of ARS vs. dispersive behaviors has been extensively studied at the levels of sensory and interneurons in the worm, but how the switch is implemented at motor circuits was largely unknown. Conceptually, this is one of only few studies investigating the selective control of head versus body movements and provides some interesting insights into the underlying mechanisms; therefore, the study is definitely important and timely. But it is unclear still how upper sensory circuits transmit the switch between ARS and dispersal to the DVA-SMD circuit. Moreover, the present study does not investigate the signaling pathway of ckr-1 in SMDs and its role in controlling neuronal activity, e.g. via Ca++ imaging. As a sole behavioral genetics study, however, I find the manuscript quite complete. The experiments logically built upon another, and the paper is well written. My only major critique is that parts of the behavioral analyses are described with insufficient detail so that it is unclear to the expert how and what exact movements were quantified. This should be addressed by providing more detailed figure captions, methods sections, more supplemental figures and movies.</p><p>1) The authors should exclude (or separate) reversal states and post-reversal turns in their analyses when measuring head bending, body bending and turn events, but it is unclear if they did so.</p><p>2) Figure 1C and methods: it is unclear what defines a singular bending event as marked on the y-axis. Did the authors measure the maximum angle during each half-oscillation? If yes, this should be explained and how maxima were calculated etc. Or do the histograms represent all values from all recording frames. In the latter case, the y-axis labelling is misleading, and I suggest use &quot;fraction of frames&quot;.</p><p>3) Figure 1C: these are averaged histograms of n=10-12 worms, but what is the average number of events per worm and in total?</p><p>4) Figure 1B-C, 2A etc.: to perform the measurements as depicted in upper panels is not really trivial, and I have the impression that the authors used their software packages in a black-box manner. What are the exact image processing steps to implement these measurements, i.e. how was vertex and sides of the angles exactly positioned? The authors should provide time-series of individual examples alongside with movies demonstrating how accurately the pipeline performs during complex ARS postures.</p><p>5) Figure 2B: the angles and body segments describing the head and head-bending angels should be unambiguously defined. The cartoon in 2B looks like they just measured nose movements.</p><p>6) Figure 3B: reorientation events are not sufficiently defined here. During ARS, worms frequently switch between forward-backward movement, perform post-reversal turns and in a continuous manner exhibit curved trajectories. From a trajectory like the red one in 3A, it is again not trivial to identify and discretize individual turning events with a start and an end and distinguish them from reversals and post reversal turns.</p><p>– The procedure needs to be explained in greater details with justification of parameter choice.</p><p>– How did the authors validate that the procedure performed well, especially during the complex ARS behaviors?</p><p>– Again, example trajectories and movies should be shown.</p><p>7) All histogram panels lack statistics, e.g. KS test or appropriate alternatives.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Ramachandran et al. report the discovery of a <italic>C. elegans</italic> GPCR – CKR-1 – that mediates some of the effects of the cholecystokinin-like neuropeptide NLP-12 on posture and foraging behavior. The discovery of this receptor permits further study of this neuropeptide signaling system, which is conserved from worms to vertebrates. Although CKR-1 is expressed in many neurons, the authors show that its function in SMD head-motorneurons is especially important for control of posture and foraging. The manuscript's strengths include: (1) rigorous characterization of receptor-ligand interactions in vitro, using a cell-based assay for GPCR activation, and in vivo, using genetic analysis, (2) compelling data in support of a model in which NLP-12 regulates SMD neurons to control foraging, and (3) high-resolution analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> posture during foraging, which illustrates the complexity and richness of this behavior, and (4) the circuit model, i.e. a role for SMDs, is tested using a number of independent methods and clearly indicated. The manuscript does have some weaknesses. In addition to specific technical points listed below, the manuscript discussed neuropeptides derived from a single source, the DVA pre-motor neuron, acting on distinct targets via distinct receptors in a conditional manner. This interesting model is suggested by the title and the abstract and comes up plainly in the introduction and discussion. However, the model is not clearly supported by the data, which primarily focus on the characterization of CKR-1 as a relevant receptor for NLP-12 peptides. Another weakness in the manuscript arises from the authors' switching between various assays for posture during locomotion, which makes it difficult for the reader to compare data between figures. Rich kymography data are relegated to supplementary figures, and data from only a subset of relevant genotypes are shown as kymographs. The manuscript would be strengthened by more uniform analysis of posture and foraging. Finally, while the data clearly show that effects of NLP-12 on posture and foraging require SMD neurons, the manuscript does not investigate how NLP-12 affects SMD activity. The manuscript would be strengthened by experiments showing a functional connection between DVA and SMD neurons, e.g. functional imaging of SMDs during optogenetic manipulation of DVAs.</p><p>1. One premise of the work is that DVA neurons are the sole source in vivo of NLP-12 peptides. A recent study (Tao et al. 2019, Dev. Cell) shows that there is an alternate source of NLP-12, the PVD nociceptors. The authors should address the possibility that their assays also detect a contribution of PVD neurons to posture/foraging.</p><p>2. The text associated with Figure 1B-C is tentative with respect to assigning redundant functions to CKR-1 and CKR-2. Why? The data are clear; these receptors function redundantly.</p><p>3. The very nice in vitro analysis of NLP-12 receptors should include negative controls. Ideally, the authors would use a scrambled neuropeptide or a related neuropeptide to demonstrate specificity of the interactions between NLP-12 and CKR-1/2.</p><p>4. The different 'bending angles' used in Figures 1 and 2 make it difficult to compare data between figures. Also, the schematics used to explain the bending angles have small fonts and are hard to read.</p><p>5. Figure 3E shows the results of a nice experiment in which optogenetic activation of NLP-12-expressing cells – presumably DVA – causes reorientations. The authors assert that this effect requires CKR-1 but not CKR-2. The data, however, suggest that CKR-2 might have an effect. The variance of the data does not allow the authors to reject a null hypothesis, but they err in then assuming that this means that CKR-2 plays no role in the phenomenon. This experiment should be repeated to determine whether there is indeed a specific or privileged role for CKR-1 in mediating NLP-12-dependent reorientations.</p><p>6. Also, Figure 3E should show raw data – don't show proportional changes – and all Figure 3 should be scatter plots allowing the reader to assess the variance of the data.</p><p>7. The authors show that effects of receptor overexpression are suppressed by loss of NLP-12 peptides. Is there precedent for this kind of genetic interaction in the literature?</p><p>8. Also, the authors, assert that suppression of effects of CKR-1 overexpression by loss of NLP-12 shows that NLP-12 peptides are the sole ligands for this receptor (page 9, line 17). It is not clear why the authors reach this conclusion.</p><p>9. There are some very nice data that are assigned to supplementary figures but might be better placed in main figures. Figure S3A-B shows data that are integral to the authors' model and could be presented in a main figure. Also, the localization of NLP-12::Venus in DVA axons near SMD processes would be appropriate to show in a main figure. It would be ideal to mark SMDs with a red fluor so that NLP-12::Venus colocalization with SMD processes could be assessed.</p><p>10. The kymography data are nice but incomplete. The authors should show kymographs from strains of all relevant genotypes. This would include: (1) ckr-1(oe); nlp-12, (2) nlp-12, ckr-1, and ckr-2 single mutants, and (3) ckr-1; ckr-2 double mutants.</p><p>11. Page 12, last paragraph indicates that 'low levels' of expression rescue ckr-1 phenotype – how has the expression level been determined? I guess that the authors refer to the amount of DNA used for transgenesis, not a direct measure of transgene expression – this should be reworded.</p><p>12. The manuscript would be strengthened by experiments that measured the effect of DVA activation on SMD physiology and what contribution NLP-12 signaling makes to any functional connection between these neurons. One potential impact of this work is that it establishes a nice paradigm for new molecular genetic analyses of neuropeptide signaling. Direct observation of the effects of NLP-12 peptides on SMD neuron physiology would further strengthen the authors' conclusions and suggest mechanisms by which CKR-1 regulates cell physiology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Ramachandran and colleagues describe how cholecystokinin-related NLP-12 neuropeptide signalling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> can regulate two different behavioural programmes, area-restricted search (ARS) and basal locomotion, by conditionally engaging different specific receptors that are expressed in different neuronal targets. They thoroughly characterise the CKR-1 receptor which had not been described previously, and place its function in context with that of the previously known NLP-12 receptor CKR-2. The manuscript gives new insight into an interesting and likely conserved mechanisms of how neuromodulatory systems enable adaptive behaviour by coordinating the action of neural circuits even when they are not directly connected. The conclusions drawn appear solid and are justified by the data presented, and the experimental approaches and results are well documented.</p><p>The main problem with the work is a certain lack of clarity regarding the separation of the roles of the CKR-1 and CKR-2 receptors on basal locomotion/body bending and head bending/reorientations. Overexpression of NLP-12 places animals in a chronic ARS state, as described in a previous publication. Is the NLP-12 overexpression model representative of the increased reorientation in area restricted search, or of control of undulations in basal locomotion, or both? If it is primarily representative of area restricted search, this would mean that CKR-2, similarly to CKR-1, mediates the chronic ARS state induced by NLP-12 overexpression, because in Figure 1B and C its mutation causes a reduction in the phenotype, and deletion of both ckr-1 and ckr-2 causes a stronger reduction.</p><p>Also, it is unconvincing that SMD neurons do not express ckr-2 (see S3D); no comparison of ckr-1 and ckr-2 expression levels in SMD is provided and in fact the CeNGEN data of single cell RNAseq of <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons shows similar expression of both receptors in SMDD (accessible at cengen.shinyapps.io/SCeNGEA). On the other hand, loss of ckr-2 on its own does not cause a significant reduction in ARS (Figure 3A).</p><p>To clarify this, the authors could measure the reorientation rate in the nlp-12OE ckr-2 mutant strain.</p><p>Given that ckr-1 overexpression as shown in Figures4-6 increases both body bending amplitude and ARS-like high reorientation rate, the authors offer the interesting possibility that SMD may also affect basal locomotion. I would suggest an experiment that clarifies whether SMD also controls body bending in basal locomotion using the single-worm tracking assay shown in Figure 2A with the SMD-specific ckr-1 rescue strains in a ckr-1 mutant background (as used in figure 7). Also they could measure body bending in the existing data on the SMD::Chrimson optogenetics.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is of high quality and significant interest and warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, once those points have been addressed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A conserved neuropeptide system links head and body motor circuits to enable adaptive behavior&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Ronald Calabrese (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers are very excited about your work and the improvements made in your revision. However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. As outlined below, the major concern of reviewers #1-2 with respect to SMD Ca++ imaging and the minor points of reviewer #3 should be addressed. We assume that this would not require new experiments but further in-depth analysis of the recordings, which should be all feasible in a short time frame.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have fully addressed my review comments to the previous submission.</p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors provide SMD Ca++ imaging experiment, which require further clarifications:</p><p>1) SMD activity in crawling worms has been reported previously by several labs, and all studies found consistently activity related to head-bending (Hendricks et al., 2012; Kaplan et al., 2020; Yeon et al., 2018). From the activity profiles shown in Figure 5, it is not possible to evaluate whether these data can be reproduced by the authors. If movie S9 is representative for these recordings, then SMD activity profiles should relate to head-bending. The fluctuations in Figure 5E rather appear as noise to me. I find it essential that the authors annotate behaviour in these recordings (forward crawling, backward crawling, head bending) and analyse the relationship between SMD activity and locomotion. If any discrepancies to the literature remain, this and possible explanations should be discussed.</p><p>2) Despite the concerns above, I find it surprising and interesting that the authors observe different perhaps baseline ratio values in 0-5min vs 30-35min off-food conditions. How this relates to the different behavioral phenotypes, incorporating our knowledge about SMD physiology remains to be discussed in more detail.</p><p>Hendricks, M., Ha, H., Maffey, N., and Zhang, Y.

This is an interesting experiment that shows clear evidence for CKR-1 in regulation of SMDs. It is not clear why the authors only show data from 3 individuals in panel E of Figure 7; panel F indicates that there are many more individuals that were assayed.

Although CKR-1 is expressed in many neurons, the authors show that its function in SMD head-motorneurons is especially important for control of posture and foraging.</p><p>The manuscript's strengths include: (1) rigorous characterization of receptor-ligand interactions in vitro, using a cell-based assay for GPCR activation, and in vivo, using genetic analysis, (2) compelling data in support of a model in which NLP-12 regulates SMD neurons to control foraging, and (3) high-resolution analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> posture during foraging, which illustrates the complexity and richness of this behavior, and (4) the circuit model, i.e. a role for SMDs, is tested using a number of independent methods and clearly indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript does have some weaknesses. In addition to specific technical points listed below, the manuscript discussed neuropeptides derived from a single source, the DVA pre-motor neuron, acting on distinct targets via distinct receptors in a conditional manner. This interesting model is suggested by the title and the abstract and comes up plainly in the introduction and discussion. However, the model is not clearly supported by the data, which primarily focus on the characterization of CKR-1 as a relevant receptor for NLP-12 peptides.</p></disp-quote><p>We aim to understand how NLP-12 signaling regulates motor transitions that are characteristic features of both local food searching and oxygen chemotaxis. We demonstrate that NLP-12 can activate 2 GPCRs, CKR-1 and CKR-2. Roles for CKR-2 in regulation of body wall motor neuron activity have been demonstrated previously (Hu et al., 2011), but <italic>ckr-2</italic> deletion has little effect on local searching behavior. We therefore focused our efforts on understanding whether CKR-1 may be a primary target of NLP-12 to promote local searching. Our deletion, rescue, overexpression, cell ablation, photostimulation, silencing and calcium imaging experiments support a model where NLP-12 activates CKR-1 expressed in the SMDs to promote searching. We show that CKR-1 and CKR-2 have largely nonoverlapping expression, suggesting they may be differentially utilized to promote alternate behavioral outcomes. Consistent with this, we are able to assign a functional role for CKR-2 solely during basal locomotion. As prior studies have demonstrated CKR-2 function in body wall motor neurons, we did not pursue this aspect further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another weakness in the manuscript arises from the authors' switching between various assays for posture during locomotion, which makes it difficult for the reader to compare data between figures. Rich kymography data are relegated to supplementary figures, and data from only a subset of relevant genotypes are shown as kymographs. The manuscript would be strengthened by more uniform analysis of posture and foraging.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not making this more clear in the initial submission. The single worm tracking used for analysis of basal locomotion in Figure 2 affords higher resolution and allows for rich quantification of relatively subtle postural changes. However, we were not able to continuously track animals during the numerous steep turns performed during ARS or with NLP-12 or CKR1 overexpression using this approach (the head and tail were often misassigned during deep bends). Hence, we switched to recording videos of behaving animals, and performing post hoc analysis of bending angles with Wormlab (MBF Biosciences). This approach did not offer the same resolution but proved more robust for analyzing deeper body bends. We measure the body bending angle at the midbody vertex in both analyses. While we made every effort to keep these angle measurements consistent across platforms, we acknowledge the measured angles differ somewhat. We now include discussion of these points in both the Methods and Results. See also response to point 4 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, while the data clearly show that effects of NLP-12 on posture and foraging require SMD neurons, the manuscript does not investigate how NLP-12 affects SMD activity. The manuscript would be strengthened by experiments showing a functional connection between DVA and SMD neurons, e.g. functional imaging of SMDs during optogenetic manipulation of DVAs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added calcium imaging (Figure 7E-F) and SMD silencing (Figure 7D) experiments to address the reviewer’s comments. Details below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. One premise of the work is that DVA neurons are the sole source in vivo of NLP-12 peptides. A recent study (Tao et al. 2019, Dev. Cell) shows that there is an alternate source of NLP-12, the PVD nociceptors. The authors should address the possibility that their assays also detect a contribution of PVD neurons to posture/foraging.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We now include additional data showing that PVD-specific expression of <italic>nlp-12</italic> does not rescue reorientations during ARS (0-5 minutes off food) [Figure S5C]. We also note that recent CeNGEN single cell RNAseq data show high levels of <italic>nlp-12</italic> transcript in DVA and by comparison very low levels in PVD, consistent with our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The text associated with Figure 1B-C is tentative with respect to assigning redundant functions to CKR-1 and CKR-2. Why? The data are clear; these receptors function redundantly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The very nice in vitro analysis of NLP-12 receptors should include negative controls. Ideally, the authors would use a scrambled neuropeptide or a related neuropeptide to demonstrate specificity of the interactions between NLP-12 and CKR-1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include empty vector negative controls [Figure S2]. Additionally, we note that no other peptides from the synthetic library of roughly 350 peptides significantly activated either CKR-1 or CKR-2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The different 'bending angles' used in Figures 1 and 2 make it difficult to compare data between figures. Also, the schematics used to explain the bending angles have small fonts and are hard to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the size of the schematics and increased the font size. The single worm tracking used in Figure 2 affords higher resolution and allows for rich quantification of postural changes during basal locomotion. However, we were unable to continuously track animals during the numerous steep turns performed during ARS or with NLP-12 or CKR-1 overexpression using this approach (the head and tail were often misassigned during deep bends). Conversely, we were unable to reliably detect and quantify the comparatively subtle effects of <italic>nlp-12</italic>, <italic>ckr-1</italic> and <italic>ckr-2</italic> deletion during basal locomotion using Wormlab. The major difference between the two analyses is that the single worm tracker divides the animal into 5 segments (head, neck, midbody, hip, tail). The body bend angle was measured at the midbody vertex, between the neck and hip skeleton vertices. The Wormlab bending angles were measured as the supplement of the angle between the head, midbody and tail vertices. We now include expanded discussion of these points in the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 3E shows the results of a nice experiment in which optogenetic activation of NLP-12-expressing cells – presumably DVA – causes reorientations. The authors assert that this effect requires CKR-1 but not CKR-2. The data, however, suggest that CKR-2 might have an effect. The variance of the data does not allow the authors to reject a null hypothesis, but they err in then assuming that this means that CKR-2 plays no role in the phenomenon. This experiment should be repeated to determine whether there is indeed a specific or privileged role for CKR-1 in mediating NLP-12-dependent reorientations.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified Figure 3E to display to a scatterplot of the data and modified the text to more clearly describe the variability in <italic>ckr-2</italic> mutant responses to DVA photostimulation. <italic>ckr-1</italic> deletion led to a clear reduction in DVA-stimulated reorientations, leading us to primarily focus on the requirement for CKR-1. The critical importance of CKR-1 for generating reorientations is further supported by our additional behavioral, overexpression and calcium imaging results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Also, Figure 3E should show raw data – don't show proportional changes – and all Figure 3 should be scatter plots allowing the reader to assess the variance of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified Figure 3E to show scatter plot, all figures are now scatter plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors show that effects of receptor overexpression are suppressed by loss of NLP-12 peptides. Is there precedent for this kind of genetic interaction in the literature?</p></disp-quote><p>We have noted several previous examples in the literature where the effects of receptor overexpression are suppressed by loss of the ligand. For example, exaggerated body bend posture produced FRPR-4 overexpression is suppressed by <italic>flp-13(lf)</italic> (Nelson et al., 2015). Similarly, hyperactive egg-laying produced by overexpression of the SER-1 serotonin receptor is suppressed by loss of serotonin (<italic>tph-1</italic> mutation) (Fernandez et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Also, the authors, assert that suppression of effects of CKR-1 overexpression by loss of NLP-12 shows that NLP-12 peptides are the sole ligands for this receptor (page 9, line 17). It is not clear why the authors reach this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to indicate NLP-12 is likely to be the major ligand responsible for CKR-1 activation. <italic>nlp-12</italic> deletion suppresses the behavioral effects of <italic>ckr-1</italic> overexpression, indicating that other endogenous peptides cannot effectively substitute for NLP-12 in eliciting the behavioral changes. This conclusion is further supported by our in vitro studies showing that NLP-12 peptides are the only peptides in the library that significantly activate CKR-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. There are some very nice data that are assigned to supplementary figures but might be better placed in main figures. Figure S3A-B shows data that are integral to the authors' model and could be presented in a main figure. Also, the localization of NLP-12::Venus in DVA axons near SMD processes would be appropriate to show in a main figure. It would be ideal to mark SMDs with a red fluor so that NLP-12::Venus colocalization with SMD processes could be assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we added images to main Figure 5 showing NLP-12::Venus localization in proximity to SMD processes in the nerve ring. For space and clarity, we felt that S3A-B (Figure S6A-B in revised manuscript) should remain supplemental.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The kymography data are nice but incomplete. The authors should show kymographs from strains of all relevant genotypes. This would include: (1) ckr-1(oe); nlp-12, (2) nlp-12, ckr-1, and ckr-2 single mutants, and (3) ckr-1; ckr-2 double mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional kymographs as requested, and moved the kymographs into main figures. Kymographs of movement during ARS are now shown in Figure 3. Kymographs of movement elicited by overexpression are now shown in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Page 12, last paragraph indicates that 'low levels' of expression rescue ckr-1 phenotype – how has the expression level been determined? I guess that the authors refer to the amount of DNA used for transgenesis, not a direct measure of transgene expression – this should be reworded.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The manuscript would be strengthened by experiments that measured the effect of DVA activation on SMD physiology and what contribution NLP-12 signaling makes to any functional connection between these neurons. One potential impact of this work is that it establishes a nice paradigm for new molecular genetic analyses of neuropeptide signaling. Direct observation of the effects of NLP-12 peptides on SMD neuron physiology would further strengthen the authors' conclusions and suggest mechanisms by which CKR-1 regulates cell physiology.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried the experiment suggested by the reviewer. We stimulated DVA in hydrogel immobilized transgenic animals expressing DVA::Chrimson::SL2::BFP and SMD::GCaMP6s::SL2::mCherry, but were unable to detect clear SMD calcium transients that were timed with DVA stimulation. The failure to detect a synaptic response may be due to the immobilized preparation or may reflect limited synaptic connectivity between DVA and SMDs–a single synapse between DVA and SMDVL. We envision that NLP-12 activation of the SMDs occurs primarily through volume transmission which would act over a longer time scale and be quite difficult to measure with this approach. To address the reviewer’s comment, we also performed calcium imaging of SMD activity in behaving animals (Figure 7E-F) during ARS. We found that SMD activity is elevated in ARS compared with dispersal. Deletion of <italic>ckr-1</italic> decreases SMD activity during ARS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Ramachandran and colleagues describe how cholecystokinin-related NLP-12 neuropeptide signalling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> can regulate two different behavioural programmes, area-restricted search (ARS) and basal locomotion, by conditionally engaging different specific receptors that are expressed in different neuronal targets. They thoroughly characterise the CKR-1 receptor which had not been described previously, and place its function in context with that of the previously known NLP-12 receptor CKR-2. The manuscript gives new insight into an interesting and likely conserved mechanisms of how neuromodulatory systems enable adaptive behaviour by coordinating the action of neural circuits even when they are not directly connected. The conclusions drawn appear solid and are justified by the data presented, and the experimental approaches and results are well documented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main problem with the work is a certain lack of clarity regarding the separation of the roles of the CKR-1 and CKR-2 receptors on basal locomotion/body bending and head bending/reorientations. Overexpression of NLP-12 places animals in a chronic ARS state, as described in a previous publication. Is the NLP-12 overexpression model representative of the increased reorientation in area restricted search, or of control of undulations in basal locomotion, or both? If it is primarily representative of area restricted search, this would mean that CKR-2, similarly to CKR-1, mediates the chronic ARS state induced by NLP-12 overexpression, because in Figure 1B and C its mutation causes a reduction in the phenotype, and deletion of both ckr-1 and ckr-2 causes a stronger reduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We used NLP-12 overexpression as a sensitive way to identify potential receptors. After implicating specific receptors through genetic suppression of peptide overexpression, we pursued behavioral studies of deletion mutants to assess specific contributions of CKR-1 versus CKR-2. NLP-12 overexpression produces behavioral effects that are qualitatively similar to ARS, but more severe. However, we are hesitant to assign further significance to interpretation of behaviors arising from peptide overexpression since they likely reflect high, non-physiological levels of NLP-12 peptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is unconvincing that SMD neurons do not express ckr-2 (see S3D); no comparison of ckr-1 and ckr-2 expression levels in SMD is provided and in fact the CeNGEN data of single cell RNAseq of <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons shows similar expression of both receptors in SMDD (accessible at cengen.shinyapps.io/SCeNGEA). On the other hand, loss of ckr-2 on its own does not cause a significant reduction in ARS (Figure 3A).</p><p>To clarify this, the authors could measure the reorientation rate in the nlp-12OE ckr-2 mutant strain.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not describing our findings more clearly. We noted weaker and more variable expression of <italic>ckr-2</italic> in the SMD neurons. Variable <italic>ckr-2</italic> expression was restricted to the SMDDs, and was not observed in the SMDVs. We noted more consistent expression of <italic>ckr-1</italic> across both SMDDs and SMDVs. We have now clarified this in the revised manuscript. The CeNGEN data do not distinguish SMDV expression. To strengthen our conclusions, we attempted rescue of <italic>ckr-1(lf);ckr-2(lf)</italic> double mutants with wild type <italic>ckr-1</italic> or <italic>ckr-2</italic>. We found that expression using the <italic>ckr-1</italic>, but not <italic>ckr-2</italic>, provided for rescue [Figure S5A].

We also now show representative tracks for the <italic>nlp-12OE;ckr-1</italic> and <italic>nlp-12OE;ckr-2</italic> mutant strains (Figure 1A), demonstrating that turning remains elevated in these animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that ckr-1 overexpression as shown in Figures4-6 increases both body bending amplitude and ARS-like high reorientation rate, the authors offer the interesting possibility that SMD may also affect basal locomotion. I would suggest an experiment that clarifies whether SMD also controls body bending in basal locomotion using the single-worm tracking assay shown in Figure 2A with the SMD-specific ckr-1 rescue strains in a ckr-1 mutant background (as used in figure 7). Also they could measure body bending in the existing data on the SMD::Chrimson optogenetics.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we measured body bending in response to SMD photostimulation and found that SMD depolarization leads to a modest increase in body bend amplitude [Figure S8E].

However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. As outlined below, the concern of reviewers #1-2 with respect to SMD Ca++ imaging. We assume that this would not require new experiments but further in-depth analysis of the recordings, which should be all feasible in a short time frame.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have fully addressed my review comments to the previous submission.</p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors provide SMD Ca++ imaging experiment, which require further clarifications:</p><p>1) SMD activity in crawling worms has been reported previously by several labs, and all studies found consistently activity related to head-bending (Hendricks et al., 2012; Kaplan et al., 2020; Yeon et al., 2018). From the activity profiles shown in Figure 5, it is not possible to evaluate whether these data can be reproduced by the authors. If movie S9 is representative for these recordings, then SMD activity profiles should relate to head-bending. The fluctuations in Figure 5E rather appear as noise to me. I find it essential that the authors annotate behaviour in these recordings (forward crawling, backward crawling, head bending) and analyse the relationship between SMD activity and locomotion. If any discrepancies to the literature remain, this and possible explanations should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. We now show heat maps for all recordings and include behavioral annotations immediately below the heat map for each recording (Figure 8A-C). In addition, we now show that reorientation frequency is correlated with average GCaMP fluorescence intensity in the SMDs during local searching (Figure 8D). However, there was not a strong correlation between peak SMD fluorescence and episodes of forward or backward movement, or reorientations. This may be in part attributable to the way we performed our experiments. We measured combined fluorescence of SMDD and SMDV neurons that themselves have distinct patterns of activation. Notably, Kaplan et al. (2020) also found that SMDD and SMDV activity were not strictly correlated with either forward or reverse command states and instead varied according to locomotor state, consistent with our observations. Our work demonstrates that NLP-12 signaling through CKR-1 promotes a state of heightened SMD activity. Based on our observations, we propose that this state of elevated SMD activity is permissive for performing forward reorientations during ARS.</p><p>As noted by the reviewer, prior studies of worms immobilized using microfluidic chips (Hendricks 2012, Shen 2016) and freely moving animals (Yeon 2018, Kaplan 2020) have noted anti-phasic activity between SMDD and SMDV neurons and opposing head/neck musculature during head bending (or head casting). Our studies do not directly address this point. We monitored the combined fluorescence of SMD neurons over longer timescales at lower magnification, offering a view of the summed SMD neuronal activity during ARS and dispersal behaviors. The lower magnification used in our studies simplified measurements from animals freely moving over large areas but limited cellular resolution. Nonetheless, to address the reviewer’s question, we attempted to distinguish the fluorescence of SMDD and SMDV neurons in our recordings; however, we did not feel we could with confidence extract this information. We now include additional discussion of these points in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Despite the concerns above, I find it surprising and interesting that the authors observe different perhaps baseline ratio values in 0-5min vs 30-35min off-food conditions.

Prior studies have indicated the SMDs are cholinergic, and their stimulation is sufficient to produce ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in head/neck muscles, consistent with proposed roles in head bending. However, physiological regulation of SMD activity is complex and involves reciprocal connections with RIA interneurons, reciprocal signaling with RME motor neurons, as well as proprioceptive feedback. In particular, inhibitory signaling from the GABAergic RME neurons onto the SMDs is implicated in modulation of head bending amplitude to optimize head bends for forward movement. While the precise role of NLP-12 modulation of SMD activity remains unclear, one intriguing possibility is that NLP12-elicited increases in SMD activity uncouple the SMDs from RME inhibitory regulation, perhaps promoting large amplitude head swings that couple to forward reorientations during searching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The revised manuscript of Ramachandran, Francis and colleagues addresses many of the questions raised during the initial round of review. I have only one comment. The authors include new data reporting SMD activity during area-restricted search and dispersal. This is an interesting experiment that shows clear evidence for CKR-1 in regulation of SMDs. It is not clear why the authors only show data from 3 individuals in panel E of Figure 7; panel F indicates that there are many more individuals that were assayed. I suggest that the authors show data from all the individuals in panel E.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
