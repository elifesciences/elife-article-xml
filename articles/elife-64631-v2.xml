complex cellular processes. However, the elucidation of protein interactions occurring within highly specialised cells and tissues is challenging. Here, we describe the development, and application, of a new method for proximity-dependent biotin labelling in whole zebrafish. Using a conditionally stabilised GFP-binding nanobody to target a biotin ligase to GFP-labelled proteins of interest, we show tissue-specific proteomic profiling using existing GFP-tagged transgenic zebrafish lines. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach, termed BLITZ (Biotin Labelling In Tagged Zebrafish), in diverse cell types such as neurons and vascular endothelial cells. We applied this methodology to identify interactors of caveolar coat protein, cavins, in skeletal muscle. Using this system, we defined specific interaction networks within in vivo muscle cells for the closely related but functionally distinct Cavin4 and Cavin1 proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>in vivo proteomics</kwd><kwd>BioID</kwd><kwd>GFP-binding nanobody</kwd><kwd>proximity-dependent biotin labelling</kwd><kwd>cavins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>569542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parton</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1045092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parton</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1044041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parton</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1099251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parton</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP200102559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parton</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CE140100036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parton</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BLITZ system enables proximity-dependent biotin labelling in live zebrafish embryos with cell and tissue specificity, providing a versatile and valuable tool for proteomic discovery using the zebrafish model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The understanding of the biological functions of a protein requires detailed knowledge of the molecules with which it interacts. However, robust elucidation of interacting proteins, including not only strong direct protein-protein interactions, but also weak, transient or indirect interactions is challenging. Proximity-dependent biotin labelling (BioID) using genetically engineered biotin ligases has emerged as a novel approach for studying protein-protein interactions and the subcellular proteome in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>). When fused to a protein of interest (POI) and expressed in cells, the promiscuous biotin ligases covalently attach biotin to all proteins within a 10 nm radius, which can be subsequently isolated by streptavidin purification and identified by mass spectrometry. Compared with traditional affinity purification with protein-specific antibodies or affinity purification tags, the BioID method has the advantage of being able to capture weak and transient interactions. In addition, unlike conventional methods such as affinity purification, where stringent extraction conditions may disrupt protein-protein interactions, the BioID method does not require proteins to be isolated in their native state. Therefore, harsh protein extraction and stringent wash conditions can be applied, which can improve solubilisation of membrane proteins and reduce false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">VarnaitÄ and MacNeill, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gingras et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The BioID method has been widely applied in cell biology to study protein-protein interactions in cultured cells, providing valuable information for building protein interaction networks. However, the reductionist in vitro applications described to date, while powerful in their own right, lack the complexity and context to address phenomena that can only be modelled in vivo, for example the differentiation of specialised cell types such as those found in muscle, the nervous system, and vasculature. The most recent generation of biotin ligases has been applied in vivo in invertebrate models; flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) and worms (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) as well as plants (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mair et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Until now, however, the applicability of BioID has been limited by the necessity to genetically tag each POI directly with a biotin ligase and generate transgenic organisms. Here, we describe a more versatile approach to the in vivo application of BioID in a vertebrate model organism, the zebrafish. Instead of directly fusing the biotin ligase to a POI, we developed a modular system for GFP-directed proteomic mapping by combining BioID with a GFP-binding nanobody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rothbauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariotti et al., 2015a</xref>). This system couples the power of the BioID system with the ability to use existing GFP-tagged transgenic zebrafish lines for proteomic mapping between different tissues and/or different proteins. We demonstrate the application of this system in screening for proteins associated with the caveolar cast proteins, Cavin1 and Cavin4, in differentiated skeletal muscle which has, to date, been difficult to achieve in culture. These analyses reveal proteins and pathways that are both overlapping and specific to Cavin1 and Cavin4.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proximity biotinylation in live zebrafish embryos</title><p>We first tested the ability of a number of biotin ligases to catalyse protein biotinylation in live zebrafish embryos. Initial attempts using BirA* or BioID2 biotin ligases in vivo in zebrafish were unsuccessful and resulted in no detectable biotinylation in zebrafish embryos as assessed by streptavidin western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In recent years, the new bioID biotin ligases, BASU, TurboID, and miniTurbo, have been developed and showed greatly improved catalytic efficiency and enhanced proximity labelling in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore tested their ability to catalyse protein biotinylation in live zebrafish embryos. Untagged, cytoplasmically localised biotin ligases were transiently expressed in zebrafish embryos by RNA injection, and the level of protein biotinylation was assessed using streptavidin immunoblot analysis (experimental regimen illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). The biotin ligases were fused to an EGFP tag for selection of transgene expressing embryos, and a Myc tag for detection by western blot. At 24 hr post injection, the GFP-positive embryos were dechorionated before incubation in biotin-supplemented media for a further 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Total protein extracts from fish embryos were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and streptavidin immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). TurboID injected embryos exhibited the strongest biotinylation of endogenous proteins among the three new biotin ligases with 500 Î¼M biotin incubation. Of note, BASU and miniTurbo were expressed at a lower level than TurboID despite equal amount of RNA injection. While we did not explore the underlying reasons for this, greater instability of miniTurbo has been reported previously and other biotin ligases have shown poor expression in cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">May et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we chose TurboID for all subsequent experiments. Note the two prominent bands consistently detected around 70 and 135 kDa in all samples likely represent endogenously biotinylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Housley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Testing and optimising biotin ligases: BASU, TurboID, and miniTurbo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic overview of the workflow.

The mosaic expression of TurboID-GFP in the muscle fibres, as well as expression in the yolk, corresponded with strong NeutrAvidin staining. The mRNA injections frequently gave rise to differing levels of expression between individual muscle cells within the same animal. Therefore, muscle fibres with little or no TurboID-GFP expression served as an internal negative control.</p><p>Biotin concentration and incubation time are two crucial factors that affect biotin ligase efficiency in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>). To achieve the most effective experimental conditions for TurboID application in zebrafish, we sought to optimise these parameters. From our initial experiments with BirA*, we knew that zebrafish embryos are able to tolerate a biotin concentration as high as 800 Î¼M with no obvious morphological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). To determine the optimal biotin concentration for TurboID in zebrafish, TurboID-expressing embryos were incubated in embryo medium containing biotin concentration ranging from 0 to 750 Î¼M for 18 hr, followed by lysis and streptavidin immunoblotting. Weak labelling could be seen with 50 Î¼M biotin, increasing through 250 Î¼M, with the strongest labelling at concentration of 500 and 750 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Unlike its application in cultured cells and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>), TurboID did not produce detectable exogenous biotinylation without the addition of biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This provides the opportunity for temporal resolution by addition of exogenous biotin at specific developmental stages. Unexpectedly, the anti-Myc immunoblot showed that a higher biotin concentration resulted in more TurboID in the total protein extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Concomitantly, the addition of exogenous biotin did not change the level of endogenous biotinylated proteins in the WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cell culture, a 10-min biotin incubation with TurboID is sufficient to visualise biotinylated proteins by immunoblotting and to perform analysis of different organellar proteomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). However, we did not observe rapid biotinylation in zebrafish within the first 2 hr of biotin incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). TurboID-induced biotin labelling was only weakly detected after 4â6 hr incubation and adequate biotinylation was only detected after overnight incubation (18 hr).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vivo proximity biotinylation targeted to a specific subcellular region or a protein of interest</title><p>Next, we tested the spatial resolution of TurboID-catalysed biotinylation in zebrafish when TurboID was targeted to a specific subcellular region and to a POI. We tagged TurboID with a nuclear localisation signal (NLS), a plasma membrane localisation motif (CaaX), the transmembrane protein CD44b and the muscle T-tubule enriched membrane protein Cavin4b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). After biotin treatment, the TurboID fusion proteins produced a biotinylation pattern corresponding to the appropriate subcellular location of targeting sequences/proteins in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The spatial resolution of the biotin labelling was remarkable as even the T-tubule structure, which is difficult to resolve in fixed embryos, was clearly visible by NeutrAvidin staining in the embryos expressing Cavin4b-TurboID. Furthermore, the biotinylated protein derived from each TurboID construct gave rise to a unique barcode of protein bands on the streptavidin blot, indicative of proteins specific to each corresponding subcellular compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results demonstrated that TurboID was able to specifically label a selective subpopulation of endogenous proteins when targeted to a specific subcellular region or protein in zebrafish embryos. Moreover, the TurboID-biotinylated proteins were recoverable from crude fish lysates by affinity purification with streptavidin-conjugated beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), ready for downstream applications such as identification by mass spectrometry.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spatial resolution of TurboID-catalysed biotinylation in zebrafish embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of eGFP-, NLS-, CaaX-, CD44b-, and Cavin4b-tagged TurboID constructs for mRNA injection in zebrafish embryos.

These properties rendered it suitable for pursuing in vivo proteomic analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conditionally stabilised GFP-binding protein (dGBP) is able to target GFP-tagged proteins in zebrafish</title><p>Although we were able to achieve proximity-dependent biotin labelling in zebrafish embryos transiently expressing TurboID by mRNA injection, this method requires the direct injection of a large number of newly fertilised embryos in order to obtain sufficient protein for subsequent mass spectrometry sequencing. It is a labour-intensive exercise when potentially analysing multiple POIs, and new genetic constructs must be generated for each POI. In addition, the protein expressed from mRNA injected at the one-cell stage becomes progressively depleted and is present only in trace amounts beyond 3 days post fertilisation. As such, this methodology is limited to early stage embryos. To circumvent these issues, we envisaged a modular system that would utilise the many existing stable zebrafish lines which express GFP-tagged proteins. Previously, we demonstrated that a GFP-binding peptide (GBP; a 14 kDa nanobody) is able to target a peroxidase (APEX2) to GFP-tagged POIs in both cell culture and zebrafish systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariotti et al., 2015b</xref>), and can be used for ultrastructural localisation. Based on these findings, we reasoned that genetically fusing TurboID with GBP would target the TurboID-GBP fusion protein to GFP-labelled POIs and/or subcellular compartments in zebrafish, enabling GFP-directed proximity biotinylation in vivo. Furthermore, generation of a stable zebrafish line expressing TurboID-GBP would allow delivery of the transgene by a simple genetic cross, circumventing the need for microinjection and enabling continued expression beyond the embryonic stages.</p><p>As proof-of-principle, we fused a red fluorescent protein (mRuby2) with the GBP nanobody and transiently expressed it in a transgenic fish line already expressing Cavin1a-Clover. Clover is a GFP derivative recognised by GBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shaner et al., 2013</xref>), and Cavin1a is an ortholog of caveolae-associated protein one in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lo et al., 2015</xref>). When expressed at low levels, mRuby2-GBP showed clear colocalisation with Cavin1a-Clover at the plasma membrane in the mRuby2-positive muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, when mRuby-GBP was expressed at higher levels, red fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm in addition to the plasma membrane, likely due to the saturation of binding between GBP and GFP. This observation raised concerns about the potential of non-specific labelling from unbound TurboID-GBP under these conditions. As a solution, we substituted the GBP with a conditionally stabilised GFP-nanobody (destabilised GBP or âdGBPâ) that is rapidly degraded unless the GFP-binding site is occupied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ariotti et al., 2018a</xref>). Using this approach, we observed tight association of mRuby2-dGBP and Cavin1a-Clover in all muscle cells regardless of expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We reasoned that a system utilising the conditionally stabilised nanobody would be less likely to result in non-specific biotin labelling within target cells in vivo. Furthermore, use of the conditionally stabilised GBP gives potential for modularity, since tissue or cell type specific biotinylation will only occur in cells expressing both GFP-POI and TurboID-dGBP fusion proteins.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>In vivo binding of GFP-nanobody, GBP and dGBP, in stable transgenic zebrafish embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Representative images showing the colocalisation between Cavin1a-Clover and mRuby2-GBP/dGBP in live zebrafish embryos.

Cavin1a and Cavin4a are orthologues of human CAVIN1 and CAVIN4, which are caveola-associated proteins involved in caveolar formation. With the same procedures, we observed clear colocalisation between biotinylated proteins and Clover-tagged cavins in muscle fibres, at the sarcolemma and T-tubules, suggesting our TurboID-dGBP system can produce proximity-dependent biotinylation with subcellular resolution. Without biotin treatment or without the expression of GFP, there was no detectable biotinylation effected by TurboID. Notably, the specificity of GFP-directed biotinylation was not compromised in fish lines expressing higher levels of TurboID-dGBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We next visualised the proteins biotinylated by TurboID-dGBP on streptavidin blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The two prominent bands representing endogenously biotinylated proteins were again observed in embryos carrying both TurboID-dGBP and Cavin1a-clover; omitting the biotin supplement resulted in no exogenous biotinylation. Intriguingly, in the absence of Cavin1a-Clover, a weak biotinylation was still observed in the embryos carrying only the TurboID-dGBP transgene, despite the level of TurboID-dGBP being undetectable on anti-Myc immunoblot. This background labelling is likely caused by TurboID-dGBP en route to proteasomal degradation. Subsequent MS analysis revealed these background proteins are mainly endogenous biotinylated proteins, nuclear proteins, cytoskeletal proteins and yolk proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Using streptavidin affinity pulldown, biotinylated proteins were isolated from total fish lysates and endogenous Cavin4b, a known Cavin1 interactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>), was detected in the streptavidin pulldown in addition to Cavin1a-GFP and TurboID-dGBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

TurboID-dGBP and cavin-Clover co-expressing embryos were selected at 2 dpf for subsequent biotin labelling and the biotinylated proteins were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nanoHPLC/MS MS/MS). The sibling embryos inheriting only the TurboID transgene were used as a background control (experimental regimen illustrated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). After subtracting background proteins and common containments, 26, 22, and 25 proteins were identified in the Cavin1a, Cavin4a, and Cavin4b samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> â Tables 1-3). Among the proteins identified, the majority of proteins are associated with the plasma membrane, consistent with the membrane localisation of cavins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Table 4). Endogenous cavins were consistently detected in all samples, suggesting that the GFP-tag, as well as the binding of TurboID-dGBP, did not interfere with the oligomerisation of the cavins. Dystrophin (DMD), a protein associated with caveolae was identified uniquely in the Cavin1a sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doyle et al., 2000</xref>).

These known interactors were undetectable in all control samples, demonstrating the high accuracy of the BLITZ system. Note that, Caveolin1 (Uniprot accession: Q6YLH8) and Caveolin (isoform unassigned; Uniprot accession: A1L1S3) were detected in the Cavin1a sample based on two high confidence peptides (HLNDDVVK and VWVYSGIGFESAR) that were not present in the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) but were not classified as significant hits based on the 1% global FDR analysis.

This system utilises the advantages of BioID at capturing weak or transient interactions in living cells, but extends its application to an in vivo setting, enabling interactome investigation at specific developmental stages under physiological conditions, and potentially in disease models. The system also has several advantages over conventional BioID methods for studying the proteome and interactome.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A schematic overview of the BLITZ system.</title><p>The TurboID-dGBP lines can be crossed with existing GFP-tagged lines. In the embryos carrying both transgenes, the binding between dGBP and GFP stabilise TurboID-dGBP, which leads to proximity biotinylation around the GFP-tagged POIs. The unbound TurboID-dGBP will be rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system, which minimises non-specific labelling when dGBP-GFP binding saturates, as well as achieving tissue specificity by averting labelling in cells/tissues that do not express GFP. The biotin-labelled proteins can be isolated by biotin affinity purification and identified by MS analysis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64631-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Firstly, BLITZ does not require extensive molecular biology steps to produce numerous expression constructs, or laborious embryonic manipulation. It instead relies on simple crossing of a TurboID-dGBP line with an existing GFP-tagged fish line of choice; a plethora of such lines currently exist in stock centres globally and, with the advent of nuclease directed genome editing, this number is rapidly increasing. Secondly, BLITZ enables cell- and tissue-specific proteomic studies, since the stability of TurboID-dGBP is dependent on its binding to GFP targets. Non-specific biotin labelling in tissues that do not express GFP-tagged constructs is avoided. Thirdly, our TurboID-dGBP system has the potential to be used with knock-in fish lines carrying a GFP fusion protein at the endogenous locus of a POI. This will enable the application of BioID to study proteomic associations with endogenous proteins, which, to our knowledge, has not been achieved by conventional BioID methods. Finally, the modularity of the BLITZ system could be advantageous for use in established tissue culture systems using existing GFP expression vectors or/and knock-in cell lines, as well as extended to other organisms.</p><p>The use of the BLITZ system also comes with some caveats. Unlike the traditional BioID approach using a direct fusion of the biotin ligase with the bait protein, our system targets TurboID to the POI through the binding of dGBP nanobody to GFP. In this case, the indirect binding increases the physical distance between biotin ligase and the POI, which could potentially enlarge the effective labelling radius and include more non-interacting neighbouring proteins. However, we have previously shown that the use of a GFP-directed nanobody to target a genetically encoded peroxidase (APEX2) for protein localisation does not appear to compromise the fidelity of labelling: APEX2 staining was rarely observed beyond 25 nm from the site of POI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariotti et al., 2015a</xref>). It is also possible that the binding of the biotin ligase-nanobody with the GFP-tagged POI could perturb the localisation of the POI, either by masking interacting surfaces or simply due to the larger size of a complex. For this reason, we routinely examine the distribution of the GFP-tagged POI both with and without biotin ligase-dGBP expression as well as the distribution of biotinylated proteins using fluorescent neutravidin staining. Since our in vivo system is based on the simple crossing of heterozygous transgenic lines, every new clutch contains offspring with every possible combination of alleles, and the appropriate internal controls can be sorted by fluorescence. As BLITZ uses biotin as a label, the method (like most BioID methods) is problematic for the identification of interactors that are endogenously biotinylated, such as carboxylases. In addition, as all BioID methods will label proteins within a small number of nanometres, non-interacting proteins could be detected simply due to close proximity. Thus, subsequent validation using other independent approaches such as biomolecular fluorescence complementation and affinity pulldown is essential to distinguish bonaÂ fide interactors from non-interacting neighbouring proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Application of BLITZ to the identification of cavin-association networks in muscle</title><p>Cavin family proteins are key components of the caveolar coat complex associated with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Cavin1 is present in all tissues and is essential for caveolar formation and function. Cavin2, 3, and 4 show more restricted tissue distributions with Cavin4 being specific to skeletal and cardiac muscle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parton et al., 2018</xref>). In the zebrafish, Cavin1 and 4 are each duplicated such that four loci exist; Cavin1a/b and Cavin4a/b. Cavin1a and b show spatially distinct expression patterns with Cavin1b being largely restricted to the developing notochord whereas Cavin1a, 4a, and 4b are all highly expressed in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Housley et al., 2016</xref>). In this study we used the BLITZ system to identify putative interactors for all three skeletal muscle cavins, and identified sets of putative interactors both unique and common to all three proteins.</p><p>The majority of proteins identified for all cavin proteomes were muscle-enriched factors and plasma membrane proteins. We also saw a specific enrichment of known caveola-associated proteins consistent with initial expectations. Interestingly, the cavin proteomes also contained a disproportionate number of nuclear proteins, such as Gnl3, Naca, and Lbr. In cultured cells, cavins have been shown to be released from the plasma membrane in response to external stimuli (such as mechanical stress) and are able to bind intracellular targets in variety of subcellular locations to regulate processes such as ribosomal RNA transcription and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu and Pilch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McMahon et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, in the absence of Cavin1, in knockout mouse muscle, Cavin4 has been shown to localise predominantly to the nucleus rather than the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>What processes might Cavin1 and Cavin4 be regulating? We know that loss of Cavin1 causes lipodystrophy and muscular dystrophy in humans. Patient and animal muscle shows hypertrophied muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rajab et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2017</xref>). Cavin4 mutations have been described in dilated cardiomyopathy patients and there is evidence that Cavin4 recruits ERK in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogata et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, there is supporting data for the positive regulation of hypertrophy in skeletal muscle fibres by Cavin1, and in cardiomyocytes by Cavin4. The cavin proteome showed an enrichment of protein kinases, such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling and plays an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy through the ERK signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Illario et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cipolletta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cipolletta et al., 2015</xref>). The activation of CaMKII can be induced by exercise in skeletal muscle, with the activation level proportional to the intensity of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rose et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, BLITZ revealed several putative cavin interactors that have also been shown to be involved in cardiomyopathies and/or skeletal myopathies, including the membrane protein Dystrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deconinck and Dan, 2007</xref>), the triad-associated proteins Bin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicot et al., 2007</xref>), Cypher/ZASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Selcen and Engel, 2005</xref>), and SPEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic ablation of zebrafish Cavin4b causes aberrant T-tubules in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Housley et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that Cavin4 may be involved in T-tubule formation through interaction with triad associated proteins, such as Bin1.</p><p>Overall, our BLITZ system enables the in vivo identification of protein interactors in a cell- and tissue-specific manner, with high precision. We demonstrated the applicability of this approach in diverse cell types including neurons and vascular endothelial cells and applied the BLITZ system to identify factors associated with cavin family proteins in differentiated skeletal muscle. BLITZ provides a versatile and valuable tool for proteomic discovery using the zebrafish model, but also has the potential for application in other in vivo contexts that to date have been challenging

according to institutional guidelines (Techniplast recirculating system, 14 hr light/10 hr dark cycle, University of Queensland, UQ). Adults (90 dpf above) were housed in 3 or 8 L tanks with flow at 28.5Â°C and embryos up to five dpf were housed in 8 cm Petri dishes in standard E3 media (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>,Â and MgSO<sub>4</sub>) at 28Â°C (incubated in the dark) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Westerfield, 2007</xref>). All experiments were approved by the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee. The following zebrafish strains were used in this study: wild-type (TAB), an AB/TU line generated in UQBR Aquatics (UQ Biological Resources), <italic>Tg(actc1b:cavin1a-Clover), Tg(actc1b:cavin4a-Clover), Tg(actc1b:Cavin4b-Clover), Tg(actb2:mKate2-P2A-TurboID-dGBP), Tg(kdrl:eGFP) and Tg(MotoN:GFP)</italic>. The developmental stages of zebrafish used in experiments are prior to specific sex determination. All zebrafish used in experiment were healthy, not involved in previous procedures and drug or test naive.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>DNA constructs and transgenic fish lines</title><p>The protein sequence of TurboID and MiniTurbo was constructed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref> while the protein sequence of BASU was designed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>.

A red fluorescent reporter, mKate2, was indirectly linked into the N-terminus of biotin ligase through a self-cleaving P2A sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shcherbo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Promoter, fluorescent report and biotin ligase were cloned into destination vector using Gateway cloning system.

In brief, plasmid constructs for generating transgenic lines were co-injected with tol2 mRNA into one-cell-stage WT zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nusslein-Volhard and Dahm, 2002</xref>). Injected F<sub>0</sub>s were raised and screened for founders producing positive F<sub>1</sub>s with Mendelian frequencies, indicative of single genomic integration. Positive F<sub>1</sub>s grown to reproductive age were used for our experiments. Stable lines were maintained as heterozygotes.

A bolus of approximately 1/5 of the total cell diameter was injected into each embryo. For DNA injection, the bolus was injected into the cell of embryos at single cell stage (5â25 min-post-fertilisation). For RNA injection, the bolus was injected into the yolk of the embryos up until two-cell stage. The RNA transcript was synthesised by mMESSAGE mMACHINE T3 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturerâs instruction. The RNA transcripts were tagged with poly(A) tail using Poly(A) Tailing Kit (Invitrogen) to extend the stability of mRNA in zebrafish embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo biotin labelling</title><p>Embryos at indicated developmental stage were incubated in the E3 media supplemented with 500 Î¼M biotin for 18 hr to initiate biotinylation in vivo. For embryos before hatching, a dechorionation step was carried out by using Pronase (Roche, 100 Î¼g/ml in E3 media for 40 min at 28Â°C) prior to the biotin incubation. After biotin incubation, embryos were washed for 40 min with two changes of standard E3 media to remove unincorporated biotin before subsequent immunostaining or protein extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Zebrafish embryos protein extraction</title><p>Fish embryos after in vivo biotin labelling were deyolked by mechanical disruption through a 200 Âµl pipette tips in calcium-free Ringerâs solution followed by two changes of solution at 4Â°C. The deyolked embryos was lysed by brief sonication in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1% NP-40; 0.1% SDS; 5 mM EDTA; 0.5% Na-deoxycholate,) with freshly added cOmplele Protease Inhibitor. Lysates were further solubilised at 4Â°C with rotation for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 Ãg for 10 min at 4Â°C, and supernatant were collected for BCA protein assay determining protein concentration. For western blot analysis, 25 fish embryos per group were used for protein extraction, whilst, for streptavidin affinity purification, approximately 350 embryos were used for each group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Western blot analysis was performed largely as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lo et al., 2015</xref>. Briefly, zebrafish samples from protein extraction were mixed with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (4X) and 10 mM DTT. Protein samples were analysed by Western blotting with following antibodies: mouse anti-Myc (dilution 1:2000), mouse anti-Actin (dilution 1:5000), rabbit anti-Cavin4b (dilution 1:2000), anti-mouse and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibodies (dilution 1:5000), streptavidin-HRP (dilution 1:5000). ECL blotting reagent was used to visualise HRP and chemiluminescent signal was detected using the ChemiDoc MP system (BioRad) as per the manufactureâs instruction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Streptavidin beads pulldowns</title><p>Fresh embryo protein extracts (4 mg in 2.5 ml RIPA buffer) was passed through PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) to remove excess free biotin using the gravity protocol according to manufacturerâs instruction. Protein extracts were then mixed with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen) from 200 Âµl bead slurry that were pre-washed with RIPA buffer, and incubated on a rotor wheel at 4Â°C overnight (16 hr). The next day, the beads were separated from the protein extracts on a magnetic rack and transferred to a new 2 ml LoBind tube (Eppendorf). The beads were washed with 1 ml of each following solution: twice with RIPA buffer, once with 2% SDS in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, once with 2 M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0 and twice again in RIPA buffer without cOmplete Protease Inhibitor. Washed beads were boiled in 60 Âµl of 2X Blot LDS sample buffer (4X diluted to 2X with RIPA buffer) containing 2 mM biotin and 20 mM DTT at 95Â°C for 10 min with 10 s vortex after first 5 min boiling. Five ul Âµof the pulldown samples was used for immunoblots, whereas the 50 Âµl of the samples were used for SDS-PAGE with SYPRO Ruby (Invitrogen) or InstantBlue protein gel stain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunostaining and confocal microscopy</title><p>Fish embryos after in vivo biotin labelling were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4Â°C. After fixation, embryos were permeabilised by proteinase K (10 Âµg/ml, 10 min for embryos at 2 dpf, or 15 min for embryos at 3 dpf), and fixed again with 4% PFA for 15 min. Embryos were washes with PBS-Tween 20 (0.1%) and blocked in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100% and 4% BSA for 3 hr at room temperature. Staining was performed in blocking buffer with NeutrAvidin-DyLight (1:500 dilution) overnight at 4Â°C followed by four washes with PBS 0.3% Trition X-100. For nuclear staining, embryos were stained with DAPI for 10 min followed by three washes with PBS 0.3% Trition X-100.</p><p>Confocal imaging was performed on Zeiss 710 meta upright confocal microscopes. Zebrafish embryos were mounted in 1% low melting point agarose in embryos media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Westerfield, 2007</xref>) on a standard 8 cm petri dish. Objectives used were Zeiss water immersion x40 N/A 1.0 (catalogue number 420762). For live embryo imaging, embryos were anaesthetised in 2.5 mM tricaine prior to imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Sample preparation for mass spectrometry</title><p>For in-gel digestion, the streptavidin pulldown samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4â12% precast gel (Blot Bis-Tris Plus, Invitrogen) and then stained with Instant<italic>Blue</italic> (Expedeon). The whole lane was excised from the gel and future cut into approximate 3 Ã 1Ã2 mm<sup>3</sup> slices (L x W x H) and each slice were placed into a separate LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) for destaining. The gels were destained by adding 500 Âµl of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1:1, vol/vol) and incubated with occasional vortexing for 30 min. The ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile buffer was removed, and the gel pieces dried for 15 min by the addition of 200 Âµl of acetonitrile. The acetonitrile was removed and another 200 Âµl aliquot was added and left for 15â30 min. The acetonitrile was removed in preparation for trypsin digestion.</p><p>After destain, the gel pieces were covered with 200 Âµl of 20 ng/Âµl of sequence grade trypsin/Lys-C (Promega) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH8 buffer. The gel pieces were left for 1 hr and if required a further 100 Âµl of trypsin/Lys-C solution was added to cover the gel pieces. The samples were placed in an incubator at 37Â°C overnight. The trypsin solution was transferred from each sample and placed in a clean Eppendorf tube. Of 5% formic acid/acetonitrile (3:1, vol/vol), 200Â ÂµlÂ was added to each tube and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in a shaker.

Five Âµl of each extract was injected onto a 5 mm x 300 Âµm, C18 3 Âµm trap column (SGE, Australia) for 5 min at 10 Âµl/min. The trapped tryptic peptide extracts were then washed onto the analytical 75 Âµm x 150 mm ChromXP C18 CL 3 Âµm column (SCIEX) at 400 nl/min and a column temperature of 45Â°C. Linear gradients of 2â40% solvent B over 60 min at 400 nl/min flowrate, followed by a steeper gradient from 40% to 90% solvent B in 5 min, then 90% solvent B for 5 min, were used for peptide elution. The gradient was then returned to 2% solvent B for equilibration prior to the next sample injection. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B contained 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The ionspray voltage was set to 2600V, declustering potential (DP) 80V, curtain gas flow 30, nebuliser gas 1 (GS1) 30, interface heater at 150Â°C. The mass spectrometer acquired 50 ms full scan TOF-MS data followed by up to 30 100 ms full scan product ion data, with a rolling collision energy, in an Information-Dependant Acquisition, IDA, mode for protein identification and peptide library production. Full scan TOFMS data was acquired over the mass range 350â1800 and for product ion ms/ms 100â1500. Ions observed in the TOF-MS scan exceeding a threshold of 200 counts and a charge state of +two to +five were set to trigger the acquisition of product ion, ms/ms spectra of the resultant 30 most intense ions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>MS data analysis and GO annotation</title><p>Data was acquired and processed using Analyst TF 1.7 software (SCIEX). Protein identification was carried out using ProteinPilot software v5.0 (SCIEX) with Paragon database search algorithm. MS/MS spectra were searched against the zebrafish proteome in the UniProt database (2019 version, containing 46847 proteins and 28365 common contaminants). The search parameter was set to through with False Discovery Rate (FDR) analysis. A non-linear fitting method was used to determine both a global and a local FDR from the decoy database search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2008</xref>). The cut-off for identified proteins was set to 1% global FDR. Endogenous biotinylated proteins, common contaminants and background proteins (generated from TurboID-dGBP control embryos) were subtracted from the cavin proteomes. The MS2Count was calculated for each identified protein by summing the MS2Count of all peptides belonging to that protein. The MS2Count for each protein was used to generate heatmaps for semiquantitative comparison across cavin interactome.</p><p>The GO annotation for our identified proteins was carried out using DAVID 6.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2009a</xref>). For zebrafish proteins without annotation information, manually annotation was performed by searching their human or mouse homologs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Anne Lagendijk and Dr. Jean Giacomotto for <italic>Tg(kdrl:EGFP)</italic> and <italic>Tg(MotoN:EGFP)</italic> fish lines, respectively.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper reports an important new advance in mapping protein-protein proximity networks, and as such will be of interest to scientists across biological disciplines. In this modular system, a conditionally stabilized GFP-binding nanobody expressed as a transgene can be combined with other zebrafish transgenic lines expressing GFP-tagged proteins of interest to achieve biotin-dependent proteomic profiling. The data show convincingly in vivo labeling and identification of proximal proteins within a living organism. This work significantly expands experimental toolbox for defining protein interaction networks in zebrafish and beyond.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;in vivo proteomic mapping through GFP-directed proximity-dependent biotin labelling in zebrafish&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Lilianna Solnica-Krezel as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ben M Major (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a very well written manuscript detailing an important technical advance for the protein-protein interaction community. The goal of the study was to develop the BLITZ method, which was accomplished and is now established. Comments and questions of minor or technical impact are as follows:</p><p>The authors conclude that &quot;TurboID exhibited the strongest biotinylation of endogenous proteins among the three new biotin ligases&quot; when transiently expressed in early zebrafish embryos (Figure 1B). However, Figure 1B also shows that by western blotting, TurboID was expressed at higher levels. Were biotinylation results normalized to the ligase expression levels?</p><p>Randomly transgenes inserted into the zebrafish genome can be silenced in consecutive generations. Can the authors comment whether TurboID-dGBP protein expression remains stable over generations? Have attempts been made to insert the TurboID-dGBP under the control of endogenous, possibly tissue-specific promoters. Some background biotinylation has been observed even with dGBP, and tissue specific expression would help reduce it.</p><p>In Figure 4A, it is unclear why Cavlin1a-Clover shows co-localization with NeutrAvidin in the third row from the top but not in the second row from the bottom. The authors suggest that the biotinylation seen by Western blot in Figure 4B in the absence of Cavlin1a is driven by dGBP en route to the proteasome. Given the importance of this control from an in vivo setting, further definition and understanding of this signal and how it impacts true positive discovery is needed.</p><p>Overall, the statistical analysis of significance for the scored proximal proteins is weak and lacks a more robust and field standard approach. Specifically, a nice set of control transgenic lines have been developed, but have not been processed by MS and are thus not used in scoring. Data processing describes a normalization step to endogenously expressed carboxylases. Do these carboxylases change in abundance across different bait proteins? The MS acquisition parameters are lacking from the Materials and methods section.</p><p>The endogenously biotinylated protein they used in their analysis was propionyl-CoA carboxiylase subunit alpha, a mitochondrial protein. Given that this is a proximity label, it might be good to add some additional controls used in their analyses, for protein specificity that are not restricted to mitochondria. If they compare the mass spec identified profile of NLS-TurboID, cytoplasmic TurboID GFP and CaaX TurboID GFP to the Caveolins. Some more statements of the restrictions of biotinylation as a proximity/location label would be appreciated in the Discussion.</p><p>The experiments describing the use of the TurboID-dGBP system to map proteins associated with Cavin9 and 4 in zebrafish muscle are very informative. With this experiment showing the potential of the method, it would be important to validate some of the newly identified potential interactors.</p><p>Only weak biotin labeling was detected after 4-6 h incubation of zebrafish embryos with biotin, and adequate labeling required 18 h incubation. Is this related to low permeability of zebrafish embryos to biotin? Has injection of biotin into embryos been attempted? This would not address later stages of development, but could be beneficial during embryogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64631.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a very well written manuscript detailing an important technical advance for the protein-protein interaction community.

In our hands, we found that both BASU and miniTurbo were expressed at a lower level than TurboID when an equal amount of RNA was injected into zebrafish embryos. While we did not explore the underlying reasons for this, greater instability of miniTurbo has been reported previously (May et al., 2020) and other biotin ligases have shown poor expression in cell cultures (Branon et al., 2018). Regardless of mechanism, BASU and miniTurbo did not perform as well as TurboID in our system. These points have been clarified in the Results section as follows:</p><p>âOf note, BASU and miniTurbo were expressed at a lower level than TurboID despite equal amount of RNA injection. While we did not explore the underlying reasons for this, greater instability of miniTurbo has been reported previously (May et al., 2020) and other biotin ligases have shown poor expression in cell cultures (Branon et al., 2018).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Randomly transgenes inserted into the zebrafish genome can be silenced in consecutive generations.

Some background biotinylation has been observed even with dGBP, and tissue specific expression would help reduce it.</p></disp-quote><p>When generating stable lines in our laboratory we take great care to avoid the problems of epigenetic silencing and loss of transgene activity due to dilution of multiple genomic integrations. Before selecting a line to work with, we outcross over several generations to ensure firstly that the transgene is inherited in a Mendelian fashion, and secondly to ensure that we have selected lines that are not prone to silencing. In generating the lines for this study, we observed that the expression of TurboID-dGBP transgene remained stable over four generations and continues to remain so. This point has been expanded upon as follows:</p><p>âThe expression of transgene is stable in our zebrafish lines and demonstrates Mendelian inheritance over four generations, indicating a stable single transgenic integration.â</p><p>We did not attempt to insert TurboID-dGBP under the control of endogenous promoter. Inserting the biotin ligases at endogenous loci is theoretically possible, but the great utility of our dGBP mediated approach is that it can be used with any GFP-expressing line. This means that a more flexible and streamlined approach would be to make or source GFP knock-in fish to cross with our dGBP line. We have used tissue specific expression of TurboID-dGBP to conduct proteomic experiments. However, we were unable to ascertain whether there was any significant reduction in background biotinylation since background biotinylation is already very low. Our rationale has been that the use of tissue specific promoters would require the generation of new driver lines for each application, decreasing the utility of the system. However, such an approach could conceivably be useful where GFP expression from the reporter line is expressed in two or more different tissues or cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4A, it is unclear why Cavlin1a-Clover shows co-localization with NeutrAvidin in the third row from the top but not in the second row from the bottom.

Given the importance of this control from an in vivo setting, further definition and understanding of this signal and how it impacts true positive discovery is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this misunderstanding has arisen because of incomplete labelling of this figure, and we have amended appropriately. The second row from the bottom in Figure 4A is a control group consisting sibling embryos carrying only Cavin1a-Clover but <italic>not</italic> the TurboID-dGBP transgene (the presence of the TurboID transgene is shown by the mKate2 signal in the third column). Additional labels âGFP-negative; mKate2-negativeâ have been added to Figure 4A and to the figure legend for clarification.</p><p>Importantly, mass-spec analysis has been performed on the negative control group expressing TurboID-dGBP without GFP bait protein and the data are given in Supplementary file 3. The majority are endogenous biotinylated proteins, pyruvate carboxylase a/b (pcxa/b), Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase beta (acacb) and Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (pcc). In addition, several nuclear proteins (ap3d and taf3), ribosomal proteins (rpl37, rpl36a and rpl39), cytoskeletal proteins (krt5 and myhz1.1) and zebrafish yolk proteins (vitellogenins) were also identified. These proteins are commonly found in BioID-based MS sequencing and were excluded from analysis. This point has been clarified further as follows:</p><p>âSubsequent MS analysis revealed these background proteins are mainly endogenous biotinylated proteins, nuclear proteins, cytoskeletal proteins and yolk proteins (Supplementary file 3).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the statistical analysis of significance for the scored proximal proteins is weak and lacks a more robust and field standard approach.

For this reason, we chose a qualitative rather than quantitative approach. However, this comment prompted us to revisit our analysis methodology. We have rerun the protein identification search using ProteinPilot software with false discovery rate (FDR) set at 1% global FDR. The FDR report detailing the quality of protein and peptide identification is now include as Figure 5âsource data 1-6. Label-free quantitation used summed MS2Count for each protein. Non-specific proteins identified in pulldown of sibling embryos that express only the TurboID-dGBP transgene was used as background control. The following explanation has been added:</p><p>âThe sibling embryos inheriting only the TurboID transgene were used as a background control (Figure 5A). [â¦] Individual hits and general properties of putative interacting proteins are discussed below.â</p><p>Based on our Western Blot and mass spec analysis, the abundance of endogenous biotinylated proteins stayed at a similar level across different fish lines used.</p><p>The mass spec acquisition parameters are now stated in the Materials and methods section follows:</p><p>âData was acquired and processed using Analyst TF 1.7 software (SCIEX). Protein identification was carried out using ProteinPilot software v5.0 (SCIEX) with Paragon database search algorithm. [â¦] The MS2Count for each protein was used to generate heatmaps for semiquantitative comparison across cavin interactomeâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The endogenously biotinylated protein they used in their analysis was propionyl-CoA carboxiylase subunit alpha, a mitochondrial protein.

In this revised manuscript, we have now used MS2Count for relative label-free quantification of detected proteins across the samples. The controls were the respective sibling embryos as explained above and depicted in Figure 5A. We did not generate stable transgenic fish lines expressing NLS-TurboID, cytoplasmic TurboID-GFP or TurboID-CaaX. The fish embryos expressing these TurboID variants (Figure 2) were generated using direct injection of RNA so it is not feasible to conduct mass spec analysis on these animals. However, we believe our existing mass spec data is sufficient to demonstrate the specificity and accuracy of BLITZ method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some more statements of the restrictions of biotinylation as a proximity/location label would be appreciated in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following text to the Discussion:</p><p>âAs BLITZ uses biotin as a label, the method (like most BioID methods) is problematic for the identification of interactors that are endogenously biotinylated, such as carboxylases. [â¦] Thus, subsequent validation using other independent approaches such as biomolecular fluorescence complementation and affinity pulldown is essential to distinguish bona fide interactors from non-interacting neighbouring proteins.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments describing the use of the TurboID-dGBP system to map proteins associated with Cavin9 and 4 in zebrafish muscle are very informative.

We require approximately 400 embryos for each sample group which makes injection an unfeasible option. However, injection of biotin solution into zebrafish has recently been applied successfully to adult zebrafish which yield more tissue (Pronobis et al., unpublished, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.19.427246v1?ct=).</p></body></sub-article></article>
