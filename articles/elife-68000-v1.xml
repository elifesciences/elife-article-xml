The spatial relationship of age-induced alterations in neural stem cells (NSCs) and surrounding cells within the hippocampal niche remains poorly understood due to limitations of antibody-based cellular phenotyping. We established iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) in tissue sections, allowing for simultaneous detection of 18 proteins to characterize NSCs and surrounding cells in 2-, 6-, and 12-month-old mice. We show that reorganization of the dentate gyrus (DG) niche already occurs in middle-aged mice, paralleling the decline in neurogenesis. 4i-based tissue analysis of the DG identifies changes in cell-type contributions to the blood-brain barrier and microenvironments surrounding NSCs to play a pivotal role to preserve neurogenic permissiveness. The data provided represent a resource to characterize the principles causing alterations of stem cell-associated plasticity within the aging DG and provide a blueprint to analyze somatic stem cell niches across lifespan in complex tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STEMBAR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jessberger</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BSCGI0_157859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jessberger</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_196869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jessberger</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2019-AdG-885579</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelkmans</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_192622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelkmans</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Iterative immunostaining using 4i enables detailed characterization of complex mouse and human tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Somatic stem cells divide throughout life to generate progeny that is required for tissue homeostasis and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fuchs and Segre, 2000</xref>). With advancing age, there is a decline in stem cell numbers, output, and function, which has been associated to altered organ integrity and reduced tissue repair in aging mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ermolaeva et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to age-dependent, cell-intrinsic alterations causing reduced functionality of somatic stem cells, there is ample evidence that changes in the surrounding stem cell niche contribute to age-related stem cell phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Navarro Negredo et al., 2020</xref>). However, the exact spatial relationships between altered niche cells and somatic stem cells remain incompletely understood, likely because conventional immunohistochemical approaches only allow for the simultaneous detection of few proteins. Further, conventional RNA sequencing approaches or proteome analyses do not allow for the recovery of spatial information within complex tissues. Thus, recent work aimed to overcome these limitations, for example by the development of spatial transcriptomics, multiplexed protein detection, and mass-spectrometry based approaches allowing for the detection of dozens of proteins with cellular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giesen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ståhl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schapiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moncada et al., 2020</xref>). Based on these technological innovations major advances have been achieved characterizing the cellular organization and complexity of mouse and human tissues in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Decalf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wagner et al., 2019</xref>). However, these approaches largely miss three-dimensional (3D) information in tissues and require highly specialized equipment and/or customized or conjugated antibodies, reducing their availability. We recently developed the 4i (iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging) technology, which allows for the detection of &gt;40 individual proteins or protein states using conventional primary and secondary antibodies and mild conditions of antibody elution by preventing photo-induced crosslinking during imaging, thereby preserving sample integrity and achieving high reproducibility at very high spatial resolution across many cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gut et al., 2018</xref>). Since 4i was originally established for monolayers of cultured cells, we here developed a robust protocol to apply 4i to histological tissue sections to characterize the aging dentate gyrus (DG) niche of the mouse hippocampus, one of the brain areas where neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new neurons throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gage, 2019</xref>). Advancing age has been associated with strongly reduced NSC activity and diminished neuronal output, which is due to cell-intrinsic, niche-dependent, and humoral mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boldrini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalamakis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tobin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denoth-Lippuner and Jessberger, 2021</xref>). Using 4i, we show that the cellular reorganization of the DG niche occurs relatively early in life and identify substantial alterations in contact sites between NSCs and the vasculature, and niche-associated changes that are paralleled with a decline in neurogenesis. The data presented here characterize age-related changes in the DG niche and provide a blueprint for the analyses of a substantial number of proteins in single cells and their surrounding niche within complex tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Iterative 4i immunostaining in complex mouse and human tissues</title><p>To achieve multiple rounds of 4i on tissue, sections needed to be adequately mounted to minimize loss of samples through detachment without affecting antigenicity. Coating the glass-bottomed well-plates with poly-d-lysine (PDL) was effective to preserve tissue adhesion across multiple cycles of 4i in sections of 3-month-old adult mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived regionalized forebrain organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, using this approach, sequential rounds of conventional antibody stainings in mouse and human tissues becomes achievable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, for details of used antibodies refer to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Notably, 4i in tissue sections allows for 3D reconstruction of tissue volumes, facilitating detailed spatial analyses throughout tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), showcased using antibodies against IBA1-labeled microglia, Nestin- and GFAP-labeled NSC processes, DCX-expressing immature neurons, LaminB1-expressing cells, and CollagenIV-labeled vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To assess potential effects of cyclic staining and repeated elutions on sample antigenicity, adult brain sections were stained with the 18 antibodies used in the present study, imaged, and subsequently subjected to six rounds of elution prior to restaining. Measured fluorescence intensities between the stainings before and after rounds of elution were strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that antigenicity is preserved across repeated cycles of iterative immunostainings for most of the antibodies that we used in tissue sections, similar to the high reproducibility that 4i achieves in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gut et al., 2018</xref>). Significant correlation was not achieved for the stem cell marker ID4 and MT3<sup>+</sup> cells were poorly correlated between rounds. While staining was impaired for ID4, the quality was improved for MT3, suggesting the elution step may have some efficacy for antigen retrieval.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Iterative immunostaining in mouse and human tissue sections.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Shown is an adult mouse dorsal hippocampal section labeled with 11 antibodies, as indicated in the individual panels, acquired over five rounds of 4i.

In addition to declining vascular networks, age has been associated with an increase in leakiness of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), potentially permitting molecules into the brain leading to increased inflammation and neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell et al., 2010</xref>). BBB integrity was estimated by measuring the percent of vasculature covered by other cell types based on signal colocalization.

Spots were randomly distributed across the GCL spaced 50 µm apart. Utilizing the multidimensionality of the data set acquired with 4i, volumes of 11 cell markers were measured within a 50 µm radius of each spot to achieve contiguous sampling of ‘microniches’ in the GCL and bordering areas of the hilus and ML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The aim of such microniche-based analyses was to identify age-related changes within the immediate proximity of neurogenic cells. Post hoc analysis showed significant differences (in terms of percent of marker expression per randomized microniche volume) in a variety of measured cell types within microniches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). For example, vascular and pericyte densities were similarly decreased at 6 and 12 months compared to 2-month-old mice. While the stem cell marker Nestin was significantly reduced by 6 months, GFAP, which is also present in classical astrocytes, remained stable between each age time point, indicating that classical astrocytes contribute substantially to GFAP-expression volumes in analyzed microniches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Additionally, SOX2 was reduced at 6 months, and decreased further in 12-month-old animals.

As the spots were largely segregated into two groups, k-means clustering was performed expecting two populations; one ‘young-like’ and one ‘old-like’ identified based on neurogenic cell content. In the 2-month-old animals, 64.5% of spots were grouped as young while 35.5% were labeled as old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

As such, the development of an ‘aged’ phenotype occurred for select niches already at 2 months of age and became already very pronounced in 6-month-old mice. To explore the potential of microenvironments that may support the persistence of R cells within the DG, spots were split by Nestin radial process content.

Thus, previous work aimed to identify age-dependent changes within neurogenic NSCs and their surrounding niches. A number of cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors have been identified that appear to mediate the age-related decline in NSC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verbitsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hafezi-Moghadam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dulken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martín-Suárez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morrow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vonk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bedrosian et al., 2021</xref>). Further, structural but also functional benefits have been associated with experimentally enhanced neurogenesis in mice of advanced age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katsimpardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McAvoy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berdugo-Vega et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horowitz et al., 2020</xref>). A critical role for vasculature within the dense vessel network of the DG has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palmer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Praag et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remained difficult to obtain a comprehensive view of age-related changes within the DG niche due to the difficulty to combine decisive cellular phenotyping of neurogenic cells with a number of different cell type markers within the same tissue section, a requirement to obtain a more complete picture of what changes indeed occur within or in the direct vicinity of NSCs in the mammalian DG. Using 4i, we here show that prominent changes in vascular microarchitecture and contact sites occur early on in life. Interestingly, we found that stem cells showed enhanced proximity with pericytes with advancing age. Further, our data indicate that both vascular density but also relative distribution of IBA1-labeled microglia and NG2-labeled oligodendroglia are associated with stem cell maintenance in the aged DG. If those cellular alterations are truly responsible for age-related changes of neurogenesis remain to be tested. Furthermore, additional alterations of niche cells may have been missed as the set of markers used to identify non-neurogenic cells in the DG do not indicate cell states or subtypes. Future experiments will aim to selectively manipulate newly identified aspects of niche interactions and composition that were identified here, probing for their functional significance. Together with other omics-based approaches that aim to identify age-dependent changes in the aging brain and within NSCs and their progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shavlakadze et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ximerakis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ibrayeva et al., 2020</xref>), the 4i-based data set we provide here will contribute to future work with the aim to enhance neurogenesis in aged brains. 4i-based data will contribute to such efforts by not only allowing for high spatial resolution of obtained expression data within complex tissues but also allowing for the characterization of interactions in the 3D space.</p><p>We here used 18 different antibodies to label identical tissue sections. However, that number may be easily scaled up when required. We show that 4i is applicable to a variety of mouse and human tissues, indicating its potential use in basically all tissues and organs. Thus, 4i will be useful to analyze a plethora of tissues and may turn out to be especially useful when only limited tissues/cells are available. For instance, it is a current fundamental limitation in clonal lineage tracing experiments that daughter cells cannot be definitely phenotyped. Rather, current limitations only allow for exclusion-based phenotyping, at least when starter/mother cells can generate a diverse set of daughter cell fates (e.g., a cell expresses protein X and Y but not Z; because only X and Y can be combined for analysis within a single stain, the negativity of Z cannot be shown and phenotypic classification needs to rely on exclusion or non-standardized morphological criteria). Thus, to date, all clonal lineages that generate &gt;2 cell types can only be partially phenotyped and diverse cell types cannot be conclusively classified within the exact same clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonaguidi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pilz et al., 2018</xref>). 4i on tissue sections will overcome these technical limitations in an easy and readily applicable way, allowing for the use of extensively characterized and validated sets of antibodies with indirect immunofluorescence.</p><p>We here demonstrate the applicability of iterative immunostaining in tissue sections using 4i, provide a comprehensive data set of the aging DG with a large set of combined markers, and identify vasculature- and glia-associated changes within the

the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland in accordance with national and cantonal regulations (license ZH037/2017; ZH126/2020). In developing the 4i protocol for tissue sections, brain tissue was collected from male and female C57Bl/6 mice ranging between 2 and 4 months of age. To attain embryonic day (E) 14.5 embryonic samples, daily plug checks were used to estimate the date of conception. Embryos were collected 14 days following the observation of a vaginal plug. For the aging study, C57BL/6J males at 2 (n=3), 6 (n=3), and 12 months (n=3) of age were used. All mice were kept in a 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>For adult tissues, animals were transcardially perfused using a peristaltic pump with cold 0.9% saline solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer. Brains were collected and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C for 8 hr. The brains were then cryo-protected in 30% sucrose for 2 days prior to sectioning. Adult mouse brain tissue was sectioned into 40 μm coronal sections on a cryotome (Leica SM2010R). For E14.5 samples, embryonic heads from C57Bl/6 mice were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% PFA overnight. Cryoprotection occurred in two steps, first for 2 days in 15% sucrose followed by 2 days in 30% sucrose, before being flash-frozen and embedded in OCT Compound (Tissue-Tek) using liquid nitrogen. Sectioning was done coronally at 40 μm using a cryostat. Sections were collected and washed with PBS to remove the remaining OCT before being transferred to cryoprotectant solution (CPS, 25% Ethyleneglycol, 25% Glycerin, and 0.1 M phosphate buffer). Forebrain-specific organoids derived from hESCs (approved by the Kantonale Ethikkomission Zurich and reported to the federal Bundesamt für Gesundheit of Switzerland) were generated as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowers et al., 2020</xref>), and fixed at day 40 in 4% PFA for 15 min, embedded in OCT, and flash-frozen using liquid nitrogen. Organoids were sectioned at 40 μm using a cryostat, sections were collected in PBS. Serial washes with PBS were performed to remove the remaining OCT, before being transferred to CPS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mounting</title><p>Prior to mounting, glass-bottomed 24-well plates (Cellvis P24-1.5H-N) were coated with 1 mg/ml PDL (Sigma-Aldrich P6407). 75 μl of the PDL solution was transferred into the center of each well and brushed to the edges with a fine paintbrush to ensure total coverage. The plates were rocked on a shaker for 5 min, after which the PDL was collected for reuse. Wells were rinsed three times with deionized water and let dry for at least 2 hr. Tissue sections were washed three times in PBS, loaded into wells containing 500 µl 1× PBS, which was subsequently aspirated allowing the tissue to lie flat and dry for approximately 20 min until there was no visible liquid remaining around the edges of the sections. The tissue was then rinsed for 30 s with 4% PFA and washed in PBS three times for 5 min each. Organoids sections were gently aspirated using a P1000 pipet with a trimmed tip and transferred into a well of a glass bottomed well plate. The sections were allowed to settle onto the glass before carefully removing the excess liquid and allowing to dry. Mounted organoid sections were additionally fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min followed by three washes with PBS. Prior to staining, the organoid sections were washed with the elution buffer three times for 5 min as a form of mild antigen retrieval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Staining</title><p>Once mounted, sections were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in a blocking solution containing PBS with 3% donkey serum, 0.5% Triton-X, and 0.025% PFA (PBS++). Sections were incubated in the primary antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), diluted in the blocking solution, for between two to four nights, depending on the efficacy of the antibodies, shaking at 4°C. Following the primary antibody incubations, the tissue was washed two times with PBS for 5 min and then blocked with PBS++ for 1 hr at room temperature. Sections were incubated with secondary antibodies, diluted at a ratio of 1:250 along with DAPI at 1:1000 in PBS++, for 3 hr shaking at room temperature, after which the tissue was washed three times with PBS for 5 min. Once the secondary antibody solutions were added all liquid handling was conducted in low light until the antibodies were eluted to reduce the chance of fluorophore crosslinking. The imaging buffer was added at least 5 min prior to imaging to ensure the penetrance of the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Imaging</title><p>Before imaging, fresh imaging buffer was prepared by dissolving 0.7 M N-Acetyl-Cysteine in 0.2 M phosphate buffer, using 10 M NaOH to adjust the pH to 7.40. Approximately 500 µl of the imaging buffer was added to each well. All 4i images were taken on a Zeiss LSM800 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Images from tile scans were exported using Carl Zeiss ZEN Blue software and stitched using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). For the aging study, DG image stacks were taken with a 20× magnification objective with a 0.8 numerical aperture and composed of tile regions with 10 tiles (5×2), with a pixel resolution of 1024×1024 per tile for a scale of 3.2055 pixels/µm with 16-bit pixel depth. Image stacks consisted of 40 frames acquired with a z-step interval of 1 µm and were used for all quantifications. High-resolution close-ups were acquired with a 40× magnification objective with a 1.1 numerical aperture in a water immersion (Zeiss Immersol W 2010) at a pixel resolution of 2048×2048 with a z-step size of 0.5 µm for 80 frames. These 40× images were used as example images in figures. All acquisitions were done with bi-directional scanning with a pixel dwell time of 2.06 µs. Within each cycle, all samples were labeled with the same antibodies, and imaged with identical microscopy settings for laser power, gain, digital offset, pinhole diameter, and z-step.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Elution</title><p>A stock solution containing 0.5 M L-Glycine, 3 M Urea, and 3 M Guanidine hydrochloride was prepared and kept at 4°C. Prior to elution, 0.07 M (0.02 g/ml) TCEP-HCl was added to a volume of the stock solution determined by multiplying the number of wells by the working volume of 150 µl by three washes. The pH of the buffer was then lowered to 2.5 using 5 M HCl to facilitated denaturation of the antibodies. The tissue was first rinsed with dH<sub>2</sub>O, then 150 µl of dH<sub>2</sub>O followed by 150 µl of the elution buffer was added to each well, shaken for 5 min, and repeated for a total of three washes. After elution, the tissue was washed three times for 5 min in PBS, after which the blocking step for the next round of IF could be started.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image alignment</title><p>To achieve accurate alignment between rounds of staining, images were registered using consistent DAPI intensity patterns. At a high digital zoom, the x and y coordinates, as well as the stack position of pixels in DAPI puncta that were recognizable across cycles and were measured. Images were transformed in the x and y planes to align to the image from the first round, with the canvas size being adjust so no image cropped and data was lost. For alignment in the z-plane, blank frames were added or frames lacking positive fluorescent signal were subtracted from the image stack accordingly using the ‘Add Slice’ and ‘Delete Slice’ functions in ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Antigenicity test</title><p>Two brain sections from 2-month-old mice were mounted and stained for all 18 antibodies used in the main study. Regions of the DG were imaged with a Zeiss LSM800 confocal laser-scanning microscope at 20× with the same parameters as in the main study. The sections were then subjected to six rounds of elution washes (3×5 min). The brain sections were incubated with the same secondary antibodies used in the first round and re-imaged to confirm successful antibody removal. A subsequent cycle of staining and imaging was performed with the same primary and secondary antibody combinations as in the first round (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Images across cycles were acquired using the same microscope settings (laser power, gain, digital offset, pinhole diameter, and z-step). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around positive cells in images from the first cycle and fluorescent intensities were measured in the same cells from the two rounds of staining as well as following elution and were correlated. For KI67, phosphorylated histone-3, and parvalbumin, too few cells were present in the sections to correlate values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image analysis</title><p>All quantifications were performed on non-projected 3D z-stack images with cells being sampled throughout the entire thickness of the image. All measures of density and intensity were performed on 16-bit images, while volumetric analyses were performed using 8-bit binary representations of the original images.</p><p>Cell counting: R cells were defined by HOPX<sup>+</sup>/SOX2<sup>+</sup> soma with a clear vertical process that was also GFAP<sup>+</sup> and S100β<sup>−</sup>. ROIs were created outlining the cell soma using the polygon selection tool in Fiji, which were saved and later used to measure fluorescent intensities of stem cell markers HOPX, and MT3, the intensity of the nuclear envelope protein LaminB1, as well as checking for the presence of the cell cycle marker KI67. NR glia-like cells in cell cycle were identified by being KI67<sup>+</sup> and located within the lower granular cell layer or SGZ extending approximately 20 µm beyond the hilar edge of the GCL. Immature neurons were counted using DCX. Positive cells had a clear ring of non-nuclear staining that encircled a significant majority of the cell (approx. 75%). Glial cell types, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, were identified as being S100β<sup>+</sup>, IBA1<sup>+</sup>, or NG2+, respectively. All cells were counted throughout the entire images using the Cell Counter plugin in Fiji using localization identifiers for the ML, hilus/CA3, and the supra and infrapyramidal blades of the GCL. The areas of the hippocampal subregions were measured. Cell density was calculated by dividing the number of cells by the regional volume expressed as mm<sup>3</sup> (region area [mm<sup>2</sup>] × tissue thickness [0.04 mm]).</p><p>Fluorescent intensity was measured in the z-position in which it was brightest for each cell. Measures were normalized to the background intensity, which was averaged from five ROIs per slice containing no positive cells within the GCL. Cells were normalized to the background of the representative slice in which the cells were measured to account for any gradient in fluorescent intensity caused by unequal antibody penetrance. The fluorescent intensity of LaminB1 was measured in R cells, immature neurons, and PV interneurons using the ROIs generated during cell counting. For glial cell types, 100 cells were selected at random throughout the imaged hippocampal structures and somatic ROIs were drawn. To ensure accurate measurement, if necessary, ROIs were adjusted to better fit the LaminB1 outline. Intensity measures were normalized to the background, which was averaged from five ROIs per slice throughout the tissue containing no positive signal. Like with the RGL markers, normalization was slice specific to account for a gradient in intensity across the z-plane. The ROIs made to measure LaminB1 in S100β<sup>+</sup> astrocytes were also used to measure the intensities of HOPX and MT3 in astrocytes.</p><p>Vasculature dimensions: All measures of vasculature dimensions were conducted using CollagenIV staining within the visible areas of the hippocampus (areas of the thalamus were excluded). To calculate vasculature density, volumes were generated based on Cavalieri’s principle, summing the area of blood vessels in each slice of an image stack and dividing by the tissue volume. Vasculature areas were measured by applying a 3D Gaussian blur with pixel radii of 2, 2, and 1.5 in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, thresholding at a fluorescence intensity of 1500, followed by two binary erosions to generate an accurate binary representation of the CollagenIV staining.</p><p>Cellular interactions: Cellular interactions were estimated by measuring the area of colocalization of cell markers on the vasculature and RGL processes. RGL processes were manually isolated from vasculature in Nestin stains by outlining Nestin<sup>+</sup> RGL processes into an ROI and clearing the outside. Binary representations were created the same as was done for CollagenIV for CD13, GFAP, and the isolated Nestin processes with thresholding at lower intensity limits of 1800, 5250, and 2000, respectively. For NG2, and IBA1, a median filter with a radius of 2 pixels was applied and thresholds were applied at 5500 and 2000, respectively. ROIs were generated by creating selections around the binary CollagenIV and Nestin, which were then applied to the other stains, measuring the area of positive pixels within the ROIs. The measured areas were normalized to the total ROI areas to get percent of coverage. S100β was excluded from all contact and volumetric analyses as the level of background prevented the creation of accurate binary representations.</p><p>Randomized niche mapping: Binary representations of DCX, HOPX, SOX2, PV, ARC, and KI67 were generated in the same manner as CollagenIV with thresholds set at 2500, 2200, 1600, 4300, 2500, and 2000, respectively. In generating binaries with intensity thresholding, Arc and Ki67 images had small false positive puncta and required additional processing to remove these background elements. Particle analysis was run to select all for positive cells using a lower area limit of 25 µm for ARC, and 15 µm for Ki67. ROIs were saved and used to draw the cells onto a blank canvas. To generate randomized sample regions, ROIs were created around the GCL using maximum z-projections of DAPI stains, which were then overlaid and filled in white on a blank image. A second equivalent blank image was subdivided by drawing vertical white bars extending the height of the canvas with a width of 1 pixel, spaced 160 pixels apart, equivalent to 50 µm in the microscope image scale. The filled representation of the GCL was multiplied with the image containing the bars resulting in an image with white bars spaced 160 pixels apart, fit to the shape and spanning the width of the blades of the GCL. ROIs were created for each bar individually by particle analysis. On a blank canvas, the bars were filled and an intensity gradient distance map was generated around it. The pixels in the bar had an intensity value of 0, with intensities increasing by one with each pixel radiating away from the origin until a value of 255. The binary representations of ARC, CD13, CollagenIV, DCX, GFAP, HOPX, IBA1, Ki67, Nestin, NG2, PV, SOX2, and S100β, which were divided by 255 so the new intensity value was 1. The binary distance maps for each bar were multiplied against the divided binary images created an image with 8-bit intensity profile representative of the distance from the point of origin. Analyzing the histogram of the resulting images provided the areas and spatial distribution of positive signal for each stain within the distance map. Areas of stains were summed within the distance maps to up to a 160 pixel (50 µm) radius, which provided adequate and contiguous sampling of the GCL, bordering areas of the hilus, and inner ML. The areas were also summed across the z-stack creating volumes. These were normalized by dividing by the total volume sampled by the distance map and reported as a percentage.</p><p>Targeted niche mapping: Distance maps were generated around the Nestin<sup>+</sup> R cell processes, and proliferating cells, and measured against the binary representations of cells the same as was done for the randomized probing. Nestin-labeled R cell processes were measured as a whole per section. Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells were isolated using particle analysis on the maximum intensity z-projection. ROIs were created around the cells and individually applied to the 3D binary to clear signal outside of the cell of interest. Stain volumes were binned at 5 µm intervals and divided by the total measured volume and reported as percent coverage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For all analyses, an alpha level was set at 0.05. To assess preservation of antigenicity Pearson correlations were performed on the normalized intensity values of isolated cells or ROIs. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare counted cell densities, as well as quiescent cell marker and LaminB1 intensities of DCX-labeled immature neurons and PV interneurons between the 2- and 12-month groups. The standard deviations between age groups were significantly different for the intensities of LaminB1 in R cells, IBA1-labeled microglia, and S100β<sup>+</sup> astrocytes so they were compared using Welch’s t-tests. One-way ANOVAs were performed to assess differences between ages in vascular densities, blood vessel coverage, randomized microniche volumes, and stem cell contact measures. These analyses were followed by post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests. When data failed the Brown-Forsythe test for equal variances, Welch’s ANOVA tests were run with Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons. For the microniche volumetric measures, Games-Howell’s multiple comparisons were used to account for the large group sizes. In comparing spots identified as young and old, Nestin high and low, and KI67 positive and negative, multiple unpaired t-tests were performed with Holms-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons. Microenvironments surrounding radial processes and proliferating cells were analyzed using mixed-effects model analysis and Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5"

The conclusion from this analysis should be toned down.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I recommend strengthening the reporting of the methods, including examples of the specific analysis, and providing high resolution single-channel images demonstrating colocalisation and associations.

We now carefully avoid the term “aged” when describing results for 12-month-old mice. We also more explicitly introduced what we refer to by the term “advancing age”. We had not meant to portray our findings in the context of “aged” mice (where we fully agree that older mice, e.g., 18-24 month-old, should have been used) but rather in the context of “advancing age”, which we define as functional alteration based on chronological age of an individual/tissue. Maturation until mid-life cannot be ruled out but given that in mice and humans function of cells seems to decline rather early on in life (certainly around the first third of the maximum life span if not much earlier), we do not believe that the changes in neurogenesis (dramatic decline of newborn neurons compared to sexually mature, young adult, 2-month-old mice) seen in 12-month-old mice purely reflect “maturation” of that brain area. We understand that the use of “aged” is not just semantics. However, we do feel that the use of the term “advanced age” is certainly justified and together with the introductory remarks now included will not mislead the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is no evidence that staining for the different antibodies used works as well in the 2-month and 12-month-old sections (except for the similar expression levels of LaminB1 in some cell types), expression of a protein that is not expected to change between the two stages should be analysed alongside the proteins analysed, as a control of consistency in antibody staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have now included novel data showing that</p><p>HOPX and MT3 – showing altered expression levels in neurogenic progenitors – do not change expression levels in classical astrocytes with age (please refer to revised Figure 4C). Furthermore, we do show that changes of LB1 with age are cell type specific (please refer to revised Figure 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In contrast with the thorough characterisation of neural stem cells, other cell types in the niche are identified with only one marker.

This could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern and have now extended the discussion accordingly. Please refer to page 15 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The comparison of the intensity of antibody labelling before and after 6 rounds of elution (Figure 1E) is an important validation of the method. However it should be conducted systematically for each antibody used in 4i as different epitopes recognised by different antibodies may differ in their sensitivity to the elution process.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we have now performed the suggested experiments. The new data are included in the revised extended data Figure 1. Furthermore, we have now added a more detailed description how “new” antibodies should be tested. Please refer to page 5 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>“To assess potential effects of cyclic staining and repeated elutions on sample antigenicity, adult brain sections were stained with the 18 antibodies used in the present study, imaged, and subsequently subjected to six rounds of elution prior to restaining. Measured fluorescence intensities between the stainings before and after rounds of elution were strongly correlated (Figure 1E and Figure 1 Supplemental), indicating that antigenicity is preserved across repeated cycles of iterative immunostainings for most of the antibodies that we used in tissue sections, similar to the high reproducibility that 4i achieves in cultured cells (Gut et al., 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the same figure, have the authors verified that not only the secondary antibody but also the primary antibody is eluted in each cycle (by re-incubating the eluted sections with the secondary antibody only)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed the suggested experiments, again corroborating the results that were obtained using cultured cells (Gut et al., 2018 Science). The new data are included in the revised extended data Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I find it somewhat counterintuitive that microniches from 2-month-old animals segregate into two groups of young-like and old-like spots rather than forming a continuum between these two states (Figure 6C). Please discuss the implications.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the microniches in 2-month-old mice do represent a continuum in a PCA (indicated by the stretch on component 1). However, there are already at the 2 months time point microniches that do resemble microniches in the DG of mice with more advanced age. We have discussed this finding now more explicitly. Please refer to page 10 and 11 of the revised manuscript. The split between young and old was manufactured by K-means clustering expecting two groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Proximity of radial processes with CollagenIV and CD13 diminishes between 2- and 6-months and increases between 6- and 12- months. There is therefore no clear trend in the changes that occur across the lifespan. This cast some doubt on the significance of the analysis and the results obtained. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that stem cell contacts with CollagenIV are reduced at 6 months compared to 2-month-old mice and then increased between 6- and 12-month-old mice (CD13 is not different between 2- and 6-month-old mice). These are the data we observed that may indicate that the situation is distinct between 6- and 12-month-old mice. We do not understand how that result may “cast some doubt on the significance of the analysis”: it would be rather unlikely if the changes we observed would all follow a linear trajectory. However, we have extended the presentation of that finding and also followed the reviewer’s advice to tone down conclusions regarding contact sites (please refer to changes on page 11 and 12).</p><p>“To analyze possible interactions between R cells and other cell types in the niche, the area of cell marker co-localization (i.e., proximity) was measured. In general, a greater percentage of radial processes in 12-month-old animals were in close proximity with niche cell markers for vasculature, pericytes, and microglia, than in younger mice (Figure 7A-B). R cell processes were preferentially close to the vasculature in areas with low pericyte coverage (negative for CD13) (Licht et al., 2020), but co-localization of radial processes with CD13-labeled pericytes was increased at 12 months compared to at 2 months (Figure 7A-B). Further, the number of close proximity potential contact sites with IBA1-labeled microglia increased with age, while proximity between R cells and OPCs remained unchanged (Figure 7A-B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 7A-B, the authors conduct an analysis of contact sites of radial stem cells with other cell types in the niche. However the analysis does not seem to have enough spatial resolution to conclude that NSCs contact other niche cells rather than being in proximity but without contact. The conclusion from this analysis should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have modified the description of our results accordingly.
