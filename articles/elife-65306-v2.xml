The network of interactions these microbes establish with their host and among each other is suggested to contribute to the immune responses of plants against pathogens. In wild <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> populations, the oomycete pathogen <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic> plays an influential role in structuring the leaf phyllosphere. We show that the epiphytic yeast <italic>Moesziomyces bullatus</italic> ex <italic>Albugo</italic> on Arabidopsis, a close relative of pathogenic smut fungi, is an antagonistic member of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> phyllosphere, which reduces infection of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> by <italic>A. laibachii</italic>. Combination of transcriptomics, reverse genetics, and protein characterization identified a GH25 hydrolase with lysozyme activity as a major effector of this microbial antagonism. Our findings broaden the understanding of microbial interactions within the phyllosphere, provide insights into the evolution of epiphytic basidiomycete yeasts, and pave the way for novel biocontrol strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Much like the ‘good bacteria’ that live in our guts, many microscopic organisms can co-exist with and even benefit the plants they live on.

While some microbes enter the plant and establish endophytic interactions with a broad range of outcomes from beneficial to pathogenic, plant surfaces harbor a large variety of microbial organisms. Recent research has focused largely on the importance of the rhizosphere microbiota in nutrient acquisition, protection from pathogens, and boosting overall plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ritpitakphong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Walker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulgarelli et al., 2013</xref>). However, the above ground parts of the plant including the phyllosphere are colonized by diverse groups of microbes that also assist in plant protection and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mikiciński et al., 2016</xref>). The environment has a major impact on the microbial communities of the leaf surface, ultimately influencing their interactions with the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stone et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Scale-free network analysis was performed with the leaf microbial population of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agler et al., 2016</xref>). The majority of the interactions between kingdoms, e.g. fungi and bacteria, were found to be negative, consistent with the fact that rather the antagonistic interactions stabilize a microbial community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coyte et al., 2015</xref>). Phyllosphere network analysis of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> identified a small number of microbes as ‘hub’ organisms, i.e. influential microbes that have severe effects on the community structure. The major hub microbe in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> phyllosphere is the oomycete <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic>, which is a pathogenic symbiont biotrophic of Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agler et al., 2016</xref>). This pathogen has been shown to significantly reduce the bacterial diversity of epiphytic and endophytic leaf habitats. Since bacteria generally comprise a large proportion of the phyllosphere microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vorholt, 2012</xref>), phylogenetic profiling of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> was also directed toward identifying a small group of bacteria that frequently colonize <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaves. The analysis helped to develop a synthetic community of bacteria for experiments in gnotobiotic plants.</p><p>Besides bacteria and oomycetes, the microbiota of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaf also comprises a broad range of fungi. Among those fungi, basidiomycete yeasts are frequently found and the most frequent ones are the epiphytic basidiomycete genus Dioszegia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agler et al., 2016</xref>), as well as an anamorphic yeast associated with <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infection belonging to the Ustilaginales. This order includes many pathogens of important crop plants, for example corn smut and loose smut of oats, barley, and wheat are caused by <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, <italic>U. avenae</italic>, <italic>U. nuda</italic>, and <italic>U. tritici</italic>, respectively. Generally, the pathogenic development of smut fungi is linked with sexual recombination and plant infection is only initiated upon mating, when two haploid sporidia form a dikaryotic filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brefort et al., 2009</xref>). Ustilaginales <italic>Pseudozyma</italic> sp. yeasts, however, are found mostly in their anamorphic stage in nature. They tend to epiphytically colonize a wide range of habitats, where an infrequent sexual recombination might occur when they meet on a susceptible host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kruse et al., 2017</xref>). Phylogenetic reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kruse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) showed that the smut pathogen of millet, <italic>Moesziomyces bullatus</italic> and four species of Pseudozyma, namely <italic>P. antarctica</italic>, <italic>P. aphidis</italic>, <italic>P. parantarctica</italic>, and <italic>P. rugulosa</italic> form a monophyletic group. The latter do represent anamorphic and culturable stages of <italic>M. bullatus</italic> and, hence, can be grouped to this genus. Moesziomyces strains have been reported in a number of cases to act as microbial antagonists. A strain formerly classified as <italic>Pseudozyma aphidis</italic> (now <italic>M. bullatus</italic>) inhibited <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pv. <italic>vesicatoria</italic>, <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic>, <italic>Clavibacter michiganensis</italic>, <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>, and <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> in vitro and also led to the activation of induced defense responses in tomato against the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barda et al., 2015</xref>). It was reported that <italic>P. aphidis</italic> can parasitize the hyphae and spores of <italic>Podosphaera xanthii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gafni et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Pseudozyma churashimaensis</italic> was reported to induce systemic defense in pepper plants against <italic>X. axonopodis</italic>, Cucumber mosaic virus, Pepper mottle virus, Pepper mild mottle virus, and broad bean wilt virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we explored the antagonistic potential of an anamorphic Ustilaginales yeast within the leaf microbial community of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. We show that <italic>Moesziomyces bullatus</italic> ex <italic>Albugo</italic> on Arabidopsis (which will be referred to as <italic>MbA</italic> from further on) prevents infection by the oomycete pathogen <italic>A. laibachii</italic> and identified fungal candidate genes that were upregulated in the presence of <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, when both microbes were co-inoculated to the host plant. A knockout mutant of one of the candidates, which belongs to the glycoside hydrolase – family 25 (GH25) – was found to lose its antagonistic activity toward <italic>A. laibachii,</italic> providing mechanistic insights into fungal-oomycete antagonism within the phyllosphere microbiota. Functional characterization of GH25 will be an important step toward establishing <italic>MbA</italic> as a suitable biocontrol agent.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In a previous study we isolated a basidiomycetous yeast from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaves infected with the causal agent of white rust, <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agler et al., 2016</xref>). This yeast was tightly associated with <italic>A. laibachii</italic> spore propagation. Even after years of subculturing in the lab and re-inoculation of plants with frozen stocks of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> isolate Nc14, this yeast remained highly abundant in spore isolates. Phylogenetic analyses based on fungal ITS-sequencing identified the yeast as <italic>Pseudozyma</italic> sp. Those yeasts can be found across the family of Ustilaginaceae, being closely related to pathogens of monocots like maize, barley, sugarcane, or sorghum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>). Based on phylogenetic similarity to the pathogenic smut <italic>Moesziomyces bullatus</italic> which infects millet, several anamorphic Pseudozyma isolates were suggested to be renamed and grouped to <italic>M. bullatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Since the <italic>Pseudozyma</italic> sp. that was isolated from <italic>A. laibachii</italic> spores groups into the same cluster, we classified this newly identified strain as <italic>MbA (Moesziomyces bullatus</italic> ex <italic>Albugo</italic> on Arabidopsis).</p><p>Based on the identification of <italic>MbA</italic> as having a significant effect on bacterial diversity in the Arabidopsis phyllosphere, we tested its interaction with 30 bacterial strains from 17 different species of a synthetic bacterial community (SynCom, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) of Arabidopsis leaves in one-to-one plate assays. This experiment identified seven strains being inhibited by Moesziomyces, as indicated by halo formation after 7 days of co-cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, this inhibition was not seen when the pathogenic smut fungus <italic>U. maydis</italic> was co-cultivated with the bacteria, indicating a specific inhibition of the bacteria by <italic>MbA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The primary hub microbe in the Arabidopsis phyllosphere was found to be the pathogenic oomycete <italic>A. laibachii,</italic> which was isolated in direct association with Moesziomyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agler et al., 2016</xref>). To test if both species interfere with each other, we deployed a gnotobiotic plate system and quantified <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infection symptoms on Arabidopsis. In control experiments, spray inoculation of only <italic>A. laibachii</italic> spores on Arabidopsis leaves led to about 33% infected leaves at 14 days post infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). When the bacterial SynCom was pre-inoculated on leaves 2 days before <italic>A. laibachii</italic> spores a significant reduction of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infection by about 50% was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, if Moesziomyces was pre-inoculated with the bacterial SynCom, <italic>A. laibachii</italic> spore production was almost completely abolished. Similarly, the pre-inoculation of only <italic>MbA</italic> resulted in an almost complete loss of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infection, independently of the presence of a bacterial community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The antagonistic effect of <italic>MbA</italic> toward <italic>A. laibachii</italic> was further confirmed using Trypan blue staining of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infected <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaves. <italic>A. laibachii</italic> forms long, branching filaments on Arabidopsis leaves at 15 dpi. Contrarily, in the presence of <italic>MbA</italic>, we observed mostly zoospores forming either no or very short hyphae, while further colonization of the leaf with long, branching was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, our findings demonstrate that <italic>MbA</italic> holds a strong antagonistic activity toward <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, resulting in efficient biocontrol of pathogen infection. Thus, <italic>MbA</italic> is an important member of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> phyllosphere microbial community, with a strong impact on its quantitative composition. However, despite several reports of the basidiomycete yeasts acting as antagonists, genome information of this group is rather limited. To enable a molecular understanding of how <italic>MbA</italic> acts on other members of the phyllosphere community, <italic>MbA</italic> genome information is required. We therefore sequenced the genome of <italic>MbA</italic> and established molecular tools including a protocol for stable genomic transformation to allow functional genetic approaches.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Infection assay of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> on <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.</title><p>Addition of a bacterial SynCom reduces the infection symptoms of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> at 14 days post infection.

Induction of appressoria formation in vitro can be induced by adding 100 µM of the cutin monomer 16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid (HDD) to the fungal cells prior to cell spraying onto a hydrophobic surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mendoza-Mendoza et al., 2009</xref>). In the absence of HDD, only about 8% of the <italic>U. maydis</italic> SG200 cells and 14% of the <italic>MbA</italic> cells formed appressoria on parafilm 24 hr after spraying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Many smut fungi including the model species <italic>U. maydis</italic> are dimorphic organisms. In their saprophytic phase they grow as haploid non-pathogenic yeast cells. Only on appropriate host surfaces, haploid cells switch to filamentous growth and expression of pathogenicity-related genes is only activated upon mating in the filamentous dikaryon. A prime prerequisite for pathogenic development is therefore the ability of mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bölker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nadal and Gold, 2010</xref>). Our genome analysis identified a tetrapolar mating system with a complete set of mating genes in <italic>MbA</italic>. Looking more closely on the phylogeny of different mating genes it appears that all sequenced Moesziomyces strains have the same pheromone receptor type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together with our unsuccessful mating assays, this suggests that all sequenced strains of this species have the same mating type and, therefore, are unable to mate. Mating type bias after spore germination was reported for <italic>Ustilago bromivora,</italic> which leads to a haplo-lethal allele linked to the MAT-2 locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rabe et al., 2016</xref>). In this case, an intratetrad mating event rescues pathogenicity in nature as the second mating partner is not viable after spore germination. Together with the observation that anamorphic Moesziomyces yeasts are ubiquitous in nature, one could hypothesize that these fungi are highly competitive in their haploid form and antagonism might have led to the selection of one viable mating type. This eventually adapted to the epiphytic life style. At the same time, one should not dismiss the possibility that in the presence of a viable mating partner and suitable host surface, the yeasts can undergo potential sexual reproduction and thereby revitalizing the gene pool from time to time.</p><p>Transcriptome analysis showed that epiphytic growth of <italic>MbA</italic> on <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leads to massive transcriptional changes particularly in primary metabolism, which might reflect adaptation to the nutritional situation on the plant surface.

Initially discovered in the fungi <italic>Chalaropsis</italic> sp., this group of proteins is largely present in bacteria as well as phages, for example the germination-specific muramidase from <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> S40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 1997</xref>). The bacterial muramidase, cellosyl from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rau et al., 2001</xref>), also belongs to the Chalaropsis type of lysozyme. These proteins are proposed to cleave the β-1,4-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) in the bacterial peptidoglycan. Specifically, the β-1,4 N,6-O-diacetylmuramidase activity allows the Chalaropsis type lysozyme to degrade the cell wall of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, in contrast to the commercially available HEWL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rau et al., 2001</xref>). Despite differences in structure and molecular weight from HEWL, the GH25 of MbA has lysozyme activity against the gram positive bacterium <italic>Micrococcus lysodeikticus</italic> in a fluorogenic assay. This highlights the overall biochemical functionality of the recombinant glycoside hydrolase. The glycoside Hydrolase 25 family is predicted to have an active site motif DXE that is highly conserved across the fungal kingdom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). The structure of glycoside hydrolase family 25 from <italic>Aspergillus fumigates</italic> was characterized and the presence of N-terminal signal peptide was considered to indicate an extracellular secretion of the protein with possible antimicrobial properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korczynska et al., 2010</xref>). The role of the secreted hydrolase in the fungal kingdom is not completely explored yet. The presence of such hydrolases has in many cases been hypothesized to be associated with hyperparasitism of fungi parasitizing fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyde et al., 2019</xref>) or oomycetes parasitizing oomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horner et al., 2012</xref>). Our results might therefore indicate a cross kingdom hyperparasitism event between a fungus and an oomycete. Previous work on microbial communities has indicated that negative interactions stabilize microbial communities. Hyperparasitism is such a negative interaction with a strong eco-evolutionary effect on pathogen–host interactions and therefore on community stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parratt and Laine, 2016</xref>). <italic>MbA</italic> might therefore regulate <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infection and reduce disease severity. The qPCR evaluation of oomycete biomass strongly points toward the idea that <italic>A. laibachii</italic> is a direct target of antagonism for MBA. Since we observed reduced formation of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> in the presence of <italic>MbA</italic>, we also tested if the GH25 lysozyme would suppress zoospore germination. However, we could not detect a significant reduction of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> zoosporangia germination upon treatment with active GH25 lysozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting that the GH25 lysozyme interferes with <italic>A. laibachii</italic> at a later stage of infection. As <italic>A. laibachii</italic> has been shown to reduce microbial diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agler et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>MbA</italic> might increase diversity through hyperparasitism of <italic>A. laibachii</italic>. At the same time this increased diversity might have caused the need for more secondary metabolites to evolve in the <italic>MbA</italic> genome to defend against niche competitors. Through its close association with <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, <italic>MbA</italic> could be a key regulator of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> microbial diversity and therefore relevant for plant health beyond the regulation of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infection.</p><p>In conclusion, the secreted hydrolase we identified as a main factor of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> inhibition has great potential to act as antimicrobial agent. The isolated compound is not only valuable per se in an ecological context. It can further lay the grounds for exploring other microbial bioactive compounds that mediate inter-species and inter-kingdom crosstalk. A main goal of our future studies will be to understand on the mechanistic level, how the GH-25 suppresses <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, and at which developmental step the oomycete infection is blocked. It will be particularly interesting to elucidate if and how the GH25 enzyme activity directly interferes with the <italic>A. laibachii</italic> cell wall. While the canonical lysozyme substrate is found in bacterial cell walls, a detailed biochemical characterization of substrate specificity will be required to pinpoint potential target sites in the oomycete cell wall. Also, to the best of our knowledge there is no detailed information on the <italic>A. laibachii</italic> cell wall structure and composition. One could speculate if GH25 activity directly affects cell wall integrity of <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, or if a modification of the cell wall structure interferes with pathogenic development, e.g. by interfering with cellular differentiation, blocking signal perception, or by triggering a host defense response.</p><p>Since the GH-25 enzyme is well conserved among Ustilaginales including pathogenic species, it will also be tempting to elucidate whether the species-specific antagonism identified here is broadly conserved among Ustilaginales fungi and oomycetes. We further will investigate potential responses by the host plant and how this impacts <italic>A. laibachii</italic> growth upon <italic>MbA</italic> colonization. Functional investigation of these interactions can provide meaningful insights as to why certain yeasts prefer to colonize specific environments. At the same time, it will be worth exploring how the basidiomycete yeasts influence the bacterial major colonizers of the phyllosphere.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>MbA_g2490</italic>)</td><td>g2490</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>DH5α</td><td>Other</td><td/><td>Doehlemann lab</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Pichia pastoris</italic>)</td><td>KM71H-OCH</td><td>Other</td><td/><td>Doehlemann lab</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Monoclonal 6x-His tag antibody</td><td>Sigma (St. Louis; Mississippi; USA)</td><td/><td>1/10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse IgG <break/>(Monoclonal)</td><td>Thermo Fischer Scientific (Waltham; Massachusetts; USA)</td><td/><td>1/3000</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pGAPzα (plasmid)</td><td>Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td><italic>A. thaliana</italic> EF1-α:forward</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruhe et al., 2016</xref></td><td>PCR primers</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">AAGGAGGCTGCTGAGATGAA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td><italic>A. thaliana</italic> EF1-α:reverse</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruhe et al., 2016</xref></td><td>PCR primers</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">TGGTGGTCTCGAACTTCCAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Oomycete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 5.8 s: forward</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruhe et al., 2016</xref></td><td>PCR primers</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">ACTTTCAGCAGTGGATGTCTA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Oomycete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 5.8 s: reverse</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruhe et al., 2016</xref></td><td>PCR primers</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">GATGACTCACTGAATTCTGCA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>EnzChek Lysozyme Assay Kit</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>E22013 <break/></td><td>Lysozyme activity assay</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Trypan blue stain</td><td>Sigma Aldrich <break/>(No. 302643)</td><td>CAS-Number: 72-57-1</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>MbA</italic> wild-type strain was isolated from <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infected <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaves [7].

mechanisms of microbe-microbe interactions in plant microbiota communities is of great fundamental interest, and promising for agricultural application for example in biocontrol. This study reports on a specific molecular player mediating antagonism by a leaf-surface dwelling yeast on an oblicate biotrophic oomycete pathogen. The yeast <italic>Moesziomyces bullatus ex Albugo</italic> (MbA) was isolated from the biotrophic pathogen oomycete <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic>, which acts as a hub organism in Arabidopsis phyllosphere microbiome. The study promotes the establishment of Mba as a leaf epiphytic model fungus, by providing a sequenced genome, the transcriptome in response to interaction with a phyllosphere bacterial SynCom and <italic>A. laibachii</italic> and by establishing a transformation system for generation of k. o. strains by homologous recombination. The authors report that MbA antagonizes the oomycete pathogen <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, via a putatively secreted GH25 hydrolase with lysozyme activity. This important finding provides novel insights into the yet elusive molecular mechanisms involved in shaping the microbiome community on leaf surfaces through microbe-microbe interactions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A fungal member of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> phyllosphere antagonizes <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic> via a putative secreted hydrolase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its present form.</p><p>Although the reviewers and ourself found the study original and the establishment of <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis</italic> as a genetic model as well as its characterization interesting, the reviewers detected several flaws, which prevent publication in <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>– the phylogenetic placing of &quot;<italic>Moesziomyces albugensis</italic>&quot; appears incorrect</p><p>– its mode of action on Albugo is not described and</p><p>– the GH25 enzyme and its function are not sufficiently characterized</p><p>We would be happy to consider an improved version of the manuscript, in which the reviewer comments have been addressed comprehensively; and which provides a better understanding of <italic>Moesziomyces</italic> action on Albugo and GH25 function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors establish <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis</italic> as a new &quot;model fungus&quot; at the leaf surface, which may act as a parasite on the pathogenic oomycete of Arabidopsis <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic>. They provide a sequenced genome, the transcriptome in response to interaction with the plant, phyllosphere bacteria and the oomycete <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, a transformation system for generation of k. o. strains by homologous recombination and characterize the mating type as well as filament and appressoria forming behavior in vitro.</p><p>In addition, they also report some interesting biology and show that <italic>M. albugensis</italic> antagonizes the oomycete pathogen <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, probably via a secreted putative GH25 hydrolase. This finding and other findings, that may be expected from this research line in the future, may yield biocontrol fungi to combat agriculturally relevant oomycete infections of crop leaves.</p><p>While M.albugensis is an exciting new fungus and the identification of the effector required for parasitism of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> is very interesting, the manuscript still suffers from a few unclarities.</p><p>– From the text I did not understand whether M. albugensis lives only epiphytically or can also colonize the plant tissue (it forms appressoria on hydrophobic surfaces) or whether it is exclusively associated with <italic>A. laibachii</italic>. This should be clarified.</p><p>– It is unclear how the bacterial SynCom was constructed and which isolates it contains.</p><p>– The quantification of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infection seems kind of rough and prone to subjectivity. An additional, more quantitative method should be used for quantification, for example by qPCR using an amplicon from <italic>A. laibachii</italic> DNA normalized to a plant amplicon.</p><p>– It is unclear whether GH25 hydrolase suppresses infection of plant leaves by <italic>A. laibachii</italic> or whether it helps <italic>M. albugensis</italic> to parasitize <italic>A. laibachii</italic> by other means. The authors should examine the effect of isolated GH25 hydrolase on <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infection.</p><p>– At which stage of infection is <italic>A. laibachii</italic> blocked by GH25 hydrolase or <italic>M. albugensis</italic>?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study by Eitzen et al., characterizes a yeast species isolated from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> phyllosphere classified as <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis</italic> (Ma). The report provides phylogenetic classification, genome analysis and functional analysis of Ma inhibitory activity towards the white rust oomycete <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic> (Al). Understanding functional interaction in the plant microbiota is a field of intense research with a great fundamental interest, as well as promising applied perspectives regarding the identification of novel biocontrol agents such as potentially Ma. I found the manuscript very pleasant to read and well structured. The work appeared rigorous and conclusions are appropriately supported by the available data. A number of biocontrol yeasts have been isolated in the past, but in my opinion this study stands out by providing direct genetic evidence of the anti-rust activity of Ma, through the identification of one underlying gene (encoding a putative GH25 enzyme) and the characterization of the corresponding mutant phenotype. The Ma genome sequence and gene expression data also provide an interesting resource for further analysis of the biology of this phyllosphere fungus.</p><p>1) I would have liked to see the activity of the GH25 characterized further. I am lacking a clear hint towards GH25 molecular activity on Al and possibly other members of the phyllosphere. Does ectopic (eg in plants) expression of GH25 has inhibitory effect on Albugo?

The new strain would just be an addition to that, there is little novelty in this.</p><p>Results. This argumentation is impossible to follow. Just because something is isolated from a special location does not make it a new species.</p><p>Results. I really cannot see the reason for the authors claiming again the identification was just &quot;<italic>Pseudozyma sp</italic>.&quot; while they could show in a previous manuscript [Kruse et al., 2017] that the species is Meosziomyces bullatus.</p><p>Results. This interaction does not need to be specific. The test against <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> is also difficult to justify, as that species is largely unrelated to <italic>Moesziomyces bullatus</italic>. Instead, other species of the genus <italic>Moesziomyces</italic>, especially additional strains of <italic>Moesziomyces bullatus</italic> should have been used.</p><p>Results. While in general, it is interesting that the yeast showed an antogonistic effect, dose dependency should have been checked. Several species of the Ustulagoinales are known to produce biosurfactants that alter the properties of the plant cuticle. Thus, the effect observed can probably already explained by this. This could be addressed by additional experiments with a variety of Ustilago and <italic>Moesziomyces</italic> strains and demonstrating that a lower dose of the Albugo-associated strain inhibits the infection.</p><p>Subsection “The genome of <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis”</italic>. This lacks a lot of the usual quality control, such as genome completeness statistics, read mapping specifics, testing of the gene predictions by RNA mapping.</p><p>Subsection “The genome of <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis”</italic>. Evidence should be presented that this is not the result of a mis-assembly.</p><p>Subsection “The genome of <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis”</italic>. Even though &quot;tempting&quot;, this speculation of the authors seems very far-fetched, considering that there are many unrelated groups of the Ustilaginales that cause tumors or not.</p><p>Subsection “The genome of <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis”</italic>. This part is interesting, but needs to be backed up by RNASeq and metabolic profiling.</p><p>Subsection “The genome of <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis”</italic>. If the authors reanalyzed that genome, they could probably see that most of the &quot;effector losses&quot; are the result of bad gene calls.</p><p>Subsection “The genome of <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis”</italic>. I wonder why the authors do not cite or discuss their own findings on several <italic>Moesziomyces</italic> species previously characterized as non-pathogenic. Ökmen et al., had found years ago that these yeasts possess functional copies of PEP1.</p><p>Subsection “The genome of <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis”</italic>. The interpretation here cannot be upheld. Given current data, it seems to be a specialty of Ustilago madis that the clusters are expanded (see e.g. Sharma et al., 2014). In addition, the &quot;loss&quot; or presence of the clusters is likely a simple function of phylogenetic distance. Judging from the unfortunately not well resolved phylogeny in [Wang et al., 2015], Kalmanozyma could simply be most unrelated to <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>.</p><p>Subsection “Genetic characterization of <italic>M. albugensis”</italic>. This is the first part of the manuscript that seems solid, even though I wonder why non infection trials on the natural host of <italic>Moesziomyces bullatus</italic> were done.</p><p>Subsection “Identification of microbe-microbe effector genes by RNA-Seq”. While this cell biology part is again rather solid, the conclusions seem much too strong. For stating that the secretion of GH25 is important, the authors would need to construct a non-secreted version under a native promotor. In addition, the metabolic profile would need to be analysed, both of the secreted metabolites and those retained in the cells. It is conceivable that the GH25 enzyme processes a non-effective precursor to generate the observed effect.</p><p>As many results obtained are already discussed in the Results section, the Discussion section is sometimes repetitive. I encourage the authors to keep the Results section free from interpretation and to do this in the Discussion section. As many incorrect claims are made again in the Discussion, I do not comment on them again.</p><p>Subsection “Bioinformatics and computational data analysis”. The information regarding the genome assembly and gene prediction is at best minimal. This needs to much extended, also including the necessary quality checks as indicated earlier.</p><p>Figure 1. This is hardly useful to present the &quot;phylogenetic position&quot; of the strain. There are much more elaborate phylogenies and the authors should simply refer to them. Also, the separation into &quot;apathogenic&quot; and &quot;pathogenic&quot; strains is pointless, as they confirm what was previously known. Likely there are no apathogenic members of the Ustilaginales and the yeasts have just by chance been isolated first from the environment before the pathogenic stage was discovered.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A fungal member of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> phyllosphere antagonizes <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic> via a secreted lysozyme&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They established the yeast <italic>Moesziomyces bullatus ex Albugo</italic> (MbA), which represents a hub organism in the Arabidopsis phyllosphere microbiome, as a leaf epiphytic model fungus, by providing a sequenced genome, the transcriptome in response to interaction with a phyllosphere bacterial SynCom and the oomycete <italic>A. laibachii</italic> and by establishing a transformation system for generation of k. o. strains by homologous recombination.</p><p>They report that M. bullatus ex Albugo antagonizes the oomycete pathogen <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, via a putatively secreted GH25 hydrolase with lysozyme activity. This finding, and other findings that may be expected from this research line in the future, do not only add to a molecular understanding of microbial interactions on the leaf surface but may in the future yield biocontrol fungi to combat agriculturally relevant oomycete infections of crop leaves.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Based on the major comments of all three reviewers and a discussion, we request to address the following points before the manuscript can be accepted by <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1) The reviewers found the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1 misleading (see also comments about the tree in the previous version of the manuscript). Since a more comprehensive and correct tree is published in Kruse et al., Figure 1 should be removed from the manuscript.</p><p>2) The GH25 hydrolase exhibits lysozyme activity, which hydrolyzes β‐(1,4) linkages between the NAM and NAG saccharides. These glucans are usually found on bacterial cell walls. However, to the reviewer's knowledge, the cell wall of oomycetes is composed of β-1,3, and β-1,6 glucans. How does GH25 hydrolase inhibit the oomycete <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic>? This question or hypotheses should be raised and discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>3) The Title states that GH25 is a secreted enzyme. Unless the authors include an experiment showing secretion, statements on secretion should be toned down in the title and across the manuscript where applicable.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors establish <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis</italic> as a new &quot;model fungus&quot; at the leaf surface, which may act as a parasite on the pathogenic oomycete of Arabidopsis <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic>. They provide a sequenced genome, the transcriptome in response to interaction with the plant, phyllosphere bacteria and the oomycete <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, a transformation system for generation of k. o. strains by homologous recombination and characterize the mating type as well as filament and appressoria forming behavior in vitro.</p><p>In addition, they also report some interesting biology and show that <italic>M. albugensis</italic> antagonizes the oomycete pathogen <italic>A. laibachii</italic>, probably via a secreted putative GH25 hydrolase. This finding and other findings, that may be expected from this research line in the future, may yield biocontrol fungi to combat agriculturally relevant oomycete infections of crop leaves.</p><p>While M.albugensis is an exciting new fungus and the identification of the effector required for parasitism of <italic>A. laibachii</italic> is very interesting, the manuscript still suffers from a few unclarities.</p><p>– From the text I did not understand whether <italic>M. albugensis</italic> lives only epiphytically or can also colonize the plant tissue (it forms appressoria on hydrophobic surfaces) or whether it is exclusively associated with <italic>A. laibachii</italic>. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for being unclear in this point. <italic>M. albugensis</italic> belongs to a group of basidiomycete yeasts that has been found to lead epiphytic existence on the leaf surface. However, since the recombinant, self-compatible strain (CB1) which we generated in this study was found to form appressoria on hydrophobic surface, this hints towards the idea that in nature, the anamorphic epiphytic yeasts might still own the potential to form filamentous structure in presence of a correct mating partner. However, this remains rather speculative because the general question of how the ustilaginean yeasts actually relate to pathogenic strains remains to be solved. We added an additional clarification in subsection “Genetic characterization of <italic>MbA”.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear how the bacterial SynCom was constructed and which isolates it contains.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not having included the Syn Com isolates list. We have added this to the supplementary now and have explained how the syncom was assembled: For this SynCom we had isolated bacteria from different sites close to Tuebingen in Germany and have sequenced partial 16S to identify taxonomy. Based on these isolates and how often we have found the bacteria on different sites (at least 85% of all sites), we assembled a community with maximum phylogenetic diversity. We have further isolated bacteria from spores of our unsterile <italic>A. laibachii</italic> Nc14 isolate and have added those to cover more phylogenetic diversity.</p><p>The detailed information is now available in the new Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The quantification of A. laibachii infection seems kind of rough and prone to subjectivity. An additional, more quantitative method should be used for quantification, for example by qPCR using an amplicon from A. laibachii DNA normalized to a plant amplicon.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for pointing this out. Our quantification method is based on the percentage of infected leaves vs non-infected leaves in each individual <italic>A. thaliana</italic> seedling. This method of counting pustules on leaves has been intensely used for evaluating rust fungal infections. As leaves of sterile Arabidopsis plants are small, there are no more than one to two pustules per leaf. Using this range would not give enough resolution to see significant differences and therefore we decided to analyze significant more plants and leaves and focus on presence and absence. For statistical analysis, infection percentage of each seedling is subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) for pairwise comparison of the conditions, with Tukey’s HSD test to determine significant differences among them (<italic>P</italic> values &lt;0.05). We performed the experiments in six independent biological replicates with 12 technical replicates and observed significant difference between the <italic>Albugo</italic> treated seedlings and <italic>Albugo</italic> + <italic>Moeziomyces</italic> treated ones. Hence, we are convinced that the data shown in our study is robust and statistically significant.</p><p>However, based on the suggestion of this reviewer, we performed qPCR-based relative quantification of the <italic>Albugo</italic> biomass in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> in our new experiments where samples were treated with GH25 hydrolase and Mutant_GH25, respectively (see new Figure 8D). These experiments provide direct evidence for the biological activity of the GH25 hydrolase: <italic>Albugo</italic> biomass was reduced to about 50% in GH25 treatments compared to Mutant GH25 or untreated <italic>Albugo-</italic>infections. This new data is now included in the Results section and the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear whether GH25 hydrolase suppresses infection of plant leaves by <italic>A. laibachii</italic> or whether it helps <italic>M. albugensis</italic> to parasitize A. laibachii by other means. The authors should examine the effect of isolated GH25 hydrolase on <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infection.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good question, and we think it is answered by the new data which is already mentioned in the point above: the plant infection experiments with the recombinant GH25 hydrolase show that it directly interferes with Albugo infection (see new Figure 8D). Based on this finding, our next question for upcoming work will be to elaborate the molecular mechanism by which the enzyme inhibits <italic>Albugo</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– At which stage of infection is <italic>A. laibachii</italic> blocked by GH25 hydrolase or <italic>M. albugensis</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed a slight but not significant decrease in zoosporangial germination efficiency on treatment with the GH25 hydrolase (new Figure 7—figure supplement 5) but found that plant colonization of Albugo is significantly reduced. This is also in line with the microscopic of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaves where colonization of <italic>Albugo</italic> is visualized by Trypan blue staining (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2). This shows that in presence of <italic>MbA</italic>, there is little to no colonization of <italic>Albugo</italic> in the leaf surface and only short hyphae are formed. We have also provided more information in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The study by Eitzen et al., characterizes a yeast species isolated from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> phyllosphere classified as <italic>Moesziomyces albugensis</italic> (Ma). The report provides phylogenetic classification, genome analysis and functional analysis of Ma inhibitory activity towards the white rust oomycete <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic> (Al). Understanding functional interaction in the plant microbiota is a field of intense research with a great fundamental interest, as well as promising applied perspectives regarding the identification of novel biocontrol agents such as potentially Ma. I found the manuscript very pleasant to read and well structured. The work appeared rigorous and conclusions are appropriately supported by the available data. A number of biocontrol yeasts have been isolated in the past, but in my opinion this study stands out by providing direct genetic evidence of the anti-rust activity of Ma, through the identification of one underlying gene (encoding a putative GH25 enzyme) and the characterization of the corresponding mutant phenotype. The Ma genome sequence and gene expression data also provide an interesting resource for further analysis of the biology of this phyllosphere fungus.</p><p>1) I would have liked to see the activity of the GH25 characterized further. I am lacking a clear hint towards GH25 molecular activity on Al and possibly other members of the phyllosphere.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we expressed the GH25 hydrolase (and an enzymatic inactive version) <italic>in Pichia pastoris,</italic> purified the proteins by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and performed lysozyme activity assays using the recombinant proteins. This showed that the GH25 has a lysozyme activity, which is abolished by a single amino acid exchange in the predicted active site. This data is now included in the manuscript (New Figure 8C) and is described in the Results and the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does ectopic (eg in plants) expression of GH25 has inhibitory effect on Albugo?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the question whether the GH25 lysozyme has a direct effect on <italic>Albugo</italic>, we used the recombinant protein. As mentioned above, we did not observe a significant effect on <italic>Albugo</italic> zoospore formation (New Figure 7—figure supplement 5). On the other hand, we found that treatment of <italic>Albugo</italic>-infected Arabidopsis with the active (but not with the inactive) GH25 significantly reduced <italic>Albugo</italic> growth (New Figure 8D). This provides direct evidence showing that the GH25 lysozyme is actually inhibiting infection of Arabidopsis by <italic>Albugo</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there any indication on which species would this enzyme act?

We have additionally attached the raw file for PRALINE multiple sequence analysis for conserved sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To what extent is GH25 activity beneficial to Ma?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, which we cannot answer based on experimental evidence so far. What we show is that the GH25 is required and responsible for the antagonism towards Albugo. One now could hypothesize that this antagonism itself is beneficial for Moesziomyces, i.e. for interspecific competition in niche differentiation. A final answer for this question, however, will be subject of future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the growth of this fungus be measured on Albugo-infected vs Albugo-free plants? in vitro with or without Albugo?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting thought, which will definitely be part of future analysis on the ecological role of the GH25 for <italic>Moesziomyces</italic> as a member of the leaf phyllosphere, particularly in presence of Albugo.

If the species was isolated from and found to be closely associated with the spores of Albugo, even over years of continuous cultivation cycles, how can the authors confidently claim that the species prevents infection?</p></disp-quote><p>The fungal isolate used in this study in particular has been found associated with <italic>Albugo</italic>-infected <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaf surface. Previous study (Agler et al., 2016) identified this strain of <italic>Moesziomyces</italic> as being a hub microbe in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> phyllosphere. In this study we provide direct, quantitative evidence that it antagonizes the infection of Arabidopsis by the biotrophic oomycete pathogen <italic>Albugo laibachii</italic> via the GH25 hydrolase. However, we do not want to claim that <italic>Moesziomyces sp.</italic> in general has such a function (to justify this claim, one basically would need to test every fungal isolate individually on the experimental level), and therefore we specified the findings to the individual isolate which we have studied in detail in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction. There are many strains of Moesziomyces bullatus (as Pseudozyma aphidis) that are marked as biocontrol agent. The new strain would just be an addition to that, there is little novelty in this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are several reports on biocontrol activity by <italic>Pseudozyma</italic> sp., which is also addressed in the introduction part of our manuscript. However, we are convinced that our study is not a mere description of an organism with biocontrol activity. An important aspect is on the multitrophic interactions in a phyllosphere microbial community, where <italic>MbA</italic> appears to be regulating the presence of several other microbes in the network. Another novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we haven’t externally introduced an organism to combat pathogenicity; since the yeast is found as a member of the microbial community in the natural environment. Most importantly, our RNAseq analysis revealed the transcriptional activation of secretory enzymes in <italic>MbA</italic> when being co-cultivated with Albugo on the plant leaf, and this approach identified the GH25 lysozyme as a key determinant for the observed microbial antagonism. To the best of our knowledge, this study shows for the first direct and functional evidence on the genetic and protein level in a fungal – oomycete antagonism on/in-planta. Thus, the novelty of this study is o on the (i) community aspect and (ii) the mechanistic evidence of the microbial antagonism, rather than in the identification of a new fungal isolate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results. This argumentation is impossible to follow. Just because something is isolated from a special location does not make it a new species.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results. I really cannot see the reason for the authors claiming again the identification was just &quot;Pseudozyma sp.&quot; while they could show in a previous manuscript [Kruse et al., 2017] that the species is Meosziomyces bullatus.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results. This interaction does not need to be specific. The test against <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> is also difficult to justify, as that species is largely unrelated to Moesziomyces bullatus. Instead, other species of the genus Moesziomyces, especially additional strains of Moesziomyces bullatus should have been used.</p></disp-quote><p>The intention of this experiment was to observe if there is any difference between the well-characterized pathogenic smut <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> and the <italic>MbA</italic> strain, which acts as a microbial hub in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> phyllosphere. As suggested by this reviewer, it would be interesting to test other strains of <italic>Moesziomyces bullatus</italic> against the bacterial SynCom and Albugo to test if there is specific adaptation towards microbial interactions in different isolates of the same species. These lines will surely be followed by our future research in this context, where we want to better explore the ecology Ustilaginales yeasts in different environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results. While in general, it is interesting that the yeast showed an antogonistic effect, dose dependency should have been checked. Several species of the Ustulagoinales are known to produce biosurfactants that alter the properties of the plant cuticle. Thus, the effect observed can probably already explained by this. This could be addressed by additional experiments with a variety of Ustilago and Moesziomyces strains and demonstrating that a lower dose of the Albugo-associated strain inhibits the infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Ustilaginales are known to produce biosurfactants and we would not like to exclude that these secondary metabolites have significant impact on the microbial interactions on the leaf surface. The focus and aim of this study, however, was to investigate possible functions of secreted proteins as potential microbe-microbe effectors. Thus, we decided to investigate the function of the GH25 in more detail and performed the characterization of the recombinant protein, showing that the active GH25 lysozyme is significantly inhibiting infection of Arabidopsis by <italic>A. laibachii</italic> (new Figure 8C,D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The genome of Moesziomyces albugensis”. This lacks a lot of the usual quality control, such as genome completeness statistics, read mapping specifics, testing of the gene predictions by RNA mapping.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this lack of information on the RNA seq experiment. Each file was checked for quality control of RNA-Seq reads prior to analysis with FastQC. Reads were mapped to the <italic>Moesziomyces</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome with Tophat2 and a count table was generated for <italic>Moesziomyces</italic> counts with HT-seq count. DE-genes were determined with using the &quot;limma&quot;-package in R on &quot;voom&quot;-transformed count data and sample-specific weighting to reduce variance between samples (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We have added additional information, in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The genome of Moesziomyces albugensis”. Evidence should be presented that this is not the result of a mis-assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1, which shows genomic comparison of <italic>MbA</italic> and <italic>Moesziomyces antarctica</italic> T-34 and confirms proper assembly..</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The genome of Moesziomyces albugensis”. Even though &quot;tempting&quot;, this speculation of the authors seems very far-fetched, considering that there are many unrelated groups of the Ustilaginales that cause tumors or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this statement is very speculative and therefore deleted the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The genome of Moesziomyces albugensis”. This part is interesting, but needs to be backed up by RNASeq and metabolic profiling.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis provided no evidence on upregulation of the secondary metabolite clusters in the RNA seq experiments, hence metabolic profiling was not performed further. Thus, we only speculate on them to be involved in antibacterial activity based on interaction of <italic>MbA</italic> against the SynCom bacterial members on plate (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The genome of Moesziomyces albugensis”. If the authors reanalyzed that genome, they could probably see that most of the &quot;effector losses&quot; are the result of bad gene calls.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not analyzed the <italic>P. flocculosa</italic> genome with respect to gene loss. To avoid misunderstanding, we modified the sentence to make it clearer that we only refer to the statement by Lefebvre et al., (2013), which is apparently not in line with our observation made for MbA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The genome of Moesziomyces albugensis”. I wonder why the authors do not cite or discuss their own findings on several Moesziomyces species previously characterized as non-pathogenic. Ökmen et al., had found years ago that these yeasts possess functional copies of PEP1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following in (subsection “The genome of <italic>MbA”)</italic> “<italic>Moesziomyces</italic> sp., possess functional homologues of the <italic>pep1</italic> gene, a core virulence effector of <italic>U. maydis</italic> (Sharma et al., 2019), suggesting that such anamorphic yeasts have the potential to form infectious filamentous structures by means of sexual reproduction (Kruse et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “The genome of Moesziomyces albugensis”. The interpretation here cannot be upheld. Given current data, it seems to be a specialty of Ustilago madis that the clusters are expanded (see e.g. Sharma et al., 2014). In addition, the &quot;loss&quot; or presence of the clusters is likely a simple function of phylogenetic distance. Judging from the unfortunately not well resolved phylogeny in [Wang et al., 2015], Kalmanozyma could simply be most unrelated to <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed the example of <italic>Kalmanozyma brasiliensis</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Genetic characterization of M. albugensis”. This is the first part of the manuscript that seems solid, even though I wonder why non infection trials on the natural host of Moesziomyces bullatus were done.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion by this reviewer. Actually, we tested two different cultivars of millet, <italic>Setaria</italic> sp. and <italic>Echinochloa crus-galli</italic> for susceptibility towards transgenic self-compatible (CB1) strain of <italic>Moesziomyces</italic> sp. However, we could not observe any penetration event in the plant surface, even though the organism was seen to be forming filamentous structure. The same was true for the self-compatible CB1 strain. Thus, we cannot make any statement on a potential role of the <italic>MbA</italic> isolate as a plant pathogen in our paper. On the one hand we were not able to infect a potential host, but on the other hand we also cannot exclude that under certain conditions it could be infectious.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Identification of microbe-microbe effector genes by RNA-Seq”. While this cell biology part is again rather solid, the conclusions seem much too strong. For stating that the secretion of GH25 is important, the authors would need to construct a non-secreted version under a native promotor. In addition, the metabolic profile would need to be analysed, both of the secreted metabolites and those retained in the cells. It is conceivable that the GH25 enzyme processes a non-effective precursor to generate the observed effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the statement was quite bolt in the previous version of the manuscript. However, since the experiments with the recombinant GH25 lysozyme (Figure 8) confirmed its role in the interaction, we decided to stay with this phrase, which is now justified in our opinion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As many results obtained are already discussed in the Results section, the Discussion section is sometimes repetitive. I encourage the authors to keep the Results section free from interpretation and to do this in the Discussion section. As many incorrect claims are made again in the Discussion, I do not comment on them again.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. As suggested, we have omitted certain sentences in the Results section to avoid being repetitive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Bioinformatics and computational data analysis”. The information regarding the genome assembly and gene prediction is at best minimal. This needs to much extended, also including the necessary quality checks as indicated earlier.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we agree with the reviewer and have extended this part in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1. This is hardly useful to present the &quot;phylogenetic position&quot; of the strain. There are much more elaborate phylogenies and the authors should simply refer to them. Also, the separation into &quot;apathogenic&quot; and &quot;pathogenic&quot; strains is pointless, as they confirm what was previously known. Likely there are no apathogenic members of the Ustilaginales and the yeasts have just by chance been isolated first from the environment before the pathogenic stage was discovered.</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed this critically and, although we agree with this reviewer that there are more extensive phylogenies published, we still believe that the figure is helpful for the reader as an introduction. However, we agree with this reviewer that the term “apathogenic” is not helpful and therefore this has been changed in the revised figure legend.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Based on the major comments of all three reviewers and a discussion, we request to address the following points before the manuscript can be accepted by eLife:</p><p>1) The reviewers found the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1 misleading (see also comments about the tree in the previous version of the manuscript). Since a more comprehensive and correct tree is published in Kruse et al., Figure 1 should be removed from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have removed Figure 1 from the manuscript. We felt it was helpful as an introduction to the topic, but we agree that the information is not necessarily required in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The GH25 hydrolase exhibits lysozyme activity, which hydrolyzes β‐(1,4) linkages between the NAM and NAG saccharides. These glucans are usually found on bacterial cell walls. However, to the reviewer's knowledge, the cell wall of oomycetes is composed of β-1,3, and β-1,6 glucans. How does GH25 hydrolase inhibit the oomycete Albugo laibachii? This question or hypotheses should be raised and discussed in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the observed effect of the GH25 on <italic>A. laibachii</italic> infection is surprising (we were surprised by this finding as well). The GH25 enzymes are widely conserved in the fungal kingdom and have been associated with both fungal hyperparasitism, as well as oomycete-oomycete parasitism in Phytium (Horner et al., 2012).</p><p>With regard of a direct effect on the Albugo cell wall, one should mention that there is quite sparse knowledge on the actual cell wall composition and we would actually not exclude that it contains a substrate of the GH25. Although the MbA GH25 obviously has lysozyme activity, a comprehensive biochemical characterization of the fungal GH25 family is missing. Thus, it might very well be that these enzymes have unexpected/unknown substrates in the oomycete cell wall. Next, it is unknown which consequences an eventual hydrolysis of an Albugo cell wall compound might have (e.g. an effect on cell wall integrity, or a modification of the cell wall surface which may lead to a block in signal perception – or even an induction of plant defense). In the revised manuscript we now include a discussion on potential functions of GH25 to give the reader an idea on how it might act on the molecular level.</p><p>Lastly, one cannot rule out that the effect on <italic>A. laibachii</italic> might be an indirect one: since oomycetes can be found in association with bacteria (which is a largely unstudied/neglected topic) one could even speculate that the GH25 actually targets Albugo-associated bacteria, which might be necessary for virulence of the oomycete. While such a tempting scenario would be also in line with findings of endosymbiotic bacteria in mycorrhizal fungi (work by P. Bonfante and others), at present this is purely speculative and unless there no evidence pointing towards this direction, we’d prefer to not discuss this aspect in the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Title states that GH25 is a secreted enzyme. Unless the authors include an experiment showing secretion, statements on secretion should be toned down in the title and across the manuscript where applicable. (In several instances the authors have already carefully written about &quot;an enzyme with predicted secretion peptide&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this criticism and removed the word “secreted” from the Title, which now reads “…via a GH25 lysozyme”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
