(TFs) and the DNA response elements (REs) they recognize, control most biological processes, but little is known concerning the functional and evolutionary effects of epistatic interactions across molecular interfaces. We experimentally characterized all combinations of genotypes in the joint protein-DNA sequence space defined by an historical transition in TF-RE specificity that occurred some 500 million years ago in the DNA-binding domain of an ancient steroid hormone receptor. We found that rampant epistasis within and between the two molecules was essential to specific TF-RE recognition and to the evolution of a novel TF-RE complex with unique derived specificity. Permissive and restrictive epistatic mutations across the TF-RE interface opened and closed potential evolutionary paths accessible by the other, making the evolution of each molecule contingent on its partner's history and allowing a molecular complex with novel specificity to evolve.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07864.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07864.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07864.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Transcription factors are proteins that control which genes inside a cell are active by binding to specific short sequences of DNA called response elements. Small differences in a trancription factor's amino acid sequence or in a response element's DNA sequence can affect their ability to recognize each other. How these pairs of molecules recognize each other—and how they evolved to do so—are important questions in molecular biology and evolution.</p><p>One way to understand these questions is to study ‘sequence space’, an organized representation of all of the possible sequences of a molecule, each linked to its neighbors by single point mutations. As a molecule evolves, it follows one of many possible paths from its ancestral form to a later-day version. Some paths deliver improvements at every step, and some involve ‘neutral’ wanderings. Still other paths produce intermediate forms that work poorly or not at all; such paths are unlikely to be followed during evolution. By characterizing many different versions of a molecule and mapping their functions onto sequence space, scientists can better understand how biological molecules work and how evolution might have produced them.</p><p>No one has previously explored the combined sequence space of two interacting molecules. Now Anderson, McKeown and Thornton have characterized the joint sequence space of a transcription factor that controls a cell's response to steroid hormones and the DNA response elements that it recognizes. Their experiments focused on the portion of sequence space between two ancient members of the transcription factor family which existed just before and just after a major shift in their ability to recognize different DNA sequences.</p><p>To reconstruct these ancestral proteins, Anderson, McKeown and Thornton used computational methods to infer their most likely sequences based on those of hundreds of present-day members of the family and the relationships between them. These proteins were then tested in the laboratory to see how strongly each of them could bind to various DNA response elements.</p><p>These proteins and their preferred response elements define the start and end of an ancient evolutionary journey through sequence space, which took place about 500 million years ago. Anderson, McKeown and Thornton then reconstructed all the possible steps on the paths between the two transcription factors and the two response elements. Every transcription factor was tested with every response element, and the information about how strongly they could bind was mapped onto the joint sequence space of the two molecules.</p><p>The experiments revealed that mutations in either the DNA or the transcription factor had very different effects, depending on which other changes had already occurred elsewhere in the same molecule or in its partner. Geneticists call this phenomenon ‘epistasis’. Because of epistasis, only a handful of paths connected the ancestral protein-DNA complex to the derived complex without passing through intermediate steps that functioned poorly. These few likely paths all involved ‘permissive mutations’—a change in the DNA that allowed the protein to tolerate a mutation that was previously detrimental, or vice versa.</p><p>The findings show that the evolution of each molecule depended critically on chance events in the evolutionary history of its partner. By changing the evolutionary potential of the molecule it interacted with, the members of the complex wandered through sequence space together. This journey yielded two new molecules that now work specifically together, each with functions that are distinct from their ancestors'.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07864.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07864.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>biochemistry</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>sequence space</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>permissive mutation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11PRE7510085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Dave W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM104397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thornton</surname><given-names>Joseph W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5-T32-GM-7759-33</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKeown</surname><given-names>Alesia N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Career Scientist Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thornton</surname><given-names>Joseph W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental mapping of the joint sequence space of an ancient transcription factor (TF) and its DNA binding sites reveals that epistasis across the molecular interface permitted the evolution of a new and specific TF-DNA complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Function and evolution in molecular sequence space</title><p>The relationship between gene sequence and molecular function is of central interest in both molecular biology and evolution. A useful construct for understanding this relationship is sequence space, an organized multidimensional representation of all possible genotypes of a biological system, each connected to its neighbors by edges representing changes in a single sequence site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maynard Smith, 1970</xref>). Assigning functional information to each genotype yields a ‘topological map’ of the space, which depicts the total set of relations between sequence and function. As proteins evolve, they follow trajectories through sequence space, so the topology of the map also determines how mutation, drift, selection, and other forces can drive genetic evolution.</p><p>The functional topology of sequence space depends strongly on the degree and type of epistasis, defined as genetic interactions between sequence sites, such that the effect of a mutation at one site depends on the state at others. Epistasis makes the space's topology rugged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gavrilets, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kondrashov and Kondrashov, 2015</xref>) in the sense that the functional effect of a mutation—a step in some direction along the map—depends on the genetic background in which it occurs. By causing the fitness effects of mutations to depend on the order in which they are introduced, epistasis can affect the probability that evolution will follow any given mutational trajectory under positive selection, purifying selection, or neutral drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wright, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stadler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Poelwijk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ortlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Phillips, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Field and Matz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Salverda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Breen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harms and Thornton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yokoyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tufts et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Sequence space is vast, so an exhaustive functional mapping and characterization of epistasis for any protein or gene is impossible.

Epistasis between sites across a molecular interface could play a key role in determining the functions and evolutionary potential of molecular complexes. An important but unexplored goal is therefore to functionally map the joint multidimensional sequence space that contains the combined genotypes of interacting molecules.</p><p>The interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and the DNA response elements (REs) to which they bind exemplify this issue. TF-RE interactions regulate gene expression in virtually all biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tjian and Maniatis, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lelli et al., 2012</xref>). Effective and precise gene regulation depends on the capacity of a TF to specifically bind its preferred RE targets with sufficient affinity and occupancy in a heterogeneous cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>). The genetic determinants of affinity and specificity of TF-RE complexes must lie in both molecules and the interactions between them: for example, an amino acid replacement that changes a TF's DNA specificity must affect affinity differently when combined with various RE genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Voordeckers et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The joint sequence space of TFs and their REs has not been directly characterized, particularly in an evolutionary context. Previous work on TF-DNA recognition suggests that epistasis is likely to be important, as expected given the biophysical complexity of protein-DNA interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dill, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stout et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pabo and Nekludova, 2000</xref>). For example, numerous studies have assessed the binding of a single TF to a library of REs, thus identifying the genetic states in the DNA that determine affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Portales-Casamar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stormo and Zhao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Payne and Wagner, 2014</xref>); in several cases, epistatic interactions between neighboring nucleotides in the RE are apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Man and Stormo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Flanagan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moyroud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Other studies have addressed aspects of the TF's protein sequence space by investigating how amino acid variation in a TF affects RE binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lynch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McKeown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pougach et al., 2014</xref>), and here too there is some evidence of epistasis between residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pabo and Nekludova, 2000</xref>). We have little systematic knowledge, however, concerning the topology of joint TF-RE sequence space and how it may affect evolutionary processes.</p><p>The total joint sequence space of multiple molecules is far too large to characterize comprehensively. It should be possible, however, to functionally map the small portion of that space defined by a specific historical change in function. Such a region contains all genotypes on all direct mutational paths between the molecules in a reconstructed ancestral complex and those in a descendant complex that has different specificity. Here we map the joint sequence space across an evolutionary transition in specificity for an ancient TF protein and the DNA REs to which it binds. This approach allowed us to identify sequence states in the DNA and protein that determine the affinity and specificity of binding, to characterize epistasis within and between the molecules, and to analyze the effects of intermolecular epistasis on the evolution of gene regulation and TF-RE interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Evolutionary sequence space of an ancient steroid receptor and its REs</title><p>The DNA binding domain (DBD) of steroid hormone receptors (SRs) are a model for exploring the sequence space of an evolving TF-RE complex. SRs are a class of ligand-activated TFs; they include a ligand-binding domain—which activates gene expression in the presence of specific sex or adrenal steroid hormones—and a DNA-binding domain, which binds as a dimer to palindromic REs consisting of two half-sites each six bases long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bentley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain et al., 2007</xref>).

We previously reconstructed the ancestor of all SRs (AncSR1) and the ancestor of all PAMGRs (AncSR2) and assayed their affinities for ERE and SREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that AncSR1 was ER-like, preferentially binding to ERE, and that AncSR2 was like PAMGRs, preferentially binding SREs. When just three of the 38 amino acid replacements that occurred during the evolutionary interval between AncSR1 and AncSR2 were introduced into AncSR1, they fully recapitulated the shift in half-site preference from ERE to SREs. These three replacements (glu25GLY, gly26SER, and ala29VAL, where lower and upper cases denote ancestral and derived states, respectively) were the only changes on the DBD's ten-residue recognition helix (RH), which inserts into the DNA major groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The ancestral and derived states at these three sites are completely conserved in modern-day ERs and PAMGRs, respectively, so the inference of their states in AncSR1 and AncSR2 was unambiguous. Although other substitutions during this interval affected the DBD's non-specific affinity for DNA and the cooperativity of dimeric binding, only the RH substitutions affected half-site specificity, and they did so without affecting cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McKeown et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The ancestral complex AncSR1:ERE and the derived complex AncSR1+RH:SRE define an ancient evolutionary transition in TF:RE specificity, and the set of direct paths between these points constitutes a historically relevant region of the joint protein-DNA sequence space. Here we report on experiments to functionally map this region of the molecules' joint sequence space and to understand the implications of its topology for evolutionary processes. We experimentally measured the binding affinity of AncSR1-DBD variants containing all genotypic combinations of ancestral and derived amino acids in the RH in complexes with REs containing all possible combinations of nucleotides at the two variable positions in the half-site. We used these data to statistically estimate the main effects of every variable state in the DBD and the RE and of interactions between states within and between each molecule. This analysis allowed us to investigate how the causal determinants of binding changed as the regulatory complex evolved during the historical shift in function and to evaluate the plausibility that any pathway through the joint TF-RE space might have been followed under various evolutionary scenarios.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exploitation of latent binding affinity</title><p>We first characterized the RE-specificity of the ancestral and derived proteins AncSR1 and AncSR1+RH by measuring each protein's affinity for RE sequences containing all 16 combinations of possible nucleotides at the two sites that vary between ERE and SRE. We used a fluorescence anisotropy (FA) assay using labeled DNA probes, which provides direct and precise estimates of the free energy (ΔG) of binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, expressed as ΔG<sub>dissociation</sub>). Although the set of all possible REs is much larger, the preferred nucleotides at the other sequence positions in the RE did not change during SR evolution. We focused on differences in half-site affinity because the RH substitutions affected this phenomenon without changing the cooperativity of binding to palindromic REs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McKeown et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We found that several major changes occurred during the evolutionary transition from the ancestral to derived proteins. First, AncSR1 prefers ERE and AncSR1+RH prefers SREs, but both classes of RE are among the highest-affinity targets for both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The derived preference for SREs therefore arose by reshuffling the protein's relative affinities among high- and moderate-affinity targets, rather than by radically increasing affinity for DNA sequences that were previously bound very poorly.</p><p>Second, the RH substitutions dramatically impaired binding to the protein's best DNA targets in both absolute and relative terms; they reduced affinity for ERE by more than 2 kcal/mol while increasing affinity for SREs by a mere ∼0.2 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As a result, AncSR1's affinity for ERE is much higher than AncSR1+RH's affinity for SREs, and the difference between the best and next-best targets in AncSR1 is much larger than that in AncSR1+RH. Together, these effects make AncSR1+RH less specific for its preferred REs than AncSR1.</p><p>The RH substitutions therefore changed the protein's preferred DNA binding sites by exploiting a preexisting latent affinity for a moderate-affinity RE and dramatically reducing affinity for the ancestral RE. Exploitation of latent, moderate- or low-affinity interactions has been observed in the functional evolution of other molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khersonsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pougach et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Determinants of affinity in RE sequence space</title><p>We next used these measurements to quantitatively analyze the genetic factors within the RE's DNA sequence that determine affinity of AncSR1 and of AncSR1+RH. These determinants include the average (or ‘main’) effects of each possible nucleotide at the variable RE sites, as well as epistatic interactions, which occur when a combination of nucleotides at multiple sites affects affinity differently from expectation based on each nucleotide's average contribution. We used a multiple linear regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stormo, 2011</xref>) that predicts a protein's free energy of binding to an RE as the sum of all main and epistatic effects at the two variable positions 3 and 4 (for details, see ‘Materials and methods’); a linear model is appropriate because the dependent variable is the ΔG of reversible binding, which grows additively with the free energy of the factors that contribute to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benson, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dill, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stout et al., 1998</xref>). We used global regression to estimate the values of the model's parameters that best predict each protein's measured affinity for all 16 RE sequences. This approach allows us to quantify the contribution to the total binding energy made by each individual state (the main effects) and every combination of states (epistatic effects). It also allows us to estimate the portion of all variation in affinity explained by each main and epistatic effect (expressed as the increase in adjusted R<sup>2</sup> when a parameter for any class of effect is added to the model) and to evaluate the statistical significance of the improvement in fit attributable to each class of parameters.</p><p>We found that DNA affinity is determined by main effects of individual nucleotides and by epistatic interactions between them, but these determinants are radically different between AncSR1 and AncSR1+RH. AncSR1 prefers REs with G in position 3 (G3) by 1.0 kcal/mole and those with T in position 4 (T4) by 0.5 kcal/mole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A strong epistatic effect (G3xT4) is also present, which further enhances affinity for the GT combination by 0.8 kcal/mole beyond that expected from the main effects of these two nucleotides. This epistatic interaction establishes the protein's specificity for ERE by generating a large energy gap between binding to GT and binding to other sequences containing G3 or T4 but not both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). AncSR1's specificity is further affected by a strong negative epistatic determinant G3xA4, which substantially reduces its affinity for SRE2 (GA); without this interaction, the protein's preference for G3 would have made SRE2 (GA) a high affinity target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>The DNA determinants of binding by AncSR1+RH are very different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Unlike its ancestor, this protein's affinity is unaffected by main effects of the nucleotide at DNA position 3. Further, the ancestral preference for T4 is replaced by a strong preference for A4. The ancestral epistatic determinant G3xT4 is nearly abolished and replaced by two new positive epistatic interactions—A3xA4 and G3xA4—which together establish the protein's preference for its best targets SRE1 and SRE2 relative to other sequences that contain A4. Consistent with the lower specificity of AncSR1+RH, the magnitude of all these determinants is smaller than those that determine AncSR1's target affinity.</p><p>These data indicate that in both the ancestral and derived proteins, epistasis between the two variable nucleotide positions in the DNA target played a key role in establishing specificity of binding.

Unlike the starting and ending states, however, all intermediates were either universally low-affinity or highly promiscuous TFs. Specifically, three low-affinity intermediates (glu-gly-VAL, glu-SER-ala and glu-SER-VAL) bound to their best targets far more weakly than either the ancestral or derived forms bound their preferred sequences, and they did not bind any REs with affinity greater than the global average of all 8 proteins with all 16 REs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

To change specificity, an amino acid replacement must affect affinity for RE genotypes differently. Therefore, when amino acid replacements change specificity or preference for REs, epistasis across the protein-DNA interface must be involved. To statistically characterize this form of epistasis, we further expanded the linear models described above to simultaneously analyze the effects of the combined protein + DNA genotype on affinity. This approach allowed us to identify epistatic effects on affinity caused by combinations of amino acid replacements and nucleotide states. The magnitude of an epistatic effect across the molecular interface is the difference in the binding energy of complexes containing both a specific TF amino acid and a specific RE nucleotide from that predicted based on the average effects of each of those states. A replacement may also participate in third-order interactions with a combination of nucleotide states in the RE, if it specifically changes relative affinity for the combination more than expected from the first- and second-order effects together.</p><p>We found that each amino acid replacement is involved in cross-interface epistatic interactions that contribute to eliminating the ancestral determinants of specificity and establishing the derived determinants. Although replacement glu25GLY increases affinity for all REs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), it does not do so uniformly: it increases relative affinity for REs with nucleotide states A3, A4 and G3xA4—thus specifically improving relative binding to SREs—and decreases relative affinity for REs containing the ancestral DNA determinants G3 and T4, as well as the ERE-specific combination G3xT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This replacement's most dramatic effect is therefore to cause a specific increase in the protein's affinity for SREs relative to EREs.</p><p>The other two replacements also participate in cross-interface pairwise and third-order epistatic interactions. Both gly26SER and ala29VAL reduce the ancestral determinants of binding G3 and T4 and increase the derived preference for REs with A4. Both also are involved in third-order interactions, by which the amino acid changes further reduce affinity for the G3xT4 combination and increase affinity for the G3xA4 combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As a result, although each of these replacements reduces binding affinity to every single RE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), they do so most radically on ERE while only weakly affecting SREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these observations confirm that all three RH replacements contributed to the historical change in specificity via cross-interface epistatic interactions. Second-order intermolecular interactions allowed each replacement in the TF to shift specificity by differentially affecting affinity for REs containing specific individual nucleotide states. Third-order interactions allowed each replacement to have further effects on affinity when combined with pairs of nucleotides, beyond those expected based on any of the three sites' average effects plus all their pairwise interactions.</p><p>We found that new specificity evolved without sign epistasis. Each replacement affected binding to all 16 REs in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2, 4</xref>), but its effects on some REs were more extreme than on others. Because none of the replacements acted as a switch that impaired binding to some sequences while improving affinity for others, multiple replacements were necessary to achieve the derived specificity and affinity. Why would the shift in function not have occurred via a simpler genetic mechanism involving sign epistasis? We speculate that there are few or no potential replacements that have pinpoint opposite effects on different REs. The interface between a TF and DNA is heterogeneous and densely packed, and all four possible nucleotides share many similarities in the physical properties they confer on the DNA surface to which a TF binds. Thus, amino acid changes are more likely to alter binding in a generic direction across all possible versions of the RE, but they do so more effectively when paired with some nucleotides than with others.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mutational pathways to new transcriptional modules</title><p>Having mapped the free energy of binding—a fundamental biochemical property—across joint sequence space, we next sought to understand how evolution might proceed through this space under various evolutionary scenarios. If the relationship between biochemical affinity of a TF-RE complex and its function in the cell and organism were linear, then the ruggedness of the biochemical topology of sequence space would be identical to the ruggedness of the space's functional topology. It is highly unlikely, however, that all biological dependent variables—occupancy on DNA, gene regulatory output, phenotypic effect, and fitness—are linearly related the affinity of a TF-RE complex. A nonlinear relationship between affinity and biological function/fitness would introduce additional epistasis into the topology of sequence space and further change the kinds of paths that evolution is likely to follow under purifying selection, drift, and positive selection. The precise nature of this transformation depends strongly on biological context, is unknown. We therefore sought to gain preliminary insight into the plausibility of evolutionary trajectories through joint sequence space under two simple, biologically motivated scenarios.</p><p>The first scenario was to consider how AncSR1 might have evolved novel recognition of SREs, thus establishing occupancy of a new set of target genes, while under purifying selection to maintain specific, high-affinity binding to at least one RE at every step in the trajectory. We based our analysis on the concept of a connected network of functional protein genotypes, which assumes that purifying selection makes mutational pathways through nonfunctional intermediates very unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maynard Smith, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wagner, 2008</xref>). Although the RH substitutions occurred after a gene duplication of AncSR1, it is unlikely that either copy was released from purifying selection, because the ancestral function was conserved in both copies for tens or hundreds of millions of years before neofunctionalization occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bridgham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eick et al., 2012</xref>). We defined each protein's set of functional RE targets as those that fulfill two simple criteria. First, to achieve reasonable occupancy by the low concentrations of TF typical in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>), the RE must be bound with moderate to high affinity, which we defined as greater than the average affinity across all TF-RE complexes tested. Further, a potential DNA binding site must compete with other REs for occupancy by the same TF, so the second criterion we imposed is that the affinity constant for an RE must be within a factor of ten of that protein's best target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>). TF:RE complexes not meeting these criteria were classified as low-occupancy and therefore nonfunctional. Although these criteria are somewhat arbitrary, they provide a starting point for understanding how the biochemical epistasis we observed, along with a simple nonlinearity in the transformation of affinity into function, might affect the mutational paths available to the evolving TF-RE complex.</p><p>We found that epistasis strongly structures possible evolutionary trajectories through sequence space. Starting from AncSR1, only one replacement (glu25GLY) leads to a functional TF; the others yield proteins that do not effectively bind any REs and are therefore unlikely evolutionary intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The glu25GLY mutation produces a high-affinity but extremely promiscuous TF that retains strong binding to the ancestral ERE while gaining high-affinity binding to 13 novel REs, including the SREs. This replacement opens up new evolutionary trajectories, because once it is in place, either of the other two amino acid changes become tolerable. glu25GLY therefore represents a permissive evolutionary mutation that broadens the network of other accessible replacements that the protein can explore.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07864.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Accessible mutational pathways in the joint TF-RE sequence space.</title><p>Each vertex of the cube represents a protein genotype between AncSR1 and AncSR1+RH; amino acid states at variable RH residues are shown; lower and upper case denote ancestral and derived states, respectively.

The two possible paths available to AncSR1+RH have different functional implications for specific RE recognition, depending on the order in which the remaining replacements are introduced. Adding ala29VAL first expands the set of occupied DNA targets to include all 16 REs; the final gly26SER mutation then radically narrows the TF's specificity, eliminating 13 REs as high-occupancy targets and leaving only SRE1, SRE2, and one additional target (TA). Following the other pathway, incorporating gly26SER first narrows promiscuity somewhat but does not eliminate the ancestral targets, leaving four high-affinity REs (ERE and the other ancestrally recognized target GG, plus the novel SRE1 and SRE2); the final replacement ala29VAL then eliminates the ancestral targets—rather than expanding the protein's promiscuity, as it would if introduced earlier—and yields a protein specific for the derived REs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These observations point to higher-order epistasis—two amino acids interacting with each other to differentially change regulation of specific DNA sequences—which causes the functional implications of trajectories through sequence space to depend on the order of sequence change among multiple molecules.</p><p>Taken together, these data indicate that a derived TF could evolve to regulate a novel set of DNA targets completely distinct from those of the ancestral protein without losing the ancestral function until the final amino acid change. Because of epistasis—particularly the requirement for the permissive replacement glu25GLY for the other two replacements to be tolerated—only a small fraction of the possible pathways through protein sequence space pass through only functional TF intermediates on the way to the derived protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Along both pathways, promiscuous intermediate genotypes gained recognition of the novel SREs, followed by further replacements that eliminated high-affinity binding to the ancestral RE and any transiently acquired targets. Our results are consistent with previous studies indicating an important role for permissive mutations in enabling a protein to tolerate other function-switching mutations that would otherwise be deleterious, particularly when a threshold relationship pertains between a biochemical property and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ortlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bloom and Arnold, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Woods et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harms and Thornton, 2013</xref>).

Using the same criteria as above to define a functional complex, we sought to understand whether a single complex of AncSR1:ERE could traverse the joint TF-RE sequence space through a series of changes in the protein and the DNA, reaching AncSR1+RH:SRE along a continuous neutral network without ever losing high-affinity, high-occupancy binding.</p><p>We found that there are many pathways through the joint genotype space from the ancestral to the derived complex that maintain a functional complex at every intermediate step. These pathways are made possible by intermolecular epistasis, which causes replacements in the TF to alter constraints on evolution of the RE, and vice versa. At the starting point of AncSR1:ERE, both the TF and the RE genotypes are highly constrained by the requirement to maintain a high-affinity complex with each other: only a single mutation is available to the DNA (from GT to GG), and only one replacement (glu25GLY) is available to the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Drift along each of these pathways has very different functional implications: if the G4 mutation in the RE were to occur first, the neutral network available to the protein would remain unchanged, with glu25GLY remaining as the only viable replacement on the trajectory towards AncSR1+RH. But if glu25GLY were to occur first, the set of viable mutations available to the RE would radically expand, with almost any RE genotype being tolerated. Reaplcement glu25GLY in the TF therefore acts as a permissive substitution for drift by the RE, allowing the DNA binding site to explore many new pathways—including mutation to SREs—while still maintaining an association with the TF. Thus, neutral substitutions in the protein can permit previously unavailable moves by the DNA through its neutral network.</p><p>Conversely, neutral changes by the RE can permit amino acid replacements in the TF to occur that would otherwise have been unfavorable. For example, if the complex is in the state GLY-SER-ala:GT, adding the final replacement ala29VAL would lead to a nonfunctional complex. But if the RE were to drift first to one of the SREs, then the complex would be able to tolerate this amino acid change. Further, neutral substitutions in the RE can also restrict evolutionary pathways that were previously open to the TF, making certain amino acid changes inaccessible. For example, if the complex is in the state GLY-gly-VAL:GA, the TF can drift to AncSR1+RH via the gly26SER replacement; however, if the RE first drifts to GC, this replacement would abolish the TF:RE association, making it an unlikely evolutionary step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Permissive and restrictive mutations across the interface may act in a serial chain that reciprocally modifies the partner molecules' evolvability: a mutation in the RE may change the protein's capacity to tolerate a previously unavailable replacement, which then changes the RE's tolerance of a mutation that would otherwise have been unavailable, and so on. To follow one such example, replacement glu25GLY allows the ancestral ERE (GT) to drift to TT, which prevents gly26SER, which otherwise would have been available, and also permits the previously denied replacement ala29VAL; if ala29VAL does occur next, then mutation of the DNA to TA becomes available, which in turn is permissive for gly26SER. That replacement closes off many DNA mutations that were previously available, but the final mutation to SRE1 or SRE2 is open. Epistasis across the molecular interface therefore makes the evolution of the TF and the RE contingent upon the genotype—and therefore the prior evolutionary history—of its partner. A chain of serially contingent events may ensue, as permissive and restrictive mutations in the protein and DNA open or close evolutionary paths for mutations within the same molecule or its binding partner.</p><p>Taken together, these findings indicate that epistasis across a molecular interface can allow interacting molecules to both evolve by drift to states that are incompatible with the ancestral versions of their partner. AncSR1:ERE is a highly specific complex that does not recognize SRE; it lies on a narrow peninsula in sequence space, with few mutations leading directly to other functional complexes. A series of permissive mutations in both partners, however, could have allowed the RE and the TF to drift together through numerous new genotypes, eventually reaching AncSR1+RH:SRE, which itself is a specific complex on a narrow peninsula that does not bind or connect directly to ERE.</p><p>The nonlinear mapping we imposed from biochemical property to biological function/fitness added an additional form of epistasis to that we observed due to affinity alone. The criteria that we used to define this mapping are highly simplified. In reality, the selective effects of mutations that change TF:RE interactions are likely to depend on many factors, including the genomic context and role of other TFs in regulating a given target, interactions between the TF and other proteins, the genotype and function of other domains and sites in the TF, the physiological roles of the target genes, and the demographic characteristics of the population. How these factors affected the mapping of affinity onto fitness for the ancient molecular complex we study here is unknown; as a result, the mutational pathways most likely to have been followed during the evolutionary history of the SR DBD and its targets are also unknown. Despite this uncertainty about specific historical scenarios, however, it is clear that rampant epistasis was present at the most fundamental biochemical level, and even the simple biological criteria we imposed resulted in very strong impacts on the evolutionary accessibility of trajectories across sequence space. It therefore seems likely that epistasis will also structure evolutionary trajectories under more complex, realistic conditions that introduce further nonlinearities into the relationship between physical properties and selectable biological outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The biophysical causes of specificity are genotype-specific</title><p>Finally, we sought to understand the underlying biophysical mechanisms that cause variation in binding affinity among TF:RE pairs in this region of sequence space. To determine these mechanisms, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for AncSR1, AncSR1+RH and all intermediate protein genotypes, each bound to every one of the 16 DNA sequences. We then measured hydrogen bonding and packing at the protein-DNA interface, which are known to contribute to high-affinity interactions between proteins and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">von Hippel, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garvie and Wolberger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coulocheri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rohs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McKeown et al., 2014</xref>).

When all TF:RE combinations were analyzed, the efficiency of packing was not positively correlated with affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). When analyzed separately, packing was significantly and positively associated with affinity for only two proteins, explaining at most 40% of the variance in a protein's affinity across REs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). There is no clear pattern to explain which protein genotypes manifest a correlation of packing with affinity.</p><p>We conclude that no simple biophysical metric provides a general explanation of variation in affinity among TF-RE complexes. There may be common mechanisms for the effects of each amino acid replacement on affinity that are common to all REs: for example, replacement gly25GLY improved affinity for every RE, possibly by enhancing the entropic benefit of binding driven by the hydrophobic effect or decreasing the entropic cost of binding by introducing additional degrees of freedom in the protein backbone. But specificity—variation in affinity among REs—appears to be determined by biophysical interactions that are largely unique to each TF-RE combination. For example, replacement ala29VAL improves relative affinity for REs containing A4; in previously published ancestral X-ray crystal structures, the hydrophobic side chain of VAL29 packs against the hydrophobic methyl groups that are unique to the complementary T at position 4 in the RE, providing a likely explanation, at least in part, for this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McKeown et al., 2014</xref>). These interactions only affect packing involving a small number of atoms, and they are present in only a small number of TF-RE pairs, so they do not have a statistically detectable effect on the relationship between packing and affinity across all REs.</p><p>These results reinforce the importance of epistasis across the molecular interface. Differences in binding affinity among TF:RE complexes are typically determined by unique physical interactions between atoms on the protein and atoms on the DNA, and higher-order interactions sometimes involve more than two atoms across the interface.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Methodologies for characterizing epistasis in combined sequence space</title><p>Linear modeling strategies have previously been used to statistically characterize the main and epistatic effects of variation in a DNA sequence on affinity for a specific TF, typically using high-throughput approaches that estimate affinity from measurements of occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stormo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stormo et al., 2015</xref>). We extended these methods, using direct measurements of affinity for every combination of TF and RE genotypes in a defined region of sequence space, to identify the genetic determinants of protein-DNA affinity both within and between the two molecules.</p><p>This strategy has both advantages and limitations. By simultaneously studying the effects of variation within the RE, within the TF, and between the two molecules were we able to describe in detail how changes in the TF protein affect the specificity of RE binding and vice versa. This approach can in principle be used to study interactions in joint sequence space for any complex of molecules, including those with more than two elements. It can also be applied to large datasets, larger numbers of sites, and higher-order interactions, so long as the data are sufficiently precise to allow robust quantitative analysis.</p><p>Our experimental approach allowed us to obtain precise and direct measurements of affinity for each individual TF-RE complex, which were essential to our analysis. Statistical models of higher-order epistasis across a protein-DNA interface add many terms to the regression models previously used for individual proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stormo et al., 2015</xref>). As models become complex, estimates of higher-order determinants of affinity can become uncertain or biased if the estimates of affinity are noisy or imprecise; this problem can be exacerbated if affinities for some sequence states are estimated by interpolation rather than being measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Otwinowski and Plotkin, 2014</xref>). By directly and precisely measuring the ΔG of binding for all TF:RE combinations, we were able to detect and estimate the magnitude and importance of higher-order epistatic effects with relatively high confidence. Further, because effects on the free energy of binding by independent factors are additive for reversible interactions, these measurements allowed us to use linear regression to rigorously estimate the magnitude and significance of main and epistatic effects on TF-RE recognition. Other metrics such as occupancy or entropy may require more complex descriptive models.</p><p>Obtaining such precise and direct measurements of binding energy is time consuming and limits the number of complexes that can be studied. The 128 TF:RE combined genotypes whose affinity we measured represent a tiny slice of the vast joint sequence space of possible TFs and REs. Even within this small region of sequence space, however, we found rampant epistatic interactions within the DNA RE, within the TF protein, and between the RE and the TF. These epistatic interactions play key roles in determining the specificity of binding by each TF, and they strongly shape the functional topology of the joint sequence space and the capacity of each molecule to traverse this space under various evolutionary scenarios. As improving technical capacities allow larger tracts of joint sequence space to be analyzed and higher-level biological functions to be assessed, it seems quite likely that epistasis will be a major influence on the specificity and evolution of molecular complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Epistasis and the evolution of molecular complexes</title><p>Complexity and interdependence are often thought to act as constraints on evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewontin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kauffman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wagner and Altenberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Orr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schank and Wimsatt, 2001</xref>). Previous studies of epistasis within a molecule have shown that interactions among mutations constrict the number of passable evolutionary trajectories through sequence space and make the outcomes of evolution contingent upon the prior occurrence of permissive mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</xref>). The joint sequence space of multiple interacting molecules contains more dimensions and therefore far more paths between functional joint genotypes than does either molecule's separate sequence space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gavrilets, 2004</xref>). Our work shows that intermolecular epistasis is indeed rampant and blocks many of these additional pathways.</p><p>But intermolecular epistasis also has an opposite effect, which introduces new degrees of freedom into the evolutionary process. Permissive epistatic mutations across the molecular interface open paths for the other molecule that would otherwise have been blocked. As a result, the absolute number of trajectories (and ultimate endpoints) available to either partner is larger than it would appear to be if only the ‘slice’ or profile through the joint sequence space represented by variability in a single molecule were considered. Under the scenario we examined, for example, an ERE regulated by an immutable AncSR1-DBD could not reach SRE without losing functionality, and AncSR1 could not reach AncSR1+RH if it regulated only immutable binding sites. But because amino acid replacements in the TF are permissive for mutations in the RE, and subsequent RE mutations are permissive for replacements in the protein, both members of the complex can explore regions of their own sequence space and reach genotypes that were not previously available to either.</p><p>Molecular complexes are pervasive in biology. The extensive intermolecular epistasis that we observed among a small number of sites in a simple binary complex suggests that the reach of intermolecular epistasis may be vast. If the structure of that epistasis is anything like that present in the AncSR1-RE complex, then the web of contingent events that structures evolutionary trajectories is likely to be dense, with the evolutionary potential of any one molecule depending on prior events in other molecules. But if some of those events are permissive, as our results suggest they are likely to be, then the potential of evolution to generate new functional complexes by the combined action of mutation, drift and selection is greater than it may appear if the molecules are viewed only in isolation. Complexity and interdependence not only constrain evolution; they can also buy freedom for the parts of a system to reach new states, if the historical events are right.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification</title><p>DBDs were cloned into the pETMALc-H10T vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pryor and Leiting, 1997</xref>) (a gift from John Sondek, UNC-Chapel Hill) C-terminal to a cassette containing a 6xHis tag, maltose binding protein (MBP) and a TEV protease cleavage site.

This allowed us to assess whether addition of the second-order model terms significantly improved the fit by comparing the improvement in the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> as well as the improvement in the likelihood ratio test relative to the simpler first-order model. The effect of each second-order interaction (i.e., the epistasis that should be added to the sum of the additive lower-order effects) can be solved from these coefficients. For example, the epistatic interaction between C at position 3 and A at position 4 is:<disp-formula id="equ8"><mml:math id="m8"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>_</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>To identify the genetic determinants of binding affinity for both the protein and RE, we applied this analysis to each individual protein genotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), as well as globally across all protein and RE genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Linear models with second-order inter-molecular epistasis</title><p>We next constructed a linear model that included both first- and second-order terms within the protein and RE as well as second-order terms between the protein and RE (i.e., interactions between specific amino acid and nucleotide states).

We constructed analogous first-, second-, and third-order models using a binary encoding system, in which each variable is 1 if the respective genetic state is at a given position, and 0 otherwise (e.g., glu25 is 1 if there is a glu at position 25, and 0 in all other cases). For higher-order models, the terms were constructed so that they equal 1 if all lower-order genetic states are present (e.g., glu25_G3 is 1 if both site 25 in the RH is a glu and site 3 in the RE is a G, and 0 otherwise).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and three outside reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. There was broad agreement that this is a creative and important study, but the reviewers also made several suggestions how the impact of the work could be improved.</p><p>Specific recommendations include:</p><p>1) Acknowledge that the model (single monomer and focusing on just two positions in the DNA sequence) is probably an oversimplification, and brief discussion of potential caveats that arise from this.</p><p>2) Provide a better justification of the use of a linear model. Currently, there is a single sentence in the manuscript; you seem to be using the linear model to expose epistasis as deviations from the linear model's assumption of additivity, but this is poorly explained in the text. The limitations of the linear model are discussed in references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dill 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stout et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benson 1968</xref>) but these could easily be summarized in the text.</p><p>3) Justify why you consider only two positions in the DNA sequence; some references are given in the current test, but the discussion is brief to the point of confusion.</p><p>4) Provide a clearer justification of your threshold for functionality.

We have acknowledged that the system we used—focusing on two positions in the DNA sequence of a half-site—represents a very limited portion of the DNA sequence space that the evolving TF-RE system could in principle explore, and we have discussed the implications of this choice. This part of the space represents the historically relevant portion of the sequence space, because these are the only two positions that vary between the ancestrally preferred RE and the derived preferred RE, and only half-site specificity changed across the functional transition from AncSR1 to AncSR1+RH—not cooperativity or other aspects of dimeric binding. Limiting our study to a relatively small region of multidimensional joint protein+DNA sequence space was necessary for us to exhaustively map function and quantify genetic factors contributing to variation in affinity (we explore these points in the following subsections of the text: “Epistasis across a molecular interface: transcription factors and DNA response elements”, “Exploitation of latent binding affinity” and “Methodologies for characterizing epistasis in combined sequence space”).</p><p><italic>2) Provide a better justification of the use of a linear model. Currently, there is a single sentence in the manuscript; you seem to be using the linear model to expose epistasis as deviations from the linear model's assumption of additivity, but this is poorly explained in the text. The limitations of the linear model are discussed in references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dill 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stout et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benson 1968</xref>) but these could easily be summarized in the text</italic>.</p><p>We clarified the nature and justification for the linear regression model. The model does not assume that only additive effects of individual sites in the protein and DNA determine affinity. Rather, it models the free energy of binding as the sum of the energetic contributions of each individual site’s main effect plus those due to every epistatic interaction. Using a linear model is appropriate based on first principles given the fact that total free energy of a system by definition is the sum of the free energy of the factors that contribute to it. The advantage of this model is that it allows the energetic contributions of epistatic interactions to binding to be precisely quantified and the statistical significance of such contributions to be evaluated (please see the subsections “Determinants of affinity in RE sequence space”, “Effects of amino acid substitutions on affinity” and “Epistasis across a molecular interface”).</p><p><italic>4) Provide a clearer justification of your threshold for functionality. While is seems unlikely that the proteins would evolve through non-functional intermediates (even after gene duplication), your arguments would be strengthened by a more thorough discussion if you chose the particular thresholds.</italic></p><p>We clarified the biological justification for and limitations of the criteria we used to define functional TF-RE complexes in the latter part of the analysis. Although the criteria are simple, they are biologically motivated, and the fact that we observed extensive epistasis under such a simple nonlinear mapping suggests that more complex forms of nonlinearity, as are likely to occur in real biological systems, are also likely to give rise to epistasis. We also explicitly discussed why gene duplication almost certainly did not release the evolving AncSR1 protein from purifying selection (please refer to the subsections entitled “Mutational pathways to new transcriptional modules” and “Intermolecular epistasis allows coevolutionary drift by the TF-RE complex”).</p><p><italic>5) Cite theoretical background for dependence between nucleotide positions (Stormo lab work and others, HMM based models) and papers describing that offer examples of interdependence between nucleotides or amino acid positions.

We modified the text to note that prior research has identified epistasis between sites in TF-RE binding, and that this is expected, given the complex and integrated nature of the protein-DNA interface, citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pabo and Nekludova 2000</xref> on this point. We also clarified that the model is an extension of previous work used to analyze the specificity of a TF’s interactions with DNA (please see the subsections headed “Epistasis across a molecular interface: transcription factors and DNA response elements” and “Methodologies for characterizing epistasis in combined sequence space”).</p><p><italic>6) Describe results and modeling in a more intuitive manner that can be more easily followed. Clearly distinguish entirely new concepts from old ideas being addressed in a fresh manner</italic>.</p><p>We edited the text to make the Methods and Results easier to follow, including the description of the modeling approach. We also sought to explain more clearly the concepts of sequence space and its functional topology (please see “Function and evolution in molecular sequence space”, “Determinants of affinity in RE sequence space” “Effects of amino acid substitutions on affinity” and “Epistasis across a molecular interface”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
