It also participates in organogenesis, HIV-1 infection, and tumor development. Despite the potential therapeutic benefit of CXCR4 antagonists, only one, plerixafor (AMD3100), which blocks the ligand-binding site, has reached the clinic. Recent advances in imaging and biophysical techniques have provided a richer understanding of the membrane organization and dynamics of this receptor. Activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12 reduces the number of CXCR4 monomers/dimers at the cell membrane and increases the formation of large nanoclusters, which are largely immobile and are required for correct cell orientation to chemoattractant gradients. Mechanistically, CXCR4 activation involves a structural motif defined by residues in TMV and TMVI. Using this structural motif as a template, we performed in silico molecular modeling followed by in vitro screening of a small compound library to identify negative allosteric modulators of CXCR4 that do not affect CXCL12 binding. We identified AGR1.137, a small molecule that abolishes CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering and dynamics and blocks the ability of cells to sense CXCL12 gradients both in vitro and in vivo while preserving ligand binding and receptor internalization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>chemokine receptors</kwd><kwd>allosteric

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is a homeostatic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is widely expressed in both embryonic and adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2012</xref>). It is also ubiquitously expressed in the hematopoietic system, where it plays a pivotal role in leukocyte trafficking and arrest in specific niches in homeostasis and disease. CXCR4 is essential for adaptive and innate immune responses, as well as in the organization and maintenance of the bone marrow (BM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nie et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, CXCR4 and its unique chemokine ligand CXC motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) are largely responsible for the migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wright et al., 2002</xref>), homing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lapidot and Kollet, 2002</xref>), and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broxmeyer et al., 2003</xref>) of hematopoietic stem cells in the BM.</p><p>Results from studies in conditional <italic>Cxcr4</italic>-knockout mice point to a relevant role for CXCR4 in several non-hematopoietic tissues, for example, in regulating central nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cash-Padgett et al., 2016</xref>), and in vasculature development in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tachibana et al., 1998</xref>) and the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takabatake et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, CXCR4, together with CCR5, serve as primary co-receptors (with CD4) for HIV-1 fusion and entry into target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>CXCR4 expression is frequently elevated in many cancers, including breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Müller et al., 2001</xref>), ovarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall and Korach, 2003</xref>), prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Taichman et al., 2002</xref>), melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scala et al., 2006</xref>), and neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geminder et al., 2001</xref>), where it participates in tumor growth, tumor cell interactions with the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Orimo et al., 2005</xref>), vasculogenesis, angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2007</xref>), and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Müller et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, increased CXCR4 expression in metastatic lesions correlates with tumor progression and with preferential metastatic sites of the primary tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohn et al., 2009</xref>). Studies in mice have suggested that CXCR4 is a good target for cancer therapy, as blockade of its signaling impairs metastasis in several models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Müller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Despite the essential role of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in physiology and pathology, the only commercially available CXCR4 antagonist approved for clinical use is plerixafor (AMD3100), which is indicated for the mobilization of stem cells from the BM to the peripheral blood in autologous transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Clercq, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Single particle tracking in total internal reflection fluorescence (SPT-TIRF) experiments and stimulated emission depletion super resolution microscopy (STED) have demonstrated that CXCR4 is organized at the cell membrane as monomers, dimers and small aggregates (groups of ≥3 receptors) termed nanoclusters, and that CXCL12 binding decreases the percentage of monomers/dimers and increases the formation of large nanoclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martínez-Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>). This mechanism is essential for CXCR4 signaling, which allows cells to orient themselves correctly in response to CXCL12 gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Cuesta et al., 2022</xref>). A triple-mutant CXCR4 (K239L/V242A/L246A; CXCR4mut), located in the N-terminal region of transmembrane (TM) VI, dimerizes but neither forms nanoclusters in response to CXCL12 nor supports CXCL12-induced directed cell migration, although it can induce some Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and is internalized after ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martínez-Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>). A cluster has been identified in CXCR4, defined by TMV and TMVI residues that form a hydrophobic lock connecting the signal from the orthosteric ligand-binding site to the downstream conserved domains involved in G-protein coupling and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wescott et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used this signal domain of CXCR4 as a base to search for new CXCR4 antagonists. We performed an in silico screening of a small aromatic compound library for the identification of allosteric modulators that block directed cell migration, without interfering with ligand binding and, thus, allowing other CXCL12-mediated functions. Using molecular modeling analyses, we identified a novel class of structurally related small molecules that modulate some CXCR4 functions by binding to a novel regulatory cleft formed by the TMV and TMVI transmembrane helices. One of the selected compounds, AGR1.137, abolished CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering and dynamics and the ability of the cells to specifically sense CXCL12 gradients, but did not alter ligand binding or receptor internalization. Notably, AGR1.137 had a minimal effect on ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation, which may reduce the side effects associated with full CXCR4 inhibition. Finally, using a zebrafish tumor model, we observed that AGR1.137 treatment of HeLa cells reduced tumorigenesis and metastasis, suggesting that AGR1.137 also impairs cell sensitivity to CXCL12 gradients by blocking CXCR4 nanoclustering in vivo. In conclusion, our results establish the importance of residues within the TMV–VI cleft for CXCR4 nanoclustering and CXCL12-mediated directional migration, and identify a negative allosteric modulator that exhibits both in vitro and in vivo activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening for small compounds targeting CXCR4 that block CXCL12-induced CXCR4 nanoclustering</title><p>The propagation domain of CXCR4, which links ligand binding to the residues involved in G-protein association, includes residues bounded by the transmembrane helices TMV and TMVI, which enclose a cleft of 870 Å<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wescott et al., 2016</xref>) is surface-exposed for interactions with the plasma membrane, as it contains residues involved in lipid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Marino et al., 2023</xref>), and also includes residues implicated in receptor activation and in the transmission of conformational changes through the TM helix domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wescott et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Additionally, AGR1.135 could interact hydrophobically with several residues in TMV and TMVI, comprising two independent cavities of 434 and 1,381 Å<sup>3</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), which were not connected to the orthosteric site as indicated by SURFNET analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laskowski, 1995</xref>) included in the PDBsum server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laskowski et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As a control, AGR1.137 also reduced HeLa cell proliferation in in vitro assays mimicking the in vivo experimental conditions in zebrafish (addition of compounds every 24 hr for 3 days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next evaluated the ability of the compounds to block cell dissemination by determining the number of labeled HeLa cells that appeared in the main metastatic niche at the caudal hematopoietic plexus. AGR1.137 50 μM treatment of HeLa cells reduced cell dissemination by ~40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), strongly suggesting that this compound exerts anti-metastatic effects. As control AMD3100 (10 μM) treatment also reduced cell dissemination (~30%). The combined ability of AGR1.137 to reduce proliferation and dissemination in vivo is likely to have therapeutic value.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is involved in myriad functions, including leukocyte recruitment, embryogenesis, vascular development, hematopoiesis, heart development, nervous system organization, tumor progression, autoimmune diseases and, together with CD4, CXCR4 is a co-receptor used by HIV-1 to infect immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pozzobon et al., 2016</xref>).

These limitations and the poor clinical success of other chemokine receptor antagonists have prompted the search for alternative strategies to block chemokine receptor functions.</p><p>As for other GPCRs, CXCR4 exists in multiple conformations on the plasma membrane and interacts with other chemokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Muñoz et al., 2012</xref>) and with cell surface proteins such as the T-cell receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar et al., 2006</xref>), CD4 and other receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martínez-Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pozzobon et al., 2016</xref>). Advanced imaging-based techniques such as SPT-TIRF and super-resolution microscopy have revealed the existence of CXCR4 monomers, dimers and oligomers at the cell membrane, diffusing into the lipid bilayer. CXCL12 binding induces receptor nanoclustering and reduces the proportion of monomers and dimers, which is essential for the full activation of CXCR4 signaling and the correct orientation of the cell towards chemokine gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martínez-Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Cuesta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gardeta et al., 2022</xref>). CXCR4R<sup>334X</sup>, a truncated mutant receptor that causes WHIM syndrome, fails to form nanoclusters in the presence of CXCL12 and is unable to sense chemoattractant gradients, although it remains capable of triggering Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Cuesta et al., 2022</xref>). Due to the inability of CXCR4 to associate with the actin cytoskeleton, β-arrestin-1-deficient cells do not exhibit CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Cuesta et al., 2022</xref>). Similar observations are seen CXCR4-expressing cells treated with latrunculin A, an inhibitor of actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martínez-Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pozzobon et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that receptor nanoclustering is a ligand-mediated process that requires activation of a signaling pathway involving β-arrestin-1 and proper actin cytoskeletal dynamics.</p><p>CXCR4 contains a pocket formed by two TM domains, TMV and TMVI, and mutations in this pocket can affect the dynamics of the conformational changes triggered by ligand binding. The mechanism involves the initial interaction of CXCL12 with the extracellular region of CXCR4, which promotes conformational changes at a series of hydrophobic residues located mainly on TMV and TMVI that continue downward in the TM domains of the receptor, ultimately allowing G-protein interaction and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wescott et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, a complete alignment of GPCR class A chemokine receptors reveals that hydrophobic residues in this region that are not in highly conserved positions can have any side-chain length at any site depending on the receptor, likely conferring a specificity that could be exploited for the discovery and/or design of new antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

Nonetheless, these orthosteric compounds have off-target effects and poor selectivity due to highly homologous receptor orthosteric sites and abrogation of spatial and/or temporal endogenous signaling patterns. The use of negative allosteric modulators can tune receptor-associated functions without affecting the orthosteric binding site. For example, the negative allosteric modulator 873140 blocks CCL3 binding to CCR5 but does not alter CCL5 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Watson et al., 2005</xref>). Maraviroc, an anti-HIV-1 molecule is an allosteric modulator of CCR5 that regulates CCR5 dimer populations, their localization to the cell membrane, and their subsequent subcellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2018</xref>). Allosteric modulators of the kappa opioid receptor have been demonstrated to have desirable antinociceptive and antipruritic effects without sedative and dissociative effects in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brust et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To identify new allosteric modulators, we focused on an in silico screen targeting the pocket in CXCR4 created by TMV and TMVI, without affecting the residues involved in CXCL12 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martínez-Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pozzobon et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequent functional analysis of the selected compounds identified AGR1.135, AGR1.137, and AGR1.131. The latter, although selected with the same in silico criteria, showed a better docking score on a cleft between TMI and TMVII and did not block CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis. In addition, the compounds had no effect on CXCR2-mediated cell migration, supporting their specificity for CXCR4. The three compounds had a common core of (4-(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)phenyl) methanol but different side chains carrying amines of different length and chemical nature, which may explain their different biological activity. AGR1.131 seems to be more flexible than the other two compounds. It has an amide group and an additional CH2 linking the phenyl ring. The absence of the piperidine or piperazine rings in AGR1.131 may be related to its lack of activity on CXCR4. AGR1.137 is expected to be less hydrophilic than AGR1.135, as it contains only one tertiary amine while AGR1.135 contains two. These tertiary amines are susceptible to protonation to form a quaternary ammonium salt. In addition, the ethyl ester group present in AGR1.137 is less polar than the nitro group in AGR1.135, a feature that could affect the solubility of the compounds as well as their interactions on the receptor.</p><p>SPT-TIRF analysis showed that AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 abolished the ability of CXCL12 to induce CXCR4 nanoclustering and altered receptor dynamics at the cell membrane. Moreover, as expected from the selection criteria, these compounds had no effect on CXCL12 binding, receptor internalization, cAMP-production, or ERK1/2 or PI3K activation. The results also suggested the existence of different CXCR4 conformational states responsible for the activation of different signaling pathways. It is well known that GPCRs are thought to reside on the plasma membrane in equilibrium between distinct states, depending on complex allosteric interactions and ligand-induced conformational changes, as well as cell-specific parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vauquelin and Van Liefde, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wess et al., 2008</xref>). The emerging view is that GPCRs are highly dynamic proteins, and ligands with varying pharmacological properties differentially modulate the balance between multiple conformations. In the absence of agonists, the receptor population is dominated by conformations closely related to those observed in inactive-state crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Manglik et al., 2015</xref>). While agonist binding drives the receptor population towards conformations similar to those in active-state structures, a mixture of inactive and active conformations remains, reflecting ‘loose’ or incomplete allosteric coupling between the orthosteric and transducer pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dror et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, for some GPCRs, and under some experimental conditions, a substantial fraction of unliganded receptors are already in an active-like conformation, which may be related to their level of basal or constitutive signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Staus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ye et al., 2016</xref>). These basal activities can be modulated by ligands of varying potency. Full agonists can induce the maximal signaling response, whereas partial agonists and inverse agonists promote submaximal signaling and decrease basal activity, respectively. In addition, some ligands are known to be biased by selectively activating specific receptor-associated pathways at the expense of others, supporting the existence of distinct receptor conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kenakin, 2013</xref>). Studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor support the idea that different agonists stabilize different receptor conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yao et al., 2006</xref>), raising the possibility that allosteric ligands shift the balance to favor a particular receptor conformation. Biased ligands or allosteric modulators may thus achieve their distinctive signaling profiles by modulating this distribution of receptor conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wingler and Lefkowitz, 2020</xref>). For example, some analogs of angiotensin II do not appreciably activate Gq signaling (e.g. increase IP3 and Ca<sup>2+</sup>), but still induce receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wei et al., 2003</xref>). Some of these ligands activate Gi and G<sub>12</sub> in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Namkung et al., 2018</xref>). A similar observation has been described for CCR5, where some chemokine analogs promote G protein subtype-specific signaling bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lorenzen et al., 2018</xref>). Structural analyses of various GPCRs in the presence of different ligands vary considerably in the extent and nature of the conformational changes in the orthosteric ligand-binding site upon agonist binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Venkatakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). However, these changes modify conserved motifs in the interior of the receptor core and induce common conformational changes in the intracellular site involved in signal transduction.</p><p>We failed to detect a direct interaction between the compounds and CXCR4. Therefore, we employed an indirect strategy using docking and MD to confirm this interaction and to predict the most promising CXCR4 binding residues involved in the binding of the selected compounds. This methodology was combined with a mutation strategy to confirm the binding specificity of the allosteric modulators. AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 lost antagonism on cells expressing CXCR4L208K or CXCR4Y256F. LigPlot +analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laskowski and Swindells, 2011</xref>) indicated that AGR1.135 interacts directly with the receptor through a hydrogen bond with Y256 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). When this residue was mutated to F, one of the anchors for the compound was lost, weakening the potential interaction in the region of the upper anchor point. It is not clear how the Y256F mutation affects the binding of AGR1.137, but other potential contacts cannot be ruled out since this part of the compound is identical in both AGR1.135 and AGR1.137. This is particularly important for its neighboring residues in the alpha helix, F249, L208, as shown in the 3ODU structure, which appear to be directly involved in the interaction of both compounds with CXCR4. Alternatively, we cannot rule out an interaction between Y256 and other TMs or lipids stabilizing the overall structure, which could reverse the effect of the mutant at a later stage.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Ligplot representation of antagonists interactions with CXCR4.</title><p>Ligplot representations of AGR1.135 (<bold>A</bold>) and AGR1.137 (<bold>B</bold>), with hydrogen bonds represented in green dotted lines and non-bonded contacts in red spoke arcs.

Both allosteric modulators showed stable trajectories bound to CXCR4, being able to occupy the cavity formed by TMV and TMVI and maintaining specific hydrogen-bond interactions and hydrophobic contacts along the interaction surface. Moreover, there were differences between the two modulators in terms of binding; whereas AGR1.135 showed a more elaborated interaction due to three hydrogen bonds that curved the position of the molecule as it fitted into the cavity formed by TMV and TMVI, AGR1.137 bound to the carboxyl group of V124 in TMIII, penetrating deeper into the receptor and then following the TMV–TMVI cleft down to the bottom of the cavity. In both cases, hydrophobic interactions with several residues of the receptor allowed the compounds to attach to the cleft and partially abolish the movement of TMVI required for complete signal transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wescott et al., 2016</xref>). AGR1.137 allowed for a different conformation of the TMVI helix, one that is more shifted towards an active conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). By contrast, predictions indicated that AGR1.135 established hydrogen bonds with residues G207, Y256, and R235, complemented by hydrophobic interactions in TMV and TMVI, comprising a total surface area of 400 Å<sup>2</sup> with a length of 20 Å. AGR1.135 appeared in a more stretched conformation than AGR1.137 due to its ability to share a hydrogen bond with R235. AGR1.137 could use the carboxyl group of V124 in TMIII and overlap with AGR1.135 binding in the cavity, interacting with the other 19 residues scattered between TMV and VI to create an interaction surface of 370 Å<sup>2</sup> along 20 Å. AGR1.137 did not have the phenyl ring present in AGR1.135, resulting in a shorter moiety with greater difficulty in reaching the lower part of TMVI where R235 sits. These differences may explain the different behavior of the two compounds in cells expressing CXCR4F249L and suggest a closer interaction between the triazole group of AGR1.137 and the F249 residue on CXCR4. The main difference between AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 is the way in which the triazole group interacts with F249 and L216. For AGR1.137, the three groups are aligned in a parallel organization, which appears to be more effective. This is because there is only one hydrogen bond with V124, which significantly contributes to a more flexible interaction. Contrastingly, AGR1.135 has two anchor points on either side of the link, which, together with the interaction with F248, results in a more rigid position in the cleft. When F249 is changed to L and the two most likely rotamers resulting from the mutation are shown, rotamer B appears in close proximity to the compound, which may cause the binding to either be displaced or to adopt an alternative conformation that is easier to bind into the cleft. As mentioned above, it is likely that AGR1.135 can displace the mutant rotamer and bind more easily to the cleft due to its higher affinity. This region has also been implicated in the attachment of the orthosteric chemokine binding pocket to the lipid bilayer. F249 in CXCR4 as well as L132, V214 and L216 are involved in cholesterol binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Marino et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, AGR1.137 may also affect cholesterol binding to CXCR4, thereby altering receptor oligomerization. The X-ray structure of CXCR4 with PDB code 3ODU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2010</xref>) shows experimentally the presence of two fatty acid molecules in contact with both TMV and TMVI. Although further experiments are needed to clarify the mechanism, our results suggest that cholesterol and/or other lipids might also play an important role in CXCR4 oligomerization and function, as seen for other GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jakubík and El-Fakahany, 2021</xref>). We have recently shown that the lipid composition of the cell membrane modulates CXCR4 oligomerization. The chemokine field is very complex, and most receptors can form dimers (homo- and heterodimers) as well as oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Martínez-Muñoz, 2011</xref>). It is therefore possible that the compounds might also affect the function of other chemokine receptors that heterodimerize with CXCR4. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the residues involved in CXCR4 oligomerization might differ from those involved in dimeric structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Marino et al., 2023</xref>). These observations highlight the flexibility of the cavity and its potential for modulation. They also suggest that this cavity could be used to guide the development of a new generation of antagonists that, without affecting CXCL12 binding, allosterically modulate some GPCR-mediated functions without altering others.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>TMVI transition from inactive to active position.</title><p>Ribbon representation of TMVI of CXCR4 structures superimposed for inactive (PDB code 3ODU), intermediate active (AGR1.135, AGR1.137) and active (PDB 8U4N) upon interaction with no, negative allosteric modulators and CXCL12-induced Gi-protein interaction, respectively.

As might be expected, CXCR4 antagonism has been shown to disrupt tumor-stromal interactions, sensitize cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs, and reduce tumor growth and metastatic burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>). We used a ZTX model with HeLa cells expressing functional CXCR4 to evaluate the in vivo relevance of the selected antagonists. This is a well-studied model to assess tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Our results demonstrate that AGR1.137 treatment of HeLa cells induce a dose-dependent reduction tumor size by 40% and limits cell dissemination in the absence of toxicity, suggesting that this compound has both anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic properties. While the effect of AGR1.137 on cell dissemination may be a consequence of its effect on tumorigenesis, it also abolished directed HeLa cell migration in vitro, supporting the inhibition of cell metastasis. The data support that AGR1.137 reduces tumor size and metastasis to a similar extent as AMD3100, but the allosteric modulator is highly hydrophobic and therefore it will be very important to improve solubility, increase affinity and optimize delivery, to facilitate its use, particularly in vivo. AMD3100, which is FDA-approved for clinical use, is an orthosteric inhibitor of CXCR4 that blocks the entire signaling cascade triggered by CXCL12. Indeed, we observed that AMD3100 treatment blocked CXCL12 binding, cAMP inhibition, calcium flux, cell adhesion and cell migration, whereas the effect of AGR1.137 was limited to CXCL12-mediated directed cell migration. Although AMD3100 was well tolerated by healthy volunteers in a single-dose study, it also promotes some mild and reversible events such as increases in white blood cell counts and variations in urinary calcium just outside the normal range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hendrix et al., 2000</xref>). For the treatment of viral infections, continuous daily dosing of AMD3100 was impractical due to severe side effects including cardiac arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Clercq, 2015</xref>). It is therefore critical to control the timing of administration of AMD3100 in the context of therapeutic use. In addition, side effects after long-term administration are a potential problem. Shorter-term usage and lower doses would be fundamental keys to success in clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). The use of new drugs, such as the negative allosteric modulator AGR1.137, which block cell migration but do not affect other CXCL12-mediated signaling pathways, would, at least in theory, be more specific and produce fewer side effects.</p><p>Our data support the notion that CXCR4 is a flexible protein that can adopt a spectrum of conformations depending on several factors such as the presence of a bound ligand, the lipid composition of the cell membraneand the presence of other interacting proteins. As with many GPCRs, the stabilization of distinct CXCR4 states is a key element to modulate its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourque et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nygaard et al., 2013</xref>). Our data show that by targeting the pocket between TMV and TMVI in CXCR4, AGR1.137 can block (both in vitro and in vivo) CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering and cell sensitivity to chemoattractant gradients without altering ligand binding, thus preserving other signaling events. Ultimately, these results demonstrate the value of stabilizing specific CXCR4 conformations and considering targets other than the ligand-binding site for the design of negative allosteric modulators to block a specific set of CXCR4 functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>HeLa cells (CCL-2) and HEK293T cells (CRL-11268) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).

At the time we performed these analyses, several crystallographic structures of CXCR4 in complex with different molecules and peptides were deposited in the PDB. None of them were fully resolved because the N- and C-terminal ends of CXCR4 are very flexible loops. In addition, the CXCR4 constructs contained T4 lysozyme inserted between helices TMV and TMVI to increase the stability of the protein; this was a common strategy to facilitate crystallogenesis of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zou et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, a CXCR4 homology model was generated using the SWISS-MODEL server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>).

The center of the catalytic pocket was selected as the centroid of the grid. In the grid generation, a scaling factor of 1.0 in van der Waals radius scaling and a partial charge cutoff of 0.25 were used. A rescoring of the SP poses of each compound was then performed with the XP scoring function of Glide. The XP mode in Glide was used in the virtual screening, the ligand sampling was flexible, epik state penalties were added, and an energy window of 2.5 kcal/mol was used for ring sampling. In the energy minimization step, the distance dependent dielectric constant was 4.0 with a maximum number of minimization steps of 100,000. In the clustering, poses were considered as duplicates and discarded if both RMS deviation is less than 0.5 Å and maximum atomic displacement is less than 1.3 Å.</p><p>Simulations were calculated with an Asus 1151 h170 LVX-GTX-980Ti workstation, with an Intel Core i7-6500 K Processor (12 M Cache, 3.40 GHz) and 16 GB DDR4 2133 MHz RAM, equipped with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 980Ti available for GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) computations.</p><p>The computational sequential workflow applied in this project included: (i) Protein model construction, (ii) Virtual screening (Glide), (iii) PELE, (iv) Docking (autoDock and Glide) and (v) MD (AMBER).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>PELE</title><p>A Protein Energy Landscape Exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borrelli et al., 2005</xref>) study was carried out for the control molecule IT1t, which is a small druglike isothiourea derivative that has been crystallized in complex with CXCR4 (PDB code: 3ODU). PELE is a method to explore the energy landscape of a protein that can perform unconstrained ligand exploration to search its binding site. PELE combines a Monte Carlo stochastic approach with protein structure prediction algorithms. The script ‘Unconstrained ligand exploration and binding search’ was used to calculate 20 PELE trajectories for each ligand of the PELE program, yielding 20 PELE trajectories for each ligand. From the best five trajectories, two of them presented clearly better binding energies, and corresponded to almost the same predicted pose of the molecule. Although the predicted binding mode was not exactly the same as that in the crystal structure, the approximation was very good, allowing the approach validation. Although PELE is a suitable technique to find potential binding sites, the predicted poses must be subsequently refined using docking programs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Docking studies</title><p>All compounds were adjusted to a pH of 7.2±0.2 using the Maestro LigPrep tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">LigPrep, 2016</xref>.

The CXCR4-IT1t complex was used as a control to validate the protocol. Simulations were performed using AMBER14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Case et al., 2014</xref>) with ff14SB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maier et al., 2015</xref>) and lipid14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickson et al., 2014</xref>) force fields in the NPT thermodynamic ensemble (constant pressure and temperature). All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lippert et al., 2007</xref>). To stabilize CXCR4 and more accurately reproduce the real environment in the MD simulation, the system was embedded in a lipid bilayer using the Membrane Builder tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jo et al., 2009</xref>) from the CHARMM-GUI server. The membrane was composed of 175 molecules of the fatty acid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) in each leaflet. The protein-membrane complex was solvated with TIP3 water molecules. Chloride ions were added up to a concentration of 0.15 M in water, and sodium ions were added to neutralize the system. Minimization was performed using 3500 Steepest Descent steps and 4500 Conjugate Gradient steps three times, firstly considering only hydrogens, then considering only water molecules and ions, and finally minimizing all atoms. Equilibration raises system temperature from 0 to 300 K at a constant volume, fixing everything but ions and water molecules. After thermalization, several density equilibration phases were performed. In the production phase 50 ns MD simulations without position restraints were calculated using a time step of 2 fs. Trajectories of the most interesting poses were extended to 150 ns. ‘Stable trajectories’ have been defined to refer to those trajectories of the ligand-protein complexes whose RMSD does not fluctuate more than 0.25 Å. To estimate the affinity of the ligands for CXCR4, the binding energy of each representative structure obtained with the principal components analysis was calculated using the PRODIGY-LIGAND server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vangone and Bonvin, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Virtual screening validation</title><p>We also used a strategy based on the model of CXCR4 predicted by AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) and the sequence available under UniProt entry P61073 to validate our studies. We prepared the ligands using the OpenBabel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">O’Boyle et al., 2011</xref>), with a gasteiger charge assignment, and generated 10 conformers for each input ligand using OpenBabel. We then prepared the target structure with Openmm, removing all water and possible heteroatoms, and adding all missing atoms. We next predicted the target binding pockets with fPocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Le Guilloux et al., 2009</xref>), p2rank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krivák and Hoksza, 2018</xref>), and AutoDock autosite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ravindranath and Sanner, 2016</xref>).

We merged the results of the three programs into so-called consensus pockets, as two pockets are said to be sufficiently similar if at least 75% of their surfaces are shared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Del Hoyo et al., 2023</xref>). From the consensus pockets, one pocket was significantly larger than the others and was, therefore, selected.

Then, we clustered the different solutions into groups whose maximum RMSD was 1 Å.

These are conditions corresponding to the unstimulated cells. To observe the effect of the ligand, we coated dishes with CXCL12 (100 nM, 1 hr, 37 °C); stimulated cells were incubated (20 min, 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) before image acquisition. Experiments were performed at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (Leica AM TIRF inverted microscope; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Image sequences of individual particles (500 frames) were then acquired at 49% laser power (488 nm diode laser) with a frame rate of 10 Hz (100 ms/frame). The penetration depth of the evanescent field was 90 nm.

The receptor number along individual trajectories was determined as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martínez-Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>), using the intensity of the monomeric protein CD86-AcGFP as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dorsch et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, for each particle detected we measured the intensity of pixels around the particle (in a 3×3 pixel matrix whose central position is given by the coordinates x, y obtained by U-Track2), in each frame along its trajectory. We also estimated the particle background (K0) for each frame. K0 for each frame was calculated by locating the cell in the video and analyzing the intensities of the cell background in each frame. K0 was chosen as the gray value at a given quantile of this distribution (80%). The intensity value for each particle is then given by the difference between particle intensity and the background in each frame. To minimize photon fluctuations within a given frame, we considered the particle intensity as the average value (background subtracted) obtained over the first 20 frames. To ensure that no photobleaching events occurred within this range of frames that would affect the quantitation of the data, we measured the photobleaching times (s) from individual CD86-AcGFP (electroporated in Jurkat CD4 + cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dorsch et al., 2009</xref>) particles that exclusively showed a single photobleaching step. Fitting of the distribution to a single exponential decay renders a τ0 value of ∼5 s, which corresponds to 50 frames (100 ms/frame). The total number of receptors/particles was finally estimated by dividing the average particle intensity by the particle intensity arising from individual AcGFP molecules. To unequivocally identify the intensity emitted by an individual AcGFP, we used as a calibrator Jurkat CD4<sup>+</sup> cells electroporated with the monomeric CD86-AcGFP. We performed SPT experiments on CD86-AcGFP and analyzed the data in similar way as described above. Distribution of monomeric particle intensities was analyzed by Gaussian fitting, rendering a mean value of 980 ± 89 a.u. This value was then used as the monomer reference to estimate CXCR4-AcGFP particle size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Internalization and flow cytometry studies</title><p>Cells (5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) were activated with CXCL12 (50 nM) at the indicated time points at 37 °C.

Statistical differences were reported as n.s.=not significant p&gt;0.05, *p≤0.05, **p≤0.01, ***p≤0.001 and ****p≤0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>Has a patent for compounds AGR1.131, AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 (PCT/ES2022/070376)</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Provided input into the project</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Provided input into the project</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Resources, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con22"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con23"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con24"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con25"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from buffy coats were obtained from the Centro de Transfusiones of the Madrid Community.

Overall, the results build a strong case for the potential of this new compound to target specific functions of CXCR4, particularly linked to tumorigenesis.

This way, the authors designed compound AGR1.137, which abolishes ligand-induced CXCR4 receptor nanoclustering and the subsequent directed cell migration without affecting ligand-binding itself or some other ligand-induced signaling pathways. The authors have used a relatively broad set of experiments to validate and demonstrate the effects of the drug. Importantly, the authors also test AGR1.137 in vivo, using a zebra fish model of tumorigenesis and metastasis. A relatively strong inhibitory effect of the compound is reported.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors have been able to significantly strengthen their data from the first submission. The content of this manuscript is pretty solid, although studies in mammalian model systems are naturally needed in the future to better assess the promise of the compound.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93968.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p><p>(1) In the &quot;Introduction&quot; section, an important aspect that requires attention pertains to the discussion surrounding the heterodimerization of CXCR4 and CCR5. Notably, the manuscript overlooks a recent study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42082-z">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-42082-z</ext-link>) elucidating the mechanism underlying the formation of functional dimers within these G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)…The inclusion of this study within the manuscript would significantly enrich the contextual framework of the work, offering readers a comprehensive understanding of the current knowledge surrounding the structural dynamics and functional implications of CXCR4 and CCR5 heterodimerization.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her recommendation to enrich the contextual framework of our study. The Nature Communications paper by Di Marino et al. was published after we sent the first version of our manuscript to eLife, and therefore was not included in the discussion. As the reviewer rightly indicates, this paper elucidates the mechanism underlying the formation of functional dimers within CCR5 and CXCR4. Using metadynamics approaches, the authors emphasize the importance of distinct transmembrane regions for dimerization of the two receptors. In particular, CXCR4 shows two low energy dimer structures and the TMVI-TMVII helices are the preferred interfaces involved in the protomer interactions in both cases. Although the study uses in silico techniques, it also includes the molecular binding mechanism of CCR5 and CXCR4 in the membrane environment, as the authors generate a model in which the receptors are immersed in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) phospholipid bilayer with 10% cholesterol. This is an important point in this study, as membrane lipids also interact with membrane proteins, and the lipid composition affects CXCR4 oligomerization (Gardeta S.R. et al. Front. Immunol. 2023). In particular, Di Marino et al. find a cholesterol molecule placed in-between the two CXCR4 protomers where it engages a series of hydrophobic interactions with residues including Leu132, Val214, Leu216 and Phe249. Then, the polar head of cholesterol forms an H-bond with Tyr135 that further stabilizes protomer binding. In our hands, the F249L mutation in CXCR4 reverted the antagonism of AGR1.137, suggesting that the compound binds, among others, this residue. We should, nonetheless, indicate that we analyzed receptor oligomerization and not CXCR4 dimerization, which was the main object of the Di Marino et al. study. It is therefore also plausible that other residues than those described as essential for CXCR4 dimerization might participate in receptor oligomerization. We can speculate that AGR1.137 might affect cholesterol binding to CXCR4 and, therefore, alter dimerization/oligomerization. Additionally, the CXCR4 x-ray structure with PDB code 3ODU (Wu B. et al. Science, 2010) experimentally shows the presence of two fatty acid molecules in contact with both TMV and TMVI. These molecules closely interact with hydrophobic residues in the protein, thereby stabilizing it in a hydrophobic environment. Although more experiments will be needed to clarify the mechanism involved, our results suggest that cholesterol and/or other lipids also play an important role in CXCR4 oligomerization and function, as seen for other GPCRs (Jakubik J. &amp; ElFakahani E.E. Int J Mol Sci. 2021). However, we should also consider that other factors not included in the analysis by Di Marino et al. can also affect CXCR4 oligomerization; for instance, the co-expression of other chemokine receptors and/or other GPCRs that heterodimerize with CXCR4 might affect CXCR4 dynamics at the cell membrane, similar to other membrane proteins such as CD4, which also forms complexes with CXCR4 (Martinez-Muñoz L. et al. Mol. Cell 2018).</p><p>The revised discussion contains references to the study by Di Marino et al. to enrich the contextual framework of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In &quot;various sections&quot; of the manuscript, there appears to be confusion surrounding the terminology used to refer to antagonists. It is recommended to provide a clearer distinction between allosteric and orthosteric antagonists to enhance reader comprehension. An orthosteric antagonist typically binds to the same site as the endogenous ligand, directly blocking its interaction with the receptor. On the other hand, an allosteric antagonist binds to a site distinct from the orthosteric site, inducing a conformational change in the receptor that inhibits the binding of the endogenous ligand. By explicitly defining the terms &quot;allosteric antagonist&quot; and &quot;orthosteric antagonist&quot; within the manuscript, readers will be better equipped to discern the specific mechanisms discussed in the context of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>The behavior of the compounds described in our manuscript (AGR1.35 and AGR1.137) fits with the definition of allosteric antagonists, as they bind on a site distinct from the orthosteric site, although they only block some ligand-mediated functions and not others. This would mean that they are not formally antagonists and should be not considered as allosteric compounds, as their binding on CXCR4 does not alter CXCL12 binding, although they might affect its affinity. In this sense, our compounds respond much better to the concept of negative allosteric modulators (Gao Z.-G. &amp; Jacobson K.A. Drug Discov. Today Technol. 2013). They act by binding on a site distinct from the orthosteric site and selectively block some downstream signaling pathways but not others induced by the same endogenous agonist.</p><p>To avoid confusion and to clarify the role of the compounds described in this study, we now refer to them as negative allosteric modulators along the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the Results section, the computational approach employed for &quot;screening small compounds targeting CXCR4, particularly focusing on the inhibition of CXCL12-induced CXCR4 nanoclustering&quot;, requires clarification due to several points of incomprehension. The following recommendations aim to address these concerns and enhance the overall clarity of the section:</p><p>(1) Computational Approach and Binding Mode Description:</p><p>-Explicitly describe the methodology for identifying the pocket/clef area in angstroms (Å) on the CXCR4 protein structure. Include details on how the volume of the cleft enclosed by TMV and TMVI was determined, as this information is not readily apparent in the provided reference (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1601278113">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1601278113</ext-link>).</p></disp-quote><p>The identification of the cleft was based on the observations by Wu et al. (Wu B. et al. Science 2010) who described the presence of bound lipids in the area formed by TMV and VI, and those of Wescott et al. (Wescott M.P. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2016) on the importance of TMVI in the transmission of conformational changes promoted by CXCL12 on CXCR4 towards the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor to link the binding site with signaling activation. Collectively, these results, and our previous data on the critical role of the N-terminus region of TMVI for CXCR4 oligomerization (Martinez-Muñoz L. et al. Mol. Cell 2018), focused our in silico screening to this region. Once we detected that several compounds bound CXCR4 in this region, the cleavage properties were calculated by subtracting the compound structure. The resulting PDB was analyzed using the PDBsum server (Laskowski R.A. et. al. Protein Sci. 2018). Volume calculations were obtained using the server analyzing surface clefts by SURFNET (Laskowski R. A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995). The theoretical interaction surface between the selected compounds and CXCR4 and the atomic distances between the protein residues and the compounds was calculated using the PISA server (Krissinel E. &amp; Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007) (Fig. I, only for review purposes). The analysis of the cleft occupied by AGR1.135 showed two independent cavities of 434 Å3 and 1,381 Å3 that were not connected to the orthosteric site. In the case of AGR1.137, the data revealed two distinct clefts of 790 Å3 and 580 Å3 (Fig. I, only for review purposes). These details have been included in the revised manuscript (New Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig 8A, B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Clarify the statement regarding the cleft being &quot;surface exposed for interactions with the plasma membrane,&quot; particularly in the context of its embedding within the membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>For GPCRs, transmembrane domains represent binding sites for bioactive lipids that play important functional and physiological roles (Huwiler A. &amp; Zangemeister-Wittke U. Pharmacol. Ther. 2018). The channel between TMV and TMVI connects the orthosteric chemokine binding pocket to the lipid bilayer and is occupied by an oleic acid molecule, according to the CXCR4 structure published in 2010 (Wu B. et al. Science 2010). In addition, the target region contains residues involved in cholesterol (and perhaps other lipids) engagement (Di Marino et al. Nat. Commun. 2023). Taken together, these data support our statement that the cleft supports interactions between CXCR4 molecules and the plasma membrane.</p><p>Moreover, the data of Di Marino et al. also support that CCR5 and CXCR4 have a symmetric and an asymmetric binding mode. Therefore, either dimeric structure has the possibility to form trimers, tetramers, and even oligomers by using the free binding interface to complex with another protomer. This hypothesis suggests that the interaction of dimers to form oligomers should involve residues distinct from those included in the dimeric conformation.</p><p>The sentence has been modified in the revised manuscript to clarify comprehension.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Discuss the rationale behind targeting the allosteric binding pocket instead of the orthosteric pocket, outlining potential advantages and disadvantages.</p></disp-quote><p>The advantages and disadvantages of using negative allosteric modulators vs orthosteric antagonists have been now included in the revised discussion.</p><p>The majority of GPCR-targeted drugs function by binding to the orthosteric site of the receptor, and are agonists, partial agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists. These orthosteric compounds can have off-target effects and poor selectivity due to highly homologous receptor orthosteric sites and to abrogation of spatial and/or temporal endogenous signaling patterns.</p><p>The alternative is to use allosteric modulators, which can tune the functions associated with the receptors without affecting the orthosteric site. They can be positive, negative or neutral modulators, depending on their effect on the functionality of the receptor (Foster D.J. &amp; Conn P.J. Neuron 2017). For example, the use of a negative allosteric modulator of a chemokine receptor to dampen pathological signaling events, while retaining full signaling for non-pathological activities might limit adverse effects (Kohout T.A.et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2004). In this case, the negative allosteric modulator 873140 blocks CCL3 binding on CCR5 but does not alter CCL5 binding (Watson C. et al. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005). In other cases, allosteric modulators can stabilize a particular receptor conformation and block others. The mechanism of action of the anti-HIV-1, FDAapproved, CCR5 allosteric modulator, maraviroc (Jin J. et al. Sci. Signal. 2018) is attributed to its ability to modulate CCR5 dimer populations and their subsequent subcellular trafficking and localization to the cell membrane (Jin J .et al. Sci. Signal. 2018). Two CCR5 dimeric conformations that are imperative for membrane localization were present in the absence of maraviroc; however, an additional CCR5 dimer conformation was discovered after the addition of maraviroc, and all homodimeric conformations were further stabilized. This finding is consistent with the observation that CCR5 dimers and oligomers inhibit HIV host-cell entry, likely by preventing the HIV-1 co-receptor formation.</p><p>It is well known that GPCRs activate G proteins, but they also recruit additional proteins (e.g., β-arrestins) that induce signaling cascades which, in turn, can direct specific subsets of cellular responses independent of G protein activation (Eichel K. et al. Nature 2018) and are responsible for either therapeutic or adverse effects. Allosteric modulators can thus be used to block these adverse effects without influencing the therapeutic benefits. This was the case in the design of G protein-biased agonists for the kappa opioid receptor, which maintain the desirable antinociceptive and antipruritic effects and eliminate the sedative and dissociative effects in rodent models (Brust T.F. et al. Sci. Signal 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Provide the PDB ID of the CXCR4 structure used as a template for modeling with SwissModel. Explain the decision to model the structure from the amino acid sequence and suggest an alternative approach, such as utilizing AlphaFold structures and performing classical molecular dynamics with subsequent clustering for the best representative structure.</p></disp-quote><p>The PDB used as a template for modeling CXCR4 was 3ODU. This information was already included in the material and methods section. At the time we performed these analyses, there were several crystallographic structures of CXCR4 in complex with different molecules and peptides deposited at the PDB. None of them included a full construct containing the complete receptor sequence to provide a suitable sample for Xray structure resolution, as the N- and C-terminal ends of CXCR4 are very flexible loops. In addition, the CXCR4 constructs contained T4 lysozyme inserted between helices TMV and TMVI to increase the stability of the protein––a common strategy used to facilitate crystallogenesis of GPCRs (Zou Y. et al. PLoS One 2012). Therefore, we generated a CXCR4 homology model using the SWISS-MODEL server (Waterhouse A. et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2018). This program reconstructed the loop between TMV and TMVI, a domain particularly important in this study that was not present in any of the crystal structure available in PDB. The model structure was, nonetheless, still incomplete, as it began at P27 and ended at S319 because the terminal ends were not resolved in the crystal structure used as a template. Nevertheless, we considered that these terminal ends were not involved in CXCR4 oligomerization.</p><p>As Alphafold was not available at the time we initiated this project, we didn’t use it. However, we have now updated our workflow to current methods and predicted the structure of the target using AlphaFold (Jumper J. et al. Nature 2021) and the sequence available under UniProt entry P61073. We prepared the ligands using OpenBabel (O’Boyle N.M. et al., J. Cheminformatics 2011), with a gasteiger charge assignment, and generated 10 conformers for each input ligand using the OpenBabel genetic algorithm. We then prepared the target structure with Openmm, removing all waters and possible heteroatoms, and adding all missing atoms. We next predicted the target binding pockets with fPocket (Le Guilloux V. et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2009), p2rank (Krivak R. &amp; Hoksza, J. Cheminformatics 2018), and AutoDock autosite (Ravindranath P.A. &amp; Sanner M.F. Bioinformatics 2016). We chose only those pockets between TMV and TMVI (see answer to point 3). We merged the results of the three programs into so-called consensus pockets, as two pockets are said to be sufficiently similar if at least 75% of their surfaces are shared (del Hoyo D. et al. J. Chem. Inform. Model. 2023). From the consensus pockets, there was one pocket that was significantly larger than the others and was therefore selected. We then docked the ligand conformers in this pocket using AutoDock GPU (Santos-Martins D. et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021), LeDock (Liu N &amp; Xu Z., IOP Conf. Ser. Earth Environ. Sci. 2019), and Vina (Eberhardt J. et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2021). The number of dockings varied from 210 to 287 poses. We scored each pose with the Vina score using ODDT (Wójcikowski M. et al. J. Cheminform. 2015). Then, we clustered the different solutions into groups whose maximum RMSD was 1Å. This resulted in 40 clusters, the representative of each cluster was the one with maximum Vina score and confirmed that the selected compounds bound this pocket (Author response image 1). When required, we calculated the binding affinity using Schrodinger’s MM-GBSA procedure (Greenidge P.A. et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2013), in two ways: first, assuming that the ligand and target are fixed; second, with an energy minimization of all the atoms within a distance of 3Å from the ligand. This information has now been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>AGR1.</title><p>135 docking in CXCR4 using the updated protocol for ligand docking.

The top-scoring binders were then subjected to further refinement using PELE simulations. However, I realize that a detailed description of the specific binding modes of these compounds was not provided in the text. Please make the description of binding poses more detailed</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, to assess the reliability of this method, a PELE study was carried out for the control molecule IT1t, which is a small drug-like isothiourea derivative that has been crystallized in complex with CXCR4 (PDB code: 3ODU). IT1t is a CXCR4 antagonist that binds to the CXCL12 binding cavity and inhibits HIV-1 infection (Das D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2015; Dekkers S. et al. J. Med. Chem. 2023). From the best five trajectories, two of them had clearly better binding energies, and corresponded to almost the same predicted pose of the molecule. Although the predicted binding mode was not exactly the same as the one in the crystal structure, the approximation was very good, giving validation to the approach. Although PELE is a suitable technique to find potential binding sites, the predicted poses must be subsequently refined using docking programs.</p><p>Analyzing the best trajectories for the remaining ligands, at least one of the best-scored poses was always located at the orthosteric binding site of CXCR4. Even though these poses showed good binding energies, they were discarded as the in vitro biological experiments indicated that the compounds were unable to block CXCL12 binding or CXCL12-mediated inhibition of cAMP release or CXCR4 internalization. Collectively, these data indicated that the selected compounds did not behave as orthosteric inhibitors of CXCR4. The CXCL12 binding pocket is the biggest cavity in CXCR4, and so PELE may tend to place the molecules near it. However, all the compounds presented other feasible binding sites with a comparable binding energy.</p><p>AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 showed interesting poses between TMV and TMVI with very good binding energy (-51.4 and -37.2 kcal/mol, respectively). This was precisely the region we had previously selected for the in silico screening, as previously described (see response to point 3).</p><p>AGR1.131 showed two poses with low binding energy that were placed between helices TMI and TMVII (-43.6 kcal/mol) and between helices TMV and TMVI (-39.8 kcal/mol). This compound was unable to affect CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis and was therefore used as an internal negative control as it was selected in the in silico screening with the same criteria as the other compounds but failed to alter any CXCL12-mediated functions. PELE studies nonetheless provided different binding sites for each molecule, which had to be further studied using docking to obtain a more accurate binding mode. In agreement with the previous commentary, we repeated the analysis using AlphaFold and the rest of the procedure described (see our response to point 6) and calculated the binding energies for all the compounds using Schrodinger’s MM-GBSA procedure (Greenidge P.A. et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2013). Calculations were performed in two ways: first, assuming that the ligand and target are fixed; second, with an energy minimization of all the atoms within a distance of 3Å from the ligand. The results using the first method indicated that AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 showed poses between TMV and TMVI with - 56.4 and -62.4 kcal/mol, respectively and AGR1.131 had a pose between TMI and TMVII with -61.6kcal/mol. In the second method AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 showed poses between TMV and TMVI with -57.9, and -67.6 kcal/mol, respectively, and AGR1.131 of -62.2 kcal/mol between TMI and TMVII.</p><p>This information is now included in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) (2) Experimental Design:-Justify the choice of treating Jurkat cells with a concentration of 50 μM of the selected compound.

In all cases, 100 µM nearly completely abrogated cell migration, but in order to reduce the amount of DMSO added to the cells we selected 50 µM for further experiments, as it was the concentration that inhibits 50-75% of ligand-induced cell migration. Regarding the type of small compounds used in the initial experiments, they were compounds included in the library described in reference #24 (Sebastian-Pérez V. et al Med. Biol.

J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2017). The center of the catalytic pocket was selected as the centroid of the grid. In the grid generation, a scaling factor of 1.0 in van der Waals radius scaling and a partial charge cutoff of 0.25 were used. A rescoring of the SP poses of each compound was then performed with the XP scoring function of the Glide. The XP mode in Glide was used in the virtual screening, the ligand sampling was flexible, epik state penalties were added and an energy window of 2.5 kcal/mol was used for ring sampling. In the energy minimization step, the distance-dependent dielectric constant was 4.0 with a maximum number of minimization steps of 100,000. In the clustering, poses were considered as duplicates and discarded if both RMS deviation is less than 0.5 Å and maximum atomic displacement is less than 1.3 Å.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Provide clarity on the statement that AGR1.131 &quot;theoretically&quot; binds the same motif, explaining the docking procedure used for this determination.</p></disp-quote><p>In the in silico screening, AGR1.131 was one of the 40 selected compounds that showed, according to the PELE analysis (see answer to point 8), a pose with low binding energy (-39.8 kcal/mol) between TMV and TMVI helices, which is the selected area for the screening. It, nonetheless, also showed a best pose placed between helices TM1 and TM7 (-43.7 kcal/mol) using the initial workflow. In conclusion, although AGR1.131 also faced to the TMV-TMVI, the most favorable pose was in the area between TMI and TMVII. In addition, the compound was included in the biological screening, where it did not affect CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis. We thus decided to use it as an internal negative control, as it has a skeleton very similar to AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 and can interact with the TM domains of CXCR4 without promoting biological effects.

Specificity of Low Molecular Weight Compounds:</p><p>-Clearly articulate how AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 specifically target homodimeric CXCR4 and provide an explanation for their lack of impact on heterodimeric CXCR4-CCR5 in that region.</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, we should clarify that when we talk about receptor nanoclustering, oligomers refer to complexes including 3 or more receptors and, therefore, the residues involved in these interactions can differ from those involved in receptor dimerization. Moreover, our FRET experiments did not indicate that the compounds alter receptor dimerization (see new Supplementary Fig. 7). Of note, mutant receptors unable to oligomerize can still form dimers (Martínez-Muñoz L. et al. Mol. Cell 2018; García-Cuesta E.M .et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2022). Additionally, we believe that these oligomers can also include other chemokine receptors/proteins expressed at the cell membrane, which we are currently studying using different models and techniques.</p><p>We have results supporting the existence of CCR5/CXCR4 heterodimers (Martínez-Muñoz L et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2014), in line with the data published by Di Marino et al. However, in the current study we have not evaluated the impact of the selected compounds on other CXCR4 complexes distinct from CXCR4 oligomers. Our Jurkat cells do not express CCR5 and, therefore, we cannot discuss whether AGR1.137 affects CCR5/CXCR4 heterodimers. The chemokine field is very complex and most receptors can form dimers (homo- and heterodimers) as well as oligomers (Martinez-Muñoz L., et al Pharmacol &amp; Therap. 2011) when co-expressed. To evaluate different receptor combinations in the same experiment is a complex task, as the number of potential combinations between distinct expressed receptors makes the analysis very difficult. We started with CXCR4 as a model, to continue later with other possible CXCR4 complexes. In addition, for the analysis of CCR5/CXCR4 dynamics, it is much better to use dual-TIRF techniques, which allow the simultaneous detection of two distinct molecules coupled to different fluorochromes.</p><p>Regarding the data of Di Marino et al., it is possible that the compounds might also affect heterodimeric conformations of CXCR4. This aspect has also been broached in the revised discussion. We would again note that we evaluated CXCR4 oligomers and not monomers or dimers; this is especially relevant when we compare the residues involved in these processes as they might differ depending on the receptor conformation considered. This issue was also hypothesized by Di Marino et al. (see our response to point 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) When referring to &quot;unstimulated&quot; cells, provide a more detailed explanation to elucidate the experimental conditions and cellular state under consideration.</p></disp-quote><p>Unstimulated cells refer to the cells in basal conditions, that is, cells in the absence of CXCL12.

To observe the effect of the ligand, dishes were coated as above plus CXCL12 (stimulated cells).

The revised version of the manuscript also includes the effect of this inhibitor on other relevant CXCL12-mediated responses such as cell migration (Fig. 1B), receptor internalization (Fig. 3A), cAMP production (Fig. 3C), ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 4), actin polymerization (Fig. 4A), cell polarization (Fig. 4B, C) and cell adhesion (Fig. 4D), to facilitate the interpretation of the results and improve the experimental rigor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(20) 2. Clarification of Terminology:</p><p>-Clarify the term &quot;CXCR4 internalizes&quot; by providing context, perhaps explaining the process of receptor internalization and its relevance to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to CXCR4 internalization as a CXCL12-mediated endocytosis process that results in reduction of CXCR4 levels on the cell surface. We use CXCR4 internalization in this study with two purposes: First, for CXCR4 and other chemokine receptors, internalization processes are mediated by ligand-induced clathrin vesicles (Venkatesan et al 2003) a process that triggers CXCR4 aggregation in these vesicles. We have previously determined that the oligomers of receptors detected by TIRF-M remain unaltered in cells treated with inhibitors of clathrin vesicle formation and of internalization processes (Martinez-Muñoz L. et al. Mol. Cell 2018). Moreover, we have described a mutant CXCR4 that cannot form oligomers but internalizes normally in response to CXCL12 (Martinez-Muñoz L. et al. Mol. Cell 2018). The observation in this manuscript of normal CXCL12-mediated endocytosis in the presence of the negative allosteric inhibitors of CXCR4 that abrogate receptor oligomerization reinforces the idea that the oligomers detected by TIRF are not related to receptor aggregates involved in endocytosis; Second, receptor internalization is not affected by the allosteric compounds, indicating that they downregulate some CXCL12-mediated signaling events but not others (new Fig. 3).</p><p>All these data have been included in the revised discussion of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(21) Elaborate on the meaning of &quot;CXCL12 triggers normal CXCR4mut internalization&quot; to enhance reader understanding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously described a triple-mutant CXCR4 (K239L/V242A/L246A; CXCR4mut). The mutant residues are located in the N-terminal region of TMVI, close to the cytoplasmic region, thus limiting the CXCR4 pocket described in this study (see our response to point 3). This mutant receptor dimerizes but neither oligomerizes in response to CXCL12 nor supports CXCL12-induced directed cell migration, although it can still trigger some Ca2+ flux and is internalized after ligand activation (Martinez-Muñoz L. et al. Mol. Cell 2018). We use the behavior of this mutant (CXCR4mut) to show that the CXCR4 oligomers and the complexes involved in internalization processes are not the same and to explain why we evaluated CXCR4 endocytosis in the presence of the negative allosteric modulators.</p><p>As we indicated in a previous answer to the reviewer, these issues have been re-elaborated in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(22) 3.

With the exception of the cell migration assays in Transwells, where the optimal concentration was established at 12.5 nM, in the remaining experiments the optimal concentration of CXCL12 employed was 50 nM. These concentrations were optimized in previous works of our laboratory using the same type of experiment. We should also remark that in the experiments using lipid bilayers or TIRF-M experiments, CXCL12 is used to coat the plates and therefore it is difficult to determine the real concentration of the ligand that is retained in the surface of the plates after the washing steps performed prior to adding the cells. In addition, we use 100 nM CXCL12 to create the gradient in the chambers used to perform the directed-cell migration experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(23) 4.

Workflow Clarification:</p><p>-Clearly articulate the workflow used for assessing the binding of AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 to CXCR4. Address the apparent contradiction between the inability to detect a direct interaction and the utilization of Glide for docking in the TMV-TMVI cleft.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the direct interaction of the compounds with CXCR4, we intentionally avoided the modification of the small compounds with different labels, which could affect their properties. We therefore attempted a fluorescence a spectroscopy strategy to formally prove the ability of the small compounds to bind CXCR4, but this failed because the AGR1.135 is yellow in color, which interfered with the determinations. We also tried a FRET strategy (see new Supplementary Fig. 7) and detected a significant increase in FRET efficiency of CXCR4 homodimers when AGR1.135 was evaluated, but again the yellow color interfered with FRET determinations. Moreover, AGR1.137 did not modify FRET efficiency of CXCR4 dimers. Therefore, we were unable to detect the interaction of the compounds with CXCR4.</p><p>We elected to develop an indirect strategy; in silico, we evaluated the binding-site using docking and molecular dynamics to predict the most promising CXCR4 binding residues involved in the interaction with the selected compounds. Next, we generated point mutant receptors of the predicted residues and re-evaluated the behavior of the allosteric antagonists in a CXCL12-induced cell migration experiment. Obviously, we first discarded those CXCR4 mutants that were not expressed on the cell membrane as well as those that were not functional when activated with CXCL12. Using this strategy, we eliminated the interference due to the physical properties of the compounds and demonstrated that if the antagonism of a compound is reversed in a particular CXCR4 mutant it is because the mutated residue participates or interferes with the interaction between CXCR4 and the compound, thus assuming (albeit indirectly) that the compound binds CXCR4.</p><p>To select the specific mutations included in the analysis, our strategy was to generate point mutations in residues present in the TMV-TMVI pocket of CXCR4 that were not directly proposed as critical residues involved in chemokine engagement, signal initiation, signal propagation, or G protein-binding, based on the extensive mutational study published by Wescott MP et. al.

As the reviewer indicates, AMBER14 and PELE approaches might perhaps be considered obsolescent. Thus, we have predicted the structure of the target using AlphaFold (Jumper J. et al, Nature 2021) and the sequence available under UniProt entry P61073.

Elaborate on how the lipidic double layer may influence the binding of small compounds to GPCRs embedded in the membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>Biological membranes are vital components of living organisms, providing a diffusion barrier that separates cells from the extracellular environment, and compartmentalizing specialized organelles within the cell. In order to maintain the diffusion barrier and to keep it electrochemically sealed, a close interaction of membrane proteins with the lipid bilayer is necessary. It is well known that this is important, as many membrane proteins undergo conformational changes that affect their transmembrane regions and that may regulate their activity, as seen with GPCRs (Daemen F.J. &amp; Bonting S.L., Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1977; Gether U. et al. EMBO J. 1997). The lateral and rotational mobility of membrane lipids supports the sealing function while allowing for the structural rearrangement of membrane proteins, as they can adhere to the surface of integral membrane proteins and flexibly adjust to a changing microenvironment. In the case of the first atomistic structure of CXCR4 (Wu B. et al. Science 2010), it was indicated that for dimers, monomers interact only at the extracellular side of helices V and VI, leaving at least a 4-Å gap between the intracellular regions, which is presumably filled by lipids. In particular, they indicated that the channel between TMV and TMVI that connects the orthosteric chemokine binding pocket to the lipid bilayer is occupied by an oleic acid molecule. Recently, Di Marino et al., analyzing the dimeric structure of CXCR4, found a cholesterol molecule placed in between the two protomers, where it engages a series of hydrophobic interactions with residues located in the area between TMI and TMVI (Leu132, Val214, Leu216, Leu246, and Phe249). The polar head of cholesterol forms an H-bond with Tyr135 that further stabilizes its binding mode. This finding confirms that cholesterol might play an important role in mediating and stabilizing receptor dimerization, as seen in other GPCRs (Pluhackova, K., et al. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2016). In addition, we have previously observed that, independently of the structural changes on CXCR4 triggered by lipids, the local lipid environment also regulates CXCR4 organization, dynamics and function at the cell membrane and modulates chemokine-triggered directed cell migration. Prolonged treatment of T cells with bacterial sphingomyelinase promoted the complete and sustained breakdown of sphingomyelins and the accumulation of the corresponding ceramides, which altered both membrane fluidity and CXCR4 nanoclustering and dynamics. Under these conditions, CXCR4 retained some CXCL12-mediated signaling activity but failed to promote efficient directed cell migration (Gardeta S.R. et al. Front. Immunol. 2022). Collectively, these data demonstrate the key role that lipids play in the stabilization of CXCR4 conformations and in regulating its lateral mobility, influencing their associated functions. These considerations have been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>(29) 3.

Secondly, all mutated residues did not belong to any of the critical residues involved in transmitting the signal generated by the interaction of CXCL12 with the receptor. In any case, mutants producing a non-functional CXCR4 at the cell membrane were discarded after FACS analysis and chemotaxis experiments. Finally, the length and nature of the resulting mutations were designed mainly to occlude the cleft in case of the introduction of long residues such as lysines (I204K, L208K) or to alter hydrophobic interactions by changing the carbon side chain composition of the residues in the cleft. Indeed, we agree that the alanine scan mutation analysis would have been an alternative strategy to evaluate the residues involved in the interactions of the compounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(33) Reevaluate the statement regarding the relevance of the Y256F muta7on for the binding of AGR1.137.

This is especially true for its neighboring residues in the alpha helix, F249, L208, as shown in 3ODU structure (Fig. 6D), which are shown to be directly implicated in the interaction of both compounds.

AGR1.135 binds to CXCR4 through three hydrogen bonds, two on the apical side of the compound that interact with residues TMV-G207 and TMVI-Y256 and one on the basal side that interacts with TMVI-R235 (Fig. 5A). This results in a more extended and rigid conformation when sharing hydrogen bonds, with both TMs occupying a surface area of 400 Å2 and a length of 20 Å in the cleft between TMV and TMVI (Supplementary Fig. 8A). AGR1.137 exhibits a distinct binding profile, interacting with a more internal region of the receptor. This interaction involves the formation of a hydrogen bond with TMIIIV124, which induces a conformational shift in the TMVI helix towards an active conformation (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. 13). Moreover, AGR1.137 may utilize the carboxyl group of V124 in TMIII and overlap with AGR1.135 binding in the cavity, interacting with the other 19 residues dispersed between TMV and VI to create an interaction surface of 370 Å2 along 20 Å (Supplementary Fig. 8B). This is illustrated in the new Fig. 5B.

We looked for a tumoral cell system that expresses CXCR4 and could be transplanted into zebrafish. HeLa cells are derived from a human cervical tumor, express a functional CXCR4, and have been previously used for tumorigenesis analyses in zebrafish (Brown H.K. et al. Expert Opin. Drug Discover. 2017; You Y. et al Front. Pharmacol. 2020). These cells grow in the fish and disseminate through the ventral area and can be used to determine primary tumor growth and metastasis. Nonetheless, we first analyzed in vitro the expression of a functional CXCR4 in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 10A), whether AGR1.137 treatment specifically abrogated CXCL12-mediated direct cell migration (Fig. 7A, B), as whether it affected cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 10B). As HeLa cells reproduce the in vitro effects detected for the compounds in Jurkat cells, we used this model in zebrafish.

Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; Astell K.R. and Sieger D. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2020; Chen X. et al. Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2021; Weiss JM. Et al. eLife 2022; Lindhal G. et al NPJ Precis. Oncol. 2024). Our previous experience using this model shows that tumors start having a more pronounced proliferation and lower degree of apoptosis from day 4 onwards, but we cannot keep the tumor-baring larvae for that long due to ethical reasons and also because we don’t see much scientific benefit of unnecessarily extending the experiments. Anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effects of drugs can still be observed within the three days, even if this is then commonly seen as larger reduction (instead of a smaller growth as it is commonly seen in for example mouse tumor models) compared to controls. Initially we characterized the evolution of implanted tumors in our system and how much they metastasize over time in the absence of treatment before to test the compounds (Author response image 5).</p><p>The in vivo experiments were planned to validate efficacious concentrations of the investigated drugs rather than to derive in vivo IC50 or other values, which require testing of multiple doses. We have, however, included an additional concentration to show concentration-dependence and therefore on-target specificity of the drugs in the revised version of the manuscript (data also being elaborated in ongoing experiments). At this stage, we believe that adding the LC50 does not provide interesting new knowledge, and it is standard to only show results from the experimental endpoint (in our case 3 days post implantation). We agree that showing these new data points strengthens the manuscript and facilitates independent evaluation and conclusions to be drawn from the presented data.

Changes in tumor size was evaluated as tumor area at day 1, 2 and 3 divided by tumor area at day 0, and metastasis was evaluated as the number of cells disseminated to the caudal hematopoietic plexus at day 1, 2 and 3 divided by the number of cells at day 3.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93968-sa2-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding the statement that AGR1.137 was not toxic, this was based on visual inspection of the zebrafish larvae at the end of the experiment, which also revealed a lack of drug-related mortality in these experiments. There are a number of differences in how our experiment was run compared with the standardized ZFET. ZFET evaluates toxicity from 0 hours post-fertilization to 1 or 2 days post-fertilization, whereas here we exposed zebrafish from 2 days post-fertilization to 5 days post-fertilization. The ZFET furthermore requires that the embryos are raised at 26ºC whereas kept the temperature as close as possible to a physiologically relevant temperature for the tumor cells (36ºC). In the ZFET, embryos are incubated in 96-well plates whereas for our studies we required larger wells to be able to manipulate the larvae and avoid well edge-related imaging artefacts, and we therefore used 24-well plates. As such, the ZFET was for various reasons not applicable to our experimental settings. As we were not interested in rigorously determining the LD50 or other toxicity-related measurements, as our focus was instead on efficacy and we found that the targeted dose was tolerated, we did not evaluate multiple doses, including lethal doses of the drug, and are therefore not able to determine an LD50/LC50. We also did not find drug-induced non-lethal toxic phenotypes in this study, and so we cannot elaborate further on such phenotypes other than to simply state that the drug is well tolerated at the given doses. Therefore, the reference to ZFET in the manuscript was eliminated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(37) If supplementary information is available, consider providing it for a comprehensive understanding of toxicity assessments.</p></disp-quote><p>The effective concentration used in the zebrafish study was derived from the in vitro experiments.

Optimization and Development of AGR1.137:</p><p>-Justify the need for further optimization and development of AGR1.137 if it has a comparable effect to AMD3100. Explain the specific advantages or improvements that AGR1.137 may offer over AMD3100.</p></disp-quote><p>AGR1.137 is highly hydrophobic and is very difficult to handle, particularly in in vivo assays; thus, for the negative allosteric modulators to be used clinically, it would be very important to increase their solubility in water. Contrastingly, AMD3100 is a water-soluble compound. Before using the zebrafish model, we performed several experiments in mice using AGR1.137, but the inhibitory results were highly variable, probably due to its hydrophobicity. We also believe that it would be important to increase the affinity of AGR1.137 for CXCR4, as the use of lower concentrations of the negative allosteric modulator would limit potential in vivo side effects of the drug. On the other hand, we are also evaluating distinct administration alternatives, including encapsulation of the compounds in different vehicles. These alternatives may also require modifications of the compounds.</p><p>AMD3100 is an orthosteric inhibitor and therefore blocks all the signaling cascades triggered by CXCL12. For instance, we observed that AMD3100 treatment blocked CXCL12 binding, cAMP inhibition, calcium flux, cell adhesion and cell migration (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), whereas the effects of AGR1.137 were restricted to CXCL12-mediated directed cell migration. Although AMD3100 was well tolerated by healthy volunteers in a singledose study, it also promoted some mild and reversible events, including white blood cells count elevations and variations of urine calcium just beyond the reported normal range (Hendrix C.W. et al. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000). To treat viral infections, continuous daily dosing requirements of AMD3100 were impractical due to severe side effects including cardiac arrhythmias (De Clercq E. Front Immunol. 2015). For AMD3100 to be used clinically, it would be critical to control the timing of administration. In addition, side effects after long-term administration have potential problems. Shorter-term usage and lower doses would be fundamental keys to its success in clinical use (Liu T.Y. et al. Exp. Hematol. Oncol. 2016). The use of a negative allosteric modulator that block cell migration but do not affect other signaling pathways triggered by CXCL12 would be, at least in theory, more specific and produce less side effects. These ideas have been incorporated into the revised discussion to reflect potential advantages or improvements that AGR1.137 may offer over AMD3100.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(39) 4.

Reduction of Side-Effects:</p><p>-Provide a more detailed explanation of how the identified compounds, specifically AGR1.135 and AGR1.137, contribute to the reduction of side effects. Consider discussing specific mechanisms or characteristics that differentiate these compounds from existing antagonists.</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence indicating that AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 contribute to reduce side effects is entirely speculative, as we have no experimental evidence to support it. We have therefore corrected this in the revised version. The origin of the sentence was that orthosteric antagonists typically bind to the same site as the endogenous ligand, thus blocking its interaction with the receptor. Therefore, orthosteric inhibitors (i.e. AMD3100) block all signaling cascades triggered by the ligand and therefore their functional consequences. However, the compounds described in this project are essentially negative allosteric modulators, that is, they bind to a site distinct from the orthosteric site, inducing a conformational change in the receptor that does not alter the binding of the endogenous ligand, and therefore block some specific receptor-associated functions without altering others. We observed that AGR1.137 blocked receptor oligomerization and directed cell migration whereas CXCL12 still bound CXCR4, triggered calcium mobilization, did not inhibit cAMP release or promoted receptor internalization. This is why we speculated on the limitation of side effects. The statements have been nonetheless revised in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(41) 2. Binding Site Clarification:</p><p>-Address the apparent discrepancy between docking the small compounds in a narrow cleft formed by TMV and TMVI helices and the statement that AGR1.131 binds elsewhere. Clarify the rationale behind this assertion</p></disp-quote><p>After the in silico screening, a total of 40 compounds were selected. These compounds showed distinct degrees of interaction with the cleft formed by TMV and TMVI and even with other potential interaction sites on CXCR4, with the exception of the ligand binding site according to the data described by Wescott et al. (PNAS 2016 113:9928-9933), as this possibility was discarded in the initial approach of the in silico screening. According to PELE analysis, AGR1.131 was one of the 40 selected compounds that showed a pose with low binding energy, -39.8 kcal/mol, between TMV and TMVI helices, that is, it might interact with CXCR4 through the selected area for the screening. It nonetheless also showed a best pose placed between helices TMI and TMVII, -43.7 kcal/mol. In any case, the compound was included in the biological screening, where it was unable to impact CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis (Fig. 1B). We then focused on AGR1.135 and AGR1.137, as showed a higher inhibitory effect on CXCL12-mediated migration, and on AGR1.131 as an internal negative control. AGR1.131 has a skeleton very similar to the other compounds (Fig. 1C) and can interact with the TM domains of CXCR4 without promoting effects. None of the three compounds affected CXCL12 binding, or CXCL12mediated inhibition of cAMP release, or receptor internalization. However, whereas AGR1.135 and AGR1.137, blocked CXCL12-mediated CXCR4 oligomerization and directed cell migration towards CXCL12 gradients, AGR1.131 had no effect in these experiments (Fig. 3, Fig. 4).</p><p>Next, we performed additional theoretical calculations (PELE, docking, MD) to inspect in detail the potential binding modes of active and inactive molecules. Based on these additional calculations, we identified that whereas AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 showed preferent binding on the molecular pocket between TMV and TMVI, the best pose for AGR1.131 was located between TMI and TMVII, as the initial experiments indicated. These observations and data have been clarified in the revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(42) 3. Impact of Chemical Modifications:</p><p>-Discuss the consequences of the distinct chemical groups in AGR1.135, AGR1.137, and AGR1.131, specifically addressing how variations in amine length and chemical nature may influence binding affinity and biological activity. Provide insights into the potential effects of these modifications on cellular responses and the observed outcomes in zebrafish.</p></disp-quote><p>The main difference between AGR1.131 and the other two compounds is the higher flexibility of AGR1.131 due to the additional CH2 linker, together with the lack of a piperazine ring. The additional CH2 linking the phenyl ring increases the flexibility of AGR1.131 when compared with AGR1.135 and AGR1.137, and the absence of the piperazine ring might be responsible for its lack of activity, as it makes this compound able to bind to CXCR4 (Fig. 1C).</p><p>AGR1.137 was chosen in a second round. The additional presence of the tertiary amine (in the piperazine ring) allows the formation of quaternary ammonium salts in the aqueous medium and its substituents to increase its solubility (Fig 1C). This characteristic might be related to the absence of toxic effects of the compound in the zebrafish model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(43) 4. Existence of Distinct CXCR4 Conformational States:</p><p>-Provide more detailed support for the statement suggesting the &quot;existence of distinct CXCR4 conformational states&quot; responsible for activating different signaling pathways. Consider referencing relevant studies or experiments that support this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Classical models of GPCR allostery and activation, which describe an equilibrium between a single inactive and a single signaling-competent active conformation, cannot account for the complex pharmacology of these receptors. The emerging view is that GPCRs are highly dynamic proteins, and ligands with varying pharmacological properties differentially modulate the balance between multiple conformations.</p><p>Just as a single photograph from one angle cannot capture all aspects of an object in movement, no one biophysical method can visualize all aspects of GPCR activation. In general, there is a tradeoff between high-resolution information on the entire protein versus dynamic information on limited regions. In the former category, crystal and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures have provided comprehensive, atomic-resolution snapshots of scores of GPCRs both in inactive and active conformations, revealing conserved conformational changes associated with activation. However, different GPCRs vary considerably in the magnitude and nature of the conformational changes in the orthosteric ligand-binding site following agonist binding (Venkatakrishnan A.J.V. et al. Nature 2016). Spectroscopic and computational approaches provide complementary information, highlighting the role of conformational dynamics in GPCR activation (Latorraca N.R.V. et al. Chem. Rev 2017). In the absence of agonists, the receptor population is typically dominated by conformations closely related to those observed in inactive-state crystal structures (Manglik A. et al. Cell 2015). While agonist binding drives the receptor population towards conformations similar to those in activestate structures, a mixture of inactive and active conformations remains, reflecting “loose” or incomplete allosteric coupling between the orthosteric and transducer pockets (Dror R.O. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2011). Surprisingly, for some GPCRs, and under some experimental conditions, a substantial fraction of unliganded receptors already reside in an active-like conformation, which may be related to their level of basal or constitutive signaling (Staus D.P. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2019; Ye L. et al. Nature 2016). In our case, the negative allosteric modulators, (Staus DP, et al. J. Biol. Chem 2019; Ye L. et al. Nature 2016) did not alter ligand binding and had only minor effects on specific CXCL12-mediated functions such as inhibition of cAMP release or receptor internalization, among others, but failed to regulate CXCL12-mediated actin dynamics and receptor oligomerization. Collectively, these data suggest that the described compounds alter the active conformation of CXCR4 and therefore support the presence of distinct receptor conformations that explain a partial activation of the signaling cascade.</p><p>All these observations are now included in the revised discussion of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(44) 5. Equilibrium Shift and Allosteric Ligands:</p><p>-Clarify the statement about &quot;allosteric ligands shifting the equilibrium to favor a particular receptor conformation&quot;. Support this suggestion with references or experimental evidence</p></disp-quote><p>In a previous answer (see our response to point 2), we explain why we define the compounds as negative allosteric modulators. These compounds do not bind the orthosteric binding site or a site distinct from the orthosteric site that alters the ligand-binding site. Their effect should be due to changes in the active conformation of CXCR4, which allow some signaling events whereas others are blocked. Our functional data thus support that through the same receptor the compounds separate distinct receptor-mediated signaling cascades, that is, our data suggest that CXCR4 has a conformational heterogeneity. It is known that GPCRs exhibit more than one “inactive” and “active” conformation, and the endogenous agonists stabilize a mixture of multiple conformations. Biased ligands or allosteric modulators can achieve their distinctive signaling profiles by modulating this distribution of receptor conformations. (Wingler L.M. &amp; Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2020). For instance, some analogs of angiotensin II do not appreciably activate Gq signaling (e.g., increases in IP3 and Ca2+) but still induce receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (Wei H, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2003). Some of these ligands activate Gi and G12 in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments (Namkung Y. et al. Sci. Signal. 2018). A similar observation was described in the case of CCR5, where some chemokine analogs promoted G protein subtype-specific signaling bias (Lorenzen E. et al. Sci. Signal 2018). Structural analysis of distinct GPCRs in the presence of different ligands vary considerably in the magnitude and nature of the conformational changes in the orthosteric ligand-binding site following agonist binding (Venkatakrishnan A.J.V. et al. Nature 2016). Yet, these changes modify conserved motifs in the interior of the receptor core and induce common conformational changes in the intracellular site involved in signal transduction. That is, these modifications might be considered distinct receptor conformations.</p><p>The revised discussion contains some of these interpretations to support our statement about the stabilization of a particular receptor conformation triggered by the negative allosteric modulators.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(45) 6.

PELE was used in this sense, to study how the compounds could bind in the whole surface of the target (TMV-TMVI). By applying PELE, we avoided biasing the calculation, and we found that the trajectories with better interaction energies identified the cleft between TMV and TMVI as the binding site for AGR1.135 and AGR1.137, and not for AGR1.131. AGR1.131 showed a pose with low binding energy, -39.8 kcal/mol, between TMV and TMVI helices, that is, it might interact with CXCR4 in the selected area for the screening. But it also showed a better pose placed between helices TMI and TMVII, - 43.7 kcal/mol (see our response to point 41). These data have been now confirmed using Schrodinger’s MM-GBSA procedure (see our response to points 6 and 8). In any case, the compound was included in the biological screening, where it was unable to affect CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis (Fig. 1B). Docking and MD simulations were then performed to study and refine the specific binding mode in this cavity. These data were important to choose the mutations on CXCR4 required, to test whether the compounds reversed its behavior. In these experiments we also confirmed that AGR1.131 had a better pose on the TMI-TMVII region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(46) 7.

The main difference between AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 is how the triazole group interacts with F249 and L216 (Author response image 6). In AGR1.137, the three groups are aligned in a parallel organization, which appears to be more effective: This might be due to a better adaptation of this compound to the cleft since there is only one hydrogen bond with V124. In AGR1.135, the compound interacts with the phenyl ring of F249 and has a stronger interaction at the apical edge to stabilize its position in the cleft. However, there is still an additional interaction present.

As previously mentioned, it is likely that AGR1.135 can displace the mutant rotamer and bind into the cleft more easily due to its higher affinity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(47) In the &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; section, the computational approach for the &quot;discovery of CXCR4 modulators&quot; requires significant revision and clarification.

We then generated an Ab initio optimization of the ligand geometry, defining as basis sets B3LYP 6-311+g(d), using Gaussian 09, Revision A.02, and then a single point energy calculation of ESP charges, with HF 6311+g(d) on the optimized structure.

MD simulations were performed using AMBER14 (Case D.A. et al. AMBERT 14, Univ. of California, San Francisco, USA, 2014) with ff14SB (Maier J.A. et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015) and lipid14 (Dickson C. J. et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014) force fields in the NPT thermodynamic ensemble (constant pressure and temperature). Minimization was performed using 3500 Steepest Descent steps and 4500 Conjugate Gradient steps three times, firstly considering only hydrogens, next considering only water molecules and ions, and finally minimizing all atoms. Equilibration raises system temperature from 0 to 300 K at a constant volume fixing everything but ions and water molecules. After thermalization, several density equilibration phases were performed. In the production phase, 50 ns MD simulations without position restraints were calculated using a time step of 2 fs. Trajectories of the most interesting poses were extended to 150 ns. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm (Lippert R.A. et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2007). A cutoff of 8 Å was used for the Lennard-Jones interaction and the short-range electrostatic interactions. Berendsen barostat (Berendsen H.J. et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1984) and Langevin thermostat were used to regulate the system pression and temperature, respectively. All trajectories were processed using CPPTRAJ (Roe D.R. &amp; Cheatham III T.E. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013) and visualized with VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) (Humphrey W. et al. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996).

We choose 50 µM for further studies as it was the concentration that inhibits 50-75% of the ligand induced cell migration.</p><p>We have also included the effect of two doses of the compounds (10 and 50 µM) in the zebrafish model as well as AMD3100 (1 and 10 µM) as control (new Fig. 7D, E). Tumors were imaged within 2 hours of implantation and tumor-baring embryos were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) alone, AGR1.131 or AGR1.137 at 10 and 50 µM or AMD3100 at 1 and 10 µM for three days, followed by re-imaging.</p><p>Regarding the amount of CXCL12 used in these experiments, with the exception of cell migration assays in Transwells, where the optimal concentration was established at 12.5 nM, in all the other experiments the optimal concentration of CXCL12 employed was 50 nM. In the case of the directional cell migration assays, we use 100 nM to create the chemokine gradient in the device. These concentrations have been optimized in previous works of our laboratory using these types of experiments. It should also be noted that in the experiments using lipid bilayers or TIRF-M experiments, CXCL12 is used to coat the plates and therefore it is difficult to determine the real concentration that is retained in the surface after the washing steps performed prior adding the cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors state that they could not detect direct binding of the compounds and the CXCR14. It should be reported what approaches were tried and discussed why this was not possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted a fluorescence spectroscopy strategy to formally prove the ability of AGR1.135 to bind CXCR4, but this strategy failed because the compound has a yellow color that interfered with the determinations. We also tried a FRET strategy (see supplementary Fig. 7) and detected a significant increase in FRET efficiency of CXCR4 homodimers in cells treated with AGR1.135; this effect was due to the yellow color of this compound that interferes with FRET determinations. In the same assays, AGR1.137 did not modify FRET efficiency for CXCR4 homodimers and therefore we cannot assume that AGR1.137 binds on CXCR4. All these data have been considered in the revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The proliferation data in Supplementary Figure 1 lacks controls that affect proliferation and indication of different cell cycle stages. What is the conclusion of this data? More information on the effects of the drug to cell viability would be important.</p></disp-quote><p>Toxicity in Jurkat cells was first determined by propidium iodide incorporation. Some compounds (i.e., AGR1.103 and VSP3.1) were discarded from further analysis as they were toxic for cells. In a deeper analysis of cell toxicity, even if these compounds did not kill the cells, we checked whether they could alter the cell cycle of the cells. New Supplementary Fig. 2 includes a table (panel B) with the percentage of cells in each cell cycle phase, and no differences between any of the treatments tested were detected.</p><p>Nevertheless, to clarify this issue the revised version of the figure also includes H2O2 and staurosporine stimuli to induce cell death and cell cycle alterations as controls of these assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The flow data in Supplementary Figure 2 should be statistically analysed.</p></disp-quote><p>Bar graphs corresponding to the old Supplementary Fig. 2 (new Supplementary Fig. 3) are shown in Fig. 3B. We have also incorporated the corresponding statistical analysis to this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) In general, the authors should revise the figure legends to ensure that critical details are added.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully revised all the figure legends in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Bar plots are very poor in showing the heterogeneity of the data.
