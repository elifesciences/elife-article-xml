However, the hypothesis that LTD is indispensable for motor learning was challenged by demonstration of normal motor learning in rats in which LTD was suppressed pharmacologically or in the LTD-deficient transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Welsh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schonewille et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, LTD induction by different conditioning stimulation in the above transgenic mice was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>), and the ideas that multiple types of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum contribute to motor learning, and that some types of plasticity might compensate defects of the other have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dean et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirano, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Most of previous studies have addressed roles of LTD in motor learning by examining effects of LTD-suppression or LTD-facilitation on the motor learning ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aiba et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Zeeuw et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hansel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Takeuchi et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we took a different approach, and asked whether LTD occurs during a motor learning process or not in wild-type animals, which has been rarely examined. An exception was the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schreurs et al.

OKR is a reflexive eye movement following motion of the large visual field to suppress blur of visual image during animal movement. The efficacy of OKR can be increased by applying continuous movement of the large visual field, which is called OKR adaptation. Previous studies reported that the horizontal (H) zone of flocculus, a small region of cerebellum, is necessary for adaptation of horizontal OKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Robinson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagao, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">du Lac et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyden et al., 2004</xref>).

Thus, the amplitude of unitary postsynaptic response in a PC might be decreased by the OKR training. Previous studies showed that unitary synaptic response caused by a single synaptic vesicle can be recorded as an asynchronous quantal excitatory postsynaptic current (qEPSC) in the Sr<sup>2+</sup> containing extracellular solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Ghani et al., 1996</xref>). We recorded PF-specific qEPSCs induced by stimulation of PFs in the molecular layer of cerebellar slices prepared from trained or untrained mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The amplitude of qEPSCs recorded in the lateral half of H zone in the flocculus was significantly smaller in the trained mice (9.73 ± 0.12 pA, n = 16) than in the untrained mice (10.58 ± 0.24 pA, n = 14, p=0.003, Student’s t-test). These results include the data obtained in blind experiments (trained, 9.81 ± 0.15 pA, n = 5; untrained 10.50 ± 0.23 pA, n = 5, p=0.04, Student’s t-test). We note that only qEPSCs &gt; 6 pA were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Thus, the mean amplitudes should have been overestimated, and the overestimation should have been larger when there were more small events. Therefore, the real difference of qEPSC amplitudes between with and without OKR training might have been larger. We also recorded qEPSCs in the dorsal part of paraflocculus, which was a cerebellar region located next to the flocculus and had little involvement in OKR adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nagao, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).

The series and input resistances were not different between with and without OKR training in both the flocculus and paraflocculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>).

Application of depolarization of a PC (0 mV, 50 ms, 1 Hz, 10 times) coupled with the presynaptic PF stimulation at 15 ms after the onset of PC depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref>), induced LTD at PF-PC synapses in the H zone of untrained mice (30 min, 69.5 ± 3.4%, n = 14, p&lt;0.001, paired t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), whereas the same conditioning stimulation induced weak LTD in the trained mice (97.0 ± 2.6%, n = 12, p=0.03, paired t-test).

Previous study reported that OKR training reduced the number of AMPA-type glutamate receptors at PF-PC synapses in the H zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). We think that the decrease in qEPSC amplitudes by the OKR training is functional confirmation of the above morphological results.</p><p>Clear suppression of LTD in the floccular PC after OKR training was more than we had expected, although we observed weak LTD in a few cases. It was somewhat unexpected because flocculus receives not only visual inputs, but also vestibular inputs and efference copy signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inagaki and Hirata, 2017</xref>), and during the OKR training there is no vestibular inputs. Thus, the PF-PC synapses transmitting vestibular signals were unlikely to undergo LTD depending on the PF activity. There might be some mechanisms which allow spreading of depression to the PF synapses transmitting vestibular signals, or the number of the PF inputs conveying vestibular signals is relatively small in the molecular layer region where we applied the PF stimulation. Spread of LTD to inactive PF-PC synapses has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reynolds and Hartell, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Near complete suppression of LTD (about 20% depression) and relatively small decrease (10%) in qEPSC amplitudes after OKR training may appear contradictory. We think that this apparent discrepancy was caused by larger overestimation of qEPSC amplitudes after LTD occurrence. Because of significant noise in the current traces only qEPSCs larger than 6 pA were analyzed. LTD should have increased the proportion of small qEPSCs, which were not reflected in calculation of mean amplitudes. Thus, qEPSC amplitudes should have been overestimated more after LTD occurrence than before, which must have resulted in underestimation of training effect on qEPSC amplitudes.</p><p>LTD is not an only plastic mechanism in the cerebellum, but other synaptic plasticity mechanisms could play roles in motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dean et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirano, 2013</xref>). For example, at PF-PC synapse long-term potentiation (LTP) also occurs, which contributes to motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grasselli and Hansel, 2014</xref>). Inhibitory synapses on a PC undergo plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kano et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawaguchi and Hirano, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2015</xref>). Rebound potentiation (RP), which is LTP of GABAergic synaptic transmission on a PC induced by postsynaptic depolarization, is involved in adaptation of vestibulo-ocular reflex, another type of reflex eye movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, multiple synaptic plasticity mechanisms seem to contribute to motor learning. In certain cases, synaptic plasticity mechanisms other than LTD might compensate LTD impairment, and some transgenic mice with specific-defects in LTD might have shown apparently normal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schonewille et al., 2011</xref>). The present study provides evidence suggesting that LTD does occur during a certain type of motor learning process. Whether other motor learning paradigms also cause LTD or not, and whether other cerebellar plasticity occurs during motor learning are important questions to be addressed in future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>8–10 weeks old male C57BL/6 mice were used for OKR and electrophysiological recordings.

Sinusoidal horizontal oscillation of the surrounding screen in the light at 1 Hz and 10°/sec peak velocity, was applied to induce OKR. To monitor eye movement, the right eye was illuminated by an infrared LED (TLN201, Toshiba), and the frontal image reflected by a hot mirror (DMR, Kenko) was recorded using an infrared-sensitive CCD camera (XC-HR50, Sony). Because the mirror reflects infrared light but transmits visible light, the eye position was monitored without disrupting the mouse’s view. The eye image was captured at 200 Hz, and the eye position was analyzed using a software (Geteye, Morita, Kyoto, Japan) that calculated the pupil centroid. OKR performance was evaluated by measuring the gain. Eye position traces without rapid eye movement or eye blinking during each 50 s recording period was used to estimate the OKR gain. At least 10 cycles of eye position curve were averaged and fitted with a sinusoidal curve by a least square method. The gain was defined as the amplitude of fitted sinusoidal eye position curve divided by that of the screen position. The OKR training was 60 cycles of 50 s optokinetic stimulation followed by 10 s resting period in the light.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>The 150 μm coronal slices of the flocculus and paraflocculus of cerebellum were prepared from 8 to 10 weeks old mice &lt; 30 min after the OKR training or without the training, and maintained in Krebs’ solution containing the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 1.8 KCl, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 glucose saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at room temperature (22–24°C). It was necessary to use thin slices to reliably identify H zone of the flocculus. We performed some blind experiments in which electrophysiological recordings and analyses were carried out without knowing whether the mouse was trained or not. The H zone of flocculus was morphologically identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). A PC was whole-cell voltage-clamped at −80 mV with a glass pipette filled with an internal solution containing the following (in mM): 150 CsCl, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.2 Na-GTP and 15 sucrose titrated to pH 7.3 with CsOH. Input resistance (&gt;100 MΩ) and series resistance (10–25 MΩ) were monitored throughout the experiment by applying a voltage pulse (100 ms, −10 mV) every 1 min, and the experiment was terminated when either input or series resistance changed by &gt;20%. EPSCs were recorded in the presence of 20 μM (+)-bicuculline (Merck, Darmstadt), a GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist. PF-PC EPSC was evoked by applying a 200 μs voltage pulse through a glass electrode containing Krebs’ solution which was placed in the molecular layer at 0.05 Hz. To induce LTD a 50 ms voltage pulse to 0 mV coupled with a PF stimulation at 15 ms after the onset of depolarization, was applied 10 times at 1 Hz. qEPSC was recorded in Krebs’ solution in which CaCl<sub>2</sub> was replaced with SrCl<sub>2,</sub> and voltage pulse to evoke PF-EPSC was applied 60 μm away from the soma of PC. Asynchronous EPSCs occurring 150–950 ms after the PF stimulation with appropriate time courses and amplitudes &gt; 6 pA were selected as qEPSCs, and analyzed with Mini Analysis software (Synaptosoft, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014441">SCR_014441</ext-link>). Noisy data in which detection of 6 pA qEPSC was difficult were excluded from analysis. The mean qEPSC amplitude was calculated from &gt;100 events in a PC. The mean of paired-pulse ratio of EPSC amplitudes was calculated from five trials in a PC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± SEM.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Occurrence of long-term depression in the cerebellar flocculus during adaptation of optokinetic response&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Jennifer L Raymond (Reviewer #3), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work was deemed too preliminary at this point for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the reviewers did find the research to have considerable potential impact, hence we would be willing to consider a revised version of the manuscript with a more thoroughly analyzed and convincing data set.</p><p>The experiments described represent a potentially important milestone for the cerebellar field, since this is the first study to use ex-vivo experiments (which deliver behavioral training then study the synaptic correlates in slice) to study the induction of LTD in the cerebellum during learning. The results have the potential to solidify the evidence for a role of cerebellar LTD in OKR adaptation, providing a key type of evidence that was previously lacking. Moreover, the establishment of this approach could set a new standard for studying the role of LTD in other forms of cerebellum-dependent learning, for which the role of LTD is more controversial. However, to accomplish these goals, the reviewers felt that the data must be more convincing than presented.</p><p>Most importantly, the reviewers found the qEPSC results to be not sufficiently convincing. Additional experiments should be conducted with the physiologist blind to the behavioral training condition experienced by the animal. Moreover, the data should be presented in a more informative manner, showing the distributions of the individual data sets, not just the average value.</p><p>Also, the discrepancy between the size of the effect of training on the qEPSC vs. the size of the LTD that is occluded merits additional discussion. The near-complete occlusion of LTD after behavioral training is very surprising, for the reasons indicated by the authors, and also because the normal LTD amplitude is ~20%, but the reduction in qEPSC amplitude in the trained animals was relatively small (&lt;10%). Potential reasons for this discrepancy should be discussed, and put into the context of previous work in the field.</p><p>A more minor issue is that the authors should justify their choice of LTD induction protocol. Since it is on the &quot;strong&quot; end of LTD induction protocols that are used, this may help to make the case that LTD is really occluded, even when they hit it with a strong induction protocol. But if that was the rationale for this choice, it is not stated in the manuscript.</p><p>The initial complete reviews are appended for your consideration, but the most essential issues are described above. <italic>eLife</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the present manuscript, Inoshita and Hirano present evidence that LTD occurs in the cerebellar flocculus after OKR training in mice. The authors show that amplitudes of quantal EPSCs (qEPSCs) in slices prepared after training are reduced and that LTD induction is occluded in slices from trained animals. While the findings are certainly of interest, the impact of the data is limited by small effect size (qEPSC measures). Neither the demonstration of LTD after cerebellar training (see work from Cheron and colleagues), nor the study of LTD in the flocculus (see work from Raymond and colleagues) is particularly novel. Furthermore, the study is entirely descriptive and does not address the question whether LTD contributes to OKR learning.</p><p>The difference in qEPSC amplitudes between recordings from trained and untrained mice is very small (less than 10 percent). This small effect size is a problem as it is not a trivial task to quantify qEPSC measures and the traces shown do not make a convincing case. The low effect amplitude is dramatically smaller than the LTD amplitude that is typically reported. There might be reasons for this (e.g. intact inhibition during the induction phase in the intact animal), but this is not discussed. An additional means to present the data in a more informative way would be to show the spread of individual data sets, not just the average value.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this short report, the authors studied the correlation between long term depression (LTD) at the granule cell to Purkinje cell synapses (GC-PC) and the adaptation of the optokinetic reflex (OKR), a well described model of motor learning. They showed that the gain of the OKR can be increased and correlate with a decrease in the amplitude of the quantal EPSCs recorded in brain slices at the GC-PC synapses in the H zone of the flocculus, suggesting that LTD occurred at these synapses. LTD induction was occluded by OKR training protocol without any change in paired pulse facilitation. They conclude that postsynaptic LTD occurs at the GC-PC synapses during motor learning.</p><p>My major concern is that the main result of this manuscript is not really new and more importantly does not bring new hypotheses about the link between LTD and motor learning. Several articles already correlated LTD and OKR adaptation in mice (not only VOR) in the past (Shutoh F et al. Neurosci Res. 2002 Feb;42(2):141-5 PMID: 11849733 and Eur J Neurosci 2003 18:134-42 PMID 12859346; Endo S et al. PNAS 2009 Mar 3;106(9):3525-30.PMID:19218432; Wang et al., 2014). Also, occlusion experiments by plasticity induction have been already recently demonstrated in the flocculus (Nguyen-Vu et al., <italic>eLife</italic>2017).</p><p>I agree with the author that the subject appears controversial: some studies demonstrated that LTD is important for VOR/OKR adaptation, mostly in the gain increase protocols, while others showed that LTD is not mandatory, specifically for gain decrease protocols. But it turns out that these discrepancies have different origins (for review, Ito et al. Prog Brain Res 2014; 210:1-30 PMID 24916287; Boyden et al., 2004; De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, CSH Perspect Biol 2015;7:a021683). For example, different types of plasticity may occur to compensate for the lack of LTD, masking the physiological role of LTD (Gao et al., 2012). Also, LTD protocols varied a lot and LTD induction is highly sensitive to different features (timing, number of pulses, internal solution, depolarization) suggesting that a lack of LTD for a given protocol does not necessary mean that LTD is abolished for another one (see Yamaguchi et al., 2016).</p><p>In this article, the authors used a non-physiological induction protocol (10 depolarizations of the Purkinje cell while PF are stimulated at 1 Hz and a highly permissive internal solution with Cesium ions) and without CF stimulation, which might lead to the activation of a specific transduction pathway. Finally, although it was the main issue, no causal or direct link between learning mechanisms and LTD can be inferred from this study. Therefore, I don't think that these findings can be considered of very high importance.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>- In the quantal analysis, the histogram of the distribution of individual events should be shown in order to demonstrate that the threshold (set at 6 pA) for detection is well set and that a Gaussian distribution is actually observed. Also, knowing the distribution of the mean qEPSC (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), sample size effects might have influenced the results.</p><p>- Paired Pulse frequency is not mentioned.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript provides evidence that LTD is induced at the cerebellar parallel fiber-Purkinje cell (pf-Pk LTD) synapses after adaptation of the optokinetic reflex (OKR). Although there was already considerable evidence for a role of pf-Pk LTD in this form of cerebellum-dependent learning, the evidence provided in this manuscript is some of the most direct-showing a decrease in unitary EPSC amplitude in slices from trained vs. untrained animals, plus occlusion of LTD in slices from the trained animals. The results solidify the evidence for a role of pf-Pk LTD in OKR adaptation, and establish a new approach that could be used to study the role of LTD in other forms of cerebellum-dependent learning, for which the role of LTD is more controversial.</p><p>The evidence here is consistent with and complementary to previous evidence for a role of LTD in OKR adaptation.</p><p>The near-complete occlusion of LTD after behavioral training is very surprising, for the reasons indicated by the authors, and also because the normal LTD amplitude is ~20%, but the reduction in qEPSC amplitude in the trained animals was only ~10%. This represents an interesting new insight, which may be related to other work in the field on the occlusion of plasticity (Nguyen-Vu et al., <italic>eLife</italic>2017) and the spread of LTD to nearby synapses (Wang et al. 2000; Reynolds and Hartell, 2001).</p><p>This type of ex-vivo experiment, which delivers behavioral training, then studies the cellular correlates in slice, has rarely been used in the cerebellum (the one study I can think of is Schreurs et al., 1997). Hence, one of the main merits of the current work is providing a new standard for establishing a contribution of pf-Pk LTD to learning, which can be used to assess the role of LTD in other forms of cerebellum-dependent learning. It was not necessarily the case that LTD could be detected in ex-vivo slices, since it might have been washed out in the slicing process.</p><p>For this type of experiment, it is optimal that the physiologist is blind to the behavioral condition of the animal, and that does not seem to be the case here.</p><p>The authors measured input resistance and series resistance, and used changes in these measures during the experiment as a criterion for exclusion. Were these measures similar in trained and untrained animals? These, and any other measures of the basic physiology that were made, should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36209.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Most importantly, the reviewers found the qEPSC results to be not sufficiently convincing.

Because of the significant noise in current traces only qEPSCs larger than 6 pA were measured. Thus, smaller qEPSCs were not considered. LTD should have increased the proportion of small qEPSCs, which could not be analyzed and were not reflected in calculation of mean amplitudes.

But if that was the rationale for this choice, it is not stated in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment again. It was exactly the case.

The authors show that amplitudes of quantal EPSCs (qEPSCs) in slices prepared after training are reduced and that LTD induction is occluded in slices from trained animals. While the findings are certainly of interest, the impact of the data is limited by small effect size (qEPSC measures). Neither the demonstration of LTD after cerebellar training (see work from Cheron and colleagues), nor the study of LTD in the flocculus (see work from Raymond and colleagues) is particularly novel. Furthermore, the study is entirely descriptive and does not address the question whether LTD contributes to OKR learning.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the interest in our study. We have rewritten the Introduction and added explanation to better clarify the limitation and significance of this study (Introduction, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The difference in qEPSC amplitudes between recordings from trained and untrained mice is very small (less than 10 percent). This small effect size is a problem as it is not a trivial task to quantify qEPSC measures and the traces shown do not make a convincing case. The low effect amplitude is dramatically smaller than the LTD amplitude that is typically reported. There might be reasons for this (e.g. intact inhibition during the induction phase in the intact animal), but this is not discussed. An additional means to present the data in a more informative way would be to show the spread of individual data sets, not just the average value.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. Admittedly, our presentation of data and explanation were insufficient. We have added histograms of qEPSC amplitudes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and added explanation (subsection “Smaller unitary excitatory postsynaptic response in the H zone of OKR trained mice” and Discussion, second paragraph). Because of the significant noise in current traces only qEPSCs larger than 6 pA were analyzed. Thus, smaller qEPSCs were not considered. Skewed distributions of qEPSC amplitudes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> suggest that there should have been smaller qEPSCs which were not analyzed, and LTD occurrence should have increased the proportion of small qEPSCs which were not reflected in calculation of mean amplitudes. Thus, qEPSC amplitudes should have been overestimated more after LTD occurrence than before, which must have resulted in underestimation of training effect on qEPSC amplitudes. We have also presented each mean of qEPSC amplitudes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] My major concern is that the main result of this manuscript is not really new and more importantly does not bring new hypotheses about the link between LTD and motor learning. Several articles already correlated LTD and OKR adaptation in mice (not only VOR) in the past (Shutoh F et al. Neurosci Res. 2002 Feb;42(2):141-5 PMID: 11849733 and Eur J Neurosci 2003 18:134-42 PMID 12859346; Endo S et al. PNAS 2009 Mar 3;106(9):3525-30.PMID:19218432; Wang et al., 2014). Also, occlusion experiments by plasticity induction have been already recently demonstrated in the flocculus (Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017).</p><p>I agree with the author that the subject appears controversial: some studies demonstrated that LTD is important for VOR/OKR adaptation, mostly in the gain increase protocols, while others showed that LTD is not mandatory, specifically for gain decrease protocols. But it turns out that these discrepancies have different origins (for review, Ito et al. Prog Brain Res 2014; 210:1-30 PMID 24916287; Boyden et al., 2004; De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, CSH Perspect Biol 2015;7:a021683). For example, different types of plasticity may occur to compensate for the lack of LTD, masking the physiological role of LTD (Gao et al., 2012).</p></disp-quote><p>Important new information we report here is the decrease in qEPSC amplitudes after OKR training, and the evidence whether LTD occurs or not during motor learning in wild-type animal has not been complete. We think we have provided an experimental support for the occurrence of LTD during OKR adaptation. We have added explanations about previous relevant papers and tried to better clarify the limitation and significance of this study in Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, LTD protocols varied a lot and LTD induction is highly sensitive to different features (timing, number of pulses, internal solution, depolarization) suggesting that a lack of LTD for a given protocol does not necessary mean that LTD is abolished for another one (see Yamaguchi et al., 2016).</p><p>In this article, the authors used a non-physiological induction protocol (10 depolarizations of the Purkinje cell while PF are stimulated at 1 Hz and a highly permissive internal solution with Cesium ions) and without CF stimulation, which might lead to the activation of a specific transduction pathway. Finally, although it was the main issue, no causal or direct link between learning mechanisms and LTD can be inferred from this study. Therefore, I don't think that these findings can be considered of very high importance.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we used strong LTD induction protocol to examine occlusion of LTD occurrence reliably.

Also, knowing the distribution of the mean qEPSC (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), sample size effects might have influenced the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.

This represents an interesting new insight, which may be related to other work in the field on the occlusion of plasticity (Nguyen-Vu et al., 2017) and the spread of LTD to nearby synapses (Wang et al. 2000; Reynolds and Hartell, 2001).</p><p>This type of ex-vivo experiment, which delivers behavioral training, then studies the cellular correlates in slice, has rarely been used in the cerebellum (the one study I can think of is Schreurs et al., 1997). Hence, one of the main merits of the current work is providing a new standard for establishing a contribution of pf-Pk LTD to learning, which can be used to assess the role of LTD in other forms of cerebellum-dependent learning. It was not necessarily the case that LTD could be detected in ex-vivo slices, since it might have been washed out in the slicing process.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.
