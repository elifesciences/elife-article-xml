Furthermore, p-eIF4E was highly elevated in CRC precursor lesions in mouse and human. p-eIF4E cooperated with mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> to promote Myc and ISR-dependent glutamine addiction in various CRC cell lines, characterized by increased cell death, transcriptomic heterogeneity and immune suppression upon deprivation.

The gatekeeper tumor suppressor <italic>APC</italic> is mutated in 85% of CRCs and leads to increased Wnt/Myc signaling which cooperates with mutational activation of RAS/RAF/ERK (50–80%) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways (10–15%) to promote CRC initiation and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vogelstein et al., 2013</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that oncogenic drivers such as Myc do not simply increase ‘physiologic’ proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dang, 2016</xref>), but engender ‘oncogenic’ growth and hallmarks such as altered metabolism, resistance to cell death, metastasis, and immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Since direct targeting Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang et al., 2017</xref>) or mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vogelstein et al., 2013</xref>) has not been successful in the clinic, intense interest remains to identify potential druggable targets in their regulatory circuitry.</p><p>mRNA translation is a highly energy-consuming and regulated process, and a converging target of oncogenic drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pelletier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Truitt and Ruggero, 2016</xref>). The assembly of cap-binding complex eIF4F, consisting of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), RNA helicase eIF4A and scaffold eIF4G, is the rate-limiting step in translation initiation, which entails the unwinding of the secondary structure in the mRNA 5’UTR to facilitate recruitment of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) containing the 40S ribosome and the eIF2α-GTP-Met-tRNA ternary complex for AUG codon recognition. Phosphorylation of eIF4E (S209) (p-4E, thereafter) and its inhibitor 4E-BP1 (i.e. T37/T46, S65/T70) is elevated in a variety of cancers due to activated RAS/RAF/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martineau et al., 2013</xref>). Map kinase-interacting kinase 1 and 2 (Mnk1 and Mnk2) are activated by ERK or p38 MAPKs in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli to phosphorylate eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). Constitutive or inducible p-4E is mediated by Mnk1/2 that are dispensable for normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ueda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ueda et al., 2010</xref>). p-4E is required for cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Topisirovic et al., 2004</xref>) but dispensable for normal development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furic et al., 2010</xref>). 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 in their un- or hypo-phosphorylated forms are believed to inhibit eIF4E-eIF4G binding and even p-4E levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martineau et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic ablation of either or both <italic>Eif4ebp1</italic> and <italic>Eif4ebp2</italic> in mice leads to metabolic defects not spontaneous tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le Bacquer et al., 2007</xref>). Genetic alterations in <italic>EIF4E</italic> or <italic>EIF4E4EBP1</italic> and 2 are extremely rare or absent in human cancer. The oncogenic function of p-4E and its regulation remain to be better defined and likely go far beyond increased cap binding or global mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martineau et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation of eIF2α (S51, p-eIF2α, thereafter) is the core of evolutionally conserved ‘integrated stress response’ (ISR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tameire et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cubillos-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>) and elevated in many cancers including CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt et al., 2020</xref>). In mammals, four eIF2α kinases are activated by distinct stresses such as nutrient deficiency, misfolded proteins, viral infection, or oxidative stress, and GCN2 is activated by amino acid starvation and conserved from yeast to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castilho et al., 2014</xref>). Elevated p-eIF2α inhibits global cap-dependent translation, while facilitates translation of stress-related proteins such as ATF4 and CHOP to regulate adaptation and recovery through widespread changes in transcription, translation, and metabolism. Failure to adapt leads to unresolved ISR, persistent CHOP elevation, and apoptosis via the induction of DR5 and BH3-only proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harding et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we sought to better understand the oncogenic role of p-4E. Using <italic>EIF4E <sup>S209A/+</sup></italic> knockin (4EKI) human colon cancer cells and mice, human CRC organoids and adenoma samples, we uncovered a key role of p-4E in Myc and ATF4 translation, which promotes ISR-dependent glutamine metabolism, AKT signaling and oncogenic proliferation. Mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> cooperated with Myc to promote p-4E and ISR-dependent glutamine addiction and transcriptomic heterogeneity upon deprivation.

The authors generated eIF4E<sup>S209A</sup> knock-in (4EKI) in HCT116 (heterozygous knock-in) and mice (heterozygous knock-in, and 4EKI/KI). They report with 4EKI (S209A/+) in HCT116 reduced Myc and ATF4 translation, inhibition of ISR-dependent glutamine signature, Akt activation and tumor growth. In the min mouse background, 4EKI/KI inhibited polyposis, Myc and Akt activation. They further uncover an interaction between p-eIF4E, Myc and KRAS leading to glutamine addiction that may be a therapeutic vulnerability upon deprivation. The paper unravels important signaling mechanisms involving protein translation reprogramming that are relevant to cellular transformation and which may be exploited therapeutically in cancer.</p><p>Overall the paper is well-written and adds important information for a poorly understood cancer progression mechanism involving Myc, Ras, ATF4, p-4E, glutamine, and regulation of protein translation.

Using non-phosphorylatable mutant (eIF4E S209A) knockin CRC cells and mouse models, they uncover a mechanism of p-eIF4E inducing ISR-dependent MYC and ATF4 translation leading to changes in glutamine metabolism and oncogenic proliferation. They suggest an oncogenic function of p-eIF4E S209 in CRC initiation and progression. Although the manuscript provides new data and insight on the importance of eIF4E phosphorylation for CRC tumorigenesis, which is of relevance as potential therapeutic target, there are substantial discrepancies between the data and the proposed links to stress signaling, cell death and immune evasion. Furthermore, parts of the data linking metabolic stress by glutamine deprivation to p-4E and cell death are opposing to already published mechanisms, and this is not discussed.</p><p>1) Subsection “eIF4E S209 regulates colon cancer cell growth and Myc translation”, Figure 1A. Only later it is shown that AKT activity is reduced, so signaling proteins upstream of 4EBP1 should be analysed also here in both clones for their phosphorylation status. Furthermore, 4EBP T37/46 phosphorylation is known as priming event for S65/70 phosphorylation meaning it would be counterintuitive that the latter is not affected.</p><p>2) Although introducing 4E S209 mutation is an elegant system to explore its role in tumorigenesis, neither homozygous 4EKI HCT116 clones could be obtained nor heterozygous RKO or HT29 4EKI clones, as explained by the authors. Expansion of data to more cell lines would have been important, of course, especially as RKO and HT29 are also used in later experiments. Likewise, as 4E is only heterozygously mutated, observed affects are hard to control. The authors could use a more physiological system as intestinal organoids to extend and support their findings. Furthermore, the kinases MNK1 and MNK2 are the only characterized kinases that phosphorylate 4E S209. As there are efficient MNK1/2 inhibitors available, which can also be used in vivo, the authors could use those to validate their most important findings.</p><p>3) To analyse changes in global translation efficiency in 4EKI cells the authors used polysome profiling (Figure 2A) and luciferase reporter assays (Figure 2B,C, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). It looks like that the whole polysome profile of 4EKI cells is shifted down in comparison to the profile of wt cells making interpretation difficult. In addition, using exogenously expressed luciferase reporters is a very artificial system to study endogenous protein synthesis. It is recommended to analyse global protein synthesis via S35-Methionine incorporation or Puromycin labelling, especially as observed translation changes are very subtle. Furthermore, if bicistronic reporter vectors are used to distinguish between cap- and IRES-dependent translation, a hairpin structure should be introduced in front of the IRES sequence. This can inhibit potential read-through of ribosomes, which can affect interpretation of results.</p><p>4) Figure 2E-H. The authors show reduced translation of MYC/MMP7 in 4EKI cells. Although polysomal mRNA is indeed more reduced than total RNA (at least shown for clone 1), also transcription is affected. Ribosomal profiling experiments would help to clearly distinguish between transcriptional and translational effects and to analyse whether a global oncogenic translational program is regulated by 4E S209 phosphorylation.</p><p>5) Subsection “eIF4E S209 promotes colon cancer growth in vivo through Myc and the ISR”, Figure 3D. The authors performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYC/ATF4/CHOP and show downregulation of Gln genes. It is not obvious, what is the claim behind that experiment. That knockdown of those proteins has similar effects as observed in 4EKI cells that show decreased expression of Gln genes and, therefore, these effects are MYC-/stress-dependent? This link is not directly shown by this experimental setting. Instead, the effects in 4EKI vs. wt cells should be analyzed upon MYC/ATF4 overexpression (as performed in Figure 5H and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) and whether downregulation of Gln genes can be rescued by this.</p><p>6) Figure 3G. The immunofluorescence staining is not convincing, especially p-GCN2/p-eIF2 stainings that only show some single spots rather than broad cytoplasmic staining. A positive control should be used to validate a specific signal (e.g. tunicamycin treatment for p-eIF2a). Also, stainings of total GCN2/eIF2a/AKT levels should be performed. Please provide H&amp;E stainings.</p><p>7) The authors state &quot;Cell death (TUNEL), p-S6, or expression in ATF4, CHOP, Myc, 4E or apoptotic targets was not significantly different between WT and 4EKI tumors (Figure 3K and Figure 3—figure supplement 1H-I). The expression of ISR Gln metabolic and apoptotic targets (ASCT2, SLC7A5, PUMA, TRIB, and NOXA) is also elevated in TCGA CRC cohorts&quot;.</p><p>This description is not correct, as transcript levels of ATF4/CHOP/MYC (Figure 3K) and also some apoptotic genes (DR5, NOXA Figure 3—figure supplement 1I) are obviously significantly downregulated in 4EKI vs. wt tumors. The description and relevance of apoptosis between wt and 4EKI samples is not clear/confusing, especially as highly significant downregulation of apoptotic genes in 4EKI vs. wt cells is not described at all (Figure3—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>Please adjust description and explain in more detail.</p><p>8) The authors conclude &quot;These data support that p-4E promotes Myc- and ATF4-driven CRC growth through chronic exploitation of the most ancient arm of ISR (GCN2) to maintain constitutive AKT/4E-BP1 signaling.&quot;</p><p>The conclusion that p-4E promotes the ISR and AKT/4EBP signaling via p-eIF2a/p-pGCN2 is mainly based on the not convincing tumor stainings (Figure 3G), see also comment 6. How do levels of p-eIF2a/pGCN2/pAKT levels react in 4EKI vs. wt HCT116 cells? Immunoblots should be shown. The authors could induce GCN2 activation (e.g. amino acid starvation, RNA Pol III inhibitor) to test whether active GCN2 rescues the phenotype in 4EKI cells/tumors. Furthermore, the authors argue that this MYC/ATF4/ISR-driven AKT/4EBP signaling fuels enhanced protein synthesis and, subsequently, tumor growth. Although enhanced protein synthesis is an essential factor for MYC-driven tumorigenesis, several recent publications have shown that this needs to be tightly balanced by several mechanisms. It would help for understanding, if the author's findings would be discussed more in the context of those publications.</p><p>9) Figure 4A/Figure 4—figure supplement 1A. The authors state “Uniform p-4E staining was detected in the bottom of proliferating (Ki-67+) crypts in normal mice&quot;. There is no overlay or co-staining (p-4E and Ki67) from the same section shown, making it impossible to interpret whether p-4E is found in Ki67+ crypts. Additionally, higher magnification of p-4E staining should be shown (as in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Please provide H&amp;E stainings.</p><p>10) Figure 4D/E. The authors state &quot;Compared to polyps formed in the control mice at similar sizes, ones formed in 4EKI mice showed strongly reduced levels of c-Myc, p-AKT, p-4E-BP1&quot;. This raises the question: If tumor formation is driven by elevated p-4E/MYC/pAKT/p-4EBP levels, why do those polyps form despite reduced levels of those proteins? Are those polyps smaller, although it does not look like in Figure 4B? How do p-4E levels in these APC<sup>min</sup> 4EKI/KI tumors behave, stainings should be shown. It is recommended to show all stainings for total proteins (4EBP/eIF2a/AKT).</p><p>11) The authors state “Both glucose and Gln were required for the growth of HCT116 cells in culture… (Figure 5A-C).&quot; This metabolic link has been published before, specifically in HCT116 wt cells, please cite properly (Dejure et al., 2017). In this previous publication, a mechanism has been well established that Gln starvation induces only moderate apoptosis but rather S phase arrest which is dependent on the MYC 3'UTR. Please comment on this. The authors should include BrdU π cell cycle FACS analysis to evaluate these contradictory results.</p><p>12) Please include p values for FACS analyses in complete Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>13) The authors state “Apoptotic targets (DR5, PUMA and NOXA) showed transient suppression of translation at 4 hours followed by strong increase by 24 hours (Figure 5D, middle).&quot; NOXA is clearly downregulated after 24h, please correct.</p><p>14) The authors state “In contrast, 4EKI cells showed reduced basal levels of Myc, ISR and p-AKT, and transient ISR induction… The kinetics or levels of p-4E-BP1 (T37/46), p-ERK, p-mTOR (S2448), p-S6, p-PERK, cyclin D1 were not significantly affected by 4EKI (Figure 5D)&quot;. Although I appreciate that p-eIF2a basal levels are lower in 4EKI cells, the other ISR markers (ATF4 and CHOP) seem to be not expressed at all in Figure 5D (middle panel) in both wt and 4EKI, so the claim that ISR basal levels are reduced in 4EKI cells is questionable. Also, it does not fit with Figure 3B where it is shown that ATF4 and CHOP total and polysomal mRNA levels are reduced in 4EKI vs. wt cells. Additionally, quantification of immunoblots, especially right panel, would make it easier to judge changes in kinetics of pmTOR/ERK/S6/AKT. Changes in p-PERK levels upon Gln deprivation are clearly not the same (more stable in wt than in 4EKI), in contrast to what is stated by the authors. Loading control is missing in Figure 5D, middle panel.</p><p>15) Subsection “eIF4E S209 promotes Myc- and ISR-dependent glutamine addiction”. Figure 5E-H are displayed in a confusing way and important controls are missing. Figure 5E needs to be shown for total RNA in the same way, otherwise described kinetics in changes of gene expression are not comprehensible (-GLN only shown for 24h for total RNA in F). MYC is not shown at all in total RNA, although it is stated that &quot;Myc loss and ATF4 induction was rapid and primarily in polysomal fractions&quot;. What is lane labelled with &quot;GLN+&quot; in Figure 5F, wt cells? If yes, 4EKI cells GLN+ also have to be shown as comparison as zero time points. This discrepancy would be avoided if same heatmap of total RNA is shown.</p><p>siRNA experiments and MYC/ATF4 overexpression experiments in Figure 5F/G/H and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A/B should be shown in both wt and 4EKI cells side-by-side. In Figure 5G, the authors claim that siCHOP/ASCT2/ASNS reduces apoptosis to a lesser extent upon GLN deprivation. Nevertheless, the fold induction of apoptosis (GLN+ vs. GLN-) seems to be similar to siCTR cells. Same is true for Figure 5H where fold induction of apoptosis looks similar between CTR and MYC overexpressing cells. ATF4 immunoblot is missing in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>16) Subsection “Mutant KRAS cooperates with p-4E/Myc to promote glutamine addiction and immune suppression”, Figure 6A. Total eIF4E levels are also elevated in Lim1215 cells with KRAS mutations, arguing against increased p-4E levels in this cell line. Quantification of immunoblot could help clarifying this.</p><p>17) Subsection “Mutant KRAS cooperates with p-4E/Myc to promote glutamine addiction and immune suppression”, Figure 6C,D. The apoptotic response in HCT116 wt cells is much lower than in previous assays in HCT116 (26% in Figure 6B vs. over 50% in Figure 5) and no apoptosis induction at all in Lim1215 wt cells upon GLN deprivation (also no or only weak induction of ISR, and no cl. Casp 3, Figure 6D). This raises the question to which extent this phenotype/mechanism can be generalized to CRC or whether the mutational landscape of different CRC cells affect the response. The number of analysed cell lines could be extended or a more physiological, genetically defined system with specific mutations such as intestinal organoids could be used.</p><p>18) The authors state “The sensitivity was associated with elevated apoptosis and p-GCN2/ISR response, and reduction in Myc but p-ERK (Figure 6C-E, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C).&quot; MYC levels are not shown in any of the given figures. Why should MYC levels be reduced in KRASmut cells upon GLN deprivation if they are more sensitive to deprivation and if this is mediated via MYC induction?</p><p>19) The authors state “These data establish that p-4E/Myc cooperates with mutant KRAS to promote glutamine addiction with elevated ISR and immune suppression&quot;. Are transcriptome analyses in Figure 6F-J performed in KRASwt cells? This is not completely obvious from the description. If yes, then the claim that cooperation with KRAS promotes immune suppression is not reflected by the data. Global gene expression changes are then only shown for KRASwt cells, same analyses need to be performed in KRASmut cells (-/+GLN, wt/4EKI).</p><p>20) Figure 7B. Total eIF4E and 4EBP levels are also elevated in RKO and HT29 cells, arguing against increased p-4E/p-4EBP levels. Quantification of immunoblot would help clarifying this.</p><p>21) The authors state “Together, our data support that p-4E controls cell death upon metabolic stress&quot;. This conclusion is only partially reflected by the data. I appreciate that HCT116 cells show reduced p-4E levels upon metabolic stress (GLN deprivation) associated with enhanced stress signaling (Figure 5). Instead, neither HT29 nor RKO cells that are sensitive to GLN deprivation with enhanced stress signaling, show changes in p-4E levels (Figure 7B). Therefore, it is questionable whether the proposed mechanism, p-4E regulating the response to metabolic stress, is a general feature of CRC. On the same line, a clear mechanism of the response to GLN deprivation in CRC cells has been described previously, that is associated with reduced nucleotide and MYC levels and, subsequently, slowed elongation of RNA Pol II and cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis. This is not at all discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>22) The depicted model in Figure 7F is not comprehensible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60151.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>eIF4E regulates translation initiation and S209 is often phosphorylated in cancers with deregulated RAS-MAPK or PI3k-mTOR signaling.

Furthermore, 4EBP T37/46 phosphorylation is known as priming event for S65/70 phosphorylation meaning it would be counterintuitive that the latter is not affected.</p></disp-quote><p>Added p-AKT, p-mTOR and p-ERK. See revised Figure 1A and Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although introducing 4E S209 mutation is an elegant system to explore its role in tumorigenesis, neither homozygous 4EKI HCT116 clones could be obtained nor heterozygous RKO or HT29 4EKI clones, as explained by the authors. Expansion of data to more cell lines would have been important, of course, especially as RKO and HT29 are also used in later experiments. Likewise, as 4E is only heterozygously mutated, observed affects are hard to control. The authors could use a more physiological system as intestinal organoids to extend and support their findings. Furthermore, the kinases MNK1 and MNK2 are the only characterized kinases that phosphorylate 4E S209. As there are efficient MNK1/2 inhibitors available, which can also be used in vivo, the authors could use those to validate their most important findings.</p></disp-quote><p>See reviewer 1 (point 2). We elaborated on mutant KRAS/BRAF, Mnk, and added new data on Mnki in CRC organoids. See new Figure 2I-J, revised Introduction and Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To analyse changes in global translation efficiency in 4EKI cells the authors used polysome profiling (Figure 2A) and luciferase reporter assays (Figure 2B,C, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). It looks like that the whole polysome profile of 4EKI cells is shifted down in comparison to the profile of wt cells making interpretation difficult. In addition, using exogenously expressed luciferase reporters is a very artificial system to study endogenous protein synthesis. It is recommended to analyse global protein synthesis via S35-Methionine incorporation or Puromycin labelling, especially as observed translation changes are very subtle. Furthermore, if bicistronic reporter vectors are used to distinguish between cap- and IRES-dependent translation, a hairpin structure should be introduced in front of the IRES sequence. This can inhibit potential read-through of ribosomes, which can affect interpretation of results.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point worth studying. However, we chose to focus on oncogenic targets such as Myc, MMP7, and ISR-dependent regulation of Gln metabolism, and validation in multiple CRC cell line and mouse models. See below 4 as well. See revised model Figure 7F and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2E-H. The authors show reduced translation of MYC/MMP7 in 4EKI cells. Although polysomal mRNA is indeed more reduced than total RNA (at least shown for clone 1), also transcription is affected. Ribosomal profiling experiments would help to clearly distinguish between transcriptional and translational effects and to analyse whether a global oncogenic translational program is regulated by 4E S209 phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on Myc and ISR targets in the context of Gln-dependent growth in CRC. The implication of heterogeneity, the use of systematic approach and appropriate models have been discussed. See revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “eIF4E S209 promotes colon cancer growth in vivo through Myc and the ISR”, Figure 3D. The authors performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYC/ATF4/CHOP and show downregulation of Gln genes. It is not obvious, what is the claim behind that experiment. That knockdown of those proteins has similar effects as observed in 4EKI cells that show decreased expression of Gln genes and, therefore, these effects are MYC-/stress-dependent? This link is not directly shown by this experimental setting. Instead, the effects in 4EKI vs. wt cells should be analyzed upon MYC/ATF4 overexpression (as performed in Figure 5H and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) and whether downregulation of Gln genes can be rescued by this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and clarified this point. p-4E/Myc/ISR(p-eIF2a/ATF4) are upstream events driving glutamine-biased metabolism and addiction. siRNA of downstream effectors (CHOP, ASNS or ASCT2) has more modest effects Gln addiction. This is consistent with prior studies on ISR level-dependent outcomes, including cell death in MEFs with uncontrolled translational load (<italic>1</italic>), or survival in HCT 116 cells with Myc recovery (<italic>2</italic>). See revised Figure 7F and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3G. The immunofluorescence staining is not convincing, especially p-GCN2/p-eIF2 stainings that only show some single spots rather than broad cytoplasmic staining. A positive control should be used to validate a specific signal (e.g. tunicamycin treatment for p-eIF2a). Also, stainings of total GCN2/eIF2a/AKT levels should be performed. Please provide H&amp;E stainings.</p></disp-quote><p>We included higher magnification images p-GCN2 and p-eIF2a while keeping the originals with other markers at the same magnification. The punctate p-GCN2 and/or p-eIF2a staining was observed in the polyps of APC<sup>Min</sup> mice (Figure 4A). These findings are consistent with moderate increase in ISR and transient and localized GCN2-eIF2a regulation during cell growth (<italic>3</italic>). In contrast, acute metabolic stress (i.e., mTORi) or ER stressors induce high levels of p-eIF2a (ISR) and cell death in HCT 116 xenografts as we have shown (<italic>4</italic>). Total GCN2/eIF2a/AKT levels were not affected by acute metabolic stress in various CRC lines examined. See revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1H, Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors state &quot;Cell death (TUNEL), p-S6, or expression in ATF4, CHOP, Myc, 4E or apoptotic targets was not significantly different between WT and 4EKI tumors (Figure 3K and Figure 3—figure supplement 1H-I). The expression of ISR Gln metabolic and apoptotic targets (ASCT2, SLC7A5, PUMA, TRIB, and NOXA) is also elevated in TCGA CRC cohorts&quot;.</p><p>This description is not correct, as transcript levels of ATF4/CHOP/MYC (Figure 3K) and also some apoptotic genes (DR5, NOXA Figure 3—figure supplement 1I) are obviously significantly downregulated in 4EKI vs. wt tumors. The description and relevance of apoptosis between wt and 4EKI samples is not clear/confusing, especially as highly significant downregulation of apoptotic genes in 4EKI vs. wt cells is not described at all (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>Please adjust description and explain in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the oversight. More details are added. The expression of metabolic and translational targets is reduced more significantly compared to apoptotic targets in 4EKI xenografts. The proliferation, p-GCN2/p-eIF2a, and p-AKT but not apoptosis, are reduced in 4EKI xenografts, supporting Gln-dependent metabolic adaptation and growth. See revised Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors conclude &quot;These data support that p-4E promotes Myc- and ATF4-driven CRC growth through chronic exploitation of the most ancient arm of ISR (GCN2) to maintain constitutive AKT/4E-BP1 signaling.&quot;</p><p>The conclusion that p-4E promotes the ISR and AKT/4EBP signaling via p-eIF2a/p-pGCN2 is mainly based on the not convincing tumor stainings (Figure 3G), see also comment 6. How do levels of p-eIF2a/pGCN2/pAKT levels react in 4EKI vs. wt HCT116 cells? Immunoblots should be shown. The authors could induce GCN2 activation (e.g. amino acid starvation, RNA Pol III inhibitor) to test whether active GCN2 rescues the phenotype in 4EKI cells/tumors. Furthermore, the authors argue that this MYC/ATF4/ISR-driven AKT/4EBP signaling fuels enhanced protein synthesis and, subsequently, tumor growth. Although enhanced protein synthesis is an essential factor for MYC-driven tumorigenesis, several recent publications have shown that this needs to be tightly balanced by several mechanisms. It would help for understanding, if the author's findings would be discussed more in the context of those publications.</p></disp-quote><p>See point 6 on punctate staining of p-eIF2a/p-GCN2, which is further supported by data from Apc<sup>min</sup> mice and human adenomas (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). p-4E-depedent increase in Myc/p-eIF2a/p-AKT is clearly not required for the rapid proliferation of “Normal” crypts but polyposis driven by oncogenic proliferation.</p><p>Gln-dependent adaptation in mutant <italic>KRAS</italic>, p-4E/Myc high tumors is the very cause of their Gln addiction and transcriptional heterogeneity (Figures 5-7). The findings are consistent with the degree and extent of ISR in relation to transcriptional heterogeneity and outcomes. See revised Figure 7F and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 4A/Figure 4—figure supplement 1A. The authors state “Uniform p-4E staining was detected in the bottom of proliferating (Ki-67+) crypts in normal mice&quot;. There is no overlay or co-staining (p-4E and Ki67) from the same section shown, making it impossible to interpret whether p-4E is found in Ki67+ crypts. Additionally, higher magnification of p-4E staining should be shown (as in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Please provide H&amp;E stainings.</p></disp-quote><p>It is well established (including by us) that intestinal proliferation is confined in the progenitors and the lower half of the (ALL/every) crypt. We added roomed in Ki-67 and p-4E IF in different crypts, and H&amp;E stained polyps from both WT and 4EKI APC<sup>Min</sup> mice. See revised Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D and Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 4D/E. The authors state &quot;Compared to polyps formed in the control mice at similar sizes, ones formed in 4EKI mice showed strongly reduced levels of c-Myc, p-AKT, p-4E-BP1&quot;. This raises the question: If tumor formation is driven by elevated p-4E/MYC/pAKT/p-4EBP levels, why do those polyps form despite reduced levels of those proteins? Are those polyps smaller, although it does not look like in Figure 4B? How do p-4E levels in these APC<sup>min</sup> 4EKI/KI tumors behave, stainings should be shown. It is recommended to show all stainings for total proteins (4EBP/eIF2a/AKT).</p></disp-quote><p>4EKI reduced the incidence of polyps by over 60%, and lost ones can be studied. We selected polyps at similar sizes (large) to control for growth or metabolic pressure. The residual 4EKI tumors are negative for p-4E with reduced Myc (still elevated compared to normal crypts). A potential role of p-4E in non-epithelial compartments or p-4E-independent mechanisms cannot be ruled out. See revised Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors state “Both glucose and Gln were required for the growth of HCT116 cells in culture… (Figure 5A-C).&quot; This metabolic link has been published before, specifically in HCT116 wt cells, please cite properly (Dejure et al., 2017). In this previous publication, a mechanism has been well established that Gln starvation induces only moderate apoptosis but rather S phase arrest which is dependent on the MYC 3'UTR. Please comment on this. The authors should include BrdU π cell cycle FACS analysis to evaluate these contradictory results.</p></disp-quote><p>See point 5. Our data showed dose-dependent induction of cell death with growth inhibition upon Gln starvation in HCT 116 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-D), supporting ISR-dependent outcomes. See revised Figure 7F and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Please include p values for FACS analyses in complete Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see reviewer #2 (point 7).

Corrected. See Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The authors state “In contrast, 4EKI cells showed reduced basal levels of Myc, ISR and p-AKT, and transient ISR induction… The kinetics or levels of p-4E-BP1 (T37/46), p-ERK, p-mTOR (S2448), p-S6, p-PERK, cyclin D1 were not significantly affected by 4EKI (Figure 5D)&quot;. Although I appreciate that p-eIF2a basal levels are lower in 4EKI cells, the other ISR markers (ATF4 and CHOP) seem to be not expressed at all in Figure 5D (middle panel) in both wt and 4EKI, so the claim that ISR basal levels are reduced in 4EKI cells is questionable. Also, it does not fit with Figure 3B where it is shown that ATF4 and CHOP total and polysomal mRNA levels are reduced in 4EKI vs. wt cells. Additionally, quantification of immunoblots, especially right panel, would make it easier to judge changes in kinetics of pmTOR/ERK/S6/AKT. Changes in p-PERK levels upon Gln deprivation are clearly not the same (more stable in wt than in 4EKI), in contrast to what is stated by the authors. Loading control is missing in Figure 5D, middle panel.</p></disp-quote><p>The same set of samples are used for the entire sets with action done on two separate blots (after stripping) for Figure 5D. Additional controls include total eIF2a, GCN2 and cyclin D, which did not change in response to Gln- in either WT or KI cells (or other CRCs).</p><p>p-eIF2a/ATF4/CHOP as well as ISR targets assessed by RT-PCR and/or micro array support that the basal ISR is lower in 4E KI HCT 116 cells and xenografts (with Gln) and some are punctate. Basal p-ERK, p-S6 and p-mTOR were similar in WT and 4EKI cells. See revised Figure 1A and Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Subsection “eIF4E S209 promotes Myc- and ISR-dependent glutamine addiction”. Figure 5E-H are displayed in a confusing way and important controls are missing. Figure 5E needs to be shown for total RNA in the same way, otherwise described kinetics in changes of gene expression are not comprehensible (-GLN only shown for 24h for total RNA in F). MYC is not shown at all in total RNA, although it is stated that &quot;Myc loss and ATF4 induction was rapid and primarily in polysomal fractions&quot;. What is lane labelled with &quot;GLN+&quot; in Figure 5F, wt cells? If yes, 4EKI cells GLN+ also have to be shown as comparison as zero time points. This discrepancy would be avoided if same heatmap of total RNA is shown.</p><p>siRNA experiments and MYC/ATF4 overexpression experiments in Figure 5F/G/H and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A/B should be shown in both wt and 4EKI cells side-by-side. In Figure 5G, the authors claim that siCHOP/ASCT2/ASNS reduces apoptosis to a lesser extent upon GLN deprivation. Nevertheless, the fold induction of apoptosis (GLN+ vs. GLN-) seems to be similar to siCTR cells. Same is true for Figure 5H where fold induction of apoptosis looks similar between CTR and MYC overexpressing cells. ATF4 immunoblot is missing in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 5E-I and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 examined the role of Myc/ATF4/CHOP in basal and induction of ISR upon Gln- using loss of function and gain of function in WT and 4E KI cells, respectively. These experiments support that the (inducible) expression of ISR targets and death upon persistent ISR, expression of apoptotic targets and failed recovery. Upstream regulators such as Myc (loss), ATF4 and CHOP are (more rapidly) controlled by translation (within 4 hours) (Figure 3A-D, Figure 5D).</p><p>5E-F,we clarified in legends on qRT-PCR normalization. Each marker is normalized to parental HCT 116 cells with Gln (1, black) in either sets (reviewer 2/point 8). Revised Figure 5F.</p><p>5H. Overexpression of Myc induces apoptosis in p53 WT cells (<italic>5</italic>), and caused a further increase with Gln- in 4EKI cells. Myc siRNA reduced cell death with Gln+ and Gln- in WT cells (Figure 5G). ATF4 overexpression did not increase cell death with Gln while strongly increased cell death upon Gln-. We’d like to argue that absolute levels of ISR effectors are important for cell fate. For example, expression from 0.2 to 1 vs 2-10 (same 5-fold) is likely to cause a different outcome. By analogy, cell death increased from 5-15% vs. 15-45% (3-fold) is not the same on tumor outcome or p-eIF2a levels. p-4E controls the ISR range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Subsection “Mutant KRAS cooperates with p-4E/Myc to promote glutamine addiction and immune suppression”, Figure 6A. Total eIF4E levels are also elevated in Lim1215 cells with KRAS mutations, arguing against increased p-4E levels in this cell line. Quantification of immunoblot could help clarifying this.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon Gln- (by 24 hours), total GCN2, eIF4E or eIF2a did not change in any cell line examined.

The apoptotic response in HCT116 wt cells is much lower than in previous assays in HCT116 (26% in Figure 6B vs. over 50% in Figure 5) and no apoptosis induction at all in Lim1215 wt cells upon GLN deprivation (also no or only weak induction of ISR, and no cl. Casp 3, Figure 6D). This raises the question to which extent this phenotype/mechanism can be generalized to CRC or whether the mutational landscape of different CRC cells affect the response. The number of analysed cell lines could be extended or a more physiological, genetically defined system with specific mutations such as intestinal organoids could be used.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5C. 4E WT <italic>vs.</italic> 4E KI HCT 116 cells (mutant <italic>KRAS</italic>).

Pharmacological Mnki reduced the growth of CRC organoids, p-4E and Myc levels. Gln is not used in organoid culture, and Myc-driven metabolic/Gln addiction can be compensated by alternative fuels. See new Figure 2I-J, revised Results and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) The authors state “The sensitivity was associated with elevated apoptosis and p-GCN2/ISR response, and reduction in Myc but p-ERK (Figure 6C-E, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C).&quot; MYC levels are not shown in any of the given figures. Why should MYC levels be reduced in KRASmut cells upon GLN deprivation if they are more sensitive to deprivation and if this is mediated via MYC induction?</p></disp-quote><p>Gln- induced more cell death and Myc reduction in HCT 116 cells (vs 4EKI or WT <italic>KRAS</italic>), Lim 1215 (mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> vs WT), and RKO, HT29 (vs. DLD1 and SW480). As depicted in revised model (Figure 7F), higher basal Myc and p-4E/p-4EBP1 leads to oncogenic addiction, i.e. the dependence on Myc and Gln for adaptation and growth. Their loss (acute) leads to increased stress (ISR) and cell death.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) The authors state “These data establish that p-4E/Myc cooperates with mutant KRAS to promote glutamine addiction with elevated ISR and immune suppression&quot;. Are transcriptome analyses in Figure 6F-J performed in KRASwt cells? This is not completely obvious from the description. If yes, then the claim that cooperation with KRAS promotes immune suppression is not reflected by the data. Global gene expression changes are then only shown for KRASwt cells, same analyses need to be performed in KRASmut cells (-/+GLN, wt/4EKI).</p></disp-quote><p>Our focus is to understand the role of p-4E in shapin<italic>g</italic> the response of mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> to metabolic stress.

Total eIF4E and 4EBP levels are also elevated in RKO and HT29 cells, arguing against increased p-4E/p-4EBP levels. Quantification of immunoblot would help clarifying this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. However, total eIF4E and 4E-BP1 (eIF2a or GCN2) in these cells were unaffected by Gln-. SW480 cells have eIF4E but no detectable 4EBP1, supporting the heterogeneity of CRC, compared to more uniform p-4E in mouse polyps or human adenomas. This is also the very reason for us to examine these markers, ISR levels, and transcriptional response in a panel of CRCs including isogenic pairs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) The authors state “Together, our data support that p-4E controls cell death upon metabolic stress&quot;. This conclusion is only partially reflected by the data. I appreciate that HCT116 cells show reduced p-4E levels upon metabolic stress (GLN deprivation) associated with enhanced stress signaling (Figure 5). Instead, neither HT29 nor RKO cells that are sensitive to GLN deprivation with enhanced stress signaling, show changes in p-4E levels (Figure 7B). Therefore, it is questionable whether the proposed mechanism, p-4E regulating the response to metabolic stress, is a general feature of CRC. On the same line, a clear mechanism of the response to GLN deprivation in CRC cells has been described previously, that is associated with reduced nucleotide and MYC levels and, subsequently, slowed elongation of RNA Pol II and cell cycle arrest instead of apoptosis. This is not at all discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>See above and 11) too. This model helps explain that Myc-driven metabolic addiction likely goes beyond Gln to support increased biosynthesis. Metabolic stress (Gln-) leads to Myc loss and hyperactivation of ISR, with increased cell death and other oncogenic features. Therefore, the levels and duration of ISR dictates transcriptional response, TME interaction (i.e., immune signals) and outcome.
