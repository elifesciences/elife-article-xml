channels widely used to optically activate or silence selected electrogenic cells, such as individual brain neurons. Here, we describe identifying and characterizing a set of anion-conducting ChRs (ACRs) from diverse taxa and representing various branches of the ChR phylogenetic tree. The <italic>Mantoniella squamata</italic> ACR (MsACR1) showed high sensitivity to yellow-green light (<italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> at 555 nm) and was further engineered for optogenetic applications. A single amino-acid substitution that mimicked red-light-sensitive rhodopsins like Chrimson shifted the photosensitivity 20 nm toward red light and accelerated photocurrent kinetics. Hence, it was named red and accelerated ACR, raACR. Both wild-type and mutant are capable optical silencers at low light intensities in mouse neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, while raACR offers a higher temporal resolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>channelrhodopsins</kwd><kwd>anion-conducting channelrhodopsins</kwd><kwd>red-light optogenetics</kwd><kwd>metagenomics</kwd><kwd>low light sensitivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1078 B2 221545957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hegemann</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3131/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Béjà</surname><given-names>Oded</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>99999.001756/2014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fabrin</surname><given-names>Thomaz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013278</institution-id><institution>EU Joint Programme – Neurodegenerative Disease Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPco-FuND - NiPARK</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>González-Cabrera</surname><given-names>Cristian</given-names></name><name><surname>Prigge</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001664</institution-id><institution>Leibniz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program 'BestMinds' MP J28/2017 SheLi</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prigge</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018231</institution-id><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ASAP-020505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prigge</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engineered anion-conducting channelrhodopsins with enhanced red-light sensitivity and accelerated kinetics enable precise, low-intensity optical silencing of neurons, advancing optogenetic control in neuroscience research.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-activated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagel et al., 2002</xref>). Many of them are found in algae with flagella and eyespot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>), where they are used for phototactic movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baidukova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Govorunova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sineshchekov et al., 2005</xref>). In optogenetics, cation-conducting ChRs (CCRs) are repurposed to trigger electrical activity in excitable tissue through optically evoked membrane depolarization. To shunt electrical activity in neurons, natural and engineered anion-conducting ChRs (ACRs) are predominantly used to hyperpolarize the membrane potential in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emiliani et al., 2022</xref>). Most recently, potassium-selective CCRs (KCRs) have been discovered in stramenopiles and other heterotrophic flagellates, offering additional potential to silence electrogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Govorunova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vierock et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>A limiting factor to efficiently control behavior in model organisms is the need for a large spread of light that sufficiently covers a fraction of behavior-promoting neuronal circuits. An activation wavelength (<italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub>) in the red spectral range allows penetration in deeper layers than blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ash et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, optogenetic tools that are sensitive to red light are desirable. Currently, RubyACRs from the Labyrinthulea are the most redshifted ACRs reported. However, they exhibit a substantial photocurrent inactivation and a slow photocurrent recovery at high light intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Govorunova et al., 2020</xref>) caused by the accumulation of long-lasting and non-conducting secondary photointermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sineshchekov et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, the operational light sensitivity that describes the ability of an optogenetic tool to exert an effect on the cell at a given photon density also defines the volume of activated neuronal tissue. Here, ACRs that combine high expression, high single-channel conductance, and moderate kinetics, resulting in a high operational light sensitivity, are ideal for efficiently silencing larger volumes.</p><p>We screened a panel of ChRs across the phylogenetic tree, including previously unexplored ChR clades. Among them, MsACR1, a member of the prasinophyte ACR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>), was the most activated with yellow-green light of 555 nm. Introducing substitutions into the wild-type MsACR1 protein revealed a single mutation that caused a further redshift of the action spectrum and accelerated the photocurrent kinetics. Furthermore, we evaluated the optogenetic usability of MsACR1 and its mutant raACR for ‘red and accelerated ACR’. As such, we recorded dissociated hippocampal neurons at various light stimulation paradigms and tested the possibility of disrupting neuronal network activity in the primary motor cortex that directly influences locomotion behavior. The ACRs are well expressed and reliably suppress activity with nano-watt light intensities. Additionally, raACR offers suppression of action potentials at a higher temporal resolution than MsACR1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of metagenomically identified ACRs</title><p>The expressed opsin candidates represent multiple ChR subfamilies, some coming from previously unexplored clades: MsACR1 from the mamiellophycean green alga <italic>Mantoniella squamata</italic>, a member of the prasinophyte ACR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>); GpACR1, a protein from the heterotrophic cryptomonad <italic>Goniomonas pacifica</italic> unrelated to cryptophyte ACRs and instead putatively related to labyrinthulean ACRs; S16-ACR1, which we discovered in the single-amplified genome (SAG) of the uncultured MAST3 stramenopile S16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wideman et al., 2020</xref>), representing its own deeply branching clade; TaraACR3, a haptophyte ACR of metagenomic origin; and TaraACR1 and TaraACR2, two related ChR sequences coming from giant viruses (see Supplementary Discussion) and forming a separate ChR subfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogeny and electrophysiological characterization of identified anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (ACRs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic relationships among known channelrhodopsins (ChRs) subfamilies with the described ChRs written in black and blue font.

We determined the wavelength sensitivity, photocurrent amplitudes, kinetics, and ion selectivity. All constructs showed bidirectional photocurrents upon illumination, typical for ChRs. However, while MsACR1, TaraACR1, and TaraACR2 showed no or only little photocurrent reduction under continuous illumination (photocurrent inactivation), TaraACR3, S16-ACR1, and GpACR1 showed considerable inactivation. In particular, S16-ACR1 photocurrents showed almost complete inactivation similar to the previously described MerMAIDs and some cryptophyte CCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oppermann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sineshchekov et al., 2020</xref>).

Therefore, we tested several point mutations to shift its sensitivity to the red. Generally, a redshift can be achieved by either increasing the polarity close to the β-ionone ring of the retinal chromophore or reducing the polarity in the proximity of the retinal Schiff base (RSB).</p><p>First, we tested mutations in the vicinity of the β-ionone ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The exchange of the conserved Proline in this region (HsBR-P186; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref> for an alignment) generally causes strong blue-shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2001</xref>). However, the converse G186P mutation in MsACR1 also blue-shifts the activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), as do all other tested replacements (G186C, G186H, and G186T), with a substantial amplitude reduction in the case of G186H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

To quantify the shunting efficiency at different illumination paradigms, we either applied 550 or 635 nm light continuously or pulsed at 10 Hz (2 ms pulse width) during a current-ramp injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsunoda et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, the pulsed illumination reduces the photon exposure for the neurons 50-fold compared to continuous illumination. MsACR1 and raACR both completely silenced current-evoked spiking during continuous illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, at the on-set of the light pulse, we observed a light-evoked on-set spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This has been similarly described for other ACRs and arises in axonal compartments with a higher intracellular chloride concentration compared to the soma, triggering initial chloride efflux upon ACR activation that leads to a short depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To avoid misinterpretations arising from an on-set spike during <italic>in vivo</italic> optogenetic experiments, we designed and tested soma-targeted (st) versions of MsACR1 and raACR. For this, we fused a short targeting sequence from the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv2.1 to the N-terminus of the ACRs. We determined the on-set spike probability for st-MsACR1 and st-raACR under continuous and pulsed illumination with 550 nm. The latter significantly reduced the on-set spike probability for both variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7C</xref>).

MsACR1 and st-MsACR1 also nearly completely shunt all spikes during pulsed illumination independent of the light color. Activation of raACR, or its soma-targeted version, significantly reduced the number of spikes under all conditions but with a lower potency compared to MsACR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7B</xref>), likely due to the reduced ion flux during a single photocycle.</p><p>We further assessed the minimum duration required to re-evoke a current-induced spike after optically suppressing a preceding action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). raACR allows spike triggering with a 50% spiking frequency already 50 ms after optical silencing, whereas upon activation of MsACR1, a 50% spiking frequency was reached only 180 ms post-shunting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>To assess the potential use of MsACR1 and raACR <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first modeled the brain tissue volume that could be effectively silenced.

To evaluate the efficiency of MsACR1 and raACR <italic>in vivo</italic>, we assessed how light-induced transient neuronal network perturbation in the primary motor cortex (M1) translates into locomotion impairments. As such, we injected high-titer viral particles of the ACRs into the M1 of wild-type C57BL/6 mice and implanted a 200-µm optical fiber above the injection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of locomotion in rodents <italic>in vivo</italic> using MsACR1 and raACR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of coronal brain slices confirm the expression of raACR in the primary motor cortex (M1) and the accurate placement of the optical cannula.

Two-second illumination bouts with 635 nm light pulsed at 20 Hz led to immediate locomotion arrest in all tested animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). We quantified these motor arrests by calculating the pixel movement of a body marker between two consecutive frames during periods without and with illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Activation of either ACR led to significantly reduced velocity. However, the effect was more substantial for MsACR1, likely due to its longer-lasting response compared to raACR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>As complete locomotion arrest upon light stimulation points to a complex disruption of M1 circuit function, we decided to dissect this complexity by targeting expression exclusively to parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons (PV-Cre) utilizing our soma-targeted versions. Additionally, we implanted a 32-channel single-wire optrode to measure neuronal network responses <italic>in vivo</italic> upon illumination directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anikeeva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Six weeks post-surgery, we measured neuronal responses in the M1 area during a 2-s light pulse while the animals were freely moving in an open field arena. As expected, we observed complex changes in neuronal firing, ranging from an immediate decrease or increase in neuronal spiking, delayed changes in firing rate during light stimulation, and resetting of the firing rate after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To capture the different response modes, we calculated the <italic>Z</italic>-score for 100 ms binned firing rates for all recorded units during the 2 s before, during, and after illumination with blue (473 nm) and red light (645 nm) at both 1 and 10 mW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). During the first 100 ms within a blue light stimulation at 1 mW, 9 out of 33 units for MsACR1 showed at least a twofold change in standard deviation (SD) compared to baseline (2 s before illumination), which increased to 16 units at 10 mW. For illumination with red light at either 1 or 10 mW, more than 75% of all units (51 units) responded with a change in firing rate. Interestingly, the fast-cycling raACR shows a superior inhibition at blue and red illumination regimes at 10 mW compared to MsACR1, exhibiting a modulation of neuronal spiking in more than 90% of units. At light intensities of 1 mW for both wavelengths, raACR showed moderate effects on the cortical activity of 35%. In both cases, for MsACR1 and raACR, red light illumination leads to a significant decrease in running speed at 10 mW light intensities.

We further demonstrated the applicability and potency of both wild-type and mutant in several optogenetic experiments.</p><p>Besides its availability as a useful optogenetic tool, the wild-type MsACR1 may also offer a venue for answering questions about algal phototaxis. Previously, we suggested that in motile prasinophytes, both ACRs and CCRs may cooperate to regulate photo-orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>).

Compared to some of the previously characterized viral rhodopsin channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zabelskii et al., 2020</xref>), the two described here were well expressed and showed large photocurrents. Also, TaraACR2 showed fast photocurrent off-kinetics comparable to ZipACR and RapACR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govorunova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Govorunova et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While GpACR1 and S16-ACR1 are unsuitable for optogenetic applications due to their photocurrent amplitudes and kinetics, their photocurrents unravel interesting molecular features. GpACR1 photocurrents elicit a second peak upon light shut-off, a behavior seen before for the slow-cycling CrChR2 variant C128S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berndt et al., 2009</xref>), ReaChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krause et al., 2017</xref>), or the viral rhodopsin VirChR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zabelskii et al., 2020</xref>). Its appearance is expected to be caused by the back photoisomerization of photocycle intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krause et al., 2017</xref>). S16-ACR1, on the other hand, shows a substantial voltage-dependent photocurrent inactivation and nearly complete inward rectification similar to MerMAIDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oppermann et al., 2019</xref>) and may offer further insight into these processes in general.</p><p>The action spectrum of MsACR1 shows its highest activity in yellow-green light and a distinct blue-light peak, probably resembling the β-band absorption of the retinal chromophore originating from two-photon absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stavenga et al., 1993</xref>). Surprisingly, most of the substitutions in MsACR1 close to the β-ionone ring resulted in a blue-shift. Only one mutation (F138N) caused a small redshift, suggesting that this region is already relatively polar. Alternatively, the β-ionone ring could be twisted, which decouples it from the rest of the polyene chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kato et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the active site around the RSB was more susceptible to modification, although the effect of MsACR1-T87A was less pronounced than for Chrimson (ChrimsonSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oda et al., 2018</xref>). However, upon replacing S218 with Alanine, the action spectrum was shifted by 20 nm toward longer wavelengths, mimicking several orange- or red-light-absorbing ChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oda et al., 2018</xref>). Similar shifts have been achieved naturally and artificially in animal rhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liénard et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Both MsACR1 and raACR reliably shunt spiking <italic>in vitro</italic> and induced motor arrest <italic>in vivo</italic> using 635 nm light. Shunting during continuous illumination was complete, though light-evoked on-set spikes observed for both ACRs were minimized with pulsed illumination and soma targeting of MsACR1 and raACR. Presumably, longer photon exposure is required to evoke this spike, as previously evident for GtACR1 using 10 ms light pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, shorter or ramped-on light pulses can reduce the probability of such events. Overall, pulsed illumination and soma targeting are recommended for artifact-free <italic>in vivo</italic> optogenetic experiments.</p><p>Pulsed illumination was more efficient for MsACR1. This was due to its slower kinetics, resulting in increased ion flux per photocycle. On the other hand, the accelerated kinetics of raACR allows for a higher temporal resolution, enabling current-evoked spiking already 50 ms post-illumination. Ideally, one would slow its kinetics to increase the efficiency of raACR under pulsed illumination. However, most mutations tested here that resulted in slowed kinetics also shifted <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> to the blue. Potential candidates for combining could be T87A or T87S, as they did not affect <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> but increased <italic>τ</italic><sub>off</sub> while the current amplitudes were only marginally reduced. On the other hand, screening mutations of the homologous residues to the DC pair of CrChR2 could be fruitful, as recently demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodriguez-Rozada et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Also, in contrast to other ACRs commonly used as optogenetic silencers, both MsACR1 and raACR do not show substantial photocurrent inactivation during continuous illumination and can be activated again virtually instantly without photocurrent decline. This recommends them as reliable optogenetic actuators. Furthermore, the redshifted raACR reduces potential cross-activation when used with blue-light-sensitive optogenetic actuators or reporter systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vierock et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, MsACR1 and raACR, due to their good expression and membrane targeting, high chloride conductance and slow off kinetics provide a high operational light sensitivity to neuronal cells which enables inhibition at light intensities as low as 20 nW/mm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, we believe both ACRs are a valuable addition to the optogenetic toolbox when long-lasting inhibition in larger brain volumes is required.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Identification and phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Two of the ChR sequences characterized here have been identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>: MsACR1 from <italic>M. squamata</italic> CCAP 1965/1 (1KP_QXSZ_2010086.p1, extracted from a 1KP transcriptome assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative, 2019</xref>) and GpACR1 from <italic>G. pacifica</italic> (the originally reported truncated sequence MMETSP0108_DN24423_c0_g1_i1.p1 was extended by transcriptome re-assembly of the raw data from MMETSP0108 and MMETSP0107 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keeling et al., 2014</xref>).

The whole-cell configuration was established at ≥1 GΩ membrane resistance, and cells were discarded at access resistance &gt;10 MΩ. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (G150F-8P, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) to resistances of 1.5–3 MΩ using a micropipette puller (P-1000, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and fire-polished. During measurements, a 140-mM NaCl agar bridge was used as the reference electrode. A 2-kHz Bessel filter was used for signal amplification (AxoPatch200B). Signals were digitized at 10 kHz (DigiData400) and acquired using Clampex 10.4 software (all Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). A Polychrom V (TILL Photonics, Planegg, Germany) with 7 nm bandwidth was used as the light source and coupled into an Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The light delivery was controlled by a VS25 and VCM-D1 shutter system (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). Light intensities were adjusted manually for light titration experiments using neutral density filters. In recordings of action spectra a motorized filter wheel (Newport, Irvine, CA) was used to ensure delivery of equal photon densities. Light intensities in light titration experiments were measured in the sample plane using a P9710 optometer (Gigahertz Optik, Türkenfeld, Germany) and calculated for the illuminated field (0.066 mm<sup>2</sup>) of the W Plan-Apochromat ×40/1.0 Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) objective (Carl Zeiss).</p><p>Measurements were always started in standard buffer (extracellular (in mM): 110 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1 CsCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES); intracellular (in mM): 110 NaCl, 1 KCl, 1 CsCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA)). The pH was adjusted to 7 using <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-glucamine (NMDG) or citric acid. The osmolarity was measured (Osmomat 3000basic, Gonotec, Berlin, Germany) and adjusted to 320 mOsm (extracellular) or 290 mOSM (intracellular) using glucose. For ion selectivity measurements, NaCl was replaced by 110 mM NaAsp or 110 mM NMDGCl extracellularly. The extracellular buffer was exchanged manually by adding at least 3 ml to the measuring chamber (volume ~0.5 ml). Excess buffer was removed using a Ringer Bath Handler MPCU (Lorenz Messgerätebau, Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany).</p><p>Action spectra were recorded in standard conditions at −60 mV using 10 ms light flashes of low intensity (typically in the low µW range at <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub>). <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> was determined by normalizing recorded action spectra to the respective maximum photocurrent and applying a Gauss function to the data trimmed between ±70 and ±90 nm from the maximum.

The liquid junction potential was calculated and corrected during measurements. Light titrations were recorded at −60 mV with light applied for 1 s. The activity of GtACR1, MsACR1, and raACR with green and red light was measured at −60 mV with optical filters (560 ± 10 nm with 82% transmittance and 692 ± 18 nm with 99% transmittance) inserted directly into the light path.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Hippocampal neurons cell culture and electrophysiology</title><p>Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karpova et al., 2013</xref>).

Current clamp recordings were performed using a MultiClamp700B amplifier, filtered at 8 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1550A digitizer (Molecular Devices). Neurons were held at −60 mV, and spiking was evoked with a ramp (600 pA injection; 500 ms) or rectangle protocol (pA injection considering the rheobase +50 pA; 700 ms). The inhibition was tested by activating the ACRs using continuous (700 ms) and pulsed (10 Hz, 2 ms) light and two different wavelengths (550 and 635 nm).

SAMEA2619952_516956 (1239 bp) encoding the channelrhodopsins (ChRs) TaraACR1 and TaraACR2, respectively, were initially suspected to be of viral origin due to lack of introns and short intergenic regions to the neighboring genes. The neighboring genes, a gene for a DUF285 protein (SAMEA2622336_1814029) and a short fragment of a gene for a Pif1 helicase (SAMEA2619952_516956), are from protein families widespread among, albeit not restricted to, giant viruses. More importantly, the promoter sequence of TaraACR1 contained the classical mimiviral early promoter motif AAAATTGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suhre et al., 2005</xref>) characteristic to <italic>Imitervirales</italic> and some other giant viruses, while that of TaraACR2 contained its minor variation AAAAATGA prevalent for example in the genome of Aureococcus anophagefferens virus (<italic>Imitervirales</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roitman et al., 2023</xref>). Finally, blastn searches against the GVMAGs database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schulz et al., 2020</xref>) yielded genomes belonging to the <italic>Imitervirales</italic> containing highly similar nucleotide stretches (best hits to GVMAG-M-3300001348-7<italic>, E</italic>-value 3.3 × 10<sup>−80</sup>, 72.5% nucleotide identity, and GVMAG-M-3300023184-101<italic>, E</italic>-value 8.7 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, 90.2% identity, respectively, both belonging to the <italic>Mesomimiviridae</italic>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aylward et al., 2021</xref>), although, none of them contained the ChR genes themselves. TaraACR1 and TaraACR2 represent a second example of ChR acquisition by giant viruses, alongside prasinophyte ACRs in genomes of viruses closely related to Pyramimonas orientalis virus 01b (<italic>Imitervirales</italic> family IM_12 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aylward et al., 2021</xref>) and a putative <italic>Algavirales</italic> virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>). The appearance of ion-conducting rhodopsins encoded in genomes of giant algal viruses is not restricted to ChRs, as two unrelated cases of functional rhodopsin cation channels/pumps are known from the <italic>Mesomimiviridae</italic> (viral rhodopsins, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bratanov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zabelskii et al., 2020</xref>) and the <italic>Coccolithoviridae</italic> (proton-conducting heliorhodopsins, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hososhima et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction of relationships among known channelrhodopsins.</title><p>The sequences chosen for the analysis were taken from the Catalog of Natural Channelrhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rozenberg, 2023</xref>).

This is inconsistent with the benefits and effects of red-shifting the spectrum in raACR. The authors claimed that this is due to the faster kinetics of raACR which is plausible from the data shown in Fig 3E but this could be experimentally shown if more examples of continuous illumination and pulsed illumination (such as the one shown in Fig 3D) can be shown in supplemental figures. If this is truly due to the off-kinetics, the spikes would appear after the termination of the pulses but there is little difference in the cases of continuous illumination or during illumination. The fact that 635nm is equally effective as raACR suggests that there is an overall stronger effect of MsACR1 that compensates for the red-shift of raACR.</p><p>(2) There are limited comparisons to existing variants of ACRs under the same conditions in the manuscript overall. There should be more parallel comparison with gtACR1, ZipACR and RubyACR in identical conditions in cultured cell line, cultured neurons and in vivo. In terms of overall performance, efficiency, expression in identical conditions. Without this information, it is unclear whether the effects at 635 nm is due to the expression level which can compensate for the spectral shift (which may be the case for MsACR1). The authors stated they are saving this data for another manuscript, this is important data for the current manuscript which should be presented in the existing manuscript.</p><p>(3) Despite being able to activate the channelrhodopsin with 635 nm light, the main utility of the variant would be transcranial stimulation which were not demonstrated here.</p><p>(4) For the in vivo characterization, there is no mention of animal number and results from Fig 4 and 5 appear to come from multiple samples from a single animal.

Additional engineering of MsACR1 yielded a variant (raACR1) with increased current amplitudes, accelerated kinetics, and a 20nm red-shifted peak excitation wavelength. Stimulation of MsACR1 and raACR1 expressing neurons with 635nm in mice's primary motor cortices inhibited the animals' locomotion.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The in vitro characterization of the newly identified ACRs is very detailed and confirms the biophysical properties as described by the authors. Notably, the ACRs are very light sensitive and allow for efficient in vitro inhibition of neurons in the nano Watt/mm^2 range. These new ACRs give neuroscientists and cell biologists a new tool to control chloride flux over biological membranes with high temporal and spatial precision. The red-shifted excitation peaks of these ACRs could allow for multiplexed application with blue-light excited optogenetic tools such as cation-conducting channelrhodopsins or green-fluorescent calcium indicators such as GCaMP.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The in-vivo characterization of MsACR1 and raACR1 lacks critical control experiments and is, therefore, too preliminary. The experimental conditions differ fundamentally between in vitro and in vivo characterizations. For example, chloride gradients differ within neurons which can weaken inhibition or even cause excitation at synapses, as pointed out by the authors. Notably, the patch pipettes for the in vitro characterization in neurons contained low chloride concentrations that might not reflect possible conditions found in vivo preparations, i.e., increasing chloride gradients from dendrites to synapses.</p><p>2nd review: The authors have addressed this comment in their rebuttal.</p><p>(2) Interestingly, the authors used soma-targeted (st) MsACR1 and raACR1 for some of their in vitro characterization yielding more efficient inhibition and reduction of co-incidental &quot;on-set&quot; spiking. Still, the authors do not seem to have utilized st-variants in vivo.</p><p>2nd review: The authors offered an explanation in their rebuttal and aim to add these experiments later.</p><p>(3) Most importantly, critical in vivo control experiments, such as negative controls like GFP or positive controls like NpHR, are missing. These controls would exclude potential behavioral effects due to experimental artifacts. Moreover, in vivo electrophysiology could have confirmed whether targeted neurons were inhibited under optogenetic stimulations.</p><p>Some of these concerns stem from the fact that the pulsed raACR stimulation at 635 nm at 10Hz (Fig. 3E) was far less efficient compared to MsACR1, yet the in vivo comparison yielded very similar results (Fig. 4D).</p><p>Also, the cortex is highly heterogeneous and comprises excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Using the synapsin promoter, the viral expression paradigm could target both types and cause differential effects, which has not been investigated further, for example, by immunohistochemistry. An alternative expression system, for example, under VGLUT1 control, could have mitigated some of these concerns.</p><p>2nd review: The authors have not added control experiments in Fig 4 yet but plan to conduct them later. They added a new set of experiments in Fig.5 in which PV neurons were exclusively targeted. However, the authors show in vivo electrophysiology demonstrating the expected inhibition of firing neurons (presumably PV neurons expressing raACR) under 635 nm light and disinhibition (presumably excitatory neurons).</p><p>(4) Furthermore, the authors applied different light intensities, wavelengths, and stimulation frequencies during the in vitro characterization, causing varying spike inhibition efficiencies. The in vivo characterization is notably lacking this type of control. Thus, it is unclear why the 635nm, 2s at 20Hz every 5s stimulation protocol, which has no equivalent in the in vitro characterization, was chosen.</p><p>2nd review: The authors offered a satisfactory explanation.</p><p>In summary, the in vivo experiments did not confirm whether the observed inhibition of mouse locomotion occurred due to the inhibition of neurons or experimental artifacts.</p><p>2nd review: New experiments were added which demonstrate the expected inhibition of raACR expressing PV neurons in vivo.</p><p>In addition, the author's main claim of more efficient neuronal inhibition would require to threshold MsACR1 and raACR1 against alternative methods such as the red-shifted NpHR variant Jaws or other ACRs to give readers meaningful guidance when choosing an inhibitory tool.</p><p>The light sensitivity of MsACR1 and raACR1 are impressive and well characterized in vitro. However, the authors only reported the overall light output at the fiber tip for the in vivo experiments: 0.5 mW. Without context, it is difficult to evaluate this value. Calculating the light power density at certain distances from the light fiber or thresholding against alternative tools such as NpHR, Jaws, or other ACRs would allow for a more meaningful evaluation.</p><p>2nd review: The authors added Supl Fig. 8 in which light power density and propagation of photons at 550 nm and 635nm through brain tissue was calculated when emitted from light fibers of varying diameter.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90100.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Oppermann</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01hcx6992</institution-id><institution>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berlin</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rozenberg</surname><given-names>Andrey</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qryx823</institution-id><institution>Technion-Israel Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fabrin</surname><given-names>Thomaz</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01zwmgk08</institution-id><institution>Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Magdeburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gonzalez-Cabrera</surname><given-names>Cristian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01zwmgk08</institution-id><institution>Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Magdeburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Rafael ES</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Humboldt University of Berlin</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berlin</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Beja</surname><given-names>Oded</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qryx823</institution-id><institution>Technion-Israel Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Prigge</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01zwmgk08</institution-id><institution>Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Magdeburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hegemann</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Humboldt University of Berlin</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Berlin</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors of this manuscript characterize new anion conducting that is more red-shifted in its spectrum than prior variants called MsACR1.

Neither of these is measured in the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for addressing this crucial issue. We posit that the diminished efficiency of raACR in comparison to MsACR1 WT can be attributed to the tenfold acceleration of its photocycle. As noted by Reviewer 1, the anticipated advantages associated with a red-shifted opsin, particularly in in vivo preparations, are offset by its accelerated off-kinetics. Consequently, the shorter dwell time of the open state leads to a reduced number of conducted ions per photon. Nevertheless, the operational light sensitivity is not drastically altered compared to MsACR WT (Fig. 3C). We believe that the rapid kinetics offer interesting applications, such as the precise inhibition of single action potentials through holography.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are limited comparisons to existing variants of ACRs under the same conditions in the manuscript overall.

In the context of in vitro stimulation, where single action potentials are recorded, this reduction in inhibition efficiency is resolved. However, in the realm of in vivo behavioural analysis, the observed effect is not contingent on single action potentials but rather stems from the disruption of the entire M1 motor network. In this context, despite the reduced efficiency of the fast-cycling raACR, it still manages to interrupt the M1 network, leading to similar behavioural outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the cortex is highly heterogeneous and comprises excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Using the synapsin promoter, the viral expression paradigm could target both types and cause differential effects, which has not been investigated further, for example, by immunohistochemistry. An alternative expression system, for example, under VGLUT1 control, could have mitigated some of these concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we acknowledge the limitations of our current experimental approach. We are in the process of planning and conducting additional experiments involving cre-dependent expression of st-MSACR and st-raACR in PV-Cre mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors applied different light intensities, wavelengths, and stimulation frequencies during the in vitro characterization, causing varying spike inhibition efficiencies. The in vivo characterization is notably lacking this type of control. Thus, it is unclear why the 635nm, 2s at 20Hz every 5s stimulation protocol, which has no equivalent in the in vitro characterization, was chosen.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the valuable comment from the reviewer. The objective of our in vitro characterization is to elucidate the general effects of specific stimulation parameters on the efficiency of neuronal inhibition. For instance, we aim to demonstrate that lower light intensities result in less efficient inhibition, or that pulse stimulation may lead to a less complete inhibition, albeit significantly reducing the energy input into the system.</p><p>In the in vivo characterization, we face constraints such as animal welfare considerations and limitations in available laser lines, which prevent us from exploring the entire parameter space as comprehensively as in the in vitro preparation. Additionally, it is important to note that membrane capacitance tends to be higher in vivo compared to dissociated hippocampal neurons. Consequently, we have opted for a doubled stimulation frequency from 10 Hz to 20 Hz and the stimulation pattern of 2 seconds ”on” and 5 seconds “off”. This approach allows the animals to spend less time in an arrested state while still demonstrating the effect of MsACR and variants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, the in vivo experiments did not confirm whether the observed inhibition of mouse locomotion occurred due to the inhibition of neurons or experimental artifacts.</p><p>In addition, the author's main claim of more efficient neuronal inhibition would require them to threshold MsACR1 and raACR1 against alternative methods such as the red-shifted NpHR variant Jaws or other ACRs to give readers meaningful guidance when choosing an inhibitory tool.</p><p>The light sensitivity of MsACR1 and raACR1 are impressive and well characterized in vitro. However, the authors only reported the overall light output at the fiber tip for the in vivo experiments: 0.5 mW. Without context, it is difficult to evaluate this value. Calculating the light power density at certain distances from the light fiber or thresholding against alternative tools such as NpHR, Jaws, or other ACRs would allow for a more meaningful evaluation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The study would be much strengthened if the authors can perform more experiments and characterization to support their claims, in addition to showing more raw electrophysiological traces/results and not just summary charts and graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, further experiments are planned. We appreciate the suggestion to include more raw electrophysiological traces.

Additionally, the light intensity is further reduced by using additional neutral density filters to ensure sufficiently low photocurrents to determine the spectral maximum. Therefore, the light intensity varied between constructs and sometimes measurements. We added the following line to the respective methods section to further clarify this: “(typically in the low µW-range at 𝜆max)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) MsACR1 is slower and probably more light-sensitive than raACR1, which is faster but has larger photocurrents. These are complementary tradeoffs, and the audience might wonder how MsACR1 and raACR1 photocurrents compare under similar conditions. Therefore, I suggest an alternative representation in Fig. 2C. That is, the presentation of the excitation spectra under similar light intensities and with absolute photocurrent values.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, due to the reasons stated above, MsACR1 and raACR action spectra were not recorded with the same light intensity. However, MsACR1 and raACR are compared under the same conditions for Fig. 2B, E, and F (560 nm light at ~3.2 mW/mm2) as well as in Supp. Fig. 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure legends for figures 3F and G are missing details for describing the stimulation paradigm.</p></disp-quote><p>We added more details about the stimulation paradigm.</p></body></sub-article></article>
