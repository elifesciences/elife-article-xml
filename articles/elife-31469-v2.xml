Here, we addressed the mechanism driving contraction of this 3D disordered F-actin network by comparing quantitative observations to computational models. We analyzed 3D chromosome trajectories and imaged filament dynamics to monitor network behavior under various physical and chemical perturbations. We found no evidence of myosin activity driving network contractility. Instead, our observations are well explained by models based on a disassembly-driven contractile mechanism.

Most prominently, the cortex, a thin and entangled network of F-actin underlying the plasma membrane determines the shape of animal cells, and changes in cell shape underlie cell migration, cell division and tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Munjal and Lecuit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pollard and Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>). While myosin motor activity, non-muscle myosin II in particular, is the main driver of these processes, filament dynamics has been shown to play a critical role as well. For example, cell migration is to a large part driven by polymerization of actin filaments at the cell front and depolymerization at the rear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cramer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mseka and Cramer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ridley, 2011</xref>). Cytokinetic ring closure has been shown to be driven by depolymerization of filaments in some species, although myosin activity certainly is the main driver in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mendes Pinto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neujahr et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its cortical functions, recent studies revealed extensive 3D F-actin networks in the bulk cytoplasm of large oocytes and embryos with essential functions in intracellular transport processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Field and Lénárt, 2011</xref>). For example, mouse oocytes feature a dynamic cytoplasmic F-actin network required to position the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almonacid et al., 2015</xref>), the meiotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almonacid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azoury et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schuh and Ellenberg, 2008</xref>), and to transport vesicles from the cell center to the cortex, including cortical granules to prevent polyspermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheeseman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuh, 2011</xref>). While myosin II and myosin V motors have been involved in transporting the spindle and vesicles, respectively, filament dynamics appear to have a key role in these processes as well, regulated by Fmn2/Spire1/2 as well as cortical Arp2/3 nucleators, and other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaigne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheeseman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holubcová et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfender et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Generally, while the mechanism of contractile force generation is well understood in sarcomeric-like assemblies, such as muscles or stress fibers, the mechanisms in disordered F-actin networks, such as the above quasi-2D cortical and 3D cytoplasmic networks, remains much more elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lenz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murrell et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, computational models and theoretical work so far focused largely on disordered F-actin networks formed by non-dynamic filaments inspired by in vitro reconstituted contractile systems composed of stable filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarado and Koenderink, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belmonte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bendix et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Köhler and Bausch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murrell and Gardel, 2014</xref>). While it is true that these non-dynamic systems contract efficiently, it is also clear that filament dynamics has key contributions in vivo, as illustrated above. Indeed, although much less investigated, theoretical work has shown that F-actin dynamics is able to generate not only protrusive but also contractile stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zumdieck et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In the past, we discovered a prominent example of F-actin-driven intracellular transport in starfish oocytes, whereby a 3D F-actin network collects chromosomes scattered in the large oocyte nucleus and transports them to the forming microtubule spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lénárt et al., 2005</xref>). This F-actin network forms in the nuclear region after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), at the onset of meiosis, and is essential to prevent formation of aneuploid eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mori et al., 2011</xref>). It contracts homogeneously and isotropically mediating long-range and size-selective transport of chromosomes sterically trapped in the network. While the contraction of the network is isotropic and homogeneous, connections of the network to the cell cortex provide directionality, resulting in transport towards the microtubule spindle, located at the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mori et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, the mechanism underlying contraction of this 3D F-actin network remained unknown. To reveal it, we monitored contractile behavior using the chromosomes as natural probes combined with quantitative imaging of filament dynamics in live oocytes. In parallel, we developed physical models of different mechanisms of contraction, and compared the predictions of these models to the experimental system challenged by physical and chemical perturbations. We find that observations are well fitted by models in which contraction is driven by F-actin disassembly, but not by models of motor-driven contractility. Comparisons of experimental observations to in silico reconstruction of this contractile system reveal a novel and remarkably simple architecture to transport chromosomes, to prevent aneuploidy in the large oocyte.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Network contraction is characterized by a single scalar contraction rate</title><p>As we showed previously, chromosomes are sterically entrapped and thereby transported by a contracting F-actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mori et al., 2011</xref>). Chromosomes can thus be used as probes to monitor the network’s contractile behavior without potential artifacts associated with F-actin labeling. Therefore, we optimized the spatial and temporal resolution to image and track H2B-3mEGFP or -mCherry labeled chromosomes in 3D during actin-driven transport, 2 to 8 min after NEBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monnier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mori et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We reported previously that contractile activity is isotropic and while the network normally contracts to the animal pole, this merely results from passive anchoring of the network to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mori et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, here we analyzed the pair-wise distances between chromosomes to characterize the network contraction rate, a measure that is independent of the location and even existence of the anchor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31469.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Network contraction is characterized by a single rate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Maximum z-projections of selected time points through the nuclear region of live starfish oocytes expressing H2B-mCherry (cyan) to label chromosomes during actin-driven chromosome congression. n: disassembling nucleolus; AP: animal pole; VP: vegetal pole; right: pseudo-color time projection of z-projections.

Thus, to test the possible role of NMYII we inhibited its motor activity by the small-molecule inhibitor, blebbistatin. Further, we over-expressed myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), which we found in starfish oocytes to enhance NMYII activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bischof et al., 2017</xref>).

To explore the mechanism at the filament level, we implemented an agent-based model in the Cytosim software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nedelec and Foethke, 2007</xref>). We based the model on recently published cytosim simulations, used to support a general theoretical framework of contractility in disordered filament networks, albeit in that case with static filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belmonte et al., 2017</xref>). As in the published model, we used a circular 2D geometry, assuming a ‘nuclear region’ with a radius of 10 μm initially filled by filaments having the rigidity of F-actin. We then added a few features to model the starfish chromosome transport system: first, disassembly occurring at the same rate for all filaments throughout the network; and second new filament assembly at the boundary. We also introduced ‘chromosomes’, passive objects embedded in the network for the purpose of producing simulated trajectories.</p><p>We first tested whether the combination of disassembly and cross-linking could drive network contraction. Consistent with previous theory and experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belmonte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bendix et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braun et al., 2016</xref>), in the absence of molecular motors the disassembling network did not contract over a broad range of parameters (number of filaments, cross-linkers and their unbinding rates) tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).</p><p>This suggested that contraction in our system either requires a molecular motor or a specific molecular activity that is capable of harnessing F-actin disassembly to produce contractile force. This latter can be a molecule capable of tracking the depolymerizing end of a filament and forming a connection to a neighboring filament at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zumdieck et al., 2007</xref>). Introducing such elements into the simulations, referred to as end-binding cross-linkers, resulted in robust large-scale contraction of the disassembling network in the absence of molecular motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>We then tested the effects of assembly of new filaments at the network boundary. This reproduced well the observed behavior, whereby newly produced filaments fill up the space left by the ‘old’ contracting network. Interestingly, we found that contraction rate is rather insensitive to the rate of filament assembly at the boundary: insufficient or excess filament production rates led to inhomogeneity in the network, but this did not significantly affect the rate of contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests that the contraction of the old network, and new filament assembly at the NER boundary do not necessarily need to be coupled, and this is consistent with experimental observations. First, we observed an accumulation of filaments at the boundary of old and new networks in oocytes in which contraction and filament production was imbalanced by UtrCH stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Second, in untreated oocytes we observed a gradual accumulation of filaments at the NER boundary from the vegetal to the animal pole. This can be explained by constant rate of filament production all along the boundary, and while these produced filaments are distributed to fill in the relatively larger gap at the vegetal pole, filaments accumulate at the animal pole where there is no gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus it appears that filament production does not contribute to force production; it rather serves to fill in the gap between the ‘old network’ and cytoplasmic F-actin networks, mechanically isolating the contractile system in the nuclear region from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>As the final step, we combined these components of the contractile system, and set the rate of global disassembly and assembly at the boundary to match experimental observations. We then simulated two scenarios: (i) contraction driven by an end-binding cross-linker harnessing depolymerization for generating contractile force; (ii) myosin II-like motor activity driving contraction of the disassembling network (in presence of cross-linkers, but without end-binding cross-linkers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). Both simulations produced robust contraction. However, while contraction mediated by the end-binding cross-linker closely reproduced several key features of the experimental system, motor-driven contraction showed a distinct behavior not observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). First, the disassembly-driven mechanism invariably produces contraction with a constant speed, as observed experimentally, while motor-driven contraction typically accelerates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Second, while a strictly quantitative comparison of the 2D simulations and the 3D experimental system is not possible, network density remains nearly constant during contraction in the disassembly-driven simulations, as in experiments, while during motor-driven contraction network density continuously increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

Oocytes also divide very asymmetrically in order to retain these nutrients in a single egg. The requirement for this highly asymmetric division constrains the size of the meiotic spindle. Therefore, across animal species, the meiotic spindle is small and this necessitates additional mechanism to collect and transport chromosomes scattered in the large nuclear volume to the forming microtubule spindle.</p><p>Here, we propose and reconstruct in silico a simple and robust architecture for an F-actin-based contractile system adapted to the essential function of transporting chromosomes in the large oocyte. First, the process is triggered by NEBD opening the previously inaccessible nuclear compartment to cytoplasmic actin, actin assembly factors and cross-linkers resulting in the rapid assembly of a cross-linked F-actin network in the nuclear region. As revealed by our simulations, the only additional components necessary are: (i) filament production along the boundary to separate the nuclear region from cytoplasmic F-actin networks allowing contraction towards the center, and (ii) overall filament dynamics shifted towards disassembly. In the presence of a ‘depolymerization harnessing factor’ this system undergoes robust contraction exhibiting features that closely match the experimental observations. These include constant speed, stable network density during contraction (well matched to the size of chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mori et al., 2011</xref>]), and graded response to filament stabilization and destabilization, but no effect of motor inhibition. We find that the rate of disassembly is the key parameter controlling the rate of contraction, while contraction rate is broadly insensitive to filament production at the boundary. Finally, an additional elegant feature of the system is that the disassembling network will eventually release the transported chromosomes, as it loses connectivity and stops contracting. By contrast, in the absence of disassembly, a contracting network would necessarily densify, in which case the chromosomes would be surrounded by a tight meshwork of F-actin at the end of contraction, which would likely interfere with their capture by spindle microtubules.</p><p>In conclusion, we investigated here a contractile system adapted to transport chromosomes in large oocytes. Both experiments and simulations point to an F-actin disassembly-driven mechanism driving this process, as a simple and robust solution to the challenge posed by the size and geometry of the starfish oocyte. Network contraction can be seen here as a large-scale treadmilling system, where F-actin disassembles in bulk and is replenished by filaments polymerized at the NER boundary. However, the evidences lead us to conclude that de-novo filament assembly at the NER boundary does not participate in force generation, which rather originates in the bulk of the network.</p><p>Key questions remain open regarding the detailed molecular mechanism underlying disassembly-driven force generation. The first question is the exact source of free energy driving the process. While actin polymerization is well established to produce force, at cell protrusions, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Footer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krause and Gautreau, 2014</xref>), force production by disassembly has so far only been evidenced in vitro for specific actin concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jégou et al., 2013</xref>). It is clear that microtubule depolymerization can produce force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grishchuk et al., 2005</xref>), that is harnessed for example to drive separation of sister chromatids in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheeseman and Desai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Westermann et al., 2006</xref>). Similar to tubulin, actin polymerization is tightly coupled to nucleotide hydrolysis driving the system out of equilibrium that may enable generation of force by depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braun et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, entropic forces generated either by crowding agents surrounding filaments or by diffusible cross-linkers confined in filament overlaps could drive contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braun et al., 2016</xref>), but we have not tested this possibility.</p><p>Another important question is the identity and nature of the factor harnessing the free energy originating from disassembly of actin filaments, and converting it into contractile force. Intriguingly, experiments in vitro and our initial experiments in starfish oocytes hint at formins as potential candidates for this function. These results need to be confirmed, since they rely on a small-molecule inhibitor, SMIFH2, which has been shown to inhibit formins in starfish oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ucar et al., 2013</xref>), but its specificity and selectivity profile is yet to be characterized. Secondly, the observed effect may be indirect resulting from the altered balance between other formin-driven actin assembly pathways and Arp2/3 nucleated structures, as recently showed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burke et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, although Jégou and colleagues clearly demonstrated tracking of filament ends by mDia1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jégou et al., 2013</xref>), we are at present unable to assess how similar or different these in vitro conditions may be from those in starfish oocytes, where (dis)assembly dynamics at filaments ends is likely to be regulated by multiple, so far unidentified factors.</p><p>It will be very exciting to test in the future whether formins, so far primarily considered to promote polymerization, may be also involved in transmitting force at disassembling filaments ends in vivo. However, at this point we are not able to exclude other scenarios, such as rapid re-binding of a cross-linker to the shrinking filament end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mendes Pinto et al., 2012</xref>). Further, the rate of disassembly could be affected by severing, generating more depolymerizing ends, and the actual rate of depolymerization at the end set by capping and depolymerizing factors. More elaborate models are necessary to explore these scenarios. In either case, the contractile 3D network we analyzed here, adapted to the task of transporting chromosomes in the large starfish oocyte, will continue to be a valuable system to further explore the important mechanistic details of the so far poorly understood motor-independent mechanisms of contraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>Biological sample</bold></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Patiria miniata</td><td>Patiria miniata</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scbiomarine.com/">https://scbiomarine.com/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td><bold>Transfected construct</bold></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>MRLC (Patiria miniata)</td><td>MRLC-mEGFP</td><td>doi:10.1038/s41467-017-00979-6</td></tr><tr><td>H2B (human)</td><td>H2B-mCherry, H2B-3mEGFP</td><td>doi:10.1038/nmeth876</td></tr><tr><td>Utrophin CH domain (human)</td><td>mEGFP3-UtrCH, 3mCherry-UtrCH</td><td>doi:10.1002/cm.20226</td></tr><tr><td>myosinVb tail domain (mouse)</td><td>myosinVb-Tail</td><td>doi:10.1038/ncb2802</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Peptide, recombinant protein</bold></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Histone H1 (calf)</td><td>H1</td><td>Merck</td></tr><tr><td>Utrophin CH domain (human)</td><td>UtrCH</td><td>doi:10.1002/cm.20226</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Commercial assay or kit</bold></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>AmpliCap-Max T7 High Yield Message Maker</td><td>AmpliCap-Max T7 High Yield Message Maker</td><td>CellScript</td></tr><tr><td>Poly(A) tailing kit</td><td>Poly(A) tailing kit</td><td>CellScript</td></tr><tr><td>Gel filtration column PD-10</td><td>Gel filtration</td><td>GE Healthcare</td></tr><tr><td>Ni-NTA resin</td><td>Ni-NTA resin</td><td>Qiagen</td></tr><tr><td>Vivaspin column 10,000 MW</td><td>Vivaspin column</td><td>Sartorius</td></tr><tr><td>Alexa Fluor 568 succinimidyl ester</td><td>Alexa Fluor 568 succinimidyl ester</td><td>Invitrogen</td></tr><tr><td>Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester</td><td>Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester</td><td>Invitrogen</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Chemicals, drugs</bold></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>DiIC<sub>16</sub>(3)</td><td>DiI</td><td>Invitrogen</td></tr><tr><td>1-methyladenine</td><td>1-MA</td><td>ACROS organics</td></tr><tr><td>Phalloidin-AlexaFluor 568</td><td>Phalloidin-AlexaFluor 568</td><td>Invitrogen</td></tr><tr><td>LatrunculinA</td><td>Lat A</td><td>Abcam</td></tr><tr><td>SMIFH2</td><td>SMIFH2</td><td>Tocris</td></tr><tr><td>Y-27632</td><td>Y-27632</td><td>Enzo Life Sciences</td></tr><tr><td>ML-7</td><td>ML-7</td><td>Tocris</td></tr><tr><td>Blebbistatin</td><td>BB</td><td>Abcam</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Software, algorithm</bold></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Matlab</td><td>Matlab</td><td>Mathworks</td></tr><tr><td>Cytosim</td><td>Cytosim</td><td>doi:10.1088/1367-2630/9/11/427</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Oocyte injection, maturation and centrifugation</title><p>Starfish (<italic>P. miniata</italic>, also known as <italic>Asterina miniata</italic>) were obtained from Southern California Sea Urchin Co., Marinus Scientific, South Coast Bio-Marine, or Monterey Abalone Co. and maintained in seawater tanks at 15°C at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Marine Facility.

To monitor F-actin network contraction, starfish oocytes were imaged in 3D centered on the median plane (plane of biggest surface) with a Z-step of 2 µm covering 10–20 µm over time (time step 10 s) using a square frame of 512 × 512 pixels at a pixel size of 223 nm.

Figures were assembled in Adobe Illustrator. Data analyses were performed using Matlab (MathWorks). Image data are shown after brightness and contrast adjustment and application of a 2D Gaussian blur filter (sigma value: 0.2–1.0). Some image data were registered using the ‘StackReg’ plugin implemented in Fiji to correct for oocyte movements during experiments. Panels show either single Z-slices, maximum or sum intensity projections as indicated in the figure legends. Colored time projections were done using the TimeRGBcolorcode macro in Fiji. Chromosome tracking and data analysis were done by in-house routines written in Matlab. Segmentation and tracking algorithms are described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monnier et al., 2012</xref>). Pair-wise relative chromosome velocities were defined as the slope of the best-fit line (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9) to the separation distance between the pair versus time. Similarly, pair-wise chromosome approach rate was defined as the slope of the linear fit to the separation distance between the pair for every 2 min interval during the actin-driven transport phase (from 2 to 8 min after NEBD).</p><p>To control for photobleaching, we measured fluorescence intensity in a small region in the cytoplasm during the time course of the experiment. Oocytes in which the fluorescence intensity decrease exceeded 10%, were not included in further analysis.</p><p>To measure the mass of F-actin, a custom-written Fiji macro was first used to automatically segment the nuclear region based on either the DiIC<sub>16</sub>(3) fluorescence or the bright field channel. This pipeline included a FeatureJ Hessian filtering, followed by a 2D Gaussian filtering and automatic thresholding using the ‘Otsu’ or ‘Huang’ algorithm. The segmented area was then used on the F-actin channel to measure the density (‘mean’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To estimate the mass of F-actin within the contracting network over time, we used the initial outline of the nucleus at the onset of the actin-driven phase, and applied iteratively the function ‘Enlarge’ with a factor equals to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> to extrapolate the area and further the volume of the contracting network.

Actin filaments are represented by incompressible bendable filaments of rigidity 0.075 pN.μm<sup>2</sup> (persistence length of 18 µm) in a medium of viscosity 0.3 Pa.s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belmonte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gittes et al., 1993</xref>). Filaments have an initial length of 1.5 µm and are discretized into segments of 100 nm. Disassembly occurs from one end at a speed of 0.0015 µm/s. The other end is static. Cross-linkers are modeled as Hookean springs of 10 nm resting length and rigidity of 250 pN/µm with a binding rate k<sub>on</sub> = 10 s<sup>−1</sup> (binding range of 0.01 μm) and an unbinding rate k<sub>off</sub> = 0.1 s<sup>−1</sup> that is independent of the force exerted by the link. Motors are also Hookean springs of similar characteristics as cross-linkers, but motors additionally move on filaments with a speed of 0.02 µm/s, with a linear force-velocity relationship characterized by a maximal stall force of 6 pN. Chromosomes are modeled as point-like particles to trace the network evolution, but without a drag they do not affect its behavior. Chromosomes can bind a single filament with a binding rate k<sub>on</sub> = 10 s<sup>−1</sup> (range of 0.1 μm) and a force-independent unbinding rate k<sub>off</sub> = 0.0001 s<sup>−1</sup>, and are also able to track the depolymerizing end of filaments. Actin disassembly, cross-linker and motor binding and unbinding events were modeled as first-order stochastic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gillespie, 1977</xref>).</p><p>To limit the computational cost and focus on the effect of the mode of contraction, we limited the simulation to a circular two-dimensional system of constant radius 10 µm and we neglected the steric interaction between filaments. The disc was populated initially by 5000 filaments of 1.5 µm long, 20,000 cross-linkers and 20,000 motors for the motor-driven mechanism. For the disassembly-driven mechanism, we added 40,000 end-tracking cross-linkers to the simulated system. All filaments disassembled at the same rate from one end while the other end remained stable. The disassembly rate was set at 0.0015 μm/s to match the experimentally measured contractile characteristics. To simulate the polymerization of newly-assembled filaments at the edge of the nuclear region, filaments were added with an initial length of 1.5 µm at the boundary at a rate of 12 filaments per second. Because there is no edge or steric interactions, adding new filaments per se does not produce compressive force on the old network.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Pekka Lappalainen (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrea Musacchio as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Contractile actomyosin structures are critical for many morphogenetic events and transport processes in cells. Recent studies demonstrated that a three-dimensional contractile actin network collects chromosomes and transports them to the forming microtubule spindle in starfish oocytes. However, the mechanism by which this network contracts has remained elusive. Here, Bun et al., provide evidence that myosin activity is not necessary for the network contraction, but that actin filament disassembly instead appears to drive the network contractility.</p><p>All reviewers found this study very interesting and stated that the experimental part is novel and convincing. However, because the experiments are not sufficiently well connected to the model (and the model was not rigorously tested experimentally), we cannot publish the manuscript, at least in its present form. However, if you can significantly strengthen the manuscript along the lines suggested by the reviewers, we will be glad to consider an adequately revised version of the manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The first part of the study presents some high quality experimental work with the tools available in starfish, and the second part of the study presents an interesting model. However, the main weakness of this manuscript is that the model is not really constrained by the experimental work, and that the prediction of the model was not challenged by some additional experimental work (since the putative cross-linker was not identified). Thus, the study would be much stronger if the authors could experimentally test their model. At minimum, alternative models to explain the data, and the limitations of the study, should be extensively discussed.</p><p>2) A central argument for favoring a disassembly driven mechanism over a motor driven mechanism is the comparison of the fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref> to a viscoelastic model assuming either motor-driving or disassembly. Since this is so essential, the authors should give an expression for the contraction rate α(t) for the two models in the main text and make clear which measured quantities go into the fit and what other parameters are fitted. Importantly they should also give the value of all the fitting parameters. The authors should compare these parameters wherever possible to measured or measurable values (e.g. for filament length and depolymerization rate). In the current version, it is unclear if and how much these parameters vary from fit to fit and if they are within reasonable limits.</p><p>3) Along this line: the Motor Model depends on the actin concentration. This concentration does not change a lot for various UtrCH concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Yet, the fit of the 'low' to 'high' UtrCH concentrations (dashed red, green, blue lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) is drastically different from the control (black dashed line). Where does this sudden change come from if the input is so similar?</p><p>4) It appears that the only difference between the two viscoelastic models (D versus M) is the σ_c term. For the Motor-driven model there is a linear or quadratic dependency of A (actin density), for the disassembly driven model there is a linear dependency of A. Furthermore σ_c^D depends on k_depol and &lt;l&gt;. At first sight it appears surprising how this could lead to the large differences in the fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, but A (and perhaps also &lt;l&gt;?) are time dependent. It would be helpful to explain in more detail which variables are time dependent, and also to show &lt;l&gt; (t) in real units (i.e. micrometers). Is k_depol also a function of time?</p><p>5) Comparing the two models: Model M and D both get the actin concentration A as input (linearly or quadratically). However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> the two fits go into different directions. While in M the fit increases faster and gets a peak, the fit for model D becomes smaller in value and flatter. This suggest that the bigger effect on the fit of model D is given by the &lt;l&gt; and k_depol parameters. Again, it is important to give the value and potentially even plot these two parameters for the different cases. This would be also informative in the light of the claim that these quantities are gradually changed with the UtrCH injection.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A disassembly-driven mechanism explains F-actin-mediated chromosome transport in starfish oocytes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Andrea Musacchio (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>This is a revised version of a manuscript, which provides evidence that actin filament disassembly drives the contraction of a three-dimensional actin network that collects chromosomes and transports them to the forming microtubule spindle in starfish oocytes. The authors have satisfactorily addressed the majority of the previous concerns, and the manuscript is significantly improved. Also, the experimental and simulation details are much better clarified now.</p><p>However, the formin inhibitor data were not considered particularly strong, and therefore we feel that you should tone down the conclusions concerning the role of formin(s) as a cross-linker in this process (please, see specific comments below). All proposed changes can be addressed textually and do not require new experiments.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors used SMIFH2 for inhibiting formins. To justify the use of SMIFH2 inhibitor, they referred to (Ucar et al., 2013). However, characterization of the effects of the inhibitor in this study were not particularly thorough, and this should be considered in the Discussion.</p><p>2) Even if the inhibitor works against formins, the effect of the inhibitor on the observed actin dynamics could be indirect e.g. due to altering the balance between Arp2/3 complex and formin -driven actin assembly pathways (see e.g. Burke et al., 2014). This possibility should be considered in the interpretation of the results.</p><p>3) In subsection “<italic>In silico</italic> reconstitution of the contractile system predicts a ‘depolymerization harnessing factor’ essential to drive contraction”, the authors test if the combination of disassembly and crosslinking could drive network contraction. This has already been done on a dynamic actin network (see: Ennomani et al., 2016), and should be discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>4) In the same subsection, the authors mention that mDia1 is able to track depolymerizing filament ends. However, these in vitro experiments (Jegou et al., 2013) were performed under specific conditions, where the critical concentration of actin was below the barbed end Cc. Thus, this argument cannot be used here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31469.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The first part of the study presents some high quality experimental work with the tools available in starfish, and the second part of the study presents an interesting model.

At minimum, alternative models to explain the data, and the limitations of the study, should be extensively discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In addressing this point, we made two major changes to the manuscript that we believe have significantly improved the revised version:</p><p>First, we explain more clearly how the parameters of the theory are constrained by experimental data (see also our response to the point below). We also changed the phrasing and expanded the text at several places to explain how developing the theory during this research has motivated experiments, and thus the model had a guiding virtue. Specifically, it motivated experiments in which we attempted to gradually increase and decrease disassembly rates.</p><p>Second, we now include new experiments aimed at identifying the ‘disassembly harnessing factor’ predicted by our simulations. We previously discussed that formin proteins in principle could be this factor as they do have the required activities. In the revised manuscript, we tested this experimentally by using a generic inhibitor of all proteins containing the conserved FH2 formin domain (SMIFH2). Intriguingly, this caused a significant reduction of disassembly rates and concomitant slowing of contraction, consistent with the predictions of the theory. In our view, these new findings constitute a significant advance and open a very exciting new perspective for a yet unexplored mechanism of contraction. However, the tools we have available in the starfish oocyte system are limited, and therefore identification of the specific formin-like protein is unfortunately not feasible in the frame of the present study. These limitations are now discussed explicitly in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A central argument for favoring a disassembly driven mechanism over a motor driven mechanism is the comparison of the fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6F</xref> to a viscoelastic model assuming either motor-driving or disassembly.

We took special care listing all input as well as fitting parameters used to derive the contraction rate αt over time, and we now show all equations in the main manuscript text.</p><p>Briefly, the viscoelastic model uses the following measured quantities:</p><p>a) We derived the <italic>depolymerization rate, k</italic> from the total fluorescence in the network to quantify relative changes in polymer mass over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; Equation 5; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>b) We assume that filaments depolymerize with a constant speed from onset of contraction to the point at which the network would entirely vanish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Assuming that the distribution of filament length follows a Gaussian distribution, we can calculate from this relation the <italic>mean length</italic> as a function of time, and also the <italic>number of filaments</italic> as a function of time.</p><p>We then solve the partial differential equations from active-gel theory, with either a stress that is produced by motors, or a stress that depends on disassembly. For each model, we first obtained fitting parameters compatible with αt observed in control experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary Files 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). We then used the depolymerization rate <italic>k</italic> measured in perturbations and the fitting parameters from the corresponding control experiments to obtain the predicted contraction rate, αt. This αt is then compared to the experimentally measured contraction rate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">4</xref>). Unfortunately, all parameters of the model are renormalized, and we cannot evaluate experimentally the number of filaments, the length or the depolymerization speed. As a general evaluation of our theory, we show that similar results can be obtained by modeling the F-actin network as a purely viscous gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Along this line: the Motor Model depends on the actin concentration. This concentration does not change a lot for various UtrCH concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Yet, the fit of the 'low' to 'high' UtrCH concentrations (dashed red, green, blue lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) is drastically different from the control (black dashed line). Where does this sudden change come from if the input is so similar?</p></disp-quote><p>The major difference arises from the term of contractile stress σc in the two models: this is proportional to <italic>A</italic><sup>2</sup> in model M, and proportional to <italic>A</italic><sup>1</sup> in model D (Equations 8 and 9). Since UtrCH gradually stabilizes the F-actin network and thereby hinders actin disassembly, the F-actin concentration A is increasing with increasing UtrCH amounts. Consequently, the contractility increases much faster in model M, where the stress depends on <italic>A</italic><sup>2</sup>, as compared to model D, where the stress depends on <italic>A</italic><sup>1</sup>. This difference is qualitative, and is not rooted in the particular parameter values determined by the fit performed on the unperturbed/control experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It appears that the only difference between the two viscoelastic models (D versus M) is the σ_c term. For the Motor-driven model there is a linear or quadratic dependency of A (actin density), for the disassembly driven model there is a linear dependency of A. Furthermore σ_c^D depends on k_depol and &lt;l&gt;. At first sight it appears surprising how this could lead to the large differences in the fits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, but A (and perhaps also &lt;l&gt;?) are time dependent. It would be helpful to explain in more detail which variables are time dependent, and also to show &lt;l&gt; (t) in real units (i.e. micrometers). Is k_depol also a function of time?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for these omissions. In the revised manuscript, we define all variables and constants more strictly, and explicitly write for example <italic>A</italic>(r,t), <italic>l</italic>(r,t). The depolymerization rate <italic>k</italic> is an experimental measure derived from fitting the F-actin mass over time that does not depend on time except for Latrunculin A-treated oocytes. In response to acute Latrunculin A treatment, the depolymerization rate increases over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). As the reviewer points out, the main source of the differences seen on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> is the linear vs. quadratic dependence of stress on F-actin concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Comparing the two models: Model M and D both get the actin concentration A as input (linearly or quadratically).

(and confirmed by us) is very typical for formin inhibition across animal species, due to the conserved, essential role of the formin, mDia in cytokinesis. Ucar et al. observed the same phenotype following perturbations of mDia by other means, further supporting their conclusions.</p><p>Generally, the FH2 domain targeted by SMIFH2 is extremely well conserved across species, consistent with the original report showing specific effects from yeast to mammals (Rizvi et al., 2009), as well as in mouse oocytes by others (Kim et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Even if the inhibitor works against formins, the effect of the inhibitor on the observed actin dynamics could be indirect e.g. due to altering the balance between Arp2/3 complex and formin -driven actin assembly pathways (see e.g. Burke et al., 2014). This possibility should be considered in the interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this comment, and we amended the Discussion accordingly, citing the above paper from the Kovar lab, as suggested. However, based on our previous data (Mori et al., 2014), we know that Arp2/3 is not primarily involved in nucleating filaments in the F-actin network transporting chromosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In subsection “In silico reconstitution of the contractile system predicts a ‘depolymerization harnessing factor’ essential to drive contraction”, the authors test if the combination of disassembly and crosslinking could drive network contraction. This has already been done on a dynamic actin network (see: Ennomani et al., 2016), and should be discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Ennomani et al., 2016 took a similar approach and used the Cytosim software to study the contractile response of a network in <italic>absence</italic> of filament dynamics. I.e. all their simulations were carried out with filaments of fixed length (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures, page 7 within the publication). In our opinion this is a critical difference, and correspondingly we felt no need to modify our discussion at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the same subsection, the authors mention that mDia1 is able to track depolymerizing filament ends. However, these in vitro experiments (Jegou et al., 2013) were performed under specific conditions, where the critical concentration of actin was below the barbed end Cc. Thus, this argument cannot be used here.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this comment, and we amended the Discussion accordingly. Unfortunately, we have no knowledge on the molecular composition, regulation and resulting properties of filament ends in the starfish oocyte. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate whether and to what extent the findings under the specific in vitro conditions used by Jegou et al., 2013 are applicable to starfish oocytes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
