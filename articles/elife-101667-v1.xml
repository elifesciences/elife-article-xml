despite mounting evidence linking it to various adverse health outcomes that include heightened pain perception. The prelimbic (PrL) cortex is vulnerable to insult from adolescent alcohol exposure and receives input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) while sending projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) – two brain regions implicated in nociception. In this study, adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure was carried out in male and female rats using a vapor inhalation procedure. Assessments of mechanical and thermal sensitivity revealed that AIE exposure-induced protracted mechanical allodynia. To investigate synaptic function at BLA inputs onto defined populations of PrL neurons, retrobeads and viral labeling were combined with optogenetics and slice electrophysiology. Recordings from retrobead labeled cells in the PrL revealed AIE reduced BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of neurons projecting from the PrL to the vlPAG, resulting in augmented excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and increased intrinsic excitability. Consistent with this finding, recordings from virally tagged PrL parvalbumin interneurons (PVINs) demonstrated that AIE exposure reduced both E/I balance at BLA inputs onto PVINs and PVIN intrinsic excitability. These findings provide compelling evidence that AIE alters synaptic function and intrinsic excitability within a prefrontal nociceptive circuit.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Alcohol is sometimes used as a temporary form of pain relief. However, heavy and regular consumption can have serious side effects, including altering how the brain processes pain. Over time, this may lead to more frequent and intense episodes of pain, creating a vicious cycle in which individuals drink more to counteract their heightened discomfort.</p><p>Recent studies in rodents have shown that binge drinking during adolescence also increases sensitivity to pain, with this change often persisting into adulthood. Yet, how alcohol use in teenagers impacts the parts of the brain that process pain remains poorly understood.</p><p>To investigate this question, Obray et al. compared the brains of adolescent rats that had either been exposed or not exposed to alcohol. The rats were subjected to two types of pain stimuli: mechanical pressure using the end of a metal wire and thermal pain via a heated surface. The team found that less pressure was needed for the alcohol-exposed rats to pull their paws away, suggesting they were more sensitive to pain. However, both groups of rats exhibited similar responses to the heat-related stimulus.</p><p>Next, Obray et al. explored the connections between the parts of the brain that process pain. A region of the brain known as the prefrontal cortex integrates the sensory and emotional aspects of pain by sending information to and from the amygdala and periaqueductal gray areas. Obray et al. found that inhibitory interneurons in the prefrontal cortex, which may reduce the transmission of pain, were not as well connected to the amygdala in the alcohol-exposed rats. In addition, neurons linking the prefrontal cortex to the periaqueductal gray areas were more excitable in these animals compared to the non-exposed rats.</p><p>These findings suggest that alcohol use during adolescence may make the brain more reactive to pain while impairing its ability to modulate pain signals<italic>.</italic> Understanding how early alcohol exposure alters pain sensitivity could help scientists develop strategies that disrupt the harmful cycle between alcohol use and pain<italic>.</italic> However, further studies are needed to determine whether the effects observed in this study also occur in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adolescent alcohol</kwd><kwd>AIE</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>allodynia</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>periaqueductal gray</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA019967</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chandler</surname><given-names>L Judson</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA007474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Obray</surname><given-names>J Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AA030193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Obray</surname><given-names>J Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Adolescent alcohol exposure reduced basolateral amygdala-driven inhibition of pyramidal neurons projecting from the prefrontal cortex to the periaqueductal gray and increased inhibition of prefrontal parvalbumin interneurons.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alcohol misuse and pain exhibit a bidirectional relationship. Due to its analgesic properties, alcohol is often used to self-medicate for pain relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alford et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Riley and King, 2009</xref>). However, the dose required for this effect results in blood alcohol levels akin to binge drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Neddenriep et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>), heightening the risk of alcohol-related harm. While acute alcohol consumption can temporarily alleviate pain, chronic misuse promotes hyperalgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dina et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dudek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Edwards et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jochum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Julian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">You et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, frequent acute pain and pain interference are associated with an elevated risk of being diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Edlund et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McDermott et al., 2018</xref>). This dynamic extends to adolescents where untreated pain correlates with earlier initiation of alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chau and Chau, 2023</xref>), and alcohol consumption is associated with heightened ongoing and future pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hestbaek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Horn-Hofmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pascale et al., 2022</xref>). Recent preclinical studies in rodents further indicate that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure induces persistent hyperalgesia spanning into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bertagna et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kelley et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Khan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Secci et al., 2024</xref>). Given the association between pain and AUD, understanding the impact of adolescent alcohol use on nociceptive circuits is crucial for improving AUD treatments.</p><p>Nociception involves multimodal processing across a distributed brain network. Within this network, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key node for evaluating and responding to pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bastuji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Garcia-Larrea and Peyron, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ong et al., 2019</xref>). The prelimbic (PrL) subregion of the mPFC receives inputs from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gabbott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Krettek and Price, 1977</xref>) and sends projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Floyd et al., 2000</xref>), both regions involved in nociception. Within this circuit, glutamatergic inputs from the BLA drive parvalbumin interneuron (PVIN)-mediated feedforward inhibition of pyramidal neurons projecting from the PrL to the vlPAG (PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons) to promote nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheriyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dilgen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gadotti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McGarry and Carter, 2016</xref>). Of note, activation of PrL PVINs has been shown to be pronociceptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), while activation of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons generally exhibits antinociceptive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Drake et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yin et al., 2020</xref>), although this finding has not been universally observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fan et al., 2018</xref>). These findings highlight the involvement of a BLA–PrL–vlPAG circuit in modulating nociception.</p><p>Adolescence marks a critical period of continuing development of the mPFC. This period is characterized by heightened plasticity rendering this region particularly vulnerable to environmental insults, including repeated binge alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crews et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Spear, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spear, 2018</xref>). Notably, this developmental phase is accompanied by significant alterations in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission within the mPFC. Excitatory changes include pruning of both synapses and dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Drzewiecki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Koss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mallya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petanjek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rakic et al., 1994</xref>), maturation of AMPA and NMDA receptor trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Flores-Barrera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miller et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Murphy et al., 2012</xref>), and increased innervation from the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cunningham et al., 2008</xref>). Concurrently, there is a substantial increase in excitatory input onto PVINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caballero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cunningham et al., 2008</xref>), leading to a shift toward greater inhibition in the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance at pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caballero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cass et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Klune et al., 2021</xref>). Preclinical rodent models have demonstrated that AIE exposure disrupts the normative developmental trajectory of the mPFC, inducing persistent alterations in intrinsic excitability and synaptic function. Specifically, adolescent alcohol exposure leads to decreased intrinsic excitability of PVINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trantham-Davidson et al., 2017</xref>), reduced excitatory input onto PVINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trantham-Davidson et al., 2017</xref>), diminished inhibition at pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Centanni et al., 2017</xref>), and augmented intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Galaj et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Salling et al., 2018</xref>). These findings underscore the sensitivity of mPFC circuitry to long-lasting AIE-induced changes. Building upon this understanding, the present study investigated how AIE exposure, in conjunction with a carrageen-induced inflammatory paw pain challenge, alters synaptic function at BLA inputs onto PVINs and PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The procedure for adolescent alcohol exposure used in this study is a well-characterized model designed to simulate the effects of repeated episodes of binge-like alcohol exposure. Rats were subjected to eight intermittent cycles of ethanol vapor from PD 28 to PD 54. Behavioral intoxication and blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) were assessed at the end of each cycle. The average behavioral intoxication score using the 5-point rating scale was 2.2 ± 0.1 for male rats in the AIE-saline treatment condition, 2.2 ± 0.1 for male rats in the AIE-carrageenan treatment condition, 2.2 ± 0.1 for female rats in the AIE-saline treatment condition, and 2.1 ± 0.1 for female rats in the AIE-carrageenan treatment condition, which represents a moderate level of intoxication. The corresponding BEC values were 196.4 ± 34.8 for male rats in the AIE-saline treatment condition, 240.0 ± 33.8 for male rats in the AIE-carrageenan treatment condition, 184.8 ± 38.8 for female rats in the AIE-saline treatment condition, and 177.7 ± 31.2 for female rats in the AIE-carrageenan treatment condition. Male rats had significantly higher intoxication scores than female rats (Wilcoxon rank-sum test: <italic>z</italic> = 1.967, p = 0.0492). There was no difference in average intoxication scores between rats assigned to the saline and carrageenan pain conditions (Wilcoxon rank-sum test: <italic>z</italic> = 0.450, p = 0.6529). There was no difference in BEC level between male and female rats (Wilcoxon rank-sum test: <italic>z</italic> = 1.365, p = 0.1724) or for rats assigned to the saline and carrageenan pain conditions (Wilcoxon rank-sum test: <italic>z</italic> = –0.955, p = 0.3395).

In the present study, sex was included as a between-subjects factor in the ANOVA, whereas the prior study analyzed for male and female rat data separately. Consistent with this, when we analyzed our male and female data separately, we did observe a transient increase in thermal sensitivity in female rats as was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Secci et al., 2024</xref>). Discrepancies regarding the impact of AIE on thermal sensitivity in males may stem from methodological differences such as the use of different strains of rats and differences in the ethanol exposure paradigms.</p><p>After assessing the effects of AIE exposure on mechanical sensitivity, patch-clamp slice electrophysiology was performed to assess intrinsic excitability and synaptic function within the BLA–PrL–vlPAG circuit. For PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons, these experiments revealed that AIE increased intrinsic excitability. Previous research has shown both unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Galaj et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Obray et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trantham-Davidson et al., 2017</xref>) and increased intrinsic excitability of PrL pyramidal neurons following AIE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Galaj et al., 2020</xref>) or voluntary alcohol consumption during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Salling et al., 2018</xref>). As pyramidal neurons in the PrL cortex can be classified as intratelencephalic (IT) or extratelencephalic (ET) based on their projection targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anastasiades and Carter, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2018a</xref>) and as each of these populations display unique physiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dembrow et al., 2010</xref>), one potential explanation for these results is that adolescent ethanol exposure differentially effects these populations. Consistent with this hypothesis, IT pyramidal neurons projecting from the PrL to the BLA and the nucleus accumbens do not display altered intrinsic excitability following AIE exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Obray et al., 2022</xref>) whereas PT PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons do. Notably, PT neurons display greater <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub>-dependent voltage sag than IT neurons, and adolescent alcohol exposure has been reported to reduce <italic>I</italic><sub>h</sub> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Salling et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a possible mechanism for greater ethanol effects on intrinsic excitability in ET neurons than in IT neurons. However, for PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons in the present study there was not a significant AIE-induced reduction in voltage sag. This disparity could be related to several methodological differences between studies, including differences in the exposure method (passive vapor versus voluntary drinking), the age of the animals at testing, and the use of rats versus mice. Regardless, it remains possible AIE may differentially affect the intrinsic excitability of ET and IT pyramidal neurons in the PrL.</p><p>Increased intrinsic excitability of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons was accompanied by augmented E/I balance in AIE exposed rats. The increased E/I balance resulted from reduced oIPSC amplitude. This indicated that AIE exposure reduced BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons. This is an interesting observation as it suggests that AIE prevents the normal developmental shift toward greater inhibition at PrL pyramidal neurons that occurs as PVINs mature during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caballero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caballero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Du et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Klune et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the change in feedforward inhibition, we conducted electrophysiological recordings from PrL PVINs. These recordings revealed significantly reduced intrinsic excitability in AIE exposed animals, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trantham-Davidson et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, PVIN intrinsic excitability is developmentally regulated and increases during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Koppensteiner et al., 2019</xref>). Decreased intrinsic excitability coincided with reduced BLA-driven E/I balance at PrL PVINs in male AIE exposed rats, with an attenuated effect in females. The reduced E/I balance primarily stemmed from a decrease in oEPSC amplitude, although AIE did alter oIPSC amplitude in a sex-dependent manner. The sex-dependent effect of AIE on oIPSCs is difficult to interpret, as post hoc tests did not reveal any significant effects. However, visual inspection of the data suggests a potential trend toward increased oIPSC amplitude in male AIE exposed rats and reduced amplitude in females. Intriguingly, voluntary alcohol consumption during adolescence elicits sex-dependent effects on PrL somatostatin interneuron intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sicher et al., 2023</xref>). As these neurons receive inputs from the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cummings and Clem, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McGarry and Carter, 2016</xref>) and project to PrL PVINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cummings and Clem, 2020</xref>), it is possible that somatostatin neurons are responsible for the sex-dependent effects of AIE on E/I balance and oIPSCs at PVINs.</p><p>To better characterize the reduction in glutamate signaling, we next measured monosynaptic oAMPA and oNMDA currents at BLA inputs onto PVINs. This revealed that AIE significantly decreased oAMPA and oNMDA currents without altering the overall AMPA/NMDA ratio. This agreed with prior research from our lab which found AIE reduced electrically evoked AMPA and NMDA currents onto PVINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trantham-Davidson et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether this reduction resulted from pre- or postsynaptic changes, aEPSCs were recorded from PVINs in the PrL cortex. The amplitude but not the interevent interval of the aEPSCs was reduced in AIE exposed animals, indicating a reduction in postsynaptic receptor function. These findings provide strong evidence for reduced glutamate signaling efficacy at BLA inputs onto PVINs following AIE exposure. It was also revealed that following AIE exposure, BLA-dependent feedforward inhibition of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons was decreased. This reduction may have resulted, at least in part, from the observed decreases in PrL PVIN intrinsic excitability and postsynaptic glutamate receptor function at BLA inputs to PrL PVINs. Within the BLA–PrL–vlPAG circuit, PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neuron activation is generally associated with antinociceptive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Drake et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gadotti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yin et al., 2020</xref>), while PrL PVIN activation is associated with pronociceptive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). However, PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neuron activation can be pronociceptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fan et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, chronic activation of a PrL nociceptive ensemble including PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons has been shown to induce chronic pain-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Qi et al., 2022</xref>). As PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons project to both GABA and glutamate neurons in the vlPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Guo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), and these populations have been shown to be pro- and antinociceptive, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Samineni et al., 2017</xref>), the balance of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> input onto these populations may determine the effect of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> activation on nociception. While speculative, we hypothesize that AIE selectively strengthens the input from PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons onto vlPAG GABA neurons, resulting in mechanical allodynia that could be alleviated by inhibiting PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons or activating PrL PVINs. Alternatively, these changes could represent an antinociceptive compensatory response for pronociceptive changes in other nociceptive circuits. Future experiments could test these hypotheses.</p><p>The intrinsic excitability of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons was increased following a carrageenan-induced pain challenge, akin to the heightened excitability observed in AIE exposed rats. Intrinsic excitability is also enhanced in PrL pyramidal neurons 3–5 days after intraplantar injection with complete Freund’s adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to enhancing the excitability of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons, we observed that carrageenan also increased the amplitude of oIPSCs in Air control rats, with a blunted effect in AIE exposed rats. Despite no change in glutamate transmission at BLA inputs onto PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons, the E/I balance remained unaltered. These findings are similar to those seen in a kaolin-carrageenan arthritis model, where the amplitude of BLA-driven electrically evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs) onto PrL pyramidal neurons is significantly increased without a corresponding change in glutamate transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ji et al., 2010</xref>). These findings indicate that enhanced inhibitory transmission at PrL pyramidal neurons is a hallmark of carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain.</p><p>As with PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons, carrageenan elevated the intrinsic excitability of PVINs, albeit only at large current steps. Accompanying this elevation was enhanced E/I balance at PVINs. There was not a significant change in either oEPSC or oIPSC amplitude, suggesting subtle alterations in both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. The monosynaptic oAMPA current was enhanced at PrL PVINs, leading to an increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio of Air control rats, with a weakened effect observed in AIE exposed rats. Surprisingly, the increased oAMPA currents at PVINs did not correspond to changes in either aEPSC amplitude or interevent interval. This leaves it unclear whether the observed change in synaptic strength resulted from a modification in presynaptic release probability or postsynaptic receptor function.</p><p>The present study demonstrates that in carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain, BLA inputs onto PVINs are strengthened. This strengthening, alongside increased PVIN excitability, enhances inhibition of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons. Notably, PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neuron intrinsic excitability is increased, possibly to compensate for increased inhibitory input. Remarkably, the effects of carrageenan on synaptic function were blunted in AIE exposed rats, suggesting that AIE not only induces PVIN hypofunction but also restricts pain-induced plasticity at PVINs. Intriguingly, AIE augments the number of perineuronal net (PNN) enwrapped PVINs in the PrL cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dannenhoffer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Obray et al., 2025</xref>). As PNNs play a role in stabilizing synapses and restricting plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cornez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>), this may reduce synaptic plasticity at PrL PVINs. Surprisingly, despite restricted plasticity at BLA inputs to PVINs, there were no AIE-dependent changes in carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study examined the effects of AIE exposure and a carrageenan pain challenge on a BLA–PrL–vlPAG circuit involved in modulating the descending pain pathway. Following AIE exposure, while rats displayed enhanced mechanical sensitivity, carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia was not altered by a history of AIE exposure. In AIE exposed rats, BLA inputs to the PrL were biased toward decreased feedforward inhibition of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons. A carrageenan pain challenge increased BLA-mediated inhibitory drive onto these neurons in Air control but not AIE exposed animals. These changes suggest that AIE induces long-lasting reductions in feedforward inhibition of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons which accompany increased mechanical sensitivity. In addition to reduced feedforward inhibition, AIE may also diminish plasticity at PrL PVINs. Beyond the implications for nociception, these AIE-induced alterations in BLA–PrL–vlPAG function may impact other PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neuron-mediated behaviors such as context fear discrimination (<xref

University of South Carolina. Rats were genotyped at postnatal day (PD) 14, with only hemizygote rats included in this study. On PD 21, rat pups were weaned, same sex group-housed (2–3 per cage) and assigned to one of four treatment groups: Air-saline (<italic>n</italic> = 30), Air-carrageenan (<italic>n</italic> = 30), AIE-saline (<italic>n</italic> = 30), or AIE-carrageenan (<italic>n</italic> = 29). Rats were housed in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment on a 12/12-hr light/dark cycle, with lights off from 09:00 to 21:00 each day. Teklad 2918 (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) chow and water were provided to the rats ad libitum. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2011) and were approved by the Medical University of South Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>AIE exposure</title><p>AIE exposure was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gass et al., 2014</xref>). All rats underwent eight cycles of intermittent ethanol vapor exposure beginning at PD 28 and continuing through PD 54. Each cycle consisted of 2 days of ethanol vapor exposure separated by 2 days of no ethanol exposure. The litter-matched Air rats received the same treatment except they were not exposed to ethanol vapor. On ethanol exposure days, rats were placed in the chambers at 18:00 and removed from the chambers at 08:00 on the following day. Upon removal from the chambers, the level of intoxication of each rat was rated on the following 5-point behavioral intoxication scale: 1 = no signs of intoxication; 2 = slightly intoxicated (slight motor impairment); 3 = moderately intoxicated (obvious motor impairment but able to walk); 4 = highly intoxicated (dragging abdomen, loss of righting reflex); 5 = extremely intoxicated (loss of righting reflex, and loss of eye blink reflex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gass et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Glover et al., 2021</xref>). On the last day of each cycle, blood was collected from the tail vein and analyzed for BEC using an Analox alcohol analyzer (AM1, Analox Instruments, Stourbridge, GBR). Following the last exposure cycle, the rats remained group housed in the vivarium until undergoing surgery at ~PD 80, after which they were single housed until being sacrificed to obtain slices for experimental use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Stereotaxic surgery</title><p>Rats undergoing stereotaxic surgery were induced and maintained under a surgical plane of anesthesia using isoflurane (2–3%). Intracranial injections were performed on a Kopf rat stereotaxic instrument (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). A Micro4 (World Precision Instruments [WPI], Sarasota, FL, USA) controlled UMP3 microinjection pump (WPI) connected to a glass syringe (80100, Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) under stereotaxic control was used to inject 500 nl green retrobeads IX (Lumafluor Inc, Durham, NC) into the left vlPAG (from bregma: –8.4 mm AP, –0.7 mm ML, –6.3 mm DV), 500 nl of AAV5-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP (26973-AAV5, Addgene, Watertown, MA) into the left BLA (from bregma: –2.7 mm AP, –5.1 mm ML, –8.8 mm DV), and 750 nl of AAV2-hSyn-DIO-mCherry (50459-AAV2, Addgene) into the left PrL cortex (from bregma: +2.8 mm AP, –0.6 mm ML, –3.8 mm DV). All injections occurred at 1 nl/s with the injector remaining in place for an additional 5 min following completion of the infusion. After surgery, a minimum of 4 weeks was given to allow the rats to recover and for retrograde transport and viral expression to occur.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Assessment of mechanical and thermal sensitivity</title><p>Mechanical and thermal sensitivity were assessed using the electronic Von Frey and Hargreaves tests, respectively. During the 3 days leading up to the first assessment rats were habituated to handling. On the day before the first assessment rats were acclimated to the testing apparatuses. This acclimation session consisted of 15-min exposure to the electronic Von Frey enclosure followed by 30-min exposure to the Hargreaves enclosure. Assessments began on PD 24 prior to initiation of ethanol vapor exposure on PD 28 and continued every 7 days until PD 80. Rats that subsequently underwent stereotaxic surgery followed by 4 weeks of recovery were reassessed for pain sensitivity. This was followed by injection with 100 µl of carrageenan (C2871, Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, JPN; 1% wt/vol in saline) or saline in the right hindpaw under brief isoflurane anesthesia. Subsequent pain sensitivity tests were conducted at 2-, 6-, and 24-hr post-injection, after which rats were sacrificed to obtain slices for experimental use.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Electronic Von Frey test for mechanical allodynia</title><p>On pain sensitivity test days, rats were placed in a 17″ × 8.5″ × 10″ Plexiglas enclosure with a metal mesh floor. After a 5-min acclimation period, the mechanical sensitivity of the right hindpaw was assessed using an electronic Von Frey unit (38450, Ugo Basile, Gemonio, ITA). This consisted of placing the electronic Von Frey filament perpendicular to the plantar surface of the hindpaw and applying force until a sharp withdrawal response was elicited. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed three times per session for each rat and the average gram-force required to elicit a withdrawal response was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Hargreaves test for thermal hyperalgesia</title><p>Following assessment of allodynia, rats were placed in a 4″ × 8″ × 5.5″ plexiglass enclosure with a glass floor. After a 15-min habituation period, the right hindpaw was stimulated using an infrared emitter from Ugo Basile (37570; 60% maximum intensity) and the latency to hindpaw withdrawal was measured. A 30-s cutoff was used to prevent tissue damage in rats that were unresponsive to the thermal stimulus. In each session, the paw withdrawal latency was measured three times per rat and the average score was used to quantify the level of thermal sensitivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Acute slices were obtained from rats for electrophysiological recordings beginning at PD 110. Current-clamp experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Trantham-Davidson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trantham-Davidson et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the brain was rapidly removed and placed into ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM): 93 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 <sc>D</sc>-glucose, 20 HEPES, 2.5 C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>S, 5 ascorbic acid, 15 sucrose, 10 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Following sectioning using a Leica vibratome (VT 1200S, Wetzlar, DEU), 280 μM thick slices were incubated for at least 60 min at 34°C in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 92 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 <sc>D</sc>-glucose, 20 HEPES, 5 ascorbic acid, 10 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. After incubation, slices were transferred to a submerged recording chamber held at 34°C and constantly perfused with recording aCSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 <sc>D</sc>-glucose, 0.4 ascorbic acid, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Each of these solutions was pH adjusted (pH 7.3–7.43), with an osmolarity of 300–310 mOsm, and was continuously aerated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) connected to a Windows-PC running Axograph X software through an ITC-18 digital to analog converter (HEKA Instruments, Holliston, MA). A Sutter Instruments P-1000 micropipette puller (Novato, CA) was used to pull borosilicate glass electrodes. Tip resistances ranged from 4 to 8 MΩ. All recordings were obtained from visually identified green retrobead labeled PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons or mCherry-tagged PVINs in the left PrL. Cells were identified using a Zeiss Axio Examiner.A1 microscope (Oberkochen, DEU) equipped with a DIC filter and a filter for visualizing green retrobeads and mCherry. All internal solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4 and 285 mOsm. Series and membrane resistance were measured at the beginning and end of each recording, and if the series resistance exceeded 20 MΩ or changed by more than 10% then the cell was excluded from the analysis.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Current-clamp recordings</title><p>Electrodes were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): 125 potassium gluconate, 20 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.3 Tris-GTP, and 10 phosphocreatine. To assess intrinsic excitability, picrotoxin (100 µM) and kynurenic acid (2 mM) were added to the perfused aCSF and 1-s current steps were applied in 20 pA increments ranging from –100 to +400 pA. Recordings were digitized at 10 kHz, filtered at 2 kHz, and analyzed for the number of APs elicited by each current step.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Voltage-clamp recordings</title><p>Electrodes were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): 125 cesium methanesulfonate, 10 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.5 Tris-GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, and 1 QX-314-Cl. All voltage-clamp recordings were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Postsynaptic events were evoked by optically stimulating channelrhodopsin expressing terminals from the BLA in the PrL cortex. This involved using Axograph to trigger a 5-ms pulse of light from an MDL-III-447 diode blue laser collimated to fit the microscope. The optical stimulation intensity was varied to establish the stimulus–response relationship. Once determined, the intensity was set either to induce a half-maximal response (for E/I balance experiments) or a maximal response (for AMPA/NMDA ratio experiments).</p><p>For experiments measuring the E/I balance of optically evoked postsynaptic currents onto PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons and PrL PVINs, neurons were held at –70 mV for recordings of oEPSCs and +10 mV for recordings of oIPSCs. The peak amplitudes of the oEPSC and oIPSC events were analyzed, and their ratio (oEPSC/oIPSC) was computed.</p><p>For experiments measuring the AMPA/NMDA ratio at BLA inputs onto PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons, 1 µM TTX and 100 µM 4-AP were included in the aCSF to isolate monosynaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>). Neurons were held at +40 mV and optically evoked AMPA (oAMPA) and NMDA (oNMDA) currents were isolated using the following procedure: first, a combined oAMPA and oNMDA current was recorded in aCSF containing 100 µM picrotoxin. Subsequently, 50 µM dl-APV was added to the recording aCSF to isolate the oAMPA current. Finally, to isolate the oNMDA current, the oAMPA current was subtracted from the combined oAMPA and oNMDA current. The AMPA/NMDA ratio was then computed based on the amplitude of each current. For PrL PVINs, the same procedure was followed with one additional step – after recording the AMPA current with the cell held at +40 mV, the holding potential was lowered to –70 mV and a final oAMPA current was recorded. The AMPA/NMDA ratio was then computed using the AMPA current recorded at –70 mV and the NMDA current recorded at +40 mV. This was done as PVINs express large numbers of calcium permeable AMPA receptors.</p><p>For experiments measuring optically evoked aEPSCs, TTX (1 µM) and 4-AP (100 µM) were added to the recording aCSF and SrCl<sub>2</sub> (2 mM) was substituted for CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The substitution of strontium for calcium induces asynchronous neurotransmitter release after the initial release event. The resulting interevent interval and amplitude of the asynchronous events are commonly used to quantify pre- and postsynaptic function within defined circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi and Lovinger, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dodge et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2000</xref>).

Data were assessed for normality using the Wilks–Shapiro test and checked for outliers using the IQR rule. The experimental unit for this study was the individual animal. As such, while electrophysiological measures (e.g. E/I balance, intrinsic excitability) were obtained from multiple neurons within each animal, the data were averaged within each animal prior to analysis and reporting. Unless otherwise indicated, all data were analyzed using ANOVA models including all relevant factors. Repeated measures analyses used the Greenhouse–Geisser correction for sphericity. Post hoc tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method. All values reported are mean ± SEM.

The studies are focused on inputs from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) onto parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and pyramidal cells that project to the periaqueductal gray (PAG). The authors found that AIE increased BLA excitatory drive onto parvalbumin interneurons and increased BLA feedforward inhibition onto PAG-projecting neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Fully powered cohorts of male and female rodents are used, and the design incorporates both AIE and an acute pain model. The authors used several electrophysiological techniques to assess synaptic strength and excitability from a few complimentary angles. The design and statistical analysis are sound, and the evidence supporting synaptic changes following AIE results is convincing. The authors have also revised the Discussion to assimilate the findings within prior work out of their lab and others.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) There is incomplete evidence supporting some of the conclusions drawn in this manuscript. The authors claim the changes in feedforward inhibition onto pyramidal cells are due to the changes in parvalbumin interneurons; however, the authors did not determine that PV cells mediate the feedforward BLA op-IPSCs and changes following AIE (this would require a manipulation to reduce/block PV-IN activity). This limitation in results and interpretation is important because prior work shows BLA-PFC feedforward IPSCs can be driven by somatostatin cells. Cholecystokinin cells are also abundant basket cells in PFC and have been recently shown to mediate feedforward inhibition from thalamus and ventral hippocampus, so it's also possible that CCK cells are involved in the effects observed here</p><p>(2) The authors conclude that the changes in this circuit likely mediate long-lasting hyperalgesia, but this is not addressed experimentally. In some ways, the focused nature of the study is a benefit in this regard, as there is extensive prior literature linking this circuit with pain behaviors in alternative models (e.g., SNI), but it should be noted that these studies have not assessed hyperalgesia stemming from prior alcohol exposure. While the current studies do not include a causative behavioral manipulation, the strength of the association between BLA-PL-PAG function and hyperalgesia could be bolstered by with current data if there were relationships detected between electrophysiological properties and hyperalgesia.</p><p>(3) It should be noted that asEPSC frequency can also reflect changes in number of functional/detectable synapses. This measurement is also fairly susceptible to differences in inter-animal differences in ChR2 expression. There are other techniques for assessing presynaptic release probability (e.g., PPR, MK-801 sensitivity) that would improve the interpretation of these studies if that is intended to be a point of emphasis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101667.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Obray</surname><given-names>J Daniel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical University of South Carolina</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charleston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wilkes</surname><given-names>Erik T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical University of South Carolina</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charleston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Scofield</surname><given-names>Mike</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>MUSC</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charleston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chandler</surname><given-names>L Judson</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical University of South Carolina</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Charleston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>Major Concerns/Public Review</p><p>Comment 1: There is a mild disconnect between behavioral readout (reflexive pain) and neural circuits of interest (emotional). Considering that this circuit is likely engaged in the aversiveness of pain, it would have been interesting to see how carrageenan and/or AIE impacted non-reflexive pain measures. Perhaps this would reveal a potentiated or dysregulated phenotype that matches the neurophysiological changes reported. However, this critique does not take away from the value of the paper or its conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that including measures of non-reflexive pain would enhance future studies and potentially reveal a phenotype that is closely related to the observed changes in neurophysiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Concerns/Recommendations</p><p>Comment 1: There are a few minor grammatical errors in the text, mostly in the captions.

This information needs to be provided. If the latter, there is concern that the animals did not fully acclimate to the apparatus and handling prior to testing, which should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of the behavioral analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>The rats underwent handling once a day for three days prior to the first von Frey and Hargreaves tests. On the day prior to the first test, rats were acclimated to the von Frey and Hargreaves apparatuses.

This information has been added to the revised methods section under the assessment of mechanical and thermal sensitivity heading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3</bold>:</p><p>Major Concerns/Public Review</p><p>Comment 1: There is incomplete evidence supporting some of the conclusions drawn in this manuscript. The authors claim that the changes in feedforward inhibition onto pyramidal cells are due to the changes in parvalbumin interneurons, but evidence is not provided to support that idea. PV cells do not spontaneously fire action potentials spontaneously in slices (nor do they receive high levels of BLA activity while at rest in slices). It is possible that spontaneous GABA release from PV cells is increased after AIE but the authors did not report sIPSC frequency. Second, the authors did not determine that PV cells mediate the feedforward BLA op-IPSCs and changes following AIE (this would require manipulation to reduce/block PV-IN activity). This limitation in results and interpretation is important because prior work shows BLA-PFC feedforward IPSCs can be driven by somatostatin cells. Cholecystokinin cells are also abundant basket cells in PFC and have been recently shown to mediate feedforward inhibition from the thalamus and ventral hippocampus, so it's also possible that CCK cells are involved in the effects observed here.</p></disp-quote><p>The hypothesis that adolescent alcohol exposure could change spontaneous GABA release from PVINs is an interesting one that merits future exploration. Unfortunately, as the focus of this manuscript was on circuit-specific alterations in synaptic function, this experiment is somewhat outside the scope of the paper as sIPSCs and mIPSCs are not circuit specific measures of GABA activity and would not reflect spontaneous release from only GABA interneurons receiving input from the BLA. Despite this, a future study investigating spontaneous GABA release from PVINs in the PrL would be a valuable complement to the present study.</p><p>While we did not directly manipulate PVINs to demonstrate that decreased oIPSC amplitude at PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons following AIE is due solely to changes in PVINs, it is notable that both the intrinsic excitability of PVINs and the BLA-driven E/I balance at PVINs were reduced following AIE. These changes would be consistent with decreased PVIN output onto PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons. However, we agree that this does not preclude the possibility that changes in SST or CCK interneurons contribute to the observed decrease in BLA-driven inhibition at PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons following AIE. As such, we have altered the wording in the discussion to indicate that reduced BLA-driven feedforward inhibition of PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons may be related, at least in part, to the observed changes in PVINs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: The authors conclude that the changes in this circuit likely mediate long-lasting hyperalgesia, but this is not addressed experimentally. In some ways, the focused nature of the study is a benefit in this regard, as there is extensive prior literature linking this circuit with pain behaviors in alternative models (e.g., SNI), but it should be noted that these studies have not assessed hyperalgesia stemming from prior alcohol exposure. While the current studies do not include a causative behavioral manipulation, the strength of the association between BLA-PL-PAG function and hyperalgesia could be bolstered by current data if there were relationships detected between electrophysiological properties and hyperalgesia. Have the authors assessed this? In addition, this study is limited by not addressing the specificity of synaptic adaptations to the BLA-PL-PAG circuit. For instance, PL neurons send reciprocal projections to BLA and send direct projections to the locus coeruleus (which the authors note is an important downstream node of the PAG for regulating pain).</p></disp-quote><p>We have not assessed correlations between the electrophysiological properties and hyperalgesia. We feel that future studies using DREADDs to perform cell-type and circuit-specific manipulations can better address the involvement of this circuitry in long-lasting hyperalgesia following AIE. With respect to the circuit specificity of the observed changes, we have previously evaluated the effects of AIE on pyramidal neurons projecting from the PrL to the BLA (PrL<sup>BLA</sup>). We found that following AIE exposure there was no change in the intrinsic excitability of these neurons. In addition, the amplitude and frequency of sEPSCs and sIPSCs onto PrL<sup>BLA</sup> neurons was unchanged. While these results did not assess whether the BLA-PrL-BLA circuit undergoes synaptic adaptations similar to those observed in the BLA-PrL-vlPAG circuit, it is notable that the intrinsic excitability of PrL<sup>BLA</sup> neurons was unchanged following AIE exposure. This indicates that the effects of AIE on the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PrL may be circuit specific. We agree that it would be interesting to study the effect of AIE on PrL neurons that project to the locus coeruleus, however due to the well-defined role of the BLA-PrL-vlPAG circuit in pain we chose to evaluate this circuit first.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: I have some concerns about methodology. First, 5-ms is a long light pulse for optogenetics and might induce action-potential independent release. Does TTX alone block op-EPSCs under these conditions? Second, PV cells express a high degree of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, which display inward rectification at positive holding potentials due to blockade from intracellular polyamines. Typically, this is controlled/promoted by including spermine in the internal solution, but I do not believe the authors did that. Nonetheless, the relatively low A/N ratios for this cell type suggest that CP-AMPA receptors were not sampled with the +40/+40 design of this experiment, raising concerns that the majority of AMPA receptors in these cells were not sampled during this experiment. Finally, it should be noted that asEPSC frequency can also reflect changes in a number of functional/detectable synapses. This measurement is also fairly susceptible to differences in inter-animal differences in ChR2 expression. There are other techniques for assessing presynaptic release probability (e.g., PPR, MK-801 sensitivity) that would improve the interpretation of these studies if that is intended to be a point of emphasis.</p></disp-quote><p>When we included TTX but not 4-AP we did not observe any optically evoked responses, so we don’t believe that the 5-ms pulse induced action-potential independent release in these experiments. With respect to the second point, we did not include spermine in the internal solution for the AMPA/NMDA recordings in PVINs, and it is possible that endogenous polyamines interfered with recording CP-AMPA receptors in the +40/+40 design. To address this concern, we recalculated the AMPA/NMDA ratio for PVINs using data from an optically evoked AMPA current that was collected while holding the cell at -70 mV. This data was collected at the end of the +40/+40 recording protocol as we were interested in assessing whether there would be any difference in the ratio of the +40/-70 AMPA current across treatment conditions. As there were no observed difference in the +40/-70 AMPA current ratio across treatment groups, we had originally used the +40 AMPA current for calculating the AMPA/NMDA ratio for PVINs to make the methods for calculating this ratio uniform for both PVINs and PrL<sup>PAG</sup> neurons. The methods, results, and Fig. 10 have been updated to reflect the recalculated AMPA/NMDA ratio for PVINs. Notably, only the significance of the AIE x carrageenan interaction was altered by the change in the way the AMPA/NMDA ratio was calculated. Originally, this interaction displayed a trend toward significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0501), however when the recalculated AMPA/NMDA ratio was analyzed this interaction term became significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0131). We have also added the +40/-70 AMPA ratio to figure 10 as it might be of interest.</p><p>Finally, the point regarding aEPSC frequency reflecting not only release probability but also the number of functional/detectable synapses is an important consideration. For this manuscript, we intentionally selected aEPSC frequency for this reason. As the BLA to PrL projection continues to mature during adolescence, the number of BLA contacts onto GABA neurons in the PrL increases. Thus, we thought that it was possible that AIE would alter the number of detectable BLA inputs onto PVINs. We acknowledge that as this measure is sensitive to differences in ChR2 expression between animals/slices it can be difficult to interpret. We also agree that in the future it would be beneficial to include either PPR or MK-801 sensitivity to improve interpretability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: In a few places in the manuscript, results following voluntary drinking experiments (especially Salling et al. and Sicher et al.) are discussed without clear distinction from prior work in vapor models of dependence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered the manuscript to specifically note where voluntary drinking was used rather than vapor models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: Discussion (lines 416-420). The authors describe some differing results with the literature and mention that the maximum current injection might be a factor. To me, this does not seem like the most important factor and potentially undercuts the relevance of the findings. Are the cells undergoing a depolarization block? Did the authors observe any changes in the rheobase or AP threshold? On the other hand, a more likely difference between this and previous work is that the proportion of PAG-projecting cells is relatively low, so previous work in L5 likely sampled many types of pyramidal cells that project to other areas. This is a key example where additional studies by the current group assessing a distinct or parallel set of pyramidal cells would aid in the interpretation of these results and help to place them within the existing literature. Along these lines, PAG-projecting neurons are Type A cells with significant hyperpolarization sag. Previous studies showed that adolescent binge drinking stunts the development of HCN channel function and ensuing hyperpolarization sag. Have the authors observed this in PAG-projecting cells? Another interesting membrane property worth exploring with the existing data set is the afterhyperpolarization / SK channel function.</p></disp-quote><p>In discussing the maximum current injection as a factor in differing results on intrinsic excitability, we were principally considering how the additional data points increase the power of the analysis and thus the likelihood of detecting an effect. In focusing on this, however, we ignored other relevant and interesting factors that we should also have discussed. Additional analyses examining HCN and SK channel function have now been added to the manuscript and incorporated into the results section under the heading Adolescent Intermittent Ethanol Exposure and Carrageenan Enhanced the Intrinsic Excitability of Prelimbic Neurons Projecting to the Ventrolateral Periaqueductal Gray.
