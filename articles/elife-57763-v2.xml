inhibits infection with both HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped viruses by reducing virion incorporation of envelope glycoproteins. The molecular mechanisms by which MARCH8 targets envelope glycoproteins remain unknown. Here, we show two different mechanisms by which MARCH8 inhibits viral infection. Viruses pseudotyped with the VSV-G mutant, in which cytoplasmic lysine residues were mutated, were insensitive to the inhibitory effect of MARCH8, whereas those with a similar lysine mutant of HIV-1 Env remained sensitive to it. Indeed, the wild-type VSV-G, but not its lysine mutant, was ubiquitinated by MARCH8. Furthermore, the MARCH8 mutant, which had a disrupted cytoplasmic tyrosine motif that is critical for intracellular protein sorting, did not inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated infection, while it still impaired infection by VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses. Overall, we conclude that MARCH8 reduces viral infectivity by downregulating envelope glycoproteins through two different mechanisms mediated by a ubiquitination-dependent or tyrosine motif-dependent pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>MARCH8</kwd><kwd>envelope</kwd><kwd>antiviral factor</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>tyrosine motif</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18K07156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tokunaga</surname><given-names>Kenzo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The host transmembrane protein MARCH8, previously known as an expression regulator of host proteins, is a powerful antiviral host factor with a potentially broad antiviral spectrum through two different mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) 8 is one of 11 members of the MARCH family of RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases, which consist of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT) domain containing a C4HC3 RING finger (RING-CH finger) motif, two transmembrane (TM) domains, between which a short ectodomain is located, and a C-terminal CT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goto et al., 2003</xref>). MARCH8 downregulates a variety of cellular transmembrane proteins, such as MHC-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ohmura-Hoshino et al., 2006</xref>), CD86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Tze et al., 2011</xref>), CD81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartee et al., 2010</xref>), CD44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eyster et al., 2011</xref>), TRAIL receptor 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">van de Kooij et al., 2013</xref>), CD98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eyster et al., 2011</xref>), IL-1 receptor accessory protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), and transferrin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>). We have recently reported that MARCH8 reduces HIV-1 infectivity by downregulating HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) from the cell surface, resulting in a reduced incorporation of Env into virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Tada et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein (VSV-G) was even more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of MARCH8. In the case of HIV-1 Env, it is retained intracellularly without degradation after cell-surface downregulation. In contrast, VSV-G is not only downregulated from the cell surface but also undergoes lysosomal degradation by MARCH8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Tada et al., 2015</xref>). In this regard, we hypothesized that VSV-G, whose cytoplasmic tail is lysine-rich (5 out of 29 amino acids), could be readily ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 and therefore undergo lysosomal degradation, whereas HIV-1 Env carries only two lysines (out of 151 amino acids) in its cytoplasmic tail and may rarely undergo degradation after being trapped by MARCH8. In this study, we created lysine mutants of both HIV-1 Env and VSV-G, together with newly generated MARCH8 mutants to explore the hypothesis described above. The results with these mutants show that MARCH8 targets HIV-1 Env and VSV-G by two different inhibitory mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We have recently reported that MARCH8 inhibits lentiviral infection by reducing virion incorporation of both HIV-1 Env and VSV-G in a RING-CH domain-dependent manner. Because the RING-CH domain is known to be essential for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of MARCH8, we asked whether these envelope glycoproteins are susceptible to MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination. To investigate this, we first created the VSV-G mutant CT5K/R in which five arginine residues were introduced in place of cytoplasmic lysine residues that could be ubiquitination targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper). We also generated the HIV-1 Env gp41 mutant CT2K/R harboring two arginines in place of the cytoplasmic lysines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower). Then, we prepared HIV-1 luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with the mutant envelope glycoproteins (VSV-G CT5K/R and HIV-1 Env CT2K/R) from 293T cells transiently expressing MARCH8, and compared their viral infectivity with that of control viruses pseudotyped with wild-type (WT) envelope glycoproteins. The infectivity of viruses harboring either VSV-G CT5K/R or HIV-1 gp41 Env CT2K/R was almost comparable to WT-enveloped viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). As expected, the virus pseudotyped with VSV-G CT5K/R was completely resistant to MARCH8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, the HIV-1 Env CT2K/R-pseudotyped virus was still susceptible to the inhibitory effect of MARCH8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with these results, immunofluorescence staining showed that the five lysine mutations in the CT domain of VSV-G conferred resistance to MARCH8-mediated intracellular degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), whereas the two lysine mutations in the CT domain of HIV-1 Env had no effect on its cell-surface downregulation by MARCH8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). It should be noted that MARCH8-resistant VSV-G CT5K/R colocalized with MARCH8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We thus speculated that MARCH8 ubiquitinates lysine residues of VSV-G but not of HIV-1 Env at their CT domains. Importantly, in the presence of MARCH8, HIV-1 Env preferentially colocalized with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with our previous hypothesis that MARCH8 might sequester HIV-1 Env in the TGN without degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Tada et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MARCH8 targets and ubiquitinates cytoplasmic lysine residues of VSV-G but not of HIV-1 Env.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic structure of the lysine mutants of VSV-G (CT5K/R; upper) and HIV-1 Env (CT2K/R; lower).

In cells coexpressing WT HA-MARCH8, VSV-G was efficiently ubiquitinated, whereas in cells coexpressing the RING-CH mutant of HA-MARCH8, the ubiquitination of VSV-G was lost. More importantly, the VSV-G lysine mutant CT5K/R did not undergo MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that the lysine residues at the CT domain of VSV-G are specifically ubiquitinated by MARCH8. These findings are consistent with the immunofluorescence results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). We therefore conclude that lysine residues at the CT domain of VSV-G are ubiquitinated by MARCH8, which determines the difference in the MARCH8-mediated intracellular fate between these viral glycoproteins.</p><p>Because unlike VSV-G, HIV-1 Env was retained intracellularly without degradation, as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Tada et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that these viral envelope glycoproteins might undergo endocytosis with different mechanisms of action. It has been reported that another MARCH family member, MARCH11, has a conserved tyrosine-based motif, YXXϕ, which is known to be recognized by the adaptor protein (AP) μ-subunits in the C-terminal CT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Morokuma et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore looked for the same motif(s) in MARCH8 and found the <sup>222</sup>YxxL<sup>225</sup> and <sup>232</sup>YxxV<sup>235</sup> sequences in the CT domain at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Based on this finding, we generated tyrosine motif mutants of MARCH8, in which either <sup>222</sup>Y or <sup>232</sup>Y was mutated to alanine (designated <sup>222</sup>AxxL<sup>225</sup> or <sup>232</sup>AxxV<sup>235</sup>). The protein expression in cells transfected with each MARCH8 plasmid was confirmed by immunoblotting using an anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Then, we examined whether these YXXϕ motifs are important for the antiviral activity of MARCH8.

Therefore, by performing a β-lactamase (BlaM)-fused viral protein R (Vpr)-based entry assay, we first focused on whether the loss of function of <sup>222</sup>AxxL<sup>225</sup> MARCH8 against HIV-1 Env but not VSV-G would indeed be due to the loss of its inhibitory activity on viral entry. Whereas the entry of VSV-G–pseudotyped HIV-1 prepared from cells expressing either WT or <sup>222</sup>AxxL<sup>225</sup> MARCH8 was reduced compared with that of the control virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the inhibition of the entry of whole HIV-1 virions was abrogated in viruses produced from cells expressing <sup>222</sup>AxxL<sup>225</sup>, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We further analyzed whether this motif of MARCH8 is indeed involved in the reduced virion incorporation of HIV-1 Env, which results from its cell-surface downregulation. To address this, we conducted flow cytometric analysis and quantified the levels of cell-surface and intracellular expression of Env glycoproteins. In accordance with the results obtained in infectivity assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), <sup>222</sup>AxxL<sup>225</sup> MARCH8 still reduced intracellular VSV-G expression as well as WT MARCH8 did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). On the other hand, the mutant MARCH8 had a completely abrogated ability to downregulate cell-surface HIV-1 Env, whereas WT expression led to the downregulation of HIV-1 Env from the cell surface and its intracellular retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), as we previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The results were consistent with those of the inhibitory activity of MARCH8 against the virion incorporation of HIV-1 Env (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). We therefore conclude that <sup>222</sup>YxxL<sup>225</sup> is critical for the MARCH8-mediated downregulation of HIV-1 Env but not VSV-G, which results in its reduced virion incorporation leading to impaired viral entry.</p><p>In summary, we first show the two different mechanisms by which MARCH8 inhibits viral infections, one being a ubiquitin-dependent downregulation that mediates lysosomal degradation of VSV-G whose cytoplasmic lysine residues are recognized by the RING-CH domain of MARCH8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, left), and the other, a YxxΦ motif-dependent downregulation that could explain the intracellular retention of HIV-1 Env in the TGN without degradation after cell-surface downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, right). In terms of the latter mechanism, although this could be attributed to the AP-dependent trafficking that requires the YxxΦ motif, which binds to AP μ-subunits, our preliminary results were unable to show the interaction between these subunits and MARCH8, due to technical difficulties in detecting specific bands in our IP/western blotting assays. We have recently reported that MARCH1 and MARCH2 are also antiviral MARCH family members that inhibit HIV-1 infection, although their antiviral activity is less robust, which is probably due to the lower protein expression and/or stability than that of MARCH8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Because MARCH1 and MARCH2 also harbor the Yxxϕ motif in their C-terminal CT domains, it would be intriguing to verify the importance of the motif in these proteins. It should be noted that in this study, we tested either HIV-1 Env or VSV-G derived from a single representative strain, which is a limitation of our present findings. Nevertheless, the present findings are consistent with our previous studies showing that MARCH8-induced downregulation of VSV-G leads to lysosomal degradation, while that of HIV-1 Env results in intracellular retention without degradation. In this context, the reason why VSV infection in human is always subclinical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hanson et al., 1950</xref>) could be explained at least in part by the observation that VSV-G is completely inactivated even by lower levels of MARCH8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Tada et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, in the case of HIV-1 infection, it is intriguing to postulate that the virus might rather take advantage of infection of macrophages enriched with MARCH8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Tada et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) as an ideal hideout, in which the virus could escape from immunosurveillance potentially due to the MARCH8-induced downregulation of Env from the cell surface. Overall, we conclude that MARCH8 targets HIV-1 Env and VSV-G by two different inhibitory mechanisms (either ubiquitin-dependent or YxxΦ motif-dependent downregulation). Further investigations will clarify the more detailed host defense mechanisms of this protein.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of two different molecular mechanisms by which MARCH8 inhibits viral infection.</title><p><italic>Left</italic>, MARCH8 (red) downregulates VSV-G (violet) in a ubiquitin-dependent manner.

The tyrosine motif located in the C-terminal CT of MARCH8 likely interacts with the adaptor protein μ-subunits (navy) (if this is the case with μ2 or μ1, clathrin (brown) is involved in this step), resulting in the intracellular retention of HIV-1 Env in the TGN without degradation. It should be noted that the downregulation of these viral glycoproteins might not necessarily occur at the plasma membrane. The nucleus and other organelles are not shown.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57763-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>The Env-deficient HIV-1 proviral indicator construct pNL-Luc2-E(-), HIV-1 Gag-Pol expression plasmid pC-GagPol-RRE, HIV-1 Env-expression vector pC-NLenv, HIV-1 Rev expression plasmid pCa-Rev, VSV-G expression plasmid pC-VSVg and its C-terminally T7-epitope-tagged version pVSVg-T7E, GFP expression plasmid pCa-EGFP, Vpr/β-lactamase (BlaM) expression plasmid pMM310, and MARCH8 expression plasmid either pC-MARCH8 or pC-HA-MARCH8 and its RING-CH mutant pC-HA-MARCH8-CS have previously been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Iwabu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Tada et al., 2015</xref>).

The study demonstrates that while MARCH8 downregulates the envelope protein of HIV, it does not degrade this HIV protein. This is in contrast to VSV-G, where MARCH8 downregulates the viral envelope protein and degrades it. The study illustrates a differential mechanisms of antiviral inhibition for the same host protein with different viruses.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;MARCH8 inhibits viral infection by two different mechanisms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>This manuscript follows earlier findings (Tada et al., 2015) in which they identified MARCH8 as a novel antiviral factor that inhibited VSV-G and HIV-1 Envelope to differing degrees. In the present manuscript, the authors revisit the antiviral activity of MARCH8, which has been found to downregulate several cellular transmembrane proteins. In this study the authors show that MARCH8 reduces cell surface Envelope via two pathways: ubiquitination and internalization via tyrosine motif. They show through viral entry, ubiquitination, and immunofluorescence assays that MARCH8 inhibits VSV-G through ubiquitination of its lysine residues, whereas HIV-1 is inhibited by MARCH8 through a conserved cytoplasmic tyrosine motif critical for intracellular protein sorting. This study suggest that the conserved antiviral function of MARCH8 is mediated by different mechanisms for these two viruses.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study of Zhang et al. reports differences in the mechanism of MARCH8 antiviral effects on HIV versus VSV-G. The study follows from a 2015 Nature Medicine paper showing that MARCH8 inhibits HIV replication by reducing the levels of Env on the cell and virus surface. The present study extends this work to show that while MARCH8 downregulates HIV Env, it does not degrade ENV. This is in contrast to VSV-G, where MARCH8 downregulates the viral protein and degrades it. They show evidence that the viral envelope proteins might undergo endocytosis differently, one being ubiquitin dependent the other dependent on a tyrosine motif. The study illustrates a differential mechanisms of antiviral inhibition for the same host protein with different viruses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors conclude that VSV-G and HIV Env are targeted by two mechanisms of MARCH8 that are substantially different. This conclusion would be strengthened and the impact of the manuscript would be increased if the authors provided a better mechanistic understanding of how March 8 affects the two viral proteins differently. The major conclusions do require a modest amount of additional new data to be fully supported. The major conclusion of this publication is that MARCH8 reduces cell-surface and virion incorporation of HIV-1 Envelope. In contrast, MARCH8 downregulates VSV glycoprotein from cell-surface and degrades it via ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The mechanistic details behind the fate of HIV-1 Envelope are lacking. Since the substantive claim of the manuscript is the distinctive mechanism(s) by which MARCH8 exhibits its antiviral effects on HIV-1 and VSV – it is necessary that at least the following comment be addressed:</p><p>The loss of cell surface localization of HIV-1 Envelope upon MARCH8 overexpression is striking. However, as presented, the details regarding intracellular retention of HIV-1 Env are not clear. This is an essential claim of this study and thus it is recommended that microscopy experiments be performed to elucidate this mechanism: where is HIV-1 Env being sorted? This can be easily done by performing colocalization staining with known intracellular compartment markers.</p><p>Overall, the mechanism by which MARCH-8 internalizes HIV Env is under-developed. The observation that the tyrosine at position 222 is required is interesting. It is tempting to speculate that one or more AP complexes are involved, but the authors state their preliminary data, which they do not show, does not support this hypothesis. Despite this, in their model they still speculate that AP complexes are involved. The contradictory statements are very confusing.</p><p>The authors also need to explain how the levels of MARCH8 expression levels in their system compare to endogenous levels in HIV target cells. Over expression studies are notorious for artifacts and if the levels are higher, this must be noted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57763.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors conclude that VSV-G and HIV Env are targeted by two mechanisms of MARCH8 that are substantially different.

As suggested, we performed colocalization staining by using an antibody against the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker TGN46, and found that in the presence of MARCH8, HIV-1 Env preferentially colocalized with TGN46, suggesting that MARCH8 can sequester HIV-1 Env in the TGN without degradation, as we previously hypothesized. We have added the data in Figure 1F, and the related text in the first paragraph of the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the mechanism by which MARCH-8 internalizes HIV Env is under-developed.

We apologize for the confusion caused by our statements concerning the possible binding of MARCH8’s YxxΦ motif with AP μ-subunits, which sound contradictory. The reason why we could not see the interaction between AP μ-subunits and MARCH8 in our preliminary data was not based on the results obtained under established conditions, but rather based on those due to the technical difficulties in detecting specific bands in our IP/Western blotting assays. We have therefore amended the related text in the last paragraph of the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also need to explain how the levels of MARCH8 expression levels in their system compare to endogenous levels in HIV target cells.

Here in this study, we used an aforementioned optimized amount of MARCH8 plasmid for transfection of 293T cells throughout the experiments. We have added the related text in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Viral infectivity assays”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
