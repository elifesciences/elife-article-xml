mechanical stresses caused by peristalsis of its variable content. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal epithelium, we investigate the role of vinculin, one of the best characterised mechanoeffectors, which functions in both cadherin and integrin adhesion complexes. We discovered that vinculin regulates cell fate decisions, by preventing precocious activation and differentiation of intestinal progenitors into absorptive cells. It achieves this in concert with α-catenin at sites of cadherin adhesion, rather than as part of integrin function. Following asymmetric division of the stem cell into a stem cell and an enteroblast (EB), the two cells initially remain connected by adherens junctions, where vinculin is required, only on the EB side, to maintain the EB in a quiescent state and inhibit further divisions of the stem cell. By manipulating cell tension, we show that vinculin recruitment to adherens junction regulates EB activation and numbers. Consequently, removing vinculin results in an enlarged gut with improved resistance to starvation. Thus, mechanical regulation at the contact between stem cells and their progeny is used to control tissue cell number.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mechanical changes in the environment have recently emerged as important signals of cell division and production of specialised cell types. Exactly how these forces are sensed and contribute to this process in living tissues, however, remains unclear.</p><p>This question is particularly relevant in the lining of the gut. Endlessly exposed to intense mechanical stress and the passage of food, this tissue must constantly heal and renew itself. The intestinal cells that absorb nutrients from food, for example, are continually replaced as older cells are lost. This is made possible by immature ‘progenitor’ cells in the intestine dividing and maturing into various specialised cells – including fully functional absorptive cells – upon receiving the right mechanical and chemical signals. Errors in this carefully regulated process can result in too many or too few cells of the correct kind being produced, potentially leading to disease.</p><p>To explore how mechanical forces may help to control the renewal and maturation of new intestinal cells, Bohère et al. examined the role of vinculin in the guts of fruit flies (where cell fate decisions involve mechanisms largely similar to humans). Vinculin can regulate cell fate, sense mechanical forces, and interact with the complex structures that physically connect cells to each other.</p><p>Genetically altered flies that lacked vinculin had enlarged guts containing many more absorptive cells than those of normal flies, suggesting that the vinculin protein prevents over-production of these cells. Further experiments revealed that vinculin worked exclusively in the precursors of absorptive cells, keeping them in an immature state until new mature absorptive cells were required. This was achieved by vinculin acting upon – and potentially strengthening – the junctions connecting cells together. Finally, increasing the force within cells was shown to facilitate vinculin recruitment to these junctions.</p><p>This study clarifies the role that mechanical forces at the interface between cells play in controlling when and how intestinal progenitors mature in an organism. If these findings are confirmed in mammals, Bohère et al. hope that they could inform how tissues cope with the changing mechanical landscape associated with ageing and inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vinculin</kwd><kwd>intestinal homeostasis</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship (206208/Z/17/Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kolahgar</surname><given-names>Golnar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD student studentship (102175/B/13/Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eldridge-Thomas</surname><given-names>Buffy L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sir Henry Dale Fellowship to GK(206208/Z/17/Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bohere</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In the intestine for example, where the rate of tissue turnover is high, uncompensated cell loss can result in chronic inflammation, whereas over-proliferation and mis-differentiation can produce adenomas that constitute a sensitised background for tumour initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehart and Clevers, 2019</xref>). Hence, elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating cell renewal and fate acquisition will help further our understanding of fundamental rules governing tissue homeostasis and might open avenues for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>In the mammalian intestine, a combination of locally secreted and membrane-bound proteins regulates cell fate decisions across the crypt–villus axis through the activation of key signal transduction pathways, including Wnt and Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehart and Clevers, 2019</xref>). There is also an increased appreciation of a potential role of mechanical cues from surrounding cells – through cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion protein complexes – in regulating cell fate determination, as observed in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wickström and Niessen, 2018</xref>). Although mechanosensing of the extracellular matrix is currently under investigation in intestinal organoid cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gjorevski et al., 2016</xref>), the regulation of intestinal cell fate by adhesion complexes is in general poorly understood compared to canonical signalling pathways. At adherens junctions between neighbouring epithelial cells, transmembrane E-cadherin proteins engage in homophilic adhesion via their extracellular domain, and indirectly associate with the cytoskeleton by the recruitment of β-catenin via their intracellular domain, which can interact with various actin-binding proteins including α-catenin. Heterodimeric transmembrane proteins integrins and their associated proteins, including talin, contribute to focal adhesions at cell–matrix junctions, thus linking extracellular ligands to cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hynes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the intestine, as well as other mature renewing epithelia, an outstanding question is how mechanical forces are locally integrated and interpreted to fine-tune proliferation and differentiation. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> for example, genetic ablation of integrins in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) prevents overproliferation following over-activation of growth factor signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). However, why integrins are required for proliferation remains unsolved. Characterising <italic>in vivo</italic> the function of junction-associated intracellular proteins capable of responding to mechanical forces through change of conformation and activity might illuminate how mechanotransduction contributes to the regulation of tissue homeostasis.</p><p>One candidate of interest is the highly conserved actin-binding protein vinculin, as it is capable of stabilising both adherens junctions and focal adhesions under tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bays and DeMali, 2017</xref>) and of regulating cell fate decisions in cell culture models and <italic>in vivo</italic> in the mouse skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kuroda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biswas et al., 2021</xref>). Vinculin protein consists of a head and a tail domain separated by a linker region. In cells, vinculin transits from a closed, auto-inhibited inactive conformation (whereby the head and tail domains interact with each other, preventing further protein–protein interactions), to an open, active conformation initiated by force-dependent protein unfolding (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carisey and Ballestrem, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bays and DeMali, 2017</xref>), that enables the vinculin tail domain to bind F-actin. The head domain can bind <underline>v</underline>inculin-<underline>b</underline>inding <underline>s</underline>ites (VBS) present in other proteins (including α-catenin and talin). Notably, intracellular tension induces conformational changes in α-catenin and talin, exposing their cryptic VBS and initiating vinculin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">del Rio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yao et al., 2014</xref>). This allows a transition of vinculin into an open conformation able to bind to the actin cytoskeleton, in turn enabling adhesion complexes to withstand higher forces in cells under tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">le Duc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dumbauld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thomas et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, vinculin is one of the best characterised mechanoeffectors, as mechanical force on both talin and α-catenin is converted into differential vinculin recruitment.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, loss of <italic>vinculin</italic> is embryonic lethal in mice due to defects in neural tube closure and heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 1998</xref>).

Conditional <italic>vinculin</italic> knock-out in the mouse skin epidermis revealed a dispensable role in reinforcing newly formed adherens junctions in the stratified epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rübsam et al., 2017</xref>), and a more prominent role in maintaining stem cells in a quiescent state via stabilisation of adherens junctions and contact inhibition in the hair follicle bulge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biswas et al., 2021</xref>). The variety of phenotypes observed so far among different tissues and organisms suggest that vinculin functions in a highly context-specific manner, and thus, characterising its contribution to tissue homeostasis in multiple systems is required to improve our understanding of mechanotransduction.</p><p>The role of vinculin in epithelial maintenance and stem cell lineage decisions is unknown in the intestine. Here, we investigate <italic>in vivo</italic> the role of vinculin in the maintenance of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine, a relatively simple model of homeostatic adult epithelium used for its genetic tractability (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miguel-Aliaga et al., 2018</xref>). In this system, resident stem cells are scattered among differentiated absorptive and secretory cells and respond to conserved signalling transduction pathways to, respectively, divide and differentiate. Upon cell division, ISCs self-renew and produce precursor cells able to differentiate into either secretory enteroendocrine cells (EEs) or large absorptive enterocytes (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISCs and their undifferentiated daughter cells, enteroblasts (EBs), are collectively called progenitor cells and express the transcription factor <italic>escargot</italic> (<italic>esg</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As EBs differentiate into ECs, through changes in gene expression, cells develop membrane protrusions and adopt a migratory phenotype, allowing them to move between cells; EBs also progressively increase in cell volume, resulting in an extended contact area on the basal side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>).

With the goal of uncovering intracellular factors mediating integrin function in stem cells, we investigated the role of two integrin-associated mechanosensing proteins, talin and vinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atherton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klapholz and Brown, 2017</xref>).

The role of vinculin, which is expressed ubiquitously in the gut and localises to cell–matrix and cell–cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>), has not been characterised in the adult intestine. We used RNA interference to downregulate β-PS integrin, talin and vinculin in <italic>esg-</italic>expressing progenitor cells visualised with green fluorescent protein (GFP).

One possible explanation would be that instead of dividing predominantly asymmetrically to maintain one stem cell and produce one daughter EB cell with Notch signalling active, as described in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">O’Brien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Navascués et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guisoni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu and Jasper, 2019</xref>), ISCs may more frequently divide symmetrically in <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> tissues, producing two EBs with Notch signalling active. Another possibility would be that EBs continuously signal to ISCs to divide more: this way, even a relatively smaller number of ISCs in the tissue would produce more differentiating cells. This type of feedback has been described for EBs undergoing maturation, thus we sought to identify maturing EBs. Under normal conditions, diploid EBs remain dormant after production, until in response to tissue demand, they activate signalling programmes leading to their maturation, migration, endoreplication, and differentiation into ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhai et al., 2017</xref>). To distinguish between dormant and activated EBs, we measured the nuclear size of ISCs (Dl<sup>+</sup>), EBs (<italic>NRE-lacZ</italic><sup>+</sup>), and ECs (Dl<sup>−</sup><italic>NRE-lacZ<sup>−</sup></italic> and polyploid), as a proxy of the degree of differentiation, which involves cells becoming increasingly polyploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In control tissues, EBs were distributed in two groups (see <italic>yw</italic> violin plots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), with dormant and activated cells corresponding to smaller and bigger nuclei/cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the large majority of <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> EBs had bigger nuclei, suggesting reduced numbers of cells were in the dormant stage in the absence of <italic>vinc</italic>. We also noted that most ECs in <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> guts had smaller nuclei compared to <italic>yw</italic> guts, suggesting incomplete maturation of ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>These cellular behaviours could be due to global changes for example resulting from tissue interactions in homozygous mutant flies, therefore, we generated GFP-labelled control, homozygous <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> mutant or <italic>vinc</italic>-RNAi-expressing mitotic clones derived from a single stem cell and compared the size and composition of multicellular clones. We did not detect differences in overall clone size, indicating that similar numbers of cells were produced from a single stem cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We noted however that the proportion of Dl<sup>+</sup> ISCs was reduced in <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> mutant or <italic>vinc</italic>-RNAi-expressing clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>), with some clones devoid of Dl staining (see Zooms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, despite having fewer stem cells in the absence of vinculin, clones can grow to comparable sizes to control clones, indicating stem cells must have divided more frequently. The presence of clones devoid of Dl<sup>+</sup> stem cells supports the possibility that mitotic events producing two differentiated daughter cells may occur more frequently in the absence of vinculin, as suggested from data in <italic>vinc</italic> homozygous tissues. As the clones contained comparable proportions of EEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but higher ratios of cells with bigger nuclei (indicative of EB maturation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), it suggested that vinculin might control EB numbers, at the expense of the ISC population.</p><p>Together with our previous results showing that stem cell divisions increase upon <italic>vinc</italic> knockdown in ISCs+EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), but that <italic>vinc</italic> knockdown in ISCs had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we hypothesised that vinculin in EB cell autonomously controls differentiation, and non-cell autonomously regulate ISC proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Vinculin maintains EBs in a quiescent state</title><p>To evaluate the role of vinculin in EBs, we compared loss of vinculin in both ISCs and EBs (<italic>esg<sup>+</sup> &gt; VincRNAi</italic>) versus EBs only (<italic>klu<sup>+</sup> &gt; VincRNAi</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korzelius et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reiff et al., 2019</xref>).

As before we used the ReDDM lineage timer to measure the degree of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Guts rescued by co-expression of full-length α-catenin (α-Cat FL) were indistinguishable from wild-type controls (expression of ReDDM only in <italic>esg<sup>+</sup></italic>), with similar rates of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). In contrast, co-expression of α-catenin constructs with the VBS deleted (α-Cat ΔM1a and ΔM1b), failed to rescue EBs accumulation (although intriguingly, we noted a milder phenotype with α-Cat ΔM1b). Deleting the adjacent M2 domain did not impair the ability of α-catenin to rescue this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). We next tested the role of the vinculin/α-catenin interaction in ISCs or EBs by co-expressing <italic>α-Cat RNAi</italic> and α-Cat ΔM1a and observed that the absence of VBS in α-catenin has no effect in ISCs but promotes EB differentiation and increase in numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that vinculin represses activation of a pool of EC precursors via its interaction with α-catenin. This suggests a model where vinculin, in its open, active form, contributes to keeping cellular junctions of EBs under tension, and this keeps the cells in a dormant state. In the absence of vinculin (or as the protein switches back to a closed, inactive conformation), EB junctions may destabilise faster, facilitating the transition from a dormant to an activated, migratory EB state and further differentiation into ECs. In support of this model, EB-specific knockdown of E-cadherin (<italic>Drosophila shotgun</italic>, <italic>shg</italic>) and α-catenin triggered faster differentiation (shown after 3 days of RNAi expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, as longer expression with Klu-Gal4 compromised fly survival). Since vinculin could in principle have a role at both cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>), we also tested the role of integrin-mediated adhesion in EBs and found that integrin and talin also contribute to EB differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, both adhesion machineries are required in the EB–EC differentiation step, with a clear role for vinculin/α-catenin in EBs only, and additional roles for integrin/talin in ISC maintenance. It will be important in future to resolve how these adhesion machineries cooperate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Vinculin links cellular tension to EB differentiation</title><p>As vinculin is a well-known mechanosensor, and we showed its function in homeostasis depends on its open active form, we next examined whether vinculin in EBs responds to changes in mechanical tension. To alter the cortical tension of progenitor cells, we modulated myosin II activity. <italic>Drosophila</italic> myosin II is composed of two regulatory light chains and a heavy chain, encoded, respectively, by <italic>spaghetti-squash</italic> (<italic>sqh</italic>), <italic>myosin light chain-cytoplasmic</italic> (<italic>mlc-c</italic>), and <italic>zipper</italic> (<italic>zip</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franke et al., 2006</xref>). The activity of myosin II can be elevated experimentally by expression of a phospho-mimetic, active, form of Sqh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mitonaka et al., 2007</xref>). Expression for 14 days resulted in small round progenitor cells (similar to dormant EBs described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>), that remained undifferentiated in control guts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead, RNAi-mediated downregulation of <italic>sqh</italic> or <italic>zip</italic> (predicted to reduce cell contractility) mildly increased differentiation rates, and many EBs cells changed shape and were visibly more advanced towards EC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), reminiscent of the semi-differentiated status of <italic>vincRNAi</italic>-expressing EBs. These results show that altering cell contractility directly impacts progenitor differentiation. We then asked how cellular tension affects vinculin in EBs. Expression of Sqh<sup>DD</sup> in <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> progenitor cells did not prevent the accelerated differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>), suggesting that vinculin acts downstream of cellular contractility to regulate tissue turnover. As we also observed increased vinculin recruitment to EB adherens junctions when Sqh<sup>DD</sup> was expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>), we concluded that vinculin functions downstream of cortical tension, and is mechanosensitive like in other tissues. In addition, we observed that a constitutively open form of vinculin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maartens et al., 2016</xref>) slowed down tissue turnover in <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> guts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is well known that too much vinculin activity (like in this experiment) can be deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maartens et al., 2016</xref>), nevertheless, this result is in agreement with a role of vinculin activation in progenitors to prevent premature cell differentiation. Altogether, our data support a model whereby vinculin associates with the VBS of α-catenin in EBs, which becomes exposed upon force-induced α-catenin conformational change. This binding prevents premature EB differentiation and increased ISC proliferation. The idea that vinculin functions by mediating increased tension on adherens junction was supported by the effects of independently altering acto-myosin function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Vinculin links cellular tension to enteroblast (EB) differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of ReDDM in progenitors with <italic>Sqh<sup>DD</sup></italic> for 14 days, in <italic>yw</italic> (Ctrl) or <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> guts.

With conditional and cell-specific knockdowns, we demonstrated that unlike two core members of cell–matrix adhesion complex, the integrin βPS subunit and talin, which directly binds vinculin, vinculin appears dispensable for ISC maintenance. This was surprising to us given the well-known role of vinculin in focal adhesion stabilisation <italic>in vitro</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carisey and Ballestrem, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bays and DeMali, 2017</xref>). Our work instead showed that vinculin depletion in EBs induces their partial maturation towards absorptive cells, in turn accelerating tissue turnover. As this function is dependent on interaction with α-catenin, we concluded that vinculin may be required in EBs to stabilise adherens junctions. Interestingly, altering E-cadherin- or integrin-mediated adhesion in EBs prevented premature differentiation. Since vinculin can modulate both adhesion machineries, the crosstalk between them remains to be characterised in this tissue. As the <italic>vinc</italic> phenotype correlated with that caused by decreased levels of myosin II activity it is likely that in the intestine vinculin senses myosin II tension, as in other developing epithelia in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rübsam et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Case et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jurado et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kale et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alégot et al., 2019</xref>). This could explain why in ISC/EB pairs, vinculin is only required on the EB side where cytoskeletal tension vary as cells undergo morphological changes during maturation and differentiation. Recent work in cell culture models showed that vinculin can be recruited asymmetrically in a force-dependent manner at sites of cadherin adhesion near mitotic cells. Whilst in this case, asymmetric recruitment promotes cell shape changes during cell division and maintenance of epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Monster et al., 2021</xref>), our study reveals that asymmetric vinculin requirements at cell junctions (which we showed is influenced by myosin II activity) can also regulate cell fate decisions and tissue composition in the intestine. Our findings place vinculin in a feedback loop that couples the process of EC differentiation to stem cell proliferation in the intestine. In the absence of vinculin, ISCs constitutively sense a demand for tissue replenishment and produce new cells, despite the tissue containing high proportions of progenitors, thus generating increased cell density. Whilst our data mostly support a direct role of vinculin at cell junctions in EBs, we cannot exclude that vinculin activity might also impact long range signals regulating stem cell proliferation, especially in light of the mild effects observed when vinculin is depleted in small clones of cells rather than globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>).</p><p>Previous work showed that in response to poor nutritional conditions (or insulin signalling pathway impairment), adherens junctions between ISCs and newly formed EBs were stabilised and stem cell proliferation was prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). Although the signals linking insulin signalling to junction disassembly and non-autonomous proliferation remain to be characterised, it is tempting to speculate that α-catenin recruitment of active vinculin might help strengthen adherens junctions when cells are under external tension, as would be the case during periods of active growth. In support of this hypothesis, upon refeeding (and thus active insulin signalling) after a week of starvation, <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> guts showed a recovery in size that initially surpassed the original one, correlating with increased cell production facilitated by junction disassembly. It will be interesting in future to establish whether in this system vinculin acts in parallel or downstream of the insulin signalling pathway.</p><p>Notably, E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion is also required in ECs to prevent stem cell renewal, but in this case, by preventing the secretion of mitogenic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liang et al., 2017</xref>). Such coupling of differentiated cell density and self-renewal was also demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> in the mouse adult stratified epidermis, where stem cells divide in response to delamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mesa et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanosensing in intestinal precursors regulates tissue homeostasis</title><p>It seems fitting that proteins activated in response to tissue tension couple differentiation to self-renewal. Strikingly, we observed regional differences in the rate of tissue turnover in the posterior midgut of <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> guts. As the region with highest turnover in the mutant corresponded to a narrowing portion of the gut where the domains R4 and R5 are separated by a constriction of the intestinal wall (cartoon <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marianes and Spradling, 2013</xref>), we speculate that a local increase in mechanical forces (e.g. through visceral muscle contractions and food passage) induces vinculin mediated junction reinforcement to prevent untimely cell production. Consistent with this, β-catenin had a stronger cortical localisation in this area compared to more anterior areas of the midgut (data not shown). Another hypothesis is that this gut area presents with differential expression of signalling components. These issues remain to be solved.</p><p>Our work demonstrated that vinculin is required in EBs to prevent their precocious activation and differentiation into absorptive cells. How vinculin relates to transcription factors activated at this stage such as Esg and Klu remains to be formally tested. However, we observed that <italic>vinc</italic> knockdown in EBs cells led them to stall half-way through differentiation, whilst triggering proliferation in adjacent ISCs. This suggests that vinculin prevents the premature activation of dormant EBs. Once past a certain threshold of mechanical force, vinculin might not be sufficient to prevent tissue growth. Alternatively, vinculin might also contribute to terminal differentiation, either by direct signalling of terminal differentiation or by sensing local tissue density in a similar fashion as contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alégot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biswas et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, gut stretching after food ingestion induces proliferation through activation of the YAP/TAZ homolog Yorkie. The mechanical stress induces a displacement of the Ste20 kinase Misshapen from the membrane of EBs, thereby relieving interactions with upstream mediators of the Hippo pathway, and thus allowing Yorkie nuclear translocation, activation of target genes and midgut growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2018</xref>). We suggest that vinculin contributes to mechanical force sensing in EBs and more generally helps coordinate self-renewal and differentiation into absorptive cells. Interestingly, the precursors of EEs can also transduce mechanical stress to control differentiation. In this case, however, cell fate is acquired through increased intracellular calcium downstream of the stretch-activated channel piezo expressed in EE precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Thus, lineage commitment in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine seems to depend on mechanosensing pathways specifically active in precursors cells. Together with the role of integrin activation in ISCs to regulate self-renewal (this work; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2013</xref>), it becomes apparent cell type-specific mechanosensing pathways contribute to fine-tuning cell production and tissue composition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Outlook</title><p>In the mammalian intestine, stem cells are located in crypts whilst progenitors concentrate at the bottom of villi, which are populated by differentiated cells.

The number of epithelial cell nuclei and maximum midgut width was measured in progressive cross-sections every 30 μm along 300 μm of the R4/5 region for both genotypes. <italic>GFP intensity</italic> reporting vinc-GFP recruitment at cell junctions (determined by β-catenin/Arm staining) was measured from a single z-section further away from the visceral muscles to avoid any confounding GFP signal. On Fiji, a straight line (width = 9) was drawn in between the centre of ISC/EB (Klu<sup>−</sup>/Klu<sup>+</sup>) and EB/EB (Klu<sup>+</sup>/Klu<sup>+</sup>) doublets nuclei. The plot profile option was then used to quantify GFP intensity across the previously drawn line. After extracting the numerical data, quantifications from each doublet were then centred at the highest intensity value (corresponding to the cell/cell junction). Data were plotted with GraphPad Prism 7, 8, and 9 software. In all graphs, results represent median values, error bars represent interquartile range. Statistical significance was calculated using a Mann–Whitney test and p values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Survival was compared between <italic>yw</italic> and <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> flies using the log-rank test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Wing mounting</title><p>Wings were mounted in Euparal (R1344A, Agar Scientific) on a glass slide (SuperFrost 1.0 mm, ISO 8037/1, VWR International) with coverslip (22 × 50 mm #1, 12342118, Menzel-Gläser). Images were taken on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a Q Imaging QICAM FAST1394 camera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Guts of 7-day-old female flies were dissected in Schneider’s medium (S3652, Sigma) and fixed overnight at 4°C in 2% glutaraldehyde, 2% formaldehyde in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. After fixation, guts were cut at the middle point of the posterior midgut with a razor blade (WS1010, Wilkinson Sword). Guts were washed with 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer and osmicated overnight at 4°C in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5% potassium ferricyanide, and 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Guts were washed in deionised water (DIW) and treated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature with 0.1% thiocarbohydrazide/DIW. Guts were washed again in DIW and osmicated for 1 hr at room temperature in 2% OsO<sub>4</sub> in DIW. Following washing in DIW, guts were treated for 3 days at 4°C in 2% uranyl acetate in 0.05 M maleate buffer (pH 5.5). Guts were washed in DIW and stained for 1 hr at 60°C in lead aspartate solution (0.33 g lead nitrate in 50 ml 0.03 M aspartic acid solution [pH 5.5]). Following washing in DIW, guts were dehydrated in 50%, 70%, 95–100% ethanol, three times in each for at least 5 min each. Guts were then dehydrated twice in 100% dry ethanol, twice in 100% dry acetone, and three times in dry acetonitrile for at least 5 min each. Guts were placed for 2 hr at room temperature in a 50/50 mixture of Quetol (TAAB) resin mix and 100% dry acetonitrile. Guts were incubated in pure Quetol resin mix (12 g Quetol 651, 15.7 g NSA, 5.7 g MNA, and 0.5 g BDMA [all from TAAB]) for 5 days, replacing with fresh resin mix each day. Guts were embedded in coffin mounds and incubated for 48 hr at 60°C. Resin-embedded samples were mounted on aluminium SEM stubs using conductive epoxy resin and sputter coated with 35 nm gold. Blockfaces were sectioned using a Leica Ultracut E and coated with 30 nm carbon for conductivity. The samples were imaged in a FEI Verios 460 SEM at an accelerating voltage of 3–4 keV and a probe current of 0.2 pA in backscatter mode using the CBS detector in immersion mode. Large area maps were acquired using FEI MAPS software for automated image acquisition. MAPS settings for high-resolution maps were 1536 × 1024 pixel resolution, 10-μs dwell time, two-line integrations, magnification ~×8000, working distance ~4 mm, tile size 15.9 μm, default stitching profiles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescence heatmaps</title><p>Posterior midguts were imaged with a Leica M165FC microscope with Leica DFC3000G camera. Fluorescence intensity was measured along three lines of defined position (‘upper quarter’, ‘middle’, and ‘lower quarter’) spanning the length of the posterior-most 1200 μm of each midgut using the ImageJ plot profile tool. Fluorescence intensity along the three lines was averaged for each gut. Then average fluorescence intensity was calculated for each 50 μm gut segment and normalised by dividing by the lowest fluorescence value (to account for variation in image brightness within and between genotypes). This was repeated for tens of guts for each genotype, and the overall average normalised values for each 50 μm gut segment were plotted as a heatmap using Prism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-72836-transrepform1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of experimental genotypes used throughout the figures.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-72836-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Nick Brown, Sarah Bray, Tobias Reiff, Maria Dominguez, Cedric Polesello, and Ken Irvine for kindly sharing flies with us. <italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks used in this study were otherwise obtained from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (NIH P40OD018537).

mechanosensation mechanism in fly intestinal stem cells and their enteroblast progeny. The authors focus on vinculin, whose activity in other epithelial systems is regulated by mechanical tension. The manuscript's data clearly demonstrate a role for vinculin in suppressing the proliferation of midgut stem cells and the differentiation of their enteroblast progeny and suggest that this role is exerted specifically through enteroblast vinculin. The authors find that similar phenotypes are induced by genetic manipulations of vinculin, α-catenin, and myosin, and they argue that this similarity implies that vinculin activity in enteroblasts is mechanosensitive. These findings are potentially relevant to biologists interested in stem cells, tissue homeostasis, fate decisions, and mechanobiology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72836.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03ht1xw27</institution-id><institution>National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>de Navascues</surname><given-names>Joaquin</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.05.455299">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.05.455299v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Lucy O'Brien as Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joaquin de Navascues (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Explicitly examine whether vinculin in enteroblasts is regulated by changes in mechanical tension and/or cadherin-mediated adhesion.</p><p>A pillar of the authors' model is that enteroblast vinculin exerts its effects through a mechanosensitive mechanism involving E-cad and a-cat. Work in other epithelial tissues has demonstrated that the E-cad-a-cat-vinc complex is mechanosensitive, but this mechanosensitivity has not been demonstrated in the fly gut. Since some canonical functions of E-cadherin are known to differ in the fly gut, it is important to establish that mechanosensitive regulation of vinc is conserved.</p><p>The chief evidence the authors present for mechanosensitivity is that single genetic perturbations of vinc and myosin produce similar phenotypes. However, the phenotypic readouts that are shown (nuclear size, stem cell production, differentiation index, retention index) are indicators of stem cell renewal/differentiation. These types of effects could in principle arise through numerous mechanisms, some of which are not necessarily related to tension.</p><p>Reviewer 3 suggests several approaches to more directly examine whether vinc in enteroblasts is responding to (or perhaps regulating) changes in mechanical tension. These include epistasis tests with vinc and loss- or gain-of function alleles of myosin, epistasis tests with vinc and E-cad (or perhaps E-cad mutants that lack the extracellular binding domain or the a-cat binding site), or examining the subcellular localization of vinc following loss- or gain-of-function myosin manipulations and/or in a-cat mutants. One of these suggestions, or an equivalent experiment, will be essential in a revised manuscript.</p><p>(2) Provide textual explanations and/or experimental evidence to clarify certain cell-specific phenotypes.</p><p>All reviewers felt that interpretations of some cell type-specific genetic manipulations were either oversimplified or, potentially, contradictory:</p><p>a. There was concern that some experimental outcomes (MARCM expts, knockdown experiments using ISC+EB vs EB drivers) do not support the authors' conclusion that vinc acts in enteroblasts and not in stem cells. Can the authors clarify these apparent discrepancies through either textual discussion or new data?</p><p>b. The conclusion that progenitor cell vinc does not act through integrins, which is presented as a key finding, is based on the result that mys or talin RNAi does not phenocopy vinc RNAi. However, these data do not exclude a scenario in which vinc acts through both cadherin and integrins, with the cadherin pathway dominating. Either additional data should be provided that directly test the involvement of integrins, or the text should be modified to discuss the limitations of the current approach.</p><p>c. Why does vinc::RFP rescue the vinc null while vincCO has little effect?</p><p>(3) As shown, the starvation/refeeding and survival assays are difficult to interpret because their use of whole-animal vinc nulls means that the outcomes cannot necessarily be ascribed to enteroblast vinculin. These experiments should either be repeated in a manner that reveals the contribution of enteroblast vinculin, or else removed from the study (as suggested by Reviewer 1).</p><p>(4) Dl immunostaining – Can the authors comment on how quantitation of Dl+ cells was performed with the punctate immunostaining pattern evident in, for instance, Figure 4a-b? In online discussion among the reviewers, there were differing opinions about Dl staining patterns but agreement that ascribing Dl puncta to individual cells may be unreliable without a membrane marker.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am mostly repeating myself here but the experiments I would suggest are:</p><p>– Repeating some key experiments while recording additional, more standardised metrics, in particular evaluating PH3 and rates of differentiation with ISC-Gal4, esg-Gal4, klu-Gal4 and MARCM clones with UAS-vincRNAi.</p><p>– Establishing the autonomy of the phenotype in vinc[102.1] in one of the ways suggested above.</p><p>– Establishing the autonomy of the α-catenin phenotype in ISCs and EBs, and whether the full deletion of the M1 region fails to rescue the phenotype.</p><p>– Establish whether expression of VincCO (or VincFL) can change the behaviour of the system when forced to regenerate.</p><p>Some technical fastidious stuff, sorry:</p><p>– Lifespan experiment – individuals dissected for gut staining cannot be assumed to experience the same risk as the rest – the correct approach is to remove them from the cohort or censor them, otherwise the amount of animals at risk after dissection is not the right one.</p><p>– Some language mishaps:</p><p>There is a couple of instances where esgTS-FO patches are referred to as &quot;clones&quot;, it should be corrected.</p><p>The authors refer to 29ºC in experiments using tub-Gal80ts as the 'permissive' temperature, which is not the usual way to refer to this in the literature, as this temperature is when Gal80ts stops functioning – I understand that for the activity of Gal4 this is 'permissive' but the primary molecular event is the destabilisation of Gal80ts and that is how the community is used to think of this – if the authors wish to maintain this nomenclature, perhaps some more explicit mention of what they mean would be useful in the main text.</p><p>The use of the term &quot;compensatory proliferation&quot; is a bit out of context here, as it has been employed traditionally to refer to proliferation to compensate apoptosis; however, in this paper it is argued that the proliferation arises from loss of contact inhibition due to differentiation, so the phenomenology does not parallel the traditional use of the term in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The authors correctly conclude that flies are more resistant to starvation and they word it very similarly in the main text, but in the abstract they phrase this observation as &quot;Improved recovery after starvation&quot;, which is misleading as the phenotype is circumscribed to the starvation period: the survival curve is essentially the same AFTER the re-feeding, and the only difference in the re-feeding period is this single time point when the guts from vinc[102.1] guts recovered to a slightly larger size than the fed controls. I would not hinge such a strong statement on this single observation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Dl staining in this article seems suboptimal, as the Dl signal should be clear membrane-associated rather than discrete puncta. Dl staining in the fly midgut can be tricky if fixed with 4% FAH while fixing with 100% methanol instead can solve this problem.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some additional approaches could benefit the analysis.</p><p>(1) I think the model is that Vinc strengthens adhesion between ISC and EB to suppress EB differentiation. It would be interesting then to know whether EB and ISC physically separate more quickly in Vinc mutants, which could possibly be investigated through some live imaging.</p><p>(2) Would it be possible to do some epistasis tests to further examine the model that Vinc is required to maintain tension at AJ in the EB? eg What happens of the SqhDD is combined with Vinc mutants? Or activated Vinc with myosin loss-of-function?</p><p>(3) Can the authors provide evidence that tension is actually regulating Vinc localization at AJ in the EB. eg Is Vinc localization different in the experiments that increase or decrease myosin activity? What about with the a-cat mutants?</p><p>(4) Is Vinc required just for the strength of attachment to the ISC, or is it doing something else, eg could regulation of the Hippo pathway be relevant here?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Vinculin recruitment to α-catenin halts the differentiation and maturation of enterocyte progenitors to maintain homeostasis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine.&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Mone Zaidi (Deputy Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>There is a suggestion for a tweak to the discussion: Please can you try and address that, and we can then speedily accept?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I find no major concerns with the revised manuscript. However, one point would be helpful if added to the discussion section. The authors claimed that vinc non-autonomously regulates stem cell proliferation and suggest that EBs may suppress ISCs division through cadherin-mediated adhesion. Nevertheless, this model seems not quite consistent with the fact that MARCM clone of vinc mutant and RNAi shows no increase in clone size and reduces ISC proportion. The authors claim that some vinc clones lose ISCs (Dl staining), which means if one wait for a longer time the vinc LOF clones should be smaller than the control as the stem cells are lost. Therefore, I think the authors have not ruled out the possibility that vinc mutant EBs affect ISCs through certain long-range signals like upd or growth hormone, which may actually explain why vinc LOF MARCM clone does not grow bigger since long-range effects usually require global rather than local changes. Meanwhile, mechanical forces have also been found in the regulation of cell secretion in several cases.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed the issues raised in the initial review, and I have no further concerns with the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72836.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Explicitly examine whether vinculin in enteroblasts is regulated by changes in mechanical tension and/or cadherin-mediated adhesion.</p><p>A pillar of the authors' model is that enteroblast vinculin exerts its effects through a mechanosensitive mechanism involving E-cad and a-cat.

To our knowledge, the cryptic vinculin binding site (VBS) on a-catenin only becomes accessible when a-catenin is stretched in a tension-dependent manner, as shown originally <italic>in vitro</italic> (Yonemura et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2014). The interaction between vinculin and a-catenin via the VBS was later confirmed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Sarpal et al., 2019; Alegot et al., 2019). Thus, our experiments in Figure 6E where the a-catenin RNAi phenotype is rescued by reintroduction of a full-length, but not a VBS-lacking a-catenin strongly suggest that vinculin is recruited to adherens junctions by this well-defined mechanism of binding to force-stretched a-catenin, which in turn impacts tissue turnover.</p><p>Nonetheless, we sought to provide additional evidence to support the mechanosensitive regulation of tissue turnover by vinculin, as requested. We tested the epistatic relationship between myosin II and vinculin, by expressing a constitutively active form of myosin II regulatory light chain (Sqh<sup>DD</sup>) in all progenitor cells in a <italic>vinculin</italic> mutant background. We observed rates of differentiation similar to those observed in <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> guts (new Figure 7A-B), suggesting that vinculin acts downstream of myosin II induced tension. Furthermore, we obtained data showing that vinculin recruitment to adherens junctions increased with tension in EBs (new Figure 7C-D). Thus, these experiments demonstrate that vinculin is acting in the intestine as a mechanoeffector, in a similar manner to that characterized in other epithelia (described pages 10-11 in section: ‘Vinculin links cellular tension to EB differentiation’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide textual explanations and/or experimental evidence to clarify certain cell-specific phenotypes.</p><p>All reviewers felt that interpretations of some cell type-specific genetic manipulations were either oversimplified or, potentially, contradictory:</p><p>a. There was concern that some experimental outcomes (MARCM expts, knockdown experiments using ISC+EB vs EB drivers ) do not support the authors' conclusion that vinc acts in enteroblasts and not in stem cells. Can the authors clarify these apparent discrepancies through either textual discussion or new data?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that we were unclear in the text. With hindsight, the confusion may have been caused by our describing the phenotype of MARCM clones before reporting the accumulation of EBs in the <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> guts. Therefore, we swapped these two sections and improved the description of these experiments in the manuscript (see section: “The pool of enterocyte progenitors expands upon vinculin depletion” pages 6-8).</p><p>In brief, we do not think that our results are at odds with the phenotype of vinculin knockdown using the ISC and ISC/EB drivers – we realise the text was misleading and hope to have clarified our observations in the revised manuscript (pages 7 and 8). From cell conditional RNAi experiments, like the reviewer, we would predict that vinculin knockdown or loss of function in mitotic clones (MARCM experiments, Figure 4E-G) will induce accelerated differentiation of vinculin deficient enteroblasts, which in turn will increase proliferation. We observed that <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> or <italic>vinc RNAi</italic> mitotic clones contained similar number of cells compared to control clones, but reduced proportion of stem cells (Figure 4G). We interpret this as indicating that to maintain an equivalent clone size, stem cells must have divided more frequently, with some divisions producing two differentiated daughter cells. This type of symmetric division would increase the EB pool (as seen in Figure 4—figure supplement 2B), at the expense of the ISC population, in turn decreasing long term clonal growth potential. Altogether, the results obtained with MARCM clones highlight changes in tissue dynamics compatible with those observed with cell-specific vinculin knockdowns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The conclusion that progenitor cell vinc does not act through integrins, which is presented as a key finding, is based on the result that mys or talin RNAi does not phenocopy vinc RNAi. However, these data do not exclude a scenario in which vinc acts through both cadherin and integrins, with the cadherin pathway dominating. Either additional data should be provided that directly test the involvement of integrins, or the text should be modified to discuss the limitations of the current approach.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised an important point. To test this we had to overcome the ISC defect of <italic>mys</italic> or <italic>talin</italic> RNAi, and specifically tested their function in enteroblasts using the KluGal4 driver. This revealed a similar phenotype of accelerated differentiation, assayed with the ReDDM system (see new Figure 6 —figure supplement 4). Thus, as the reviewer suggested both integrins and cadherins function in this process, we have amended the text to indicate this (see page 10, and sentence in the discussion page 12). It appears however that, unlike vinculin, they also have a key role in ISCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Why does vinc::RFP rescue the vinc null while vincCO has little effect?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 7, figure supplement 2, the accelerated turnover seen in <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> guts is attenuated by expression of Vinc<sup>CO</sup>. However, Vinc<sup>CO</sup> expression does not affect the little turnover in the guts of <italic>yw</italic> males. Previous work has shown that Vinc<sup>CO</sup> has numerous effects, none of which appear to be a simple gain of normal activity (Maartens et al., 2016) which we highlighted in the text (see page 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As shown, the starvation/refeeding and survival assays are difficult to interpret because their use of whole-animal vinc nulls means that the outcomes cannot necessarily be ascribed to enteroblast vinculin.

In online discussion among the reviewers, there were differing opinions about Dl staining patterns but agreement that ascribing Dl puncta to individual cells may be unreliable without a membrane marker.</p></disp-quote><p>Dl+ cells are quantified manually, on z-stack reconstructions spanning half the depth of the intestine from samples processed side by side with control guts. We routinely identify DAPI+Dl+ cells as small cells, located near the basal side of the epithelium. In Figure 4A-B, Dl+ staining is mutually exclusive with the b-Galactosidase staining marking Notch activating enteroblasts, confirming the effective use of this marker. We have now included this description in the method section ‘quantifications and statistics’ (page 19).</p><p>As a side note, in our experience, with our paraformaldehyde fixation method (described in material and methods), the Dl staining is mostly in puncta, but can, in some experimental conditions, appear strongly enriched at the membrane. Thus, while we appreciate the concern of the reviewer that the punctate pattern makes it harder to assign to a particular cell, in practise it is not difficult, and is standard in the field (e.g. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.08.014 (Jun-Kit Hu and Jasper, Cell reports, 2019) Willms et al., Cell Reports, 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108400 Loza-Coll et al., EMBO J., 2014 https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201489050 good example of membrane and dotty within a same panel).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I am mostly repeating myself here but the experiments I would suggest are:</p><p>– Repeating some key experiments while recording additional, more standardised metrics, in particular evaluating PH3 and rates of differentiation with ISC-Gal4, esg-Gal4, klu-Gal4 and MARCM clones with UAS-vincRNAi.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved the consistency of the measurements by adding measures of cell density throughout, as a proxy for cell proliferation and differentiation, and in cases where we could see a phenotype, we have added the mitotic index and rate of differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Establishing the autonomy of the phenotype in vinc[102.1] in one of the ways suggested above.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the survival experiment, this time knocking down vinculin in esg+ cells in the adult (Figure 8B and text page 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Establishing the autonomy of the α-catenin phenotype in ISCs and EBs, and whether the full deletion of the M1 region fails to rescue the phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed, we do not expect the autonomy of a-Catenin to be the same as vinculin.

We have attempted to measure the distance between Dl+ ISC and Su(H)lacZ+ EBs on fixed samples but found large variations both in control and <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> guts, probably representative of cells at different stages of activation. In any case, absence of changes in total a-Catenin staining in <italic>vinc RNAi</italic> clones (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) suggests that the integrity of adherens junctions is maintained between cells, even in the absence of vinculin. It is therefore possible that the changes occurring between ISCs and EBs in <italic>vinc<sup>102.1</sup></italic> mutants reflect changes in cellular tension, and changes in the engagement of adherens junction proteins with the actin cytoskeleton rather than complete separation. Thus new tools will be required to elucidate the role of vinculin in this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Would it be possible to do some epistasis tests to further examine the model that Vinc is required to maintain tension at AJ in the EB? eg What happens of the SqhDD is combined with Vinc mutants?

However, one point would be helpful if added to the discussion section. The authors claimed that vinc non-autonomously regulates stem cell proliferation and suggest that EBs may suppress ISCs division through cadherin-mediated adhesion. Nevertheless, this model seems not quite consistent with the fact that MARCM clone of vinc mutant and RNAi shows no increase in clone size and reduces ISC proportion. The authors claim that some vinc clones lose ISCs (Dl staining), which means if one wait for a longer time the vinc LOF clones should be smaller than the control as the stem cells are lost. Therefore, I think the authors have not ruled out the possibility that vinc mutant EBs affect ISCs through certain long-range signals like upd or growth hormone, which may actually explain why vinc LOF MARCM clone does not grow bigger since long-range effects usually require global rather than local changes. Meanwhile, mechanical forces have also been found in the regulation of cell secretion in several cases.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors and reviewers for taking the time to assess our revised manuscript. We have now added a sentence in the discussion to acknowledge that we cannot exclude a contribution of vinculin activity to long range signalling.</p><p>Page 13: sentence added: “Whilst our data mostly support a direct role of vinculin at cell junctions in EBs, we cannot exclude that vinculin activity might also impact long range signals regulating stem cell proliferation, especially in light of the mild effects observed when vinculin is depleted in small clones of cells rather than globally (Figure 4E-G).”</p><p>The revised version (containing tracked changes) has been uploaded in place of the current version. We also noted that 3 figures (Fig6, Figure 6S1 and Figure 8S1) were low resolution and appeared pixelated, we have thus replaced the jpgs with better quality ones.</p></body></sub-article></article>
