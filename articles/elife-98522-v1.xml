recorded neurons. These probes are often implanted acutely, but acute recordings cannot be performed in freely moving animals and the recorded neurons cannot be tracked across days. To study key behaviors such as navigation, learning, and memory formation, the probes must be implanted chronically. An ideal chronic implant should (1) allow stable recordings of neurons for weeks; (2) allow reuse of the probes after explantation; (3) be light enough for use in mice. Here, we present the ‘Apollo Implant’, an open-source and editable device that meets these criteria and accommodates up to two Neuropixels 1.0 or 2.0 probes. The implant comprises a ‘payload’ module which is attached to the probe and is recoverable, and a ‘docking’ module which is cemented to the skull. The design is adjustable, making it easy to change the distance between probes, the angle of insertion, and the depth of insertion. We tested the implant across eight labs in head-fixed mice, freely moving mice, and freely moving rats. The number of neurons recorded across days was stable, even after repeated implantations of the same probe. The Apollo implant provides an inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible solution for reusable chronic Neuropixels recordings.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Certain cognitive processes, such as learning, develop over relatively long periods (hours or days). Others, including navigation – the ability to move through a space based on our knowledge of it – usually take place when the subject is free to explore its environment. This can make studying these processes challenging, as researchers need to record brain activity for long periods and in freely moving subjects.</p><p>Electrophysiology allows researchers to record brain activity at the millisecond timescale, but technical constraints have made it difficult to record more than a few neurons for any length of time. However, a set of electrophysiology probes called Neuropixels have been developed to allow the recording of hundreds of neurons at once. These probes can be permanently implanted in the brain to track neural activity over long periods. Unfortunately, these implants make it impossible to recover the probes, making their use too expensive for most researchers.</p><p>To address this issue, Bimbard et al. set out to develop an implant that would allow the reversible implantation of Neuropixel probes, allowing researchers to track hundreds of cells at fast timescales and over long periods. The device they developed, called the Apollo implant, is a lightweight, reusable device with an open-source design that can be adjusted to suit experimental needs.</p><p>Bimbard et al. combined data from eight independent laboratories using the Apollo implant to demonstrate that it can be easily reproduced and modified. These data show that the implant can measure neural data stably for over 100 days after the initial implantation. Additionally, Bimbard et al. show that it is possible to reimplant the same probes many times without losing recording quality.</p><p>The Apollo implant makes long-term tracking of groups of neurons reliable and affordable, which will facilitate cognition studies across different model systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group

To gain insights into these processes, it is necessary to record brain activity chronically and to be able to do so in freely moving animals. Chronic recordings in freely moving animals are possible with calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zong et al., 2022</xref>). However, accessing deep brain regions can require invasive surgery and fails to capture fast neural dynamics. Electrophysiology overcomes these issues: the temporal resolution is higher, deeper regions are readily accessible, and recordings can be made in freely moving animals. Substantial effort has thus been dedicated to developing devices for chronic electrophysiology recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berényi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferguson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferreira-Fernandes et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Newman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shobe et al., 2015</xref>). But these devices are typically non-recoverable, are too heavy for use in smaller animals like mice, or record relatively few neurons.</p><p>With Neuropixels probes, many hundreds of neurons can be recorded in a single insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>). These probes allow experimenters to produce brain-wide maps of neural activity in head-restrained mice using acute recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). To track neurons across days, and to use freely moving animals, the probes can be implanted chronically, with procedures that are permanent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>) or recoverable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghestem et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Juavinett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Daal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vöröslakos et al., 2021</xref>). Permanent implants are lightweight and stable, but their use at scale is not financially feasible. Conversely, recoverable implants can be reused, but solutions need to be cheaper, lighter, more flexible, and easier to implant and explant. In particular, the only published recoverable implants for Neuropixels 2.0 probes may be too heavy for use with typical mice, and cannot be adjusted for different implantation trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Daal et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To address these issues, we developed the ‘Apollo implant’ for the reversible chronic implantation of Neuropixels probes. The implant is named for its lunar module design: a recoverable payload module accommodates up to two Neuropixels probes and is reused across animals, and a docking module is permanently cemented to the skull during implantation. The design is open source and can be readily adjusted with editable parameters to change distance between probes, implantation depth, or angle of insertion.</p><p>Our eight independent laboratories have performed successful recordings with the Apollo implant in mice and rats, supporting the flexibility and simplicity of the design. The same Neuropixels probes have been reimplanted up to six times with no significant change in recording quality. Recordings were stable across weeks and sometimes months. This allows for recordings to cover the entirety of the probes (by recording from different sections across days), while minimizing setup time, and could facilitate the tracking of neurons across days. The design has been independently printed, adjusted, and implanted across labs, and implanted subjects included freely behaving mice and rats and head-fixed mice, with Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0α (a pre-release version), and 2.0 probes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Flexible design</title><p>The Apollo implant consists of two parts, the payload and the docking modules, inspired by previous designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Daal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Both parts can be 3D-printed in a variety of materials, although we typically used a combination of Nylon PA12 and Formlabs Rigid Resin. The Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0α, and 2.0 implants weigh 1.7, 1.3, and 0.9 g (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Payload modules can accommodate up to two parallel probes, with the second probe adding a further 0.4, 0.2, and 0.2 g. The Apollo implant is therefore 40% lighter than the only published Neuropixels 2.0α solution, which recommends animals are at least 25 g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Daal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>). This allows for use in smaller animals (e.g. female and water-restricted mice). The electronics are protected by lids with slots to accommodate the flex cables when not connected to the headstage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To ensure the implant is maximally compact, flex cables can be folded into the cavity beneath the lids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This minimizes implant height (29, 21, and 17 mm for a Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0α, and 2.0), reducing the moment of inertia above the head. The implant can be 3D-printed for $10 ($3 for each disposable module).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Apollo implant and its flexible design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Exploded view of the implant showing the two modules: the payload module, which accommodates up to two Neuropixels probes (protected by two lids), and the docking module.

Once the payload module is constructed, the distance between the two probes remains fixed. The docking module is connected to the payload module via small screws, which makes it easy to assemble, and disassemble upon explantation. Only the docking module is cemented to the animal’s skull, and it is covered with merlons to increase contact with the cement and therefore the stability of the implant. To facilitate different implantation depths and angles with the same payload module, both the length and base-angle of the docking module can be adjusted. The base of the implant thus remains parallel to the skull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) which improves stability and reduces weight by minimizing implant height and the quantity of cement required. All adjustments can be achieved by inexpert CAD users with preset parameters supplied in the editable files to change distance between probes (1.8–6.5 mm—beyond 6.5 mm, two implants can be used), implantation depth (2–6.5 mm), or angle of insertion (up to 20 degrees) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). As the fully editable files are provided, users can (and have) adjusted the implants to exceed these default boundaries, or create their own custom modifications which are also available online (see Methods).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-98522-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Guide to altering the Apollo parts to a particular implantation.</title><p>This video guide demonstrates how to change the shape of the implant using parameters in Autodesk Inventor software—facilitating changes in inter-probe distance, penetration depth, and angle of implantation.</p></caption></media><p>To help combine the payload and docking modules, we designed a dedicated constructor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

The payload module was secured in its holder and attached to the end of the constructor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). The docking module holder was then slid along the constructor arms, and the two modules were secured with screws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Probes were cleaned with a Tergazyme solution, occasionally followed by a silicone cleaning solvent if Dural-Gel stuck to the probe.

In only two cases were probes damaged, and in one of those cases the skull integrity was compromised by infection (a rare occurrence) and the probe was likely broken before explantation. On six further occasions, probes stopped working due to connection errors (typically revealed by a ‘shift register’ error in SpikeGLX). The recovery rate is therefore 86% when including all connection errors. However, as this type of error is also observed with acute probe use, and there was no observable damage to the chronic probes, these failures may reflect long-term wear rather than any issue with the implant. Consistent with this, probes that failed with this error had typically been used for several months (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Outside of the originating laboratory (UCL), 95% of probes (19/20) were recovered without any broken shanks (90% when including all connection errors) demonstrating the ease with which new users adopt this design.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Stability</title><p>We tested the stability of the Apollo implant with Neuropixels 1.0, 2.0α, and 2.0 probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We implanted 48 mice using 4-shank Neuropixels 2.0α implants (20 mice with a single-probe implant and 13 mice with a dual implant), single-probe Neuropixels 2.0 implants (7 mice), and Neuropixels 1.0 implants (7 mice with a single-probe implant and one mouse with a dual), as well as 3 rats with a single Neuropixels 1.0 implant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In many cases, the same implants were reused (up to six times) and remained fully functional across different animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Recordings were performed over a period of days to months. The probes were typically inserted 5–6 mm inside the brain, traversing multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Because only 384 of the 5120 channels, termed a ‘bank’ of channels, can be recorded simultaneously on each 4-shank 2.0 probe, multiple recording sessions were often used to cover all recording sites located in the brain. Compared with acute recordings, this strategy dramatically reduces experimental setup time and complexity, and is especially beneficial for whole brain approaches. The raw signal quality did not seem to change across days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>), allowing us to identify single spikes reliably for months.

The number of single units for each probe is the sum of units across all banks within the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Unit numbers could remain stable for more than 50 days, and we observed comparable stability in most of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2020</xref>), we often observed an initial fast decrease in the number of units, but this was not systematic. Indeed, in some animals, unit number increased slowly across days until reaching a peak. The mean decrease in unit count per day was 3% (median 2%), within the range previously observed for chronic Neuropixels implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>). Although implants with more rapid unit loss were not suited for long-term recordings, others remained stable for months. Across all banks, the average number of recorded neurons on each bank was 85 ± 6 during the first 10 days (<italic>n</italic> = 59 probes, mean ± SEM), 65 ± 7 during days 10–50 (<italic>n</italic> = 50 probes), 54 ± 15 during days 50–100 (<italic>n</italic> = 6 probes), and 44 ± 25 beyond (<italic>n</italic> = 2 probes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The initial number of units did not depend on the number of times the probe was reimplanted (p &gt; 0.25, linear mixed-effects model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) or the insertion coordinates of the probe (p &gt; 0.94, linear mixed-effects model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

However, implant quality was more variable in posterior brain regions, with instances of rapidly decreasing neuron counts, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2020</xref>).

The RMS values were stable across days, across all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>).

We used the tracking software UnitMatch to track the same units across days, based on their waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Beest et al., 2024</xref>). In a mouse recorded for 100 days, a significant fraction of units could be tracked for months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). Tracked neurons had stable waveforms over days, as expected from the matching procedure, but also stable inter-spike intervals histograms (ISIHs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). These ISIHs were not used to match neurons across days, and their stability therefore strongly suggests the same units were tracked over months. The proportion of units tracked between two recordings decreased as a function of time between the recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). For two recordings on the same day, 50% of neurons were matched, suggesting an upper limit in neuron tracking with the method we used, likely due to variability in neural activity or conservative choices in software parameters. The proportion of tracked neurons typically decreased to 10% after 32 days, but the rate of decay varied across recordings: with some cases where 20% of neurons were tracked for 64 days, and others dropping to 0% after a week. In all cases, tracked units had consistent ISIHs, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)—comparing the similarity of ISIHs for tracked versus different units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

First, to minimize the weight, we recorded from two freely moving mice using either a dual Neuropixels 2.0α implant or a Neuropixels 1.0 implant, with the headstage suspended by its connection cable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). The mice explored their home cage and exhibited normal behaviors, such as grooming, running, and sleeping, suggesting that the implant did not impair basic movements. The recordings yielded high-quality, well-isolated single units for weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The distributions of the RMS values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and spike amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) were similar to the head-fixed conditions, suggesting an equivalent quality of recording despite differences in conditions, and labs. It can also be more convenient to secure the position of the headstage in each recording, or permanently attach the headstage to the implant. We thus designed a headstage holder, which we tested with Neuropixels 1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–J</xref>). To further reduce the weight on the mouse, we also designed a 1-probe version of the implant for Neuropixels 2.0, with a minimal headstage holder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–O</xref>), inserted at an angle (16 or 25 degrees), at the back of the brain.

This implant was modified to allow the headstage to be permanently attached from the first recording session (see Methods). Mice were placed in a large octagonal arena (80 cm diameter). On each trial, mice were required to respond to visual stimuli projected onto the floor of the chamber and perform a nose poke in one of the ports located around the perimeter of the chamber. Thus, during a typical session of 100 trials, mice typically traversed tens of meters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We compared mouse hit rate, trial number, and reaction times in sessions before implantation (when the mouse moved entirely freely) and after implantation (when the mouse was tethered). After implantation, mice continued to perform trials and fully explore the chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We observed an initial reduction in hit rate and trial number, and an increase in reaction time immediately after implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). The first two measures recovered within five sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>), but reaction times did not recover to pre-implantation levels, indicating that implantation may impact mobility in physically demanding tasks. Although we cannot disambiguate whether these changes are due to tethering, or the implant, it represents the maximal impact of the implantation, particularly as the heaviest Apollo implant was used. Therefore, the consistent hit rate and trial number, in a complex task requiring exploration in a large arena, demonstrates that the implant is well-suited to extended recordings from freely moving mice.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Effects of implantation on performance in a freely moving task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Trajectories (gray) of single mouse in an example session prior to implantation.

This solution is easily implanted and recovered, inexpensive, lightweight, flexible, and stable. We successfully tested the implant across multiple labs, setups (head-fixed or freely moving), and species (mice and rats), recording neural populations across weeks and even months.</p><p>The design of the Apollo implant builds upon past advances in chronic devices for Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Juavinett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Daal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vöröslakos et al., 2021</xref>) to improve on several aspects: weight, price, flexibility, and ease of use. The implant is optimized for animals that cannot carry heavy loads, like mice and especially female and water-controlled mice, which have lower body weight. Because the headstage is not permanently fixed to the implant, the animal carries less weight outside of recordings, and a single headstage can be used with multiple animals in sequence. However, the flexible design allows for the headstage to be permanently attached to an implant, which increases experimental ease at the expense of some additional implant weight. The implant is strong enough to be carried by rats with the addition of a protective 3D outer casing (see Methods), but its use in stronger animals, like ferrets or primates, remains untested. For applications requiring even lighter implants, such as birds, printing materials can be selected to further reduce weight. The lightweight design enables animals to perform complex and demanding freely moving tasks, but also allows experimenters to implant female and water-restricted mice while respecting animal welfare weight limitations.</p><p>The Apollo implant is more flexible than previously published solutions. A unique aspect of our modular design is that different docking modules can be used when reimplanting the same payload module, which enables a variety of recording configurations (brain regions, animals, and experimental setups) that would not have been possible with previous designs. The provided CAD files are fully editable and open source, allowing experienced users to modify the parts as needed. For inexpert users, the files are populated with predefined key dimensions that can be easily adjusted to accommodate changes in several features, including inter-probe distance, angle of implantation, and the length of exposed probes. This ensures the implant remains close to the skull for each experiment, minimizing surgical complications, implant weight (less bonding agent is needed), and moment of inertia (height is minimized). Indeed, even with the heavier Neuropixels 1.0 implants, freely moving mice maintained consistent performance on a complex task after implantation.</p><p>Although adapting the design to other commercially available silicon probes is beyond the scope of this study, the flexible design paves the way for future adaptations by individual groups. Because of the low component-cost ($3 per docking module), testing custom modifications is also more cost-effective than with previous solutions. This combination of flexibility and affordability is exemplified by the modifications already used across the eight labs providing data for this manuscript.</p><p>With the Apollo implant, the number of recorded neurons exhibited good stability across days, regardless of the number of times the probe had been reimplanted. To provide a realistic estimate for the number of high-quality units that could be recorded across days, we used stringent quality metrics based on unit waveform and spiking properties. Predicting the stability of an implantation was difficult and did not seem to correlate strongly with the quality of surgery (e.g. a small bleed during craniotomy, or ease of probe insertion). We observed more variable stability at the back of the brain, especially in superior colliculus, possibly due to the mechanical constraints imposed during head movements.</p><p>The Apollo implant allows for the insertion of up to two parallel probes simultaneously. This can be advantageous: it simplifies surgeries by reducing insertion time and allows probes to be placed in close proximity. However, some users may need to insert multiple probes at different angles. In this case, we are aware of two implant solutions in development that could be better suited, although to our knowledge these remain untested outside the authors’ own groups and have only been used in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">A Aery Jones, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Melin et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated that neurons recorded with the Apollo implant can be effectively tracked across days, consistent with previous characterizations of chronic Neuropixels implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Beest et al., 2024</xref>). van Beest et al. provide further evidence of neurons tracked with the Apollo implant, and a rigorous quantification of the number of neurons that one can expect to track with these methods. We expect the success of these methods to vary across model systems due to differences in waveform properties—for example, we observed qualitatively higher unit amplitudes in rats in this study. The ability to track neurons across these timescales promises to enhance our understanding of cognitive processes that evolve over long timescales, such as learning or aging.</p><p>Overall, the Apollo implant fills an important need to facilitate chronic electrophysiology with Neuropixels probes, particularly in small animals.

During the recordings, water-restricted mice were tethered and placed in a large (80 cm wide) octagonal arena (built in collaboration with NeuroGears Ltd) and were performing a behavioral task. Briefly, the floor of the arena was used as a projection surface to display the stimuli to the mice. At the bottom of each wall the nose pokes were used to detect mouse responses and deliver water reward. At a random time after the trial onset, two stimuli were presented as a spatial cue on the floor, indicating which wall had an ‘active’ nose poke with available water reward. To cue the relevant wall, each stimulus was in shape of a triangular ‘slice’ on the arena floor, with the wide base along the width of the wall that had active pokes, narrowing down to a point at the center. The walls with active ports (2/8 walls) were randomized on trial-by-trial basis, and the distances mice had to take to reach the cued walls depended on their position at the trial onset. Mouse reaction times were measured as the elapsed time from the onset of the stimulus until the registration of the poke-response at a cued wall. Mouse performance (hit rate) was calculated as the percentage of trials mice poked to one of the cued walls within 30 s. If the mouse did not poke within 30 s, the trial was aborted and labeled as a miss trial.

is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript by Bimbard et al., a new method to perform stable recordings over long periods of time with neuropixels, as well as the technical details on how the electrodes can be explanted for follow-up reuse, is provided.

Our implant has several advantages which combine to make it much more accessible than previous solutions. This enables a variety of recording configurations that would not have been possible with previous designs, facilitating recordings from a wider range of brain regions, animals, and experimental setups. In short, there are three key advances which we now emphasise in the manuscript:</p><p>Adaptability: The CAD files can be readily adapted to a wide range of configurations (implantation depth, angle, position of headstage, etc.). Labs have already modified the design for their needs, and re-shared with the community (Discussion, Para 5).</p><p>Weight: Because of the lightweight design, experimenters can (i) perform complex and demanding freely moving tasks as we exemplify in the manuscript, and (ii) implant female and water restricted mice while respecting animal welfare weight limitations (Flexible design, Para 1).</p><p>Cost: At ~$10, our implant is significantly cheaper than published alternatives, which makes it affordable to more labs and means that testing modifications is cost-effective (Discussion, Para 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- Differences between mice and rats seem very significant. Although this is probably not surprising, I suggest that the authors comment on this to make it clear to anyone trying to use in different species that are not quantified in the main figures.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct—there are qualitative differences between mice and rats, particularly with respect to the unit median amplitude. We have added a comment in the discussion to highlight these inter-species variations (Discussion, Para 7)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Another comment that would be useful to have would be how to tackle the problem of tracking the same neuron across days. Even if currently impossible, it could be useful to provide discussion along those lines as to where future improvements (either in hardware or software) can be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this. Figure. 5 does show data from tracking the same neuron across days (and even months). We have modified the language to make this clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work by Bimbard et al., introduces a new implant for Neuropixels probes.

However, the presented data does not allow us to judge whether this effect is specifically due to the presented implant or whether any implant or just tethering of the animals per se would have the same effects.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct: some of the differences in mouse reaction time could be due to the tether rather than the implant. As these experiments were also performed in water-restricted female mice with the heavier Neuropixels 1.0 implant, our data represent the maximal impact of the implant, and we have highlighted this point in the revision (Freely behaving animals, Para 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors make certain comparisons to other, previously published approaches for chronic implantation and re-use of Neuropixels probes, it is hard to make conclusive comparisons and judge the advantages of the current implant. For example, while the authors emphasize that the lower weight of their implant allows them to perform recordings in mice (and is surely advantageous), the previously described, heavier implants they mention (Steinmetz et al., 2021; van Daal et al., 2021), have also been used in mice. Whether the weight difference makes a difference in practice therefore remains somewhat unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct: without a direct comparison, we cannot be certain that our smaller, lighter implant improves behavioural results (although this is supported by the literature, e.g. Newman <italic>et al</italic>, 2023). However, the reduced weight of our implant is critical for several laboratories represented in this manuscript due to animal welfare requirements. Indeed, in van Daal <italic>et al</italic> the authors “recommend a [mouse] weight of &gt;25 g for implanting Neuropixels 1.0 probes.” This limit precludes using (the vast majority of) female mice, or water-restricted animals. Conversely, our implant can be routinely used with lighter, water-restricted male and female mice. We emphasised this point in the revision (Discussion, Para 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The non-permanent integration of the headstages into the implant, while allowing for the use of the same headstage for multiple animals in parallel, requires repeated connections and does not provide strong protection for the implant. This may especially be an issue for the use in rats, requiring additional protective components as in the presented rat experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for not clarifying the various headstage holder options in the manuscript and we have now addressed this in the revision (Freely behaving animals, Para 1&amp;2). Our repository has headstage holder designs (in the XtraModifications/Mouse_FreelyMoving folder). This allows leaving the headstage on the implant, and thus minimize the number of connections (albeit increasing the weight for the mouse). Indeed, mice recorded while performing the task described in our manuscript had the head-stage semi-permanently integrated to the implant, and we now highlight this in the revision (Freely behaving animals, Para 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The description of the different versions of the head-stage holders should be more clear, listing also advantages/disadvantages of the different solutions. It would be also useful if the authors could comment on the use of these head-stage holders in rats, since they do not seem to offer much protection.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point, and we have added notes to the manuscript to clarify the various advantages of the different headstage-holders, and that the headstage can be permanently attached to the implant (Freely behaving animals, Para 1&amp;2). This is the primary advantage of these solutions compared with the minimal implant—at the expense of increasing the implant weight.</p><p>The reviewer’s concerns regarding the lack of protection for implants in rats is well-placed, and we now emphasise that these experiments benefited from the additional protection of an external 3D casing, which is likely critical for use in larger animals (Freely behaving animals, Para 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While re-used probes seem to show similar yields across multiple uses (Figure 4C), it seems as if there is a much higher variability of the yield for probes that are used for the first (maybe also second) time. There are probes with much higher than average yields, but it seems none of the re-used probes show such high yields. Is this a real effect? Is this because the high-yield probes happened to have not been used multiple times? Is there an analysis the authors could provide to reduce the concern that yields may generally be lower for re-used probes/that there are no very high yields for re-used probes?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern with respect to Figure 4C, however, the re-use of any given probe was determined only by the experimental needs of the project. It is therefore not possible that there is a relationship between probes selected for re-use and unit-yield. We now specify this in the revised legend of Figure 4C. This variability (and the consistency in yield across uses) likely stems from differences between labs, brain region, and implantation protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that a 'large fraction' of units could be tracked for the entire duration of the experiment (Figure 5A,B). They mention in the discussion that quantification can be found in a different manuscript (van Beest et al., 2023), but this should also be quantified here in at least some more detail, also for other animals in addition to the one mouse which was recorded for ~100 days. What fraction can be held for different durations? What is the average holding time, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and have now added new panels quantifying the probability and reliability of tracking a neuron across days (Figure 5E-F). We also comment on the change in tracking probability across time, and its variability across recordings (Stability, Para 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3 (Public Reviews):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Bimbard and colleagues describe a new implant apparatus called &quot;Apollo Implant&quot;, which should facilitate recording in freely moving rodents (mice and rats) using Neuropixels probes. The authors collected data from both mice and rats, they used 3 different versions of Neuropixels, multiple labs have already adopted this method, which is impressive. They openly share their CAD designs and surgery protocol to further facilitate the adaptation of their method.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the &quot;Apollo Implant&quot; is easy to use and adapt, as it has been used in other laboratories successfully and custom modifications are already available. The device is reproducible using common 3D printing services and can be easily modified thanks to its CAD design (the video explaining this is extremely helpful). The weight and price are amazing compared to other systems for rigid silicon probes allowing a wide range of use of the &quot;Apollo Implant&quot;.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The &quot;Apollo Implant&quot; can only handle Neuropixels probes. It cannot hold other widely used and commercially available silicon probes. Certain angles and distances are not possible in their current form (distance between probes 1.8 to 4mm, implantation depth 2-6.5 mm, or angle of insertion up to 20 degrees).</p></disp-quote><p>As we now discuss in the manuscript (Discussion, Para 4), one implant accommodating the diversity of the existing probes is beyond the scope of this project. However, because the design is adaptable, groups should be able to modify the current version of the implant to adapt to their electrodes’ size and format (and can highlight any issues in the Github “Discussions” area).</p><p>With Neuropixels, the current range of depths covers practically all trajectories in the mouse brain. In rats, where deeper penetrations may be useful, the experimenter can attach the probe at a lower point in the payload module to expose more of the shank. We now specify this in the Github repository.</p><p>We have now extended the range of inter-probe distances from a maximum of 4 mm to 6.5 mm. Distances beyond this may be better served by 2 implants, and smaller distances could be achieved by attaching two probes on the same side of the docking module. These points are now specified in the revised manuscript (Flexible design, Para 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have only a few questions and suggestions:</p><p>Is it possible to create step-by-step instructions for explantation (similar to Figure-1 with CAD schematics)? You mention that payload holder is attached to a micromanipulator, but it is unclear how this is achieved. How was the payload secured with a screw (which screw)? My understanding is that as you turn the screw in the payload holder, it will grab onto the payload module from both sides, but the screw is not in contact with the payload module, correct? I found the screw type on your GitHub, but it would be great if you could add a bill of materials in a table format, so readers don't have to jump between GitHub and article.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a bill of materials to the revised manuscript (Implant design and materials, Para 2), although up-to-date links are still provided on the Github repository due to changing availability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What happens if you do a dual probe implant and cannot avoid blood vessels in one or both of the craniotomies due to the pre-defined geometry? Is this a frequent issue? How can you overcome this during the surgery?</p></disp-quote><p>Blood vessels can be difficult to avoid in some cases, but we are typically able to rotate/reposition the probes to solve this issue. In some cases, with 4-shank probes, the blood vessel can be positioned between individual probe shanks. We now detail this in the revised manuscript (Assembly and implantation, Para 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I assume if the head is not aligned (line-332) the probe can break during recovery. Have you experienced this during explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>As we now specify in the manuscript (Explantation, Para 2), we are careful when explanting the probe to avoid this issue, and due to the flexibility of the shanks, it does not appear to be a major concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why did you remove the UV glue (line 435)? How can you level the skull? I assume you have covered bregma and lambda in the first surgery which can create an uneven surface to measure even after you remove the UV glue.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this omission from the methods. We now explain (Implantation, Carandini-Harris laboratory) that the UV-glue is completely removed during the second surgery, and the skull is cleaned and scored. This improves the adhesion of the dental cement, and allows for reliable levelling of the skull.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In line 112 you mentioned that the number of recorded neurons was stable; however, you found a 3% mean decrease in unit count per day (line 120). Stability is great until day 10 (in Figure 4A), but it deteriorates quickly after that. I think it would help readers if you could add the mean{plus minus}SEM of recorded units in the text for days 1-10, days 11-50, and days 51-100 (using the data from Figure 4A).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added Supplementary Figure 4 to show unit count across bins of days, and a corresponding comment in the text (Stability, Para 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A full survey of the probe (Figure 4B) means that you recorded neuronal activity across 4-5000 channels (depending on how many channels were in the brain). While it is clear that a full probe survey can reduce the number of animals needed for a study, it is also clear in this figure that by day 25 you can record ~300 neurons on 4000 channels. It would be great to discuss this in the discussion and give a balanced view of the long-term stability of these recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, keeping a large number of units for a long time still remains a challenge. Here, we could record on average 85 neurons per bank during the first 10 days, and then only 45 after 50 days. It is important to note that our quantification averages across all banks recorded, including those in a ventricle or partly outside of the brain. Thus, our results represent a lower estimate of the total neurons recorded. Our new Supplementary Figure 4 helps to highlight the diversity of neuron number recorded per animal. Further improvements in surgical techniques and spike sorting will likely improve stability further and we have now added this comment in the manuscript (Stability, Para 2). For example, we observed excellent stability in a mouse where the craniotomy was stabilized with KwikSil (Supplementary Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The RMS value was around 20 uV in some of the recordings, and according to Figure 4G it is around 16 uV on average. Is it safe to accept putative single units with 20 uV amplitudes, when the baseline noise level is this close to the spike peak-to-peak amplitude?</p></disp-quote><p>On average, less than 1% of the units selected using all the other metrics except the amplitude had an amplitude below 30 µV, and 2.6% below 50 µV. Increasing the threshold to 30 µV, or even 50 µV, did not affect the results. We have now added this comment in the Methods (Data processing, Para 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can you add the waveform and ISIH of the example unit from day 106 to Figure 5?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added 4 units tracked up to day 106 in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could you move Supplementary Figure 3A to Figure 4? The number of units is more valuable information than the RMS noise level. I understand that you don't have such a nice coverage of all the days as in Figure 3 and 4, but you might be able to group for the first 3 days and the last 3 days (and if data is available, the middle 3 days) as a boxplot. The goal would be for the reader to be able to see whether there is any change in the number of single units over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, the number of units is more valuable. We had included this information in Figure 4A-F, but we have made edits to the text to make it clearer that this is what is being shown. The data from Figure 3A is already contained within Figure 4, but in 3A the data is separated by individual labs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Product numbers are missing in multiple places: line-285 (screw), line-288 (screw), line-290 (screw), line-309 (manipulator), line-374 (gold pin and silver wire), line-384 (Mill-Max), line-394 (silver wire), and many more. It would be great if you could add all these details, so people can replicate your protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this, and we have added details of screw thread-size and length to relevant parts of the manuscript, although any type of screw can be used. Similarly, other components are non-specific (e.g. multiple silver-wire diameters were used across labs), so we have not included specific product numbers for general consumer items (like screws and silver wires) to avoid indicating that a specific part must be purchased.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While it is great to see lab-specific methods, I am not sure in their current form it helps to understand the protocol better. The information is conveyed in different ways (I assume these were written by different people), in different orders, and in different depths (some mention probe implant location relative to bregma and midline, some don't). There are many different glues, epoxies, cement, wires, and pins. I would recommend rewriting these methods sections under a unified template, so it is easier to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and we have rewritten this section of the methods accordingly. We now use a template structure to simplify the comparisons between labs: the same template is used for each lab in each section (payload module assembly, implantation, and data acquisition).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line-307: why is a skull screw optional for grounding? What did you use for ground and reference if not a ground screw?</p></disp-quote><p>We now specify in the manuscript that during head-fixed experiments, the animal’s headplate can be used for grounding, and combined with internal referencing provided by the Neuropixels, yielded lownoise recordings (Implantation protocol, Methods).</p></body></sub-article></article>
