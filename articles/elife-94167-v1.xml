movements, and internal states. During behavior, the brain appears to sample from a broad repertoire of activation motifs. Understanding how these patterns of local and global activity are selected in relation to both spontaneous and task-dependent behavior requires in-depth study of densely sampled activity at single neuron resolution across large regions of cortex. In a significant advance toward this goal, we developed procedures to record mesoscale 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data from two novel <italic>in vivo</italic> preparations that, between them, allow for simultaneous access to nearly all 0f the mouse dorsal and lateral neocortex. As a proof of principle, we aligned neural activity with both behavioral primitives and high-level motifs to reveal the existence of large populations of neurons that coordinated their activity across cortical areas with spontaneous changes in movement and/or arousal. The methods we detail here facilitate the identification and exploration of widespread, spatially heterogeneous neural ensembles whose activity is related to diverse aspects of behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>2-photon</kwd><kwd>mesoscope</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd><italic>in vivo</italic></kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS118461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Procedures were developed to perform mesoscale 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging simultaneously from all of mouse dorsolateral neocortex, facilitating identification of widespread neural ensembles with activity related to diverse aspects of behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent advances in large-scale neural recording technology, such as widefield imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallero-Salas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esmaeili et al., 2021</xref>), large field-of-view (FOV) 2-photon (2p) imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sofroniew et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2022</xref>), and Neuropixels high-density extracellular electrophysiology recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>) have allowed for rapid advancement in our understanding of the relationships between brain-wide neural activity and both spontaneous and task-engaged behavior in mice. For example, these techniques can now be deployed in recently developed behavioral paradigms that allow for the temporal separation of periods during which cortical activity is dominated by activity related to stimulus representation, choice/decision, maintenance of choice, and response or implementation of choice during different intra-trial epochs of 2-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) discrimination tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2014</xref>), the standardization of training and performance analysis across laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguillon-Rodriguez et al., 2021</xref>; eLife), and the separation of context-dependent rule representation and choice in a working memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>One of the striking features of neocortical neuronal activity is how strongly changes in behavioral state, such as task engagement, movement, or arousal, affect the spontaneous and evoked activity of neurons within visual, auditory, somatosensory, motor and other cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). However, this is not to say that these effects are uniform across the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morandell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Neurons exhibit diversity in the dependence of their neural activity on arousal and behavioral state both between and within cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shimaoka et al., 2018</xref>), and these areas are active at different times during a rewarded task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salkoff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esmaeili et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallero-Salas et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the arousal dependence of membrane potential across cortical areas has been shown to be diverse and predictable by a temporally filtered readout of pupil diameter and walking speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shimaoka et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>For this reason, directly combining and/or comparing the correlations between behavior and neural activity across regions imaged in separate sessions may not reveal the true differences in the relationship between behavior and neural activity across cortical areas, due to a âtemporal filtering effectâ. In other words, the correlations between behavior and neural activity in each region appear to depend on the exact time since the behavior began (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shimaoka et al., 2018</xref>). In our view, this makes the simultaneous recording of multiple cortical areas essential for proper comparison of the dependencies of their neural activities on arousal/movement, because only then are the distributions of behavioral state dwell times the same across cortical areas.</p><p>Areas involved in sensory decision making are often far from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallero-Salas et al., 2021</xref>) and can exhibit coordinated state-dependent changes in functional coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clancy et al., 2019</xref>). Also, multimodal sensory information is multiplexed and combined as it ascends across the cortical hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coen et al., 2023</xref>). For these reasons, understanding the brain activity underlying optimal performance during multimodal, task-engaged behavior will require dense sampling of many brain areas at single neuron resolution across lateral, dorsal, and frontal cortices simultaneously at a temporal resolution high enough to describe both spontaneous behavioral state transitions and the neural dynamics relevant for a given task.</p><p>Dense intra-cortical sampling at a fixed depth/cortical layer across many areas is not possible with current Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>), 1-photon (1p) widefield imaging can be contaminated by neuropil and hemodynamic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waters, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valley et al., 2020</xref>) and typically does not achieve single cell resolution (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kauvar et al., 2020</xref>), and standard 2p imaging is limited by scanning speed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong et al., 2015</xref>) and field of view spatial extent (FOV; i.e. simultaneously imageable, either contiguous or non-contiguous, regions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hattori et al., 2019</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Note that although some recent advances in 1p widefield imaging have allowed for the imaging of individual cells, both in head-fixed and freely moving mice, they do not achieve true single cell resolution in practice (they get close to ~10 Î¼m xy or âlateralâ resolution, with undefined z or âdepthâ resolution) and rely in part on the sparse labeling of neurons with Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators either within or across cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hope et al., 2023</xref>, bioRxiv; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Recent advancements in cranial window preparations have enabled imaging over large portions of the dorsal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stringer et al., 2023</xref>, bioRxiv). However, simultaneous 2p imaging over a large cortical area including both dorsal and lateral regions, particularly in a preparation that allows for simultaneous imaging of the major primary sensory cortices (auditory, visual, and somatosensory) and frontal motor/choice areas (M1, M2) in awake, behaving mice has not been previously shown.</p><p>Here, we developed a set of new techniques and integrated them with existing technologies in order to overcome the limitations of current state-of-the-art methods and provide the first pan-cortical 2p assays at single-cell resolution in awake, behaving mice.

The objective can rotate +/-20 degrees medio-laterally, if needed, to optimize imaging of any portion of the cortex under the cranial window.

Fixed arm (top) has flat proximal angle at bend near dual-screw headpost mounting slot (right red arrow), and can be mounted on a Thorlabs 1-inch diameter post mounted to a rotating ball-joint base (SL20, see Supplementary methods and materials) to achieve leftward 22.5 degree rotation for side mount (not shown). Flexible positioning on wheel is possible due to Â¼ââ20 bolt accepting slot that allows support posts to be positioned closer to or farther from headpost mounting slot (left red arrow). Custom adjustable arm (bottom) has rotating brass shaft attached to ball-and-socket joint with hexagonal tightening ring (top, long black arrow), stabilized by dual set screws on both ends (bottom, two short black arrows), at a bend proximal to the headpost mounting slot. This allows for rapid, fixable on-rig fine adjustment of the mounting angle in all directions, and eliminates the need for a Thorlabs rotating ball-joint base so that 1â diameter vertical posts can be used (instead of Â½â diameter, which we used at first), thus enhancing overall stability for imaging.

Both headposts are attached with two 82 degree countersunk 2â56 thread 1 â 4 '' stainless steel screws (McMaster-Carr, see Supplementary methods and materials) and positioned in a custom machined slot within the support arm for enhanced stability. The headpost arm can easily be held within the support arm slot by thumb prior to screw affixation during mounting.

Flat shields (top left, bottom left) are attached with 1:1 rapid curing Sylgard (top right; 170 Fast Cure encapsulant, see Supplementary methods and materials) to the perimeter of the headpost. Stable positioning during curing is enabled by attachment of dual 3-pronged lab clamps attached to left and right support arms with quick ties (not shown). Then, a tip-clipped transfer pipette is used to add deionized or Millipure water to the window, with the Sylgard acting as a dam, until the objective can be lowered far enough to raise a meniscus. Additional water can then be added from either side of the preparation under the objective.

Given that arousal state- and movement-related activity appears to be a ubiquitous feature of cortical activity across all regions, it would be advantageous to develop methodologies that allow for simultaneous, single neuron resolution, contiguous monitoring of neuronal activity during second-to-second movements and changes in arousal, during both spontaneous and trained behaviors. Here, we harness new imaging and analysis technologies in order to both address this methodological gap and provide a proof of principle test of these methods by examining the relationship of behavioral arousal and movement to detailed spatial patterns of neural activity across the dorsal and lateral neocortex.</p><p>The overall workflow for our mouse preparations, data acquisition, and data analysis can be found in the following supplementary document: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/pancortical_workflow_diagrams.pdf">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/pancortical_workflow_diagrams.pdf</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vickers, 2024b</xref>.

We chose this form of data collection for use in head-fixed mice because it allows for: (1) rapid scanning (i.e. it uses a resonant scanner coupled to a virtually conjugated galvo pair) over a large (5x5 mm fully corrected, or up to 6x6 mm imageable), field-curvature corrected field of view (FOV); (2) subcellular resolution in the z-axis to avoid region-of-interest (ROI) contamination by neuropil and neighboring cells (0.61 x 0.61 x 4.25 Âµm xyz point-spread function at 970 nm laser excitation wavelength); (3) correction for aberrations at all wavelengths between 900â1070 nm, to allow for combined imaging of multiple fluorophores. We achieved these three objectives in head-fixed mice that were able to walk freely on a running wheel (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, and Video 6), to clearly view visual monitors on both sides, and to lick either of two water spouts (left, right) for 2-alternative forced choice responses, while we performed left, right, and rear videography to monitor each mouseâs face, pupil, and body.</p><p>The neuronal imaging methodology we chose (see below) is not the only one available. For example, another promising and recently developed alternative implementation, Diesel 2p, allows for similarly flexible and large FOV imaging at single-cell resolution, but with a significantly higher z-axis point-spread function (~8â10 Âµm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Despite this drawback, its use of dual scan engines allows for true simultaneous imaging of different cortical areas, while the 2p RAM mesoscope (Thorlabs) accomplishes this by rapid jumping (~1 ms) between FOVs. Both systems offer excellent corrected field curvatures on the order of +/-25 Âµm over ~5 mm.</p><p>Several primary design constraints needed to be met to achieve our goal of monitoring neuronal activity over a large portion of the mouse lateral and/or dorsal cortices. These ranged from aspects of the surgical preparation, mounting, and imaging, to neural recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>, Protocols II-III). To increase the extent of the neocortex over which we could monitor neural activity, we developed two distinct headpost/cranial window preparations. In the first, the dorsal mount, the mouse is head-fixed upright on a cylindrical running wheel and the objective is vertical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Here, both wings of the headpost are attached to support arms, and each support arm is mounted on two vertical 1â diameter posts secured with flexing feet for maximum stability. This preparation allowed for monitoring of neural activity over large regions of both cerebral hemispheres, from the posterior aspects of visual cortex to the anterior aspects of motor cortex, and laterally to the dorsal-most aspects of auditory cortex, depending on the placement of the 2p mesoscope objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>The second preparation, the side mount, required the head of the mouse to be rotated 22.5<sup>o</sup> to the left (or right, not shown), with the microscope objective vertical or tilted 1â5 degrees to the right, so as to extend the 5x5 mm imaging FOV to include the auditory cortex and other neighboring ventral/lateral cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and e</xref>). For the side mount, the headpost had only a single, left wing so that the right side of the mouseâs face would not be occluded. The deep lateral/ventral extent of the side mount headpost prevented easy addition of a right headpost wing. Attaching the left wing to a single support arm supported by two 1â diameter vertical posts mounted with flexing feet, as in the dorsal mount preparation, was sufficient to minimize movement artifacts. A key additional difference to note here is that two small screws were used to attach the left wing of the side mount headpost to the support arm, thus giving it additional stability. The dorsal mount preparation used only one screw (the outermost hole) on each of the left and right side headpost wings. Thus, both preparations were secured by a total of two mounting screws, each countersunk into headpost arms. An important design feature is that the headpost wings fit into recessed rectangular slots machined into the support arms, facilitating stability.</p><p>We observed that mice adapt well to head tilt in the side mount preparation, and will readily whisk, walk or run, and learn to perform lick response tasks in this configuration. Keeping the microscope objective in a vertical or near-vertical orientation, and rotating the mouseâs head (instead of rotating the objective), significantly improved the manageability of the water meniscus between the objective and the cranial window. However, if needed, the objective of the Thorlabs mesoscope may be rotated laterally up to +/- 20<sup>o</sup> for direct access to more ventral cortical areas, for example if one wants to use a smaller, flat cortical window that requires the objective to be positioned orthogonally to the target region. In general, setups such as Sutterâs MOM system and Thorlabsâ Bergamo microscope, which offer even greater degrees of microscope objective rotation, would allow enhanced versatility with our preparations.</p><p>Preliminary comparisons across mice indicated that side and dorsal mount mice showed a similar degree of behavioral variability both within and across sessions. An example of the relative ease with which mice adapted to the ~22.5 degree neck rotation can be seen in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref> and Video 10. It was in general important to make sure that the distance between the wheel and all four limbs was similar when using either preparation. In particular, careful attention must be paid to the positioning of the front limbs in the side mount mice so that they are not too high off the wheel. This can be accomplished by a slight forward angling of the left support arm. With dorsal mount mice, it was important to not place them too close to the wheel, in which case they would exert pressure on the headpost and support arms, leading to increased movement artifacts, or too far above the wheel, which can significantly reduce walking bout frequency.</p><p>Although it was in principle possible to image the side mount preparation in the same optical configuration without rotating the mouse (by rotating the objective to 20 degrees to the right), we found that the last 2â3 degrees of unavailable, yet necessary, rotation (our preparation is rotated 22.5 degrees left, which is more than the full available 20 degrees rotation of the objective), along with several other factors, made this undesirable. First, it was difficult or impractical to attach the horizontal light shield and to establish a water meniscus with the objective fully rotated. One could use gel instead of water (although, in our hands, gel was optically inferior), but without the horizontal light shield, light from the UV and IR LEDs can reach the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) via the objective and contaminate the image or cause tripping of the PMT. Second, imaging the right pupil and face of the mouse was difficult under these conditions because the camera would need the same optical access angle as the objective, or would need to be moved down toward the air table and rotated up 20 degrees, in which case its view would be blocked by the running wheel and other objects mounted on the air table. A system of mirrors for imaging the animal could be used to overcome this problem, but would further complicate the current setup.</p><p>Cortical imaging in the novel side mount preparation was restricted to one hemisphere and a thin medial strip (~1 mm wide) of the contralateral hemisphere. This allowed for imaging from roughly the anterio-medial areas of V1 to medial and medio-lateral secondary regions of motor cortex (or slightly farther, if the anterior-posterior axis of the brain is oriented along the diagonal of the 5x5 mm FOV, or if one images to the full allowable but partially uncorrected 6x6 mm extent with ScanImage). This anterior-posterior reach was similar to that observed in the dorsal mount preparation. However, the side mount windowing and the accompanying mounting procedure significantly increased our ability to image neural activity in lateral (ventral) cortical aspects, including auditory, somatosensory, and association cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), notably without the need for substantial rotation of the objective.</p><p>To achieve 2p neuronal imaging from broad cortical regions, we created large and stable, custom (designed in AutoDesk Inventor) 3D-printed titanium (laser sintered powder with active cooling and shot-peened post-processing) headposts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d, e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1e, f</xref>; Suppl Design Files; i.materialise.com and sculpteo.com) and glass (0.21 mm thick, Schott D263T) cranial windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a, c, d, e, and f</xref> ; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>; Suppl Design files: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vickers, 2024a</xref>); Labmaker.org for dorsal mount; TLC International for cutting, and GlasWerk for bending, for the side mount and early prototypes of the dorsal mount). We incorporated these custom made headposts and cranial windows into the dorsal mount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref> upper, d upper left, e), and side mount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b, e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a, c, lower, d, lower left and right, and f, upper right</xref>) preparations. The dorsal mount preparation allowed for imaging over roughly the same extent of bilateral dorsal cortex as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>, although we were able to image up to ~25 mm<sup>2</sup> at a time, compared to the more typical maximum 2p FOV of ~1 mm<sup>2</sup>. In addition, the area of bilateral cortex imageable with this preparation is comparable to that of many recent studies employing widefield 1-photon imaging, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musall et al., 2019</xref>. The side mount preparation allowed for imaging of an extent of right hemisphere comparable to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esmaeili et al., 2021</xref>, although they used through-the-skull widefield 1-photon imaging, while our cranial window preparation allows for either widefield 1-photon imaging, or single neuron resolution 2p imaging, in the same mouse.</p><p>To mimic the curvature of the brain and reduce tissue compression, which is a problem with flat coverslips with a diameter larger than ~3 mm, cranial windows were curved by heating pre-cut (TLC International) glass pieces over 9 or 10 mm bend-radius molds (GlasWerk). The bend radius (i.e. radius of half cylinder mold over which the melted glass is bent to achieve its curved shape) was fixed at 10 mm for Labmaker.org dorsal mount windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1e</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; early attempts with 11 or 12 mm bend radii failed for all but the largest adult male mice). For windows custom designed in collaboration with GlasWerk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1f</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), the bend radius was set at either 9 mm, for a tight fit to ventral auditory areas, or at 10 mm, to enable simultaneous imaging of the entire preparation at a single focal depth. In our experience, successful cranial windows last between 100 and 150 days, or in some rare cases up to 300 days: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/window_preparation_stability.pdf">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/window_preparation_stability.pdf</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vickers, 2024b</xref>. The keys to this stability were even pressure across the surface of the window, complete enclosure of the glass-skull interface with flow-it, causing minimal damage to the dura during the craniotomy, and constant attention to the minimization of infection either across the surface of the skull, between the headpost and window surgeries, or around the external perimeter of the headpost, after the window surgery (See Protocol III and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The success rate for window implantation, for both dorsal mount and side mount preparations, was around ~65% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1g</xref>; see also Protocol III). However, with extensive practice this can be raised to be closer to 75â80%, especially if care is taken to both maximize the area of the craniotomy and to leave the dental cement attaching the headpost to the skull undamaged during drilling, so that the perimeter of the window fits fully inside the craniotomy, the window âfloatsâ or sits freely directly on the surface of the brain, and the headpost remains firmly attached to the skull. This was accomplished in later iterations of our designs and methods by making the side mount window slightly smaller at the anterior edge of M2, and by using an adjustable support arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>, lower) mounted on a small breadboard attached underneath the base of the stereotax in order to fix the mouse in its 22.5 degree left-rotated position during the window surgery so that it would not move or vibrate during drilling of the craniotomy. This also acted to minimize âbreak-throughsâ of the drill bit tip through the skull and into the brain.</p><p>The main causes of death during cranial window surgery were exsanguination during the surgery following a ruptured major blood vessel on the surface of the brain (either sagittal or lateral, usually), damage to the dura caused by the skull during the removal step of the craniotomy or by the sharp tip of a tool used to remove the skull, failure to properly pressurize the window across the entire cortical surface, or failure to completely seal the window to the skull fragment around its entire perimeter with flow-it (here, rapid UV light application during flow-it application can help). In some cases where the mouse survived the window surgery it was still considered a failure if a bleed re-erupted and occluded at least 30% of the window, or if glue occluded at least 30% of the window either above or below the surface of the window. In general, most bleeds cleared, on their own, by cerebrospinal fluid within a week if there was no direct clotting on the surface of the brain.</p><p>Changes in vasculature following cranial window surgery were usually minimal but could involve the following: (i) sometimes a vessel is displaced or moved during the window surgery, (ii) sometimes a vessel, in particular the sagittal sinus, will enlarge or increase its apparent diameter over time if it is not properly pressured by the cranial window, and (iii) sometimes an area experiencing window pressure that is too low will, over time, show outgrowth of fine vascular endings. The most common of these was (i), and (iii) is perhaps the least common. In general the vasculature is quite stable, and window preparations that we observed to be of high quality at ~1 week post-surgery showed minimal changes over the first ~150 days (see supplementary materials: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/window_preparation_stability.pdf">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/window_preparation_stability.pdf</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vickers, 2024b</xref>).</p><p>Within a field of view of 5x5 mm, curvature of the brain, especially in the mediolateral direction, is a significant problem. To partially compensate for brain curvature, online field-curvature correction (FCC) was applied in ScanImage (Vidrio Technologies, MBF Biosciences) during mesoscope image acquisition. In addition, complementary fast-z âsawtoothâ or âstepâ corrections were applied when all ROIs were acquired at the same or different z-planes, respectively (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sofroniew et al., 2016</xref>). Despite this, small uncorrected discrepancies in the depth of the imaging plane below the pial surface may have remained, especially along the long-axis of acquisition ROIs in the side mount preparation (i.e. mediolateral). It is likely that optical effects of the curvature of the glass partially compensated for these differences in targeted imaging depth (i.e. by refraction to normalize approach of the laser to the pial surface), although we did not quantify this effect. In cases where we imaged multiple small ROIs, nominal imaging depth was adjusted in an attempt to maintain a constant relative cortical layer depth (i.e. depth below the pial surface).</p><p>We estimate that we experienced ~200 Î¼m of depth offset across 2.5 mm. If the objective is orthogonal to our 10 mm bend window and centered at the apex of its convexity, a small ROI located at the lateral edge of the side mount preparation would need to be positioned around 200 Î¼m below that of an equivalent ROI placed near the apex, and would be at close to the same depth as an ROI placed at or near the midline, at the medial edge of the window. We determined this by examining the geometry of our cranial windows in CAD drawings (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/tree/main/cranial_windows">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/tree/main/cranial_windows</ext-link>), and by comparing z-depth information from adjacent sessions in the same mouse, the first of which used a large FOV and the second of which used multiple small FOVs optimized so that they sampled from the same cortical layers across areas.</p><p>The mouse was restrained by fixation of the headpost with two countersunk screws to either a fixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>, top) or adjustable aluminum support arm (custom; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>, bottom) and mounting apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). For the dorsal mount preparation, two headpost support arms, one on each side of the head, were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>, top; outer screw of both headpost wings used) while for the side mount preparation, a single, left side support arm was sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, bottom; inner and outer screws in the left headpost wing were both used). It was important to fix the headpost mounting arms to the top of the airtable with 1-inch diameter vertical mounting posts (Thorlabs RS6P8, RSH4, PF175), making sure all joints were clean of debris and tightened securely, to reduce movement artifacts.</p><p>To further minimize movement artifacts, it was also important to mount the mouse at a distance from the surface of the running wheel that was not too low, which would allow the mouse to push up with its legs, or too high, so that part of the mouseâs body weight would be supported by the headpost. A final consideration to minimize movement artifacts was to ensure that proper, even pressure was maintained across the entire interface between the brain and the cranial window during window implantation, both by making the craniotomy large enough so that the entire window could be set freely on the brain surface, and by using the 3D-printed window stabilizer properly during the application of flow-it glue to attach the edge of the window to the skull (see Protocols II, III).</p><p>Both preparations were found to be relatively free of vibration and movement artifacts and allowed for micro-adjustments (i.e. pitch, yaw, and roll) of the mouse relative to both the objective and the running wheel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b and c</xref>). Increased positioning flexibility of the support-arm assembly was achieved through either of two ways: (1) by positioning it on a distal base-attached ball-joint mount (Thorlabs, SL20 articulating base; not shown); (2) through the use of a custom adjustable headpost support arm that was proximally adjusted around a ball-and-joint assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>, bottom). This adjustable support arm operated through the use of a custom wrench and reverse-threaded (left-handed) nut for initial coarse tightening, and a micro-clamp for rotational stabilization during tightening. Four micro-hex wrench driven set-screws, two on either side of the ball-and-joint fitting, were used to achieve the final, fully locked state for imaging. The adjustable support arm was found to be superior to the base-attached ball joint mount in allowing for iterative micro-positioning of the animal in relation to the running wheel, objective, and lick spouts after initial fixation (mounting) of the headstage to the support bar.</p><p>In order to perform 2p neuronal imaging, the large 2p-RAM water-immersion objective (~10x net magnification, 0.6 NA, ~1.3 kg, 12 mm diameter tip, 25.6 mm shaft) must be positioned between 2.2 and 2.8 mm (i.e. ~working distance minus window thickness) from the curved glass surface of the cranial window while maintaining a stable water meniscus. Providing a base for the water meniscus while also blocking incident light entry was achieved by creating a custom 3D printed plastic light shield (AutoDesk Inventor, MakerGear M3 printer, PLA) that was attached to the protruding, fitted rim of the headpost with 170 FAST CURE Sylgard (âwok oneâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c, d</xref>). A second light shield (âwok twoâ) served to further block extraneous light entry into the objective and was attached to the base of the lower light shield (âwok oneâ) by fitting of a U-shaped profile over a vertically protruding single edge profile along the perimeter of the first, lower light shield (âwok oneâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>Together, these two custom-printed light shields prevented incident light (from the video stimulus monitor, the ultraviolet LEDs used for controlling the baseline and dynamic range of pupil diameter, and the infrared LEDs used to illuminate the mouse) from entering the imaging objective and thereby either contaminating the image or tripping the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Line-of-sight for the animal to the video stimulus monitor was retained, and this design allowed for free vertical and rotational (over a limited range) movement of the objective lens, which was contacted directly only by the water meniscus.</p><p>Direct left, right, and posterior camera angles, or âlines of sightâ, were preserved to enable reliable recording and proper illumination of pupil diameter, whisker pad movement, and the movement of other body parts such as the nose, mouth, ear, paws, and tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>; see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Placement of the rotated mouse in the side mount preparation near the left side of the running wheel allowed for the animalâs left and right fields of view to not be significantly obstructed. Adjustable positioning of two vertically and laterally offset conductance-based lick spouts for 2-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) task performance (lick left, lick right) and reward delivery was achieved with a rapidly translatable motorized linear stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; 63.7ms total travel time over 7 mm; Zaber Technologies). This system allowed for rapid withdrawal of lick spouts between trials, and presentation of the lick spouts during the response period of each trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pseudo-widefield imaging and optogenetic stimulation hardware modifications of the Thorlabs 2-photon mesoscope</title><p>Examining neuronal activity at the single cell level and relating it to stimulus-evoked activity observed at the widefield level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), as well as manipulating regions of the cortex through localized light delivery and optogenetics (see Video 11), required precise optical alignment across all three of these methods.

Finally, the spatial coordinate system of the 1p opto-stimulation laser routed in through an auxiliary light-path of the mesoscope needed to be aligned to that of the 2p laser so that specific cortical subregions could be targeted for optogenetic inhibition by light activated, ChR2-mediated excitation of parvalbumin interneurons in Thy1-RGECO x PV-Cre x Ai32 mice (Video 11).</p><p>In order to align 2p maps of single neuron activity with functional 1p cortical maps determined through pseudo-widefield imaging (i.e. combined reflected and fluorescence light imaging with a standard ânon-widefieldâ format CCD camera), we designed a method for reliably aligning a standardized cortical map (i.e. the Allen CCF v3.0; we used either a 0 degree, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/python_code/CCF_map_rotation/0deg/CCF_MMM.png">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/python_code/CCF_map_rotation/0deg/CCF_MMM.png</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vickers, 2024b</xref>, or 22.5 degree, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/python_code/CCF_map_rotation/22deg/CCF_MMM.png">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/python_code/CCF_map_rotation/22deg/CCF_MMM.png</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vickers, 2024b</xref>, rotated CCF map outline created with the following code: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/python_code/CCF_map_rotation/Rotate_CCF.py">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/python_code/CCF_map_rotation/Rotate_CCF.py</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vickers, 2024b</xref>), to an image of the cortical vasculature pattern, which can be directly visualized with both widefield and 2p imaging techniques for each brain (see Protocol V). The epifluorescence light source (Excelitas) for the pseudo-widefield imaging, which was parfocal with the 2p imaging coordinate system, was controllable by a dial, shutter, and remote foot-pedal for optimal ease of positioning the objective in the water meniscus at a distance of ~2.2 mm from the headpost and cranial window without crashing into the preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1d</xref>, top and bottom right). This allowed us to âdriveâ the position of the 2p mesoscope FOV to the desired Allen CCF cortical area by moving the objective to a location where the observed vasculature pattern matched that of a processed image we created ahead of time on our 1-photon widefield imaging rig that combined vasculature, sensory responses, and skull landmarks from each mouse.</p><p>This technique required several modifications of the auxiliary light-paths of the Thorlabs mesoscope, and would also likely involve similar modifications in other comparable microscope setups, such as Diesel 2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu et al., 2021</xref>).

This allowed for 2p imaging and blue 1p laser optogenetic stimulation to occur pseudo-simultaneously, because rapid, electronic control of the PMT1 and PMT2 shutters was able to limit interruption of image acquisition to a brief period during presentation of the optogenetic stimulus (~100 ms; see Video 11; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/mesoscope_optical_path_opto_switching.pdf">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/mesoscope_optical_path_opto_switching.pdf</ext-link>). Here, replacement of the switchable mirror behind the objective, which blocked 2p imaging during pseudo-widefield imaging in our original configuration, with a dichroic that, when positioned in the light path, allowed both 920 nm (2p excitation) and 473 nm (opto-excitation) light to reach the mouse brain without requiring any additional slow switching of optical components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Reduction of resonant scanner noise</title><p>Resonant scanners in 2p microscopes emit intense sound at the resonant mirror frequency, which is well within the hearing range of mice (~12.5 kHz emitted in the Thorlabs mesoscope).

By comparison, encasements designed using standard 3D-design and printing techniques (i.e. not based on a 3D scan) were, in our hands, only able to achieve a noise reduction of ~30 dB, to a level still audible to both mice and humans. This difference was due to the enhanced precision of encasement fit enabled by using the 3D-scanned map of the microscopeâs surface contours.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cortical alignment to the common coordinate framework (CCF) v3.0 map</title><p>Interpretation of the diversity of activity of thousands of neurons simultaneously identifiable with the mesoscope requires proper cortical areal localization, including that of areas anatomically or functionally distant from primary sensory cortices.

For example, running typically enhances the gain of visually evoked responses in the mouse primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>), while it significantly decreases that of evoked auditory responses in primary auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Assessing such potential differences between functionally distinct, and potentially distant, cortical areas required simultaneous imaging across multiple cortical regions while maintaining adequate imaging speed, quality, and resolution. To achieve this level of 2p imaging across several millimeters of cerebral cortex (e.g. from visual to motor or auditory cortical areas), we first sought to optimize the parameters of our mesoscope imaging methods and protocols.</p><p>Conventional 2p imaging using a preparation similar to our dorsal mount (âCrystal Ckullâ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) previously employed serial acquisition of ~1 x 1 mm FOVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Other 2p Thorlabs mesoscope imaging studies have used acquisition protocols targeting z-stacks of 600x600 Âµm FOVs in barrel cortex (3 planes at 7 Hz, 1.17 Âµm/pixel; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peron et al., 2015</xref>), 900x935 Âµm FOVs in visual cortex (11 planes at ~1 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>), and three adjacent 600x1800 Âµm FOVs in CA1 hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2023</xref>; bioRxiv). Here, with our dorsal and side mount preparations, we were able to routinely image between 2000 and 7600 neurons per session over up to ~25 mm<sup>2</sup> of dorsal cortex simultaneously at ~3 Hz with a resolution of 5 Âµm/pixel in GCaMP6s mice (combined total in both preparations for all large-FOV sessions: N=17 mice, n=91 sessions, ~350,000 neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-94167-video8.mp4" id="video8"><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>Dorsal mount.</title><p>Titanium 3D printed headpost shown from above, with paraformaldehyde-fixed mouse brain shown beneath custom cranial window, colored Allen CCF outlines, and an example 5 x 4.62 mm mesoscope FOV corresponding to data in this video shown inside an inset box indicated by a white dashed line.

Red arrowheads indicate co-alignment of transient arousal increases accompanied by walking, whisking, and pupil dilation, with diverse changes in neural activity across rastermap, PC1-, and PC2-sorted ensembles.</p></caption></media><p>In order to achieve spatially broad and dense sampling, while monitoring changing activity in each neuron as frequently as possible, we typically tiled seven mediolaterally aligned 5000x660 Âµm FOVs (i.e. mechanical scanning along a long-axis oriented mediolaterally, combined with fast resonant-scanning across multiple short-axes oriented anterior-posterior) over either posterior-medial, posterior-lateral, or anterior dorsal, cortex at a pial depth of ~200â300 Âµm (cortical layers 2/3). Bidirectional scanning (with a scan-phase correction of between -0.9 and -1.0) and field-curvature correction were typically enabled, with a 1-5 ms âflybackâ and âframeâ time, which are defined in ScanImage as the time delay for retargeting of the laser from the end of one line or frame acquisition to the beginning of the next, respectively. Here, there is a trade-off between longer flyback times, which reduce imaging speed but minimize positioning errors at the beginning of each scan line or ROI, and shorter values, which accelerate overall imaging acquisition speed but increase these positioning errors.</p><p>We typically imaged GCaMP6s fluorescence in awake, behaving mice at an excitation wavelength of 920 nm with 60â95 mW power calibrated at the pia over 20â90 min sessions, with little to no bleaching or change in baseline fluorescence. Suite2p reliably extracted neurons with &gt;0.9 classifier probabilities, and nearly completely (i.e. to less than 0.1 pixels) removed x-y movement artifacts with uncorrected, raw principal components of up to ~1.3 pixels (i.e. up to ~15% of a 20â40 Âµm, or 4â8 pixels, diameter neuron at an imaging resolution of 0.2 Âµm/pixel, reduced to less than 0.5 Âµm or 1â2% of the diameter of a neuron after combined rigid and non-rigid motion correction; see Video 11).</p><p>To further control for z-movement artifacts (whose correction is intractable post-acquisition under normal scanning conditions) we also occasionally used GPU-enabled online fast-z motion correction (42/52 large FOV side mount sessions, and 9/39 large FOV dorsal mount sessions, used online z-correction) with ScanImage (Vidrio Technologies, LLC). This was only possible, in our hands, during multi-frame imaging when all frames were acquired at the same z-level. Quality of post-hoc motion-corrected dF/F traces and correlations with behavioral variables did not appear, by eye, to be different under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1a vs b</xref>; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/tree/main/online_fast_z_correction">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/tree/main/online_fast_z_correction</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vickers, 2024b</xref>), as both types of sessions contained similar mixtures of neurons with both walk-bout dependent and independent activity, for example. Because the z-motion correction did not lead to large qualitative differences in neural activity and its relationship to behavioral primitives, both types of session are used interchangeably here.</p><p>In order to confirm neural region-of-interest (ROI) selection (i.e. each neuron as identified by a spatiotemporal footprint in Suite2p), increase scan speed, and correct our cortical layer 2/3 targeting for the effects of brain curvature, we also routinely imaged in random access mode with 4â6 small FOVs (660â1320 x 660 Âµm) positioned over visual (V1), somatosensory (S1), retrosplenial (RSpl), posterior parietal (PPC), and/or motor (MOs_pm, MOs_am, and/or MOs_al - ALM) cortices at independently controlled z-levels, with an imaging speed of 4â10 Hz and a resolution of 1.0â2.0 Âµm/pixel (see Protocol I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2d, e</xref>). These multi-FOV sessions yielded hundreds of high quality neurons per FOV, at a density roughly twice that of the lower resolution sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2c vs d</xref>).</p><p>Uncontrolled image motion due to the movement of behaving animals is a significant impediment to image quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>). We have taken significant care in our headpost design and fixation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1aâf</xref>, and Supplementary methods and materials) so that our preparations are highly stable, such that motion-corrected or âregisteredâ movies showed very little to no residual movement in either large FOV, low-resolution, or multiple small FOV, high-resolution sessions (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>; Video 11). Furthermore, movement-related neural activities across neighboring detected ROIs in large FOV, low-resolution sessions were correlated but non-identical upon detailed examination, and differed from dF/F Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence fluctuations detected in nearby non-ROI and blood-vessel regions of similar cross-sectional area (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>; Video 11), thus strongly suggesting that it was non-artifactual. In theory, movement artifact signals should be relatively time-locked or nearly synchronous across cortical regions during vigorous walking or movement. However, we did not observe this in our preparations.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-94167-video9.mp4" id="video9"><label>Video 9.</label><caption><title>Example two-dimensional field of view (FOV) rendered movie and insert from an example session where factorial hidden Markov modeling showed near global synchrony of PC1 loading during walking bouts in a side mount mouse.</title><p>A 5 x 5 mm full FOV movie (~10x real-time) is shown at top left, with a 1 x 1 mm inset (white dashed box) expanded and shown at bottom left.

Actual behavioral arousal and movement primitives are shown as traces below (walk = red, whisk = blue, pupil = gray). Note that walk-related activity changes are correlated with independent fluctuations across the three example neurons, and furthermore that blood vessel fluctuations are small and not movement-locked, consistent with the idea that neurobehavioral activity alignment in this case, even with detected transient global synchrony across the first PC of activity, is not driven by brain movement artifact.</p></caption></media><p>These findings, therefore, gave us confidence that neural activity changes detected during spontaneous movements of the mouse were due to real changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence within each neuron, and not to movements of the brain causing the neuron to shift into or out of each Suite2p-defined ROI and leading to artifactual fluorescence transients (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>; Video 11, which use blood vessels and inactive fluorophore/neuropil, respectively, as examples of the lack of significant movement-driven artifactual transients in GCaMP6s(-) structures in our preparations). In other studies, performed using the same setup and methods as those applied here, we have demonstrated that non-activity dependent fluorescent markers, such as the expression of a non-activity dependent fluorescent marker mCherry in cholinergic or noradrenergic axons, or autofluorescent blebs, exhibit no significant movement-related changes in fluorescence, indicating that movement artifacts are minimal in our preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2023</xref>). It should be noted that axonal diameters are on the order of ~1 Âµm or less - this is significantly smaller than the diameter of the neuronal cell bodies (~15â30 Âµm) imaged here. Axons, therefore, are a more stringent test of the stability of our imaging preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Modulation of neural activity by spontaneous movements and arousal as observed with the dorsal mount preparation</title><p>Recent work has shown that sorting fluorescence based 2p GCaMP cortical neuronal activity with an algorithm called Rastermap is a powerful method to reveal clusters of cells that exhibit similar patterns of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stringer et al., 2023</xref>, bioRxiv). An example of such sorting of our data for a dorsal mount session of 3096 neurons is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> (top). This method for one-dimensional nonlinear embedding works by sorting and clustering of ROIs (i.e. neurons) by similarity of neural activity patterns across multiple timescales, using k-means clustering, sorting by asymmetric similarity as defined by peak cross-correlations at non-negative timelags, and upsampling of individual cluster activities in principal components space to allow sorting within clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stringer et al., 2023</xref>, bioRxiv). Here, sorting with Rastermap revealed clustering of neurons with clearly distinguishable activity patterns that exhibited heterogeneous relationships to the behavioral primitive arousal/movement variables of walk speed, whisker motion energy, and pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a, top, and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>).</p><p>The activity generated by these thousands of neurons was clearly not random, with sub-groups of cells exhibiting similar activity patterns. Many neurons exhibited activity that appeared to be coupled to walking/whisking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> top, b). It has previously been shown that the first principal component of cortical neuronal activity is highly correlated with movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, sorting our neurons based on degree of activity loading onto their first two principal components (i.e. neurons at the top of the sort have the largest amount of activity accounted for by the first principal component of activity across the entire population) revealed several distinct patterns of activity. The first principal component, PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, middle) demonstrated a clear relationship to walking/whisking, such that some neurons were strongly activated in association with movement (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and c1 in PC1, middle, and c, top</xref>), while other neurons appeared to be deactivated during movement bouts (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and c2 in PC1, middle, and c, bottom</xref>).</p><p>Closer examination revealed that some manually selected Rastermap and PC1 clusters were active primarily during walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, top, d1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, middle, c1, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, d1) and/or whisking, with either transient or sustained activity, while others were either active during low arousal periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, middle, c2) or appeared to display a combination of ON/OFF transient whisking-related activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, top, d2, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, right; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In the illustrated example, alignment of marked increases and decreases in bulk population neural activity to eight brief walking bouts and whisking bouts in the absence of walking (red and blue arrowheads, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4aâc</xref>), both of which were accompanied by pupil dilations, was more clearly seen following ROI sorting by first and second principal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> middle and bottom; PC1 and PC2, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) than in Rastermap sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, top). In particular, PC1 seemed to sort neurons by transient walk and whisk activity, while PC2 appeared to sort neurons according to a more sustained component of whisking activity.</p><p>Interestingly, separation of the top and bottom fifth of neurons in the example data set sorted by PC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> middle, c1 and c2, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> top and bottom, respectively) showed large groups of neurons with clear positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c1</xref>, top) and negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c2</xref>, bottom) correlations with arousal/movement, as demonstrated by alignment of rasterized neural activity with walk and whisker transients, and local maxima in pupil diameter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). These separate groups of âONâ and âOFFâ neurons were not as well identified when sorting by PC2. Specifically, neurons with high PC1 values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c1</xref>) showed elevated activity during periods of increased arousal/movement, while neurons with low PC1 values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c2</xref>) showed depressed activity levels during these periods. Subsets of these neurons showed either elevated basal activity with a suppression of activity during periods of enhanced arousal and/or movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c2</xref>, top of Rastermap), or transient increased activity leading up to movement/arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c2</xref>, bottom of Rastermap), followed by transient suppression (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>).</p><p>Examination of individual ârawâ dF/F traces confirmed that these differences were not due to artifacts of z-scoring or superneuron averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stringer et al., 2023</xref>, bioRxiv) in the PC and Rastermap sorted displays (not shown). The term âsuperneuronâ here refers to the fact that when Rastermap displays more than ~1000 neurons it averages the activity of each group of adjacent 50 neurons in the sort to create a single display row, to avoid exceeding pixel limitations of the display.

Principal component analysis of this activity suggests that one major factor is variations in behavioral state, as indicated by movement/arousal (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that the use of dozens or more of the top principal components of the motion energy of facial movement videos is beneficial in explaining variance in visual cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). However, beyond the first few principal components of facial movement, the precise behavioral meaning of the subsequent components are difficult to discern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we took a different approach by using a multi-step semi-automated analysis pipeline to identify higher order behavioral motifs and to examine the relationship of these motifs to the diversity of patterns of neural activity observed in the cortex.</p><p>To test the feasibility of this approach, we first created pose estimates consisting of (x,y) positions of a set of user-labeled body-parts and joints from our left, right, and posterior mouse videos using DeepLabCut (DLC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). These pose estimate outputs were used for unsupervised machine learning extraction of behavioral motifs by an algorithm called âBehavioral segmentation of open field in DeepLabCutâ (âB-SOiDâ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu and Yttri, 2021</xref>; see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">Video 10</xref>). To identify high-level patterns of spontaneous head-fixed mouse behavior, we next performed manifold embedding (âUMAPâ) and cluster identification (âHDBSCANâ) of DLC pose tracking outputs in BSOiD. A random-forests machine classifier was trained with these clusters to be able to predict, or identify, behavioral motifs in any test session with the same set or subset of labeled body part pose estimates (i.e. x-y positions for a certain number of body parts with the same names), either within or between mice.</p><p>In an example side mount session (same session as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we identified 16 BSOiD behavioral motifs that exhibited good coarse and fine alignment to the dynamics of behavioral arousal primitives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), including walking, and manually selected discrete Rastermap groups from the same session. Here, BSOiD was trained on a randomly selected 80% subset of four sessions from the same mouse across three days, including the target session itself, with minimum cumulative motif times set to 1% of total video time or ~100 s, and then used to label individual video frames from the entirety of the target session. We found that, in some cases, training on individual sessions resulted in poor identification of rare and or brief behaviors, such as walking (which occurs rarely in some sessions; not shown). Initial attempts to train BSOiD on sessions across mice failed, likely due to differences in their behavioral repertoires. However, we were able to identify a subset of repeating behavioral motifs across mice. Also, the number of motifs per session and per mouse were comparable and tended to exhibit state transitions on similar timescales.</p><p>Examination of four types of qualitatively identified behavioral epochs (âtwitchâ, âwhiskâ, âwalkâ, and âpupil oscillateâ) at a finer temporal scale showed good alignment of BSOiD motifs with fine-scale features of spontaneous head-fixed mouse behavior at the level of movement and arousal primitives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For example, balancing wheel movements during âtwitchâ seem to align well to flickering into BSOiD motifs 8 and 11, while flickering into motif 13 during âwalkâ appears to correspond well to individual periods of high walk speed during the extended walking bout (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). The qualitative labels that best describe these behaviors (âtwitchâ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6aâc</xref>; âwhiskâ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6aâc</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>; âwalkâ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6aâc</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1b</xref>; âpupil oscillateâ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6aâc</xref>) did not appear to align with or be clearly explained by simple âfirst-orderâ interaction effects of movement and arousal primitives (i.e. whisk/walk/pupil x ON/OFF), despite the fact that the above-mentioned, closer, albeit preliminary, analysis of fine-scale behavioral features revealed precise and reliable alignments. This suggests that these methods will yield novel and important insights into the organization of neurobehavioral alignment across cortex, because other factors that are currently poorly understood appear to be contributing to the alignments.</p><p>Alignment of the bulk activity of all neurons in each Rastermap group with BSOiD motif transitions for this example session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6aâc</xref>, colored, vertically oriented dashed boxes) showed differential alignment with the above-mentioned four high-level, manually identified qualitative behaviors (âtwitchâ, âwhiskâ, âwalkâ, and âpupil oscillateâ). Note that, although individual BSOiD motifs could occur across multiple qualitatively identified higher level behaviors, each behavior consisted of a repeating pattern of a restricted set of motifs. For example, motif 13 in this session seems to correspond to a syllable that might best be termed âsymmetric and ready stanceâ. This tended to occur just before and after walking, but also during rhythmic wheel balancing movements that appear during the âoscillateâ behavior.</p><p>The occurrences of these behaviors, then, were clearly aligned with both behavioral movement/arousal primitives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) and the activity of putative, qualitatively segmented neural ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6câd</xref>) that displayed varied spatial distributions across defined CCF areas of the side mount preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>).</p><p>For example, the qualitatively identified high-level behaviorâwhiskâ, which in this case corresponds to whisking in the absence of walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>), with relatively elevated pupil diameter, aligns with strong activity in Rastermap group 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6câd</xref>, white dashed oval corresponding to Rastermap group #5, mean trace in blue), which has a higher density of neurons in retrosplenial, secondary visual, somatosensory barrel, and dorsal auditory CCF areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, R5). On the other hand, the qualitatively identified high-level behavior âwalkâ, which in this case refers to neurons with strong, transient activity aligned to seven individual bursts of walking during an extended walking bout, aligns with strong activity in Rastermap groups 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6câd</xref>, white dashed oval corresponding to Rastermap groups #6 and 7, mean trace in red), which has a higher density of neurons in primary and secondary motor cortices, upper and lower limb somatosensory cortices, and primary visual cortex.</p><p>Note that the qualitative behaviors identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> do not correspond directly to the Rastermap group labels used in earlier figures to point out possible alignment between neural activity and behavioral primitives. For example, the âwhiskâ group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, right, corresponds to a subset of the neurons with strong neural activity aligned to the âtwitchâ behavior in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> (R3 and R4), and the walk and whisk group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, left, corresponds to a subset of the neurons with strong neural activity aligned to the âwalkâ behavior in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> (R6 and R7). Furthermore, these single session results are preliminary and are not intended, at this point, as a result that necessarily generalizes across sessions or across mice. Rastermap maximum neuron densities can be found in the corresponding figure legend, but we did not apply tests of statistical significance here for these reasons. However, with ~30 CCF areas, a uniform distribution of neurons in a given Rastermap group would be ~3.3% per area. One would expect, therefore, that some of the neural density values we observed, which ranged up to ~40% for area M2 in Rastermap group 7 corresponding to the âwalkâ qualitative behavior, would be highly significant if they were to be observed consistently across sessions.</p><p>We expect that, in general and based both on our preliminary results and emerging trends in existing literature, that the predictive contribution of high level behavioral motifs relative to movement and arousal primitives will be greater both in lateral cortical areas, such as A1, in non-primary CCF areas further up the cortical hierarchy, such as secondary sensory cortices and M2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; bioRxiv), and over intermediate and longer timescales of activity aligned with purposeful and/or goal oriented movements organized at higher levels of the behavioral hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mimica et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Overview and main findings</title><p>We developed novel headpost designs, surgical procedures, 3D-printed accessories, experimental protocols, and analysis pipelines that allowed us to routinely perform 2p imaging of up to ~7500 neurons simultaneously across ~25 mm<sup>2</sup> of either bilateral parieto-occipital (âdorsal mountâ) or unilateral temporo-parietal (âside mountâ) cortex in separate populations of awake, behaving mice, while simultaneously monitoring an array of global arousal state variables. Correlations between neural activity and arousal/movement were broadly, but heterogeneously, represented across both local and regional spatial scales. Preliminary analysis showed that this rich dataset could be used to segregate specific mappings between high-level, qualitatively identified behaviors (e.g. âtwitchâ, âwhiskâ, âwalkâ, and âpupil oscillateâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), each consisting of a persistent pattern of robustly identifiable, high-level behavioral motifs, low-level behavioral arousal, and movement primitives (i.e. walk, whisker, and pupil; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), and spatially localized neural activity clusters (i.e. âRastermapâ groups; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6câe</xref>). Further analysis of such mappings will both allow for the fine dissection of patterned behaviors and neural activity, and for the development of a powerful framework for the sophisticated prediction of performance in mice engaged in a variety of multimodal sensory discrimination tasks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hulsey et al., 2023</xref>; bioRxiv, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; bioRxiv).</p><p>Taken together, these findings show the strong potential of our novel methods for further elucidation of the principles of pan-cortical neurobehavioral alignment at the level of densely sampled individual neurons. For example, the spatial distributions of densities of neurons in each Rastermap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stringer et al., 2023</xref>, bioRxiv) group across CCF areas were partially overlapping, yet strongly dissociable (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6e</xref>). This suggested that dynamic, recurring patterns of arousal-dependent reorganization might act to enable activity mode switching between various distributed, cortical functional âcommunitiesâ. Each of these communities, then, could be specialized for different forms of activity related to various aspects of spontaneous behavior or task performance. This topic should be further explored with principled statistical techniques for recursive, top-down hierarchical community detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have shown here that it is feasible to monitor individual neuronal activities across broad expanses of the cerebral cortex and to perform neurobehavioral alignment of high resolution behavioral arousal state motifs and pan-cortical, activity-clustered neural ensembles in awake, behaving mice. Furthermore, our preliminary findings suggest a detailed alignment between both arousal/movement primitives and high-level behavioral motifs that appears to vary across broad regions of cortex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings extend those of earlier studies that showed widespread encoding of behavioral state during spontaneous behavior in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref> ; imaging and Neuropixels recordings) and encoding of uninstructed movements during task performance both across dorsal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musall et al., 2019</xref> ; widefield imaging across dorsal cortex, 2p imaging in restricted FOVs in primary visual and secondary motor cortex) and brain-wide during task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; Neuropixels recordings at low volumetric sampling density).</p><p>In particular, our findings are consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref> in that we observe widespread, strong correlations of cortical neural activity with the behavioral state variables of movement (facial and locomotor) and pupil diameter. However, we imaged larger areas of cortex simultaneously, including medial, anterior, and lateral cortical areas, at a higher overall imaging frequency (~3 Hz vs. ~1 Hz). Although admittedly this imaging speed is still not fast enough to record fast cortical encoding of sensory information or decision making, these factors, taken together, may have contributed to our ability to observe enhanced heterogeneity across these non-primary cortical areas, including in neurons whose activities were strongly suppressed during periods of increased arousal/movement (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, 2). Higher concentrations of such neurons were evident over lateral regions of cortex such as primary auditory and somatosensory nose and mouth regions, and in anterior regions including secondary motor cortex.</p><p>We also showed that high-level behaviors, manually identified and aligned to clusters of repeating motifs by UMAP embedding (BSOiD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu and Yttri, 2021</xref>), aligned well with patterns of neural activity identified by Rastermap corresponding to neural ensembles with non-uniform spatial distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that encoding of behavioral state across cortex may occur at multiple levels of the behavioral hierarchy, in addition to that of âlow-levelâ behavioral arousal/movement primitives such as pupil diameter, whisker motion energy, and walking speed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mimica et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that neurons with no correlation to arousal/movement, or with a large negative correlation, are also widespread across cortex, suggests that multiple mechanisms or pathways may exist in parallel to distribute information about behavioral state across the brain. Interestingly, as evidenced by our discovery with Rastermap of neural ensembles exhibiting diverse response kinetics and polarities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a, top, d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a, top, d</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6câe</xref>), these pathways may be activated with different temporal dynamics simultaneously across various brain areas, thus making our approach for simultaneous recording of many areas one of the keys to potentially understanding the nature of their neuronal activity. The reason for this is that correlations between behavior and neural activity across different cortical regions appear to depend on the exact time since the behavior began (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shimaoka et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the distribution of behavioral state dwell times must be the same across the recording epochs corresponding to all cortical areas in order to detect distributed patterns of correlations between behavior and neural activity. In practice this would seem to require the simultaneous recording of all the individual neurons across the dorsolateral cortex that are part of the neural ensembles identified by Rastermap, as we have done here - accurately piecing such ensembles together across multiple separate recordings might not be possible.</p><p>For this reason, directly combining and/or comparing the correlations between behavior and neural activity across regions imaged in separate sessions may not reveal the true differences in the relationship between behavior and neural activity across cortical areas, due to a âtemporal filtering effectâ, because the correlations between behavior and neural activity in each region appear to depend on the exact time since the behavior began (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shimaoka et al., 2018</xref>). In our view, this makes the simultaneous recording of multiple cortical areas essential for proper comparison of the dependence of their neural activity on arousal/movement, because only then are the distributions of behavioral state dwell times the same across the recording epochs corresponding to all cortical areas.</p><p>Additional experiments are warranted to uncover the mechanistic basis of such differences across large populations of cortical neurons associated with changes in activity level during periods of fluctuating arousal/engagement. For example, correlations between spiking-related Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and movement/arousal under 2p imaging, both as shown here and in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>), and Neuropixels recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>), appear not to mirror those observed with widefield voltage imaging of membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shimaoka et al., 2018</xref>; especially in VIS_lm and SS_b). This suggests the existence of a complex interaction between movement/arousal related changes in membrane potential and spiking that may vary across cortical areas.</p><p>In general, our preparations allow for the observation of diverse pan-cortical neural populations that likely communicate with each other in a transient and/or sustained manner during alternating periods of low and high movement/arousal and drive different patterns of global functional connectivity. Furthermore, the apparent variability of these neurobehavioral alignments suggests that interactions between cognitive and arousal/movement encodings may also occur during spontaneous behavior, in addition to during task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musall et al., 2019</xref>), and that the degree of this interaction may depend on the cortical area.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Advantages and disadvantages of our approach (with potential solutions)</title><p>A main advantage of our approach is the flexibility afforded by the combination of our two surgical preparations (see Protocols II, III), in terms of the sheer number of cortical areas spanning distant regions that can be recorded simultaneously at single cell resolution under 2p imaging. The interoperability of our preparations across widefield 1p and Thorlabs mesoscope 2p imaging rigs (see Protocol IV) allows for the straight-forward development of an experimental pipeline that first surveys widespread activity at fast timescales (widefield,~10â50 Hz) and then investigates the activity of large subregions in a serial manner at intermediate timescales (Thorlabs mesoscope,~1â10 Hz).</p><p>A drawback of our current preparations is that they require use of a large water-immersion objective with a relatively short working distance (~2.4â3.0 mm). This limits access for simultaneous electrophysiological recordings during mesoscale imaging, even though the same preparations could be used for simultaneous imaging and electrophysiological recordings on other acquisition rigs (i.e. widefield and/or standard 2p), used in parallel to the mesoscope with the same mice.</p><p>In tandem with our headpost, surgical, behavioral, and analytic protocols, this could enable simultaneous Neuropixels, whole-cell electrophysiology, and mesoscale single-cell resolution imaging experiments. Such an approach would allow integration of neural data from multiple brain depths and areas, as well as across multiple spatiotemporal scales. Thus, these techniques would allow modification of our current methods to allow examination of faster timescale cortical dynamics than we can currently capture with 2p imaging alone, such as those related to initial encoding of sensory information and decision making.</p><p>Another limitation of our current methodologies for single large FOV imaging, as presented here, is that we imaged neurons at a single cortical depth, and at an imaging rate that did not take full advantage of the speed of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator that we used (i.e. GCaMP6s; we estimate that imaging at ~10 Hz would sample all available information and avoid aliasing with a rise time of ~200ms and decay time of ~1.2 s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). To address these limitations, we are expanding our analyses to sessions, which we have already recorded, acquired at ~5â10 Hz over 4â6 FOVs at multiple z-depths (e.g. V1, A1, M2, RSpl, and SS_m/_n cortical areas; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2e</xref>), with resolutions ranging from 0.2 to 1 Âµm per pixel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Future directions</title><p>Reliability of cortical area identification and alignment in our dorsal and side mount preparations is enhanced due to standardization of headposts and cranial windows, and the combined use of skull landmark and cortical vasculature alignment in a rigorous, semi-automated widefield multimodal sensory mapping protocol.

For experiments with combined Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and optogenetic inhibition we used PV-Cre x Ai32 x Thy1-RGECO mice (JAX # 017320x024109 x 030528 or 030527). Habituation of each mouse to the experimental setup was performed for 2â3 days prior to 2p data acquisition during standard protocol for spontaneous behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgeries</title><p>See Protocols II and III, and Supplementary methods and materials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral videography</title><p>See Supplementary methods and materials, Overall workflow, Protocol I.

We controlled imaging with ScanImage (2018â2021; Vidrio) running in Matlab, with GPU-enabled online z-axis motion correction. Behavioral synchronization was achieved by triggering 2p acquisition with the first right body camera frame clock signal. Left and posterior cameras were triggered by the same signal, but were subject to variable LabView runtime-related delays on the order of up to ~10 ms and, on rare occaision, dropped frames. Exposure times for both left and right body cameras, as well as frame-clock times for all three body cameras, were recorded in Spike2 (CED Power1401) as continuous waveforms and events, respectively, to allow for temporal alignment of recorded videos.</p><p>We used the ScanImage function SI render to combine image strips from large field-of-view (FOV) sessions, and in some cases we used custom Suite2p Matlab scripts (courtesy of Carsen Stringer) to align small FOVs from the same or different z-planes in a single session. Rigid and non-rigid motion correction were performed in Suite2p, along with region of interest (ROI) detection and classifier screening of ROIs likely to be neurons. Rigid motion correction computes the shift between a reference image and each frame using phase-correlation, and non-rigid correction divides the image into subsections and calculates the shift of each block, or subsection, separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>; also: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://suite2p.readthedocs.io/en/latest/registration.html">https://suite2p.readthedocs.io/en/latest/registration.html</ext-link>).</p><p>Fluorescence intensities were calculated as changes in fluorescence divided by baseline fluorescence (dF/F), where F was calculated, for each neuron, using an ~30â60 s (100â200 frame) rolling 10th or 15th percentile baseline of the neuropil subtracted mean ROI pixel intensity (F-0.7*Fneu). Traces of dF/F were then truncated to match the length of acquired behavioral data and resampled (python: scipy.signal.resample for upsampling, or numpy: slicing for downsampling), along with behavioral data, to 10 Hz for further analysis. 2p acquisition rates for the large FOV sessions ranged from roughly 1.6â4.5 Hz, with most sessions acquired at ~3 Hz.

Some movies had noticeable sporadic motion blur (in particular of whiskers during whisking), small areas of overexposure, and brief periods of paw occlusion or mislabeled points during walking, grooming, and other brief periods of high motor activity. These difficulties could be remedied in the future by increasing sampling frame rate (although this generates larger file sizes), as well as further optimizing IR illumination. For the preliminary analysis contained here, we performed multiple reruns of DLC to achieve an acceptable quality standard, but we did not rigorously employ tracking, exclusion, or smoothing of DLC outputs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioral motif analysis (BSOiD)</title><p>Pose-tracking data outputs from DLC in the form of comma-separated value files were loaded into B-SOiD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/YttriLab/B-SOID">https://github.com/YttriLab/B-SOID</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu and Yttri, 2021</xref>) along with concatenated, cropped, and spatially downsampled (FFMPEG) right-camera videos (~20â90 min,~100 MB to 1 GB per video).

Thresholding of cumulative motion energy by z-score further confirmed this and made the following kinematic patterns evident: (i) In asymmetric pose motifs, a clear region of low movement (dark pixels) is visible in the chest region between the left and right shoulders that is either absent or not as prominent in high-arousal and symmetric pose motifs; (ii) Enhanced nose and mouth movement was associated with high arousal walking but could also occur independently of walking; and (iii) Increased whisker movement was associated with high arousal walking but could also occur independently of walking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Protocol I</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Overall workflow</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Headpost implantation in mice between 8 and 12 weeks postnatal (male preferred due to larger skull size). 60 minutes under isoflurane.

Particularly commendable is their dedication in providing detailed surgical preparations and corresponding design files, a contribution that will greatly benefit the broader neuroscience community as a whole. The quality of the data is high and examples are available to the community. More importantly, the authors have acquired activity-clustered neural ensembles at an unprecedented spatial scale to further correlate with high level behaviour motifs identified by B-SOiD. Such an advancement marks a significant contribution to the field. While the manuscript is comprehensive and the analytical strategy proposed is promising, some technical aspects warrant further clarification.

This is described in the methods and now supplemental figure, but a visual representation would greatly benefit the readers looking to implement something similar as a main figure but I guess they can find it in the methods. No stats for the results shown in Figure 6e, it would be useful to know which of these neural densities for all areas show a clear statistical significance across all the behaviors. While I understand that this is a methods paper, it seems like the authors are aware of the literature surrounding large neuronal recordings during mouse behavior. Indeed, in line 178-179 the authors mention how a significant portion of the variance in neural activity can be attributed to changes in &quot;arousal or self-directed movement even during spontaneous behavior.&quot; Why then did the authors not make an attempt at a simple linear model that tries to predict the activity of their many thousands of neurons by employing the multitude of regressors at their disposal (pupil, saccades, stimuli, movements, facial changes, etc). These models are straightforward to implement, and indeed it would benefit this work if the model extracts information on par with what it's known from the literature. We also realize such a model could be done in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94167.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vickers</surname><given-names>Evan D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oregon</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Eugene</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oregon</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oregon</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This valuable paper presents a thoroughly detailed methodology for mesoscale-imaging of extensive areas of the cortex, either from a top or lateral perspective, in behaving mice.

See Line ~309, pg 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Insightful preliminary data and analysis:</p><p>The preliminary data unveiled in the study reveal interesting heterogeneity in the relationships between neural activity and detailed behavioral features, particularly notable in the lateral cortex. This aspect of the findings is intriguing and suggests avenues for further exploration.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>-Clarification about the extent of the method in the title and text:</p><p>The title of the paper, using the term &quot;pan-cortical,&quot; along with certain phrases in the text, may inadvertently suggest that both the top and lateral view preparations are utilized in the same set of mice. To avoid confusion, it should be explicitly stated that the authors employ either the dorsal view (which offers limited access to the lateral ventral regions) or the lateral view (which restricts access to the opposite side of the cortex). For instance, in line 545, the phrase &quot;lateral cortex with our dorsal and side mount preparations&quot; should be revised to &quot;lateral cortex with our dorsal or side mount preparations&quot; for greater clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: We have opted to not change the title of the paper, because we feel that adding the qualifier, âin two preparations,â would add unnecessary complexity. In addition, while the dorsal mount preparation allows for imaging of bilateral dorsal cortex, the side mount preparation does indeed allow for imaging of both dorsal and lateral cortex across the right hemisphere (a bit of contralateral dorsal cortex is also imageable), and the design can be easily âflippedâ across a mirror-plane to allow for imaging of left dorsal and lateral cortex. Taken together, we do show preparations that allow for pan-cortical 2-photon imaging.</p><p>We do agree that imprecise reference to the two preparations can sometimes lead to confusion. Therefore, we made several small revisions to the manuscript, including at ~line 545, to make it clearer that we used two imaging preparations to generate our combined 2-photon mesoscope dataset, and that each of those two preparations had both benefits and limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Comparison with existing methods:</p><p>A more detailed contrast between this method and other published techniques would add value to the paper. Specifically, the lateral view appears somewhat narrower than that described in Esmaeili et al., 2021; a discussion of this comparison would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: The preparation by Esmaeili et al. 2021 has some similarities to, but also differences from, our preparation. Our preliminary reading is that their through-the-skull field of view is approximately the same as our through-the-skull field of view that exists between our first (headpost implantation) and second (window implantation) surgeries for our side mount preparation, although our preparation appears to include more anterior areas both near to and on the contralateral side of the midline. We have compared these preparations more thoroughly in the revised manuscript. (See lines ~278.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the number of neurons analyzed seems modest compared to recent papers (50k) - elaborating on this aspect could provide important context for the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ response: With respect to the âmodestâ number of neurons analyzed (between 2000 and 8000 neurons per session for our dorsal and side mount preparations with medians near 4500; See Fig. S2e) we would like to point out that factors such as use of dual-plane imaging or multiple imaging planes, different mouse lines, use of different duration recording sessions (see our Fig S2c), use of different imaging speeds and resolutions (see our Fig S2d), use of different Suite2p run-time parameters, and inclusion of areas with blood vessels and different neuron cell densities, may all impact the count of total analyzed neurons per session. We now mention these various factors and have made clear that we were not, for the purposes of this paper, trying to maximize neuron count at the expense of other factors such as imaging speed and total spatial FOV extent.</p><p>We refer to these issues now briefly in the main text. (See ~line 93, pg 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Discussion of methodological limitations:</p><p>The limitations inherent to the method, such as the potential behavioral effects of tilting the mouse's head, are not thoroughly examined. A more comprehensive discussion of these limitations would enhance the paper's balance and depth.</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: Our mice readily adapted to the 22.5 degree head tilt and learned to perform 2-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) auditory and visual tasks in this configuration (Hulsey et al, 2024; Cell Reports). The advantages and limitations of such a rotation of the mouse, and possible ways to alleviate these limitations, as detailed in the following paragraphs, are now discussed more thoroughly in the revised manuscript at ~line 235, pg. 7.</p><p>One can look at Supplementary Movie 1 for examples of the relatively similar behavior between the dorsal mount (not rotated) and side mount (rotated) preparations. We do not have behavioral data from mice that were placed in both configurations. Our preliminary comparisons across mice indicates that side and dorsal mount mice show similar behavioral variability. We have added brief additional mention of these considerations on ~lines 235-250, pg 7.</p><p>It was in general important to make sure that the distance between the wheel and all four limbs was similar for both preparations. In particular, careful attention must be paid to the positioning of the front limbs in the side mount mice so that they are not too high off the wheel. This can be accomplished by a slight forward angling of the left support arm for side mount mice.</p><p>Although it is possible to image the side mount preparation in the same optical configuration that we do without rotating the mouse, by rotating the objective 20 degrees to the right of vertical, we found that the last 2-3 degrees of missing rotation (our preparation is rotated 22.5 degrees left, which is more than the full available 20 degrees rotation of the Thorlabs mesoscope objective), along with several other factors, made this undesirable. First, it was very difficult to image auditory areas without the additional flexibility to rotate the objective more laterally. Second, it was difficult or impossible to attach the horizontal light shield and to establish a water meniscus with the objective fully rotated. One could use ultrasound gel instead (which we found to be, to some degree, optically inferior to water), but without the horizontal light shield, light from the UV and IR LEDs can reach the PMTs via the objective and contaminate the image or cause tripping of the PMT. Third, imaging the right pupil and face of the mouse is difficult under these conditions because the camera would need the same optical access angle as the 2-photon objective, or would need to be moved downward toward the air table and rotated up at an angle of 20 degrees, in which case its view would be blocked by the running wheel and other objects mounted on the air table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Preliminary nature of results:</p><p>The results are at a preliminary stage; for example, the B-soid analysis is based on a single mouse, and the validation data are derived from the training data set.</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: In this methods paper, we have chosen to supply proof of principle examples, without a complete analysis of animal-to-animal variance.</p><p>The B-SOiD analysis that we show in Figure 6 is based on a model trained on 80% of the data from four sessions taken from the same mouse, and then tested on all of a single session from that mouse. Initial attempts to train across sessions from different mice were unsuccessful, probably due to differences in behavioral repertoires across mice. However, we have performed extensive tests with B-SOiD and are confident that these sorts of results are reproducible across mice, although we are not prepared to publish these results at this time.</p><p>We now clarify these points in the main text at ~line 865, pg 27.</p><p>An additional comparison of the results of B-SOiD trained on different numbers of sessions to that of keypoint-MOSEQ (Weinreb et al, 2023, bioRxiv) trained on ~20 sessions can now be found as supplementary material on our GitHub site:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/Figure_SZZ_BSOID_MOSEQ_align.pdf">https://github.com/vickerse1/mesoscope_spontaneous/blob/main/Figure_SZZ_BSOID_MOSEQ_align.pdf</ext-link></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discrepancy between the maps in Figures 5e and 6e might indicate that a significant portion of the map represents noise. An analysis of variability across mice and a method to assign significance to these maps would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: After re-examination of the original analysis output files, we have indeed discovered that some of the Rastermap neuron density maps in Figure 6e were incorrectly aligned with their respective qualitative behaviors due to a discrepancy in file numbering between the images in 6e and the ensembles identified in 6c (each time that Rastermap is run on the same data, at least with the older version available at the time of creation of these figures, the order of the ensembles on the y-axis changes and thus the numbering of the ensembles would change even though the neuron identities within each group stayed the same for a given set of parameters).</p><p>This unfortunate panel alignment / graphical display error present in the original reviewed preprint has been fixed in the current, updated figure (i.e. twitch corresponds to Rastermap groups 2 and 3, whisk to group 6, walk to groups 5 and 4, and oscillate to groups 0 and 1), and in the main text at ~line 925, pg 29. We have also changed the figure legend, which also contained accurate but misaligned information, for Figure 6e to reflect this correction.</p><p>One can now see that, because the data from both figures is from the same session in the same mouse, as you correctly point out, Fig 5d left (walk and whisk) corresponds roughly to Fig 6e group R7, âwalkâ, and that Fig 5d right (whisk) corresponds roughly to Fig 6e group R4, âtwitchâ.</p><p>We have double-checked the identity of other CCF map displays of Rastermap neuron density and of mean correlations between neural activity and behavioral primitives in all other figures, and we found no other such alignment or mis-labeling errors.</p><p>We have also added a caveat in the main text at ~lines 925-940, pg. 30, pointing out the preliminary nature of these findings, which are shown here as an example of the viability of the methods. Analysis of the variability of Rastermap alignments across sessions is beyond the scope of the current paper, although it is an issue that we hope to address in upcoming analysis papers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Analysis details:</p><p>More comprehensive details on the analysis would be beneficial for replicability and deeper understanding. For instance, the statement &quot;Rigid and non-rigid motion correction were performed in Suite2p&quot; could be expanded with a brief explanation of the underlying principles, such as phase correlation, to provide readers with a better grasp of the methodologies employed.</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: We added a brief explanation of Suite2p motion correction at ~line 136, pg 4. We have also added additional details concerning CCF / MMM alignment and other analysis issues. In general we cite other papers where possible to avoid repeating details of analysis methods that are already published.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a comprehensive technical overview of the challenging acquisition of large-scale cortical activity, including surgical procedures and custom 3D-printed headbar designs to obtain neural activity from large parts of the dorsal or lateral neocortex.

There are advantages and disadvantages to each chosen technique, such as ease of use, field of view, accuracy, and speed. We will reference the papers you mention without an extensive literature review, but we would like to emphasize the following points:</p><p>Even the best one-photon imaging techniques typically have ~10-20 micrometer resolution in xy (we image at 5 micrometer resolution for our large FOV configuration, but the xy point-spread function for the Thorlabs mesoscope is 0.61 x 0.61 micrometers in xy with 970 nm excitation) and undefined z-resolution (4.25 micrometers for Thorlabs mesoscope). A coarser resolution increases the likelihood that activity related fluorescence from neighboring cells may contaminate the fluorescence observed from imaged neurons. Reducing the FOV and using sparse expression of the indicator lessens this overlap problem.</p><p>We do appreciate these recent advances, however, particularly for use in cases where more rapid imaging is desired over a large field of view (CCD acquisition can be much faster than that of standard 2-photon galvo-galvo or even galvo-resonant scanning, as the Thorlabs mesoscope uses). This being said, there are few currently available genetically encoded Ca2+ sensors that are able to measure fluctuations faster than ~10 Hz, which is a speed achievable on the Thorlabs 2-photon mesoscope with our techniques using the âsmall, multiple FOVâ method (Fig. S2d, e).</p><p>We have further clarified our discussion of these issues in the main text at ~lines 76-80, pg 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors' claim of achieving optical clarity for up to 150 days post-surgery with their modified crystal skull approach is significantly longer than the 8 weeks (approximately 56 days) reported in the original study by Kim et al.

We did not find any obvious qualitative differences in the number of behavioral motifs identified, the dwell times of these motifs, and similar issues, relating to the issue of tilting of the mouseâs head in the side mount preparation. We also did not find any obvious differences in the relative frequencies of high level qualitative behaviors, such as the ones referred to in Fig. 6, between the two preparations.</p><p>Our mice readily adapted to the 22.5 degree head tilt and learned to perform 2-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) auditory and visual tasks in this configuration (Hulsey et al, 2024; Cell Reports). The advantages and limitations of such a rotation of the mouse, and possible ways to alleviate these limitations, as detailed in the following paragraphs, are now discussed more thoroughly in the revised manuscript. (See ~line 235, pg. 7)</p><p>One can look at Supplementary Movie 1 for examples of the relatively similar behavior between the dorsal mount (not rotated) and side mount (rotated) preparations. We do not have behavioral data from mice that were placed in both configurations.

First, it was very difficult to image auditory areas without the additional flexibility to rotate the objective more laterally. Second, it was difficult or impossible to attach the horizontal light shield and to establish a water meniscus with the objective fully rotated. One could use gel instead (which we found to be optically inferior to water), but without the horizontal light shield, the UV and IR LEDs can reach the PMTs via the objective and contaminate the image or cause tripping of the PMT. Third, imaging the right pupil and face of the mouse is difficult to impossible under these conditions because the camera would need the same optical access angle as the objective, or would need to be moved down toward the air table and rotated up 20 degrees, in which case its view would be blocked by the running wheel and other objects mounted on the air table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Clarification in the discussion section:</p><p>The paragraph titled &quot;Advantages and disadvantages of our approach&quot; seems to diverge into discussing future directions, rather than focusing on the intended topic.

This is based on the argument that combining multiple recordings with movement indicators will 'necessarily obscure the true spatial correlation structures'. However, I don't understand why this is the case or what is meant by 'true spatial correlation structures'. Aren't there many earlier studies that provided important insights from individual cortical areas? It would be helpful to improve the writing to make this argument clearer.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: The reviewer makes an excellent point and we have re-worded the manuscript appropriately, to reflect the following clarifications. These changes can be found at ~lines 58-71, pg. 2.</p><p>We believe you are referring to the following passage from the introduction:</p><p>âFurthermore, the arousal dependence of membrane potential across cortical areas has been shown to be diverse and predictable by a temporally filtered readout of pupil diameter and walking speed (Shimoaka et al, 2018). This makes simultaneous recording of multiple cortical areas essential for comparison of the dependence of their neural activity on arousal/movement, because combining multiple recording sessions with pupil dilations and walking bouts of different durations will necessarily obscure the true spatial correlation structures.â</p><p>Here, we do not mean to imply that earlier studies of individual cortical areas are of no value. This argument is provided as an example, of which there are others, of the idea that, for sequences or distributed encoding schemes that simultaneously span many cortical areas that are too far apart to be simultaneously imaged under conventional 2-photon imaging, or are too sparse to be discovered with 1-photon widefield imaging, there are some advantages of our new methods over conventional imaging methods that will allow for truly novel scientific analyses and insights.</p><p>The general idea of the present example, based on the findings of Shimoaka et al, 2018, is that it is not possible to directly combine and/or compare the correlations between behavior and neural activity across regions that were imaged in separate sessions, because the correlations between behavior and neural activity in each region appear to depend on the exact time since the behavior began (Shimoaka et al, 2018), in a manner that differs across regions. So, for example, if one were to record from visual cortex in one session with mostly brief walk bouts, and then from somatosensory cortex in a second session with mostly long walk bouts, any inferred difference between the encoding of walk speed in neural activity between the two areas would run the risk of being contaminated by the âtemporal filteringâ effect shown in Shimoaka et al, 2018. However, this would not be the case in our recordings, because the distribution of behavior durations corresponding to our recorded neural activity across areas will be exactly the same, because they were recorded simultaneously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The text describes different timescales of neural activity but is an imaging rate of 3 Hz fast enough to be seen as operating at the temporal dynamics of the behavior? It appears to me that the sampling rate will impose a hard limit on the speed of correlations that can be observed across regions. While this might be appropriate for relatively slow behaviors and spontaneous fluctuations in arousal, sensory processing and decision formation likely operate on faster time scales below 100ms which would even be problematic at 10 Hz which is proposed as the ideal imaging speed in the manuscript.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: Imaging rate is always a concern and the limitations of this have been discussed in other manuscripts. We will remind the reader of these limitations, which must always be kept in mind when interpreting fluorescence based neural activity data.</p><p>Previous studies imaging on a comparable yet more limited spatial scale (Stringer et al, 2019) used an imaging speed of ~1 Hz. With this in view, our work represents an advance both in spatial extent of imaged cortex and in imaging speed. Specifically, we believe that ~1 Hz imaging may be sufficient to capture flip/flop type transitions between low and high arousal states that persist in general for seconds to tens of seconds, and that ~3-5 Hz imaging likely provides additional information about encoding of spontaneous movements and behavioral syllables/motifs.</p><p>Indeed, even 10 Hz imaging would not be fast enough to capture the detailed dynamics of sensory processing and decision formation, although these speeds are likely sufficient to capture âstableâ encodings of sensory representations and decisions that must be maintained during a task, for example with delayed match-to-sample tasks.</p><p>In general we are further developing our preparations to allow us to perform simultaneous widefield imaging and Neuropixels recordings, and to perform simultaneous 1.2 x 1.2 mm 2-photon imaging and visually guided patch clamp recordings.</p><p>Both of these techniques will allow us to combine information across both the slow and fast timescales that you refer to in your question.</p><p>We have clarified these points in the Introduction and Discussion sections, at ~lines ~93-105, pg 3, and ~lines 979-983, pg 31 and ~lines 1039-1045, pg 33, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The dorsal mount is very close to the crystal skull paper and it was ultimately not clear to me if there are still important differences aside from the headbar design that a reader should be aware of.

Multimodal mapping by widefield imaging is done through the skull between these two surgeries for two major reasons. First, to make efficient use of the time between surgeries. Second, to allow us to compare the multimodal maps to skull landmarks, such as bregma and lambda, for improved alignment to the CCF.</p><p>Anesthesia was applied to prevent state changes and movements of the mouse, which can produce large, undesired effects on neural responses in primary sensory cortices in the context of these mapping experiments.

Motif 11 also occurs prominently in the oscillate state and the unnamed sequence on the left. Is this meaningful or is the emphasis here on times of change between behavioral motifs?

This tends to occur just before and after walking, but also during rhythmic wheel balancing movements that appear during the âoscillateâ behavior.</p><p>The intent of Fig. 6a is to show that each qualitatively identified behavior (twitch, whisk, walk, and oscillate) corresponds to a period during which a subset of BSOiD motifs flicker back and forth, and that the identity of motifs in this subset differs across the identified qualitative behaviors. This is not to say that a particular motif occurs only during a single identified qualitative behavior. Admittedly, the identification of these qualitative behaviors is a bit arbitrary - future versions of BSOiD (e.g. ASOiD) in fact combine supervised (i.e. arbitrary, top down) and unsupervised (i.e. algorithmic, objective, bottom-up) methods of behavior segmentation in attempt to more reliably identify and label behaviors.</p><p>Flickering appears to be a property of motif transitions in raw BSOiD outputs that have not been temporally smoothed. If one watches the raw video, it seems that this may in fact be an accurate reflection of the manner in which behaviors unfold through time. Each behavior could be thought of, to use terminology from MOSEQ (B Datta), as a series of syllables strung together to make a phrase or sentence.

Again, other reasons that imaging many areas simultaneously would provide a unique advantage over imaging smaller areas one at a time and attempting to pool data across sessions would include the identification of sequences or neural ensembles that span many areas across large distances, or the understanding of distributed coding of behavior (an issue we explore in an upcoming paper).</p><p>We have clarified these points at the location in the Discussion that you have identified.

Furthermore, the CCD camera (Thorlabs) has a much smaller detector chip than that of the other widefield cameras that we use (RedShirt Imaging and PCO), and we use it to image at an acquisition speed of around 10 Hz maximum, instead of ~30-50 Hz, which is our normal widefield imaging acquisition speed (it also has a slower readout than what we would consider to be a standard or ârealâ 1-photon widefield imaging camera).</p><p>For these 3 reasons we refer to this as âpseudo-widefieldâ imaging.

These surgeries are rather challenging - they require proper instruction and experience. With the current protocol, our survival rate for the window surgery alone is as high as 75-100%. Some mice can be lost at headpost implantation, in particular if they are low weight or if too much muscle is removed over the auditory areas. Finally, some mice survive windowing but the imageable area of the window might be too small to perform the desired experiment.</p><p>We have added a paragraph detailing this issue in the main text at ~lines 287-320, pg 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In both Suppl_Movie_S1_dorsal_mount and Suppl_Movie_S1_side_mount provided (Movie S1), the behaviour video quality seems to be unoptimized which will impact the precision of Deeplabcut. As evident, there were multiple instances of mislabeled key points (paws are switched, large jumps of key points, etc) in the videos.</p><p>Many tracked points are in areas of the image that are over-exposed.</p><p>Despite using a high-speed camera, motion blur is obvious.</p><p>Occlusions of one paw by the other paws moving out of frame.</p><p>As Deeplabcut accuracy is key to higher-level motifs generated by BSOi-D, can the authors provide an example of tracking by exclusion/ smoothing of mislabeled points (possibly by the median filtering provided by Deeplabcut), this may help readers address such errors.</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: We agree that we would want to carefully rerun and carefully curate the outputs of DeepLabCut before making any strong claims about behavioral identification. As the aim of this paper was to establish our methods, we did not feel that this degree of rigor was required at this point.</p><p>It is inevitable that there will be some motion blur and small areas of over-exposure, respectively, when imaging whiskers, which can contain movement components up to ~150 Hz, and when imaging a large area of the mouse, which has planes facing various aspects. For example, perfect orthogonal illumination of both the center of the eye and the surface of the whisker pad on the snout would require two separate infrared light sources. In this case, use of a single LED results in overexposure of areas orthogonal to the direction of the light and underexposure of other aspects, while use of multiple LEDs would partially fix this problem, but still lead to variability in summated light intensity at different locations on the face. We have done our best to deal with these limitations.</p><p>We now briefly point out these limitations in the methods text at ~lines 155-160, pg 5.</p><p>In addition, we have provided additional raw and processed movies and data related to DeepLabCut and BSOiD behavioral analysis in our FigShare+ repository, which is located at:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.c.7052513">https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.c.7052513</ext-link></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 153-154, the authors mentioned that the Deeplabcut model was trained for 650k iterations. In our experience (100-400k), this seems excessive and may result in the model overfitting, yielding incorrect results in unseen data. Echoing point 4, can the authors show the accuracy of their Deeplabut model (training set, validation set, errors, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: Our behavioral analysis is preliminary and is included here as an example of our methods, and not to make claims about any specific result. Therefore we believe that the level of detail that you request in our DeepLabCut analysis is beyond the scope of the current paper. However, we would like to point out that we performed many iterations of DeepLabCut runs, across many mice in both preparations, before converging on these preliminary results. We believe that these results are stable and robust.</p><p>We believe that 650k iterations is within the reasonable range suggested by DLC, and that 1 million iterations is given as a reasonable upper bound. This seems to be supported by the literature for example, see Willmore et al, 2022 (âBehavioral and dopaminergic signatures of resilienceâ, Nature, 124:611, 124-132). Here, in a paper focused squarely on behavioral analysis, DLC training was run with 1.3 million iterations with default parameters.</p><p>We now note, on ~lines 153-154, pg 5, that we used 650K iterations, a number significantly less than the default of 1.03 million, to avoid overfitting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 140-141, the authors mentioned the use of slicing to downsample their data. Have any precautions, such as a low pass filter, been taken to avoid aliasing?</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: Most of the 2-photon data we present was acquired at ~3 Hz and upsampled to 10 Hz. Most of the behavioral data was downsampled from 5000 Hz to 10 Hz by slicing, as stated. We did not apply any low-pass filter to the behavioral data before sampling. The behavioral variables have heterogeneous real sampling/measurement rates - for example, pupil diameter and whisker motion energy are sampled at 30 Hz, and walk speed is sampled at 100 Hz. In addition, the 2-photon acquisition rate varied across sessions.</p><p>These facts made principled, standardized low-pass filtering difficult to implement. We chose rather to use a common resampling rate of 10 Hz in an unbiased manner. This downsampled 10 Hz rate is also used by B-SOiD to find transitions between behavioral motifs (Hsu and Yttri, 2021).</p><p>We do not think that aliasing is a major factor because the real rate of change of our Ca2+ indicator fluorescence and behavioral variables was, with the possible exception of whisker motion energy, likely at or below 10 Hz.</p><p>We now include a brief statement to this effect in the methods text at ~lines 142-146, pg. 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 288-299, the authors have made considerable effort to compensate for the curvature of the brain which is particularly important when imaging the whole dorsal cortex. Can the authors provide performance metrics and related details on how well the combination of online curvature field correction (ScanImage) and fast-z &quot;sawtooth&quot;/&quot;step&quot; (Sofroniew, 2016)?</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: We did not perform additional âground-truthâ experiments that would allow us to make definitive statements concerning field curvature, as was done in the initial eLife Thorlabs mesoscope paper (Sofroniew et al, 2016).</p><p>We estimate that we experience ~200 micrometers of depth offset across 2.5 mm - for example, if the objective is orthogonal to our 10 mm radius bend window and centered at the apex of its convexity, a small ROI located at the lateral edge of the side mount preparation would need to be positioned around 200 micrometers below that of an equivalent ROI placed near the apex in order to image neurons at the same cortical layer/depth, and would be at close to the same depth as an ROI placed at or near the midline, at the medial edge of the window. We determined this by examining the geometry of our cranial windows, and by comparing z-depth information from adjacent sessions in the same mouse, the first of which used a large FOV and the second of which used multiple small FOVs optimized so that they sampled from the same cortical layers across areas.</p><p>We have included this brief explanation in the main text at ~lines 300-311, pg 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 513-515, the authors mentioned that the vasculature pattern can change over the course of the experiment which then requires to re-perform the realignment procedure. How stable is the vasculature pattern? Would laser speckle contrast yield more reliable results?</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: In general the changes in vasculature we observed were minimal but involved the following: (i) sometimes a vessel was displaced or moved during the window surgery, (ii) sometimes a vessel, in particular the sagittal sinus, enlarged or increased its apparent diameter over time if it is not properly pressured by the cranial window, and (iii) sometimes an area experiencing window pressure that is too low could, over time, show outgrowth of fine vascular endings. The most common of these was (i), and (iii) was perhaps the least common. In general the vasculature was quite stable.</p><p>We have added this brief discussion of potential vasculature changes after cranial window surgery to the main text at ~lines 286-293, pg 9.</p><p>We already mentioned, in the main text of the original eLife reviewed preprint, that we re-imaged the multimodal map (MMM) every 30-60 days or whenever changes in vasculature are observed, in order to maintain a high accuracy of CCF alignment over time. See ~lines 507-511, pg 16.</p><p>We are not very familiar with laser speckle contrast, and it seems like a technique that could conceivably improve the fine-grained accuracy of our MMM-CCF alignment in some instances. We will try this in the future, but for now it seems like our alignments are largely constrained by several large blood vessels present in any given FOV, and so it is unclear how we would incorporate such fine-grained modifications without applying local non-rigid manipulations of our images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 588-598, the authors mentioned that the occasional use of online fast-z corrections yielded no difference. However, it seems that the combination of the online fast-z correction yielded &quot;cleaner&quot; raster maps (Figure S3)?</p></disp-quote><p>Authorsâ Response: The Rastermaps in Fig S3a and b are qualitatively similar. We do not believe that any systematic difference exists between their clustering or alignments, and we did not observe any such differences in other sessions that either used or didnât use online fast-z motion correction.</p><p>We now provide raw data and analysis files corresponding to the sessions shown in Fig S3 (and other data-containing figures) on FigShare+ at:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.c.7052513">https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.c.7052513</ext-link></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ideally, the datasets contained in the paper should be available on an open repository for others to examine.
