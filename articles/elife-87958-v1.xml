mediated by intrinsically disordered segments flanking the conserved catalytic domain. The doublecortin-like kinases (DCLKs) are a family of microtubule-associated proteins characterized by a flexible C-terminal autoregulatory ‘tail’ segment that varies in length across the various human DCLK isoforms. However, the mechanism whereby these isoform-specific variations contribute to unique modes of autoregulation is not well understood. Here, we employ a combination of statistical sequence analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and in vitro mutational analysis to define hallmarks of DCLK family evolutionary divergence, including analysis of splice variants within the DCLK1 sub-family, which arise through alternative codon usage and serve to ‘supercharge’ the inhibitory potential of the DCLK1 C-tail. We identify co-conserved motifs that readily distinguish DCLKs from all other calcium calmodulin kinases (CAMKs), and a ‘Swiss Army’ assembly of distinct motifs that tether the C-terminal tail to conserved ATP and substrate-binding regions of the catalytic domain to generate a scaffold for autoregulation through C-tail dynamics. Consistently, deletions and mutations that alter C-terminal tail length or interfere with co-conserved interactions within the catalytic domain alter intrinsic protein stability, nucleotide/inhibitor binding, and catalytic activity, suggesting isoform-specific regulation of activity through alternative splicing. Our studies provide a detailed framework for investigating kinome-wide regulation of catalytic output through cis-regulatory events mediated by intrinsically disordered segments, opening new avenues for the design of mechanistically divergent DCLK1 modulators, stabilizers, or degraders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular biology</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>catalytic activity</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM139656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kannan</surname><given-names>Natarajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000357</institution-id><institution>North West Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CR1208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daly</surname><given-names>Leonard A</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyers</surname><given-names>Claire E</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyers</surname><given-names>Patrick A</given-names></name><name><surname>Byrne</surname><given-names>Dominic P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S018514/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Byrne</surname><given-names>Dominic P</given-names></name><name><surname>Daly</surname><given-names>Leonard A</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyers</surname><given-names>Patrick A</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyers</surname><given-names>Claire E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N021703/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Byrne</surname><given-names>Dominic P</given-names></name><name><surname>Daly</surname><given-names>Leonard A</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyers</surname><given-names>Patrick A</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyers</surname><given-names>Claire E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/X002780/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Byrne</surname><given-names>Dominic P</given-names></name><name><surname>Daly</surname><given-names>Leonard A</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyers</surname><given-names>Patrick A</given-names></name><name><surname>Eyers</surname><given-names>Claire E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Isoform-specific variations in doublecortin-like kinases offer a new framework for understanding kinome-wide modulation of protein stability and catalytic activity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein kinases are one of the largest druggable protein families comprising 1.7% of the human genome and play essential roles in regulating diverse eukaryotic cell signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manning et al., 2002</xref>). The doublecortin-like kinases (DCLKs) are understudied members of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CAMK) clade of serine-threonine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agulto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayer and Schulman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gógl et al., 2019</xref>). There are three distinct paralogs of DCLK (1, 2, and 3), the last of which is annotated as a ‘dark’ kinase due to the lack of information pertaining to its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berginski et al., 2021</xref>). Human DCLK1 (also known as DCAMKL1) was initially identified in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sossey-Alaoui and Srivastava, 1999</xref>), followed by the cloning of human DCLK2 and -3 paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ohmae et al., 2006</xref>). Full-length DCLK proteins contain N-terminal doublecortin-like (DCX) domains, microtubule-binding elements that play a role in microtubule dynamics, neurogenesis, and neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couillard-Despres et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horesh et al., 1999</xref>). DCLKs have garnered much interest as disease biomarkers, since they are upregulated in a variety of cancer pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Westphalen et al., 2017</xref>), as well as neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galvan et al., 2018</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which DCLK activity is autoregulated, and how and why they have diverged from other protein kinases is not well understood.</p><p>Like all protein kinases, the catalytic domain of DCLKs adopts a bi-lobal fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gógl et al., 2019</xref>), with an N-terminal ATP-binding lobe and C-terminal substrate-binding region. Canonical elements within the two lobes include the DFG motif, a Lys-Glu salt bridge that is associated with the active conformation, Gly-rich loop, and ATP-binding pocket, which are all critical elements for catalysis. Many protein kinases, including CAMKs, tyrosine kinases, and AGCs, elaborate on these core elements with unique N-terminal and C-terminal extensions that flank these catalytic lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kannan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yeon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwon et al., 2018</xref>), allowing them to function as allosteric regulators of catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gógl et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, CAMKs are archetypal examples of kinases that can exist in an active-like structural conformation, yet still remain catalytically inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gógl et al., 2019</xref>). This is in large part due to the presence of unique C-terminal tails that are capable of blocking ATP or substrate binding in well-studied kinases such as CAMK1 and CAMKII. In canonical CAMKs, autoinhibition may be released upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (CaM) interaction with the CAMK C-tail, which makes the substrate-binding pocket and enzyme active site accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rellos et al., 2010</xref>). In CAMKII, the N- and C-terminal segments flanking the kinase domain are variable in length across different isoforms and the level of kinase autoinhibition or autoactivation has been reported to be dependent on the linker length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2020</xref>). The CAMKII C-tail can be organized into an autoregulatory domain and an intrinsically disordered association domain. The autoregulatory domain also serves as a pseudosubstrate, which physically blocks the substrate-binding pocket until it is competed away by CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hudmon and Schulman, 2002</xref>). Notably, this autoregulatory pseudosubstrate can be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rellos et al., 2010</xref>), and phosphorylation of the C-tail makes CAMKII insensitive to CaM binding. Across the CAMK group, several other kinases share autoinhibitory activity via interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding domains and the C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wayman et al., 2008</xref>), and a major feature of these kinases is variation in the tail length across the distinct genetic isoforms.</p><p>The human genome encodes four distinct DCLK1 isoforms, termed DCLK1.1–1.4 in UniProt (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Omori et al., 1998</xref>), which display differential activity- and tissue-specific expression profiles. Human DCLK1.1 (also known as DCLK1 alpha) is expressed in a variety of tissues, but is enriched in cells derived from the fetal and adult brain, whereas DCLK1.2 (also known as DCLK1 beta) is expressed exclusively in the embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matsumoto et al., 1999</xref>). DCLK1.3 and DCLK1.4, which lack tandem microtubule-binding DCX domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) but are otherwise identical to DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2, respectively, are also highly expressed in the brain. To aid with clarity, the names of the human DCLK1 genes and their isoforms used in this paper are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Recent structural and cellular analyses have begun to clarify the mechanisms by which the DCLK1.2 isoform is regulated by the C-tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agulto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2022b</xref>). Mechanistically, autophosphorylation of Thr 688, which is present only in the C-tail of DCLK1.2 (and DCLK1.4), blunts kinase activity and subsequently inhibits phosphorylation of the N-terminal DCX domain and thus drives DCLK microtubule association in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agulto et al., 2021</xref>). Consistently, deletion of the C-tail or mutation of Thr 688 restores DCLK1.2 kinase activity, subsequently leading to DCX domain phosphorylation and the abolition of microtubule binding.

We identify the C-terminal tail as the hallmark of DCLK functional specialization across the kingdoms of life and propose a refined model in which this regulated tail functions as a highly adaptable ‘Swiss Army Knife’ that can ‘supercharge’ multiple aspects of DCLK signaling output. Notably, a conserved segment of the C-tail functions as an isoform-specific autoinhibitory motif, which mimics ATP functions through direct tail docking to the nucleotide-binding pocket, where it forms an ordered set of interactions that aligns the catalytic (C) spine of the kinase in the absence of ATP binding. Furthermore, molecular modeling demonstrates that a phosphorylated threonine in the C-tail of DCLK1.2, which is absent in DCLK1.1, is positionally poised to competitively mimic the gamma phosphate of ATP, perhaps in a regulated manner. Other segments of the tail function as a pseudosubstrate by occluding the substrate-binding pocket and tethering to key functional regions of the catalytic domain. Thermostability analysis of purified DCLK1 proteins, combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, confirms major differences in thermal and dynamic profiles of the DCLK1 isoforms, while catalytic activity assays reveal how specific variations in the G-loop and C-tail can rescue DCLK1.2 from the autoinhibited conformation. Together, these studies demonstrate that isoform-specific variations in the C-terminal tail co-evolved with residues in the DCLK kinase domain, contributing to regulatory diversification and functional specialization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Origin and evolutionary divergence of DCLK family members</title><p>The human DCLKs’ repertoire is composed of three genes, termed DCLK1, -2, and -3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The experimental model employed in this study, DCLK1, is composed of multiple spliced variants in human cells. Those full-length proteins that contain N-terminal DCX domains are usually referred to as DCLK1.1 or DCLK1.2 and the variants that lack the DCX domains are termed here (for simplicity) ΔDCLK 1.1 and ΔDCLK1.2 (also referred to as DCLK1.3 and DCLK1.4). The core catalytic domain with minimal flanking regions (DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) is identical in all DCLK1 proteins, whereas the length of the tail, or the presence of the DCX domains, generates considerable diversity from the single human DCLK1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To infer evolutionary relationships of DCLK paralogs, and especially the evolution of the C-terminal tail regions that lie adjacent to the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we performed phylogenetic analysis of 36 DCLK sequences with an outgroup of closely related CAMK sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). These DCLK sequences are from a representative group of holozoans, which consist of multicellular eukaryotes (metazoans) and closely related unicellular eukaryotes (pre-metazoans). The analysis generated four distinct clades: pre-metazoan DCLK, metazoan DCLK3, vertebrate DCLK2, and vertebrate DCLK1. Interestingly, DCLK genes demonstrated significant expansion and diversification within metazoan taxa. The pre-metazoan DCLK sequences were the most ancestral and showed no DCLK diversity, suggesting the DCLK expansion and diversification correlated with the evolution of multicellular organisms. Within the metazoan expansion of DCLK, DCLK3 is the most ancestral and can be broken down into two sub-clades: protostome DCLK3 and deuterostome DCLK3. Within invertebrates, only two DCLK paralogs were present, one that was identified as a DCLK3 ortholog and another that was not clearly defined as either DCLK1 or DCLK2. This suggests that the diversification into DCLK1 and DCLK2 paralogs from an ancestral DCLK1/2-like paralog occurred after the divergence of invertebrates and vertebrates, which is further supported by the monophyletic DCLK1 and DCLK2 clades in vertebrates (bootstrap value: 99).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Evolution of the doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK) family.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree showing the divergence and grouping of DCLK sub-families in different taxonomic groups.

Within both protostome and deuterostome DCLK3, the length of the C-terminal tail is ~50 residues or less. This is in marked contrast to the tail lengths of vertebrate DCLK1 and DCLK2, which are ~100 residues long. In addition to the C-terminal tail, an analysis of the domain organization of these DCLKs reveals that DCLK3 predominantly contains only a single N-terminal doublecortin domain (DCX), whereas invertebrate DCLKs, and vertebrate DCLK1 and DCLK2 predominantly contain two DCX domains at the N-terminus of the long isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, we identified a putative active site-binding motif, VSVI, and a phosphorylatable threonine conserved within vertebrate DCLK1 and DCLK2, which is absent in all other DCLK sequences, including invertebrate DCLK1/2. This raises the possibility that the DCLK1/2 tail extensions are employed for vertebrate-specific regulatory functions.</p><p>Next, we compared the type of DCLK1 protein sequence encoded by a range of chordate mammalian genomes. The domain organization of each DCLK1 isoform was compared based on annotated sequences from UniProt, demonstrating the presence of at least one DCLK1 protein that lacks the DCX domains in every species examined, with a mixture of ΔDCLK1.1 and ΔDCLK1.2 splice variants. Interestingly, it was only in the human DCLK1 gene that definitive evidence for ΔDCLK1.1 and ΔDCLK1.2 variants were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To establish a model for DCLK1 biophysical analysis, we constructed a recombinant hybrid human DCLK1 catalytic domain with a short C-tail sequence that is equivalent to DCLK1.1 amino acids 351–689, containing the catalytic domain with a short C-tail region. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, incubation of size exclusion chromatography (SEC)-purified GST-tagged DCLK1 with 3C protease generated the mature untagged DCLK1 protein for biophysical analysis. Analytical SEC revealed that purified DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 isoforms are monomeric in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). We evaluated catalytic activity for DCLK1.1<sub>351-689</sub> using a validated peptide phosphorylation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which revealed efficient phosphorylation of a DCLK1 substrate peptide. The K<sub>M[ATP]</sub> for peptide phosphorylation was close to 20 µM in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel), similar to values measured for other Ser/Thr kinases that are autophosphorylated and active after expression from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne et al., 2020b</xref>). DCLK-dependent peptide phosphorylation was completely blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel) by prior incubation of the reaction mixture (containing 1 mM ATP) with the chemical inhibitor DCLK1-IN-1, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferguson et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to enzyme activity, we monitored thermal denaturation of purified, folded, DCLK1<sub>351-689</sub> protein in the presence of ATP, either alone or as a Mg:ATP complex, which is required for catalysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, DCLK1 was stabilized by 2.1°C upon incubation with an excess of Mg:ATP, and this protective effect was completely blocked by mutation of Asp 533 (of the conserved DFG motif) to Ala, consistent with canonical ATP interaction in the nucleotide-binding site. Finally, we assessed the thermal effects of a panel of DCLK1 inhibitors on the model DCLK1.1<sub>351-689</sub> protein. Prior incubation with DCLK1-IN-1, LRRK2-IN-1, the benzopyrimidodiazipinones XMD8-92 and XMD8-85, which have been reported to potently (though not specifically) inhibit DCLK1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patel et al., 2021</xref>), led to marked protection from thermal unfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Further examination of the intron and exon boundaries indicates that human DCLK1.1 contains an additional exon (exon 16) that is not spliced in DCLK1.2.

The crystal structure of DCLK1.2 (PDB: 6KYQ) was employed for the DCLK1.2<sub>short</sub> model and AlphaFold2 was used to model the other proteins (DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> and DCLK1.1<sub>short</sub>). Comparison of the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of the two isoforms in three different replicates of MD simulations indicates strikingly different thermal fluctuations in the C-terminal tails and catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). In particular, the IBS (between 682 and 688) is stably docked in the ATP-binding pocket in DCLK1.2 and an alpha-helical conformation is maintained during the microsecond time scale across different replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, bottom). In contrast, the IBS is more unstable in DCLK1.1, as indicated by high thermal fluctuations and a lack of secondary structure propensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, top). A caveat to bear in mind is that DCLK1.1 is an AlphaFold2 model, which will also account for increased RMSF. Analysis of sequence variations and structural interactions provides additional insights into the differential dynamics of the two isoforms. The helical conformation of the IDS in DCK1.2 is maintained during the simulation due, in part, to a capping interaction with Thr 687, which is absent in DCLK1.1 due to the alternative splicing event detailed above. Likewise, another key residue in DCLK1.2, Lys 692, anchors the tail to the catalytic domain through directional salt bridges with the conserved aspartates (Asp 511 and Asp 533) in the HRD and DFG motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These interactions are not observed in DCLK1.1 simulations because Lys 692 is substituted to a histidine (His 689), which is unable to form a corresponding interaction with the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also evaluated the effects of T688A (non-phosphorylated) or T688E (phosphomimetic) mutations through DCLK1 MD simulations and found that the two mutations slightly destabilize the tail relative to WT. Three replicates of the two mutants show increased RMSF of the tail region relative to WT DCLK1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Either mutation was not sufficiently destabilizing on its own to unlatch the C-tail, and we hypothesize that other residues in addition to T688 are also likely to be important for contributing to conformational regulation of the kinase domain by the C-terminal tail. The variable docking of the C-tail within the kinase domains of the two DCLK1 isoforms, and the extent to which this contributes to more transient or stable autoinhibited states are explored in more detail in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Residues contributing to the co-evolution and unique tethering of the C-terminal tail to the DCLK catalytic domain</title><p>To identify specific residues that contribute to the unique modes of DCLK regulation by the C-terminal tail, we performed statistical analysis of the evolutionary constraints acting on DCLK and related CAMK family sequences.

In comparison, the same region in DCLK1.1, which lacks Thr 687, is predicted to be unstructured.

The ΔTm values obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) demonstrate that mutation of Asp 398 or Asn 400 in the Gly-rich loop are by themselves insufficient to destabilize DCLK1.2. In marked contrast, dual mutation of the hydrophobic pair of Val 682 and Val 684 residues to Thr, or mutation of the acidic tail residue Asp 691, resulted in a pronounced reduction in DCLK1.2 thermal stability. Moreover, the recorded Tm values for these latter two mutations quite closely resembled the Tm of DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> (which lacks the C-tail entirely), which is consistent with the uncoupling of the C-tail and a commensurate decrease in thermal stability associated with loss of this interaction. We next determined the catalytic activity of our recombinant DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 proteins side-by-side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although partially diminished in relation to DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>, both DCLK1.1<sub>short</sub> (351–703) and DCLK1.1<sub>long</sub> (351–729) variants possess robust catalytic activity. This suggested ineffective ATP-competitive autoinhibition mediated by the C-tail segment of DCLK1.1 and is consistent with their closely matched Tm values to DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, both C-tail containing variants of DCLK1.1 (and particularly DCLK1.1<sup>351-729</sup>) exhibited lower affinity for ATP (inferred from K<sub>M[ATP]</sub> for peptide phosphorylation), which is consistent with partial occlusion of the ATP-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In marked contrast, the detectable kinase activity for short (351–703) or long (351–740) DCLK1.2 proteins was significantly blunted compared to DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>, exhibiting just ~5% of the activity of the catalytic domain alone, and consistently, the calculated K<sub>M[ATP]</sub> was ~4-fold higher compared to the catalytic domain lacking the C-tail. We also utilized autophosphorylation as a proxy for overall kinase activity. Quantitative tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of site-specific autophosphorylation within DCLK1.1<sub>short</sub> and DCLK1.2<sub>short</sub> demonstrate a marked reduction in the site-specific abundance of phosphate in DCLK1.2 when compared to DCLK1.1 at two separate sites that could be directly and accurately quantified by MS (S438 and S660, DCLK1.1 relative abundance set to 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). LC-MS/MS also indicated that several autophosphorylation sites identified in isoform 1 were absent in DCLK1.2 (Ser 683 and Thr 692, the latter of which is an amino acid that is unique to the C-tail of DCLK1.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, amino acid substitutions in the G-loop or the C-tail of DCLK1.2 designed to subvert C-tail and ATP site interactions also had major effects on DCLK1.2 phosphorylation and catalytic activity. DCLK1.2 D398A was activated some fivefold when compared to the WT form, whereas DCLK1.2 N400A was almost as active as the DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>. Consistently, DCLK1.2 V682T/V684T and D691A proteins were also much more active than the WT form of DCLK1.2.

Together, these observations confirm that targeted mutations are sufficient to relieve ATP-competitive C-tail autoinhibition by physical tail uncoupling; this model is also strongly supported by marked changes in the biophysical stability of the mutant proteins, particularly for V682/684T and D691A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Structural and Functional Analysis of DCLK1.2 Variants: Insights into Amino Acid Modifications, Thermal Stability, and Kinase Activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural depiction of DCLK1.2 (PDB: 6KYQ) showing the location of modified DCLK1 amino acids on the G-loop (purple) or C-tail (red).

DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> (351–686), DCLK1.1<sub>short</sub> (351–703) and DCLK1.1<sub>long</sub> (351–729) proteins all behaved similarly in the presence of either Mg:ATP or DCLK1-IN-1, inducing marked stabilization. In contrast, DCLK1.2<sub>short</sub> (351–703) or DCLK1.2<sub>long</sub> (351–740) proteins registered negligible thermal shifts in the presence of the same concentration of either ligand, which is in line with the C-tail tightly occupying the ATP-binding site and obstructing their binding. Remarkably, D398A and N400A DCLK1.2, whose high basal Tm values (compared to DCLK1<sub>cat</sub>) are consistent with stabilization by docking of the C-tail within the kinase domain, were markedly destabilized in the presence of either ligand. This suggests that incorporation of these G-loop mutations in isolation is insufficient to dislodge the C-tail, but rather that the stability of the interaction is compromised to the extent that either ATP or DCLK-IN-1 can competitively dislodge the bound tail from the ATP active site, resulting in a net destabilization caused by lack of tail engagement. This observation is corroborated by the results of our kinase assays, where both D398A and N400A mutants were more active than WT DCLK1.2, confirming appropriate ATP binding (a prerequisite for catalysis). Finally, DCLK1.2 V682T/V684T and D691A, which exhibit lower basal Tm values than the WT protein (indicating a loss of tail interaction), were both stabilized in a ligand-dependent manner to a similar degree to that observed for DCLK1<sub>cat</sub> and DCLK1.1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Collectively, these observations clearly demonstrate that the C-tail section of DCLK1.2 can both stabilize the canonical DCLK kinase domain and inhibit kinase activity (by impeding the binding and structural coordination of Mg:ATP) much more effectively than that of DCLK1.1. Our targeted mutational analysis of key contact residues in DCLK1.2 also clearly shows that this is a consequence of specific amino acid interactions that are absent in DCLK1.1 due to alternative-splicing and subsequent sequence variation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Classification of DCLK regulatory segments</title><p>We synthesized our experimental findings by classifying the DCLK C-tail into six functional segments, based on interactions with different regions of the catalytic domain and their conservation between the C-tail splice variants in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>): First is an ATP-mimetic peptide segment (residues 682–688 in DCLK1.2) that readily mimics physiological ATP binding by completing the C-spine in the nucleotide-binding site. The inhibitory peptide also contains a phosphorylatable Thr residue, which sits adjacent to the highly characteristic Gly-rich loop (GDGNFA, residues 396–402). Second, we define a pseudosubstrate mimic (residues 692–701), which interacts with the acidic HRD and DFG Asp sidechains and docks in the substrate pocket occluding substrate access. Third, at the C-terminus of the tail lies an IDS (residues 702–749, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), which packs dynamically against DCLK conserved residues in the kinase activation loop. Fourth, at the beginning of the C-tail lies a CAMK-tether (residues 654–664), a set of residues that pack against a CAMK-specific insert in the C-lobe. In many CAMK crystal structures, this insert makes multiple contacts with the F-helix and C-tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fifth, this is followed by a highly dynamic pseudosubstrate region (residues 672–678) that occludes the substrate pocket and will thus interfere with substrate phosphorylation. Sixth, a transient beta-strand is formed in DCLK1.2 through amino acid-specific sequences that help modulate and potentially strengthen binding of the C-tail in this isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Collectively, these segments and their associated interaction sites demonstrate that co-evolution of the unique C-tail with the catalytic domain is the central hallmark of DCLK functional divergence, and that changes in these segments possess the ability to ‘supercharge’ catalytic output of the kinase. In particular, the variable C-terminal segments of the tail might contribute to isoform-specific functional specialization. The combinatorial diversity of events that modulate C-tail function may allow DCLKs to nimbly coordinate various tasks including ATP-binding, substrate-based phosphorylation, regulation of DCX domain phosphorylation and structural disposition, kinase autoinhibition, and allosteric regulation. Isoform-specific variability provides additional nuance to regulatory and catalytic signaling events and may even contribute to differences in cellular localization (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleoplasm) and tissue-specific activity, enabling contextual DCLK regulation through these modular sequence segments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A DCLK1 C-tail can act as a multi-functional Swiss Army Knife, using six distinct segments for a variety of regulatory functions including mimicking ATP binding/association, stabilizing the G-loop, occluding the substrate-binding pocket, and packing against the kinase activation loop.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87958-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig9s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 9—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Intrinsic disorder prediction of DCLK1.2 C-tail using IUPRED3.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87958-fig9-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The kinase domain is a conserved switch for phosphorylation-based catalytic regulation. Yet the complexity of cell signaling pathways demands other nuanced forms of regulation beyond binary ‘on’ or ‘off’ switch-based mechanisms. For many Ser/Thr kinases, including AGC and CAMK families, these distinct regulatory functions come from segments which flank the kinase domain, N- and C-terminal regions, which serve to modulate activity through allosteric activation, inhibition, or rheostatic behaviors that change based on environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gógl et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we expand on our knowledge of allosteric diversity in the human kinome by revealing how alternative splicing of the DCLK1 C-tail contributes to isoform-specific behaviors, coupling regulation of catalytic output, phosphorylation, protein dynamics and stability, substrate binding, and protein-protein interactions. Our ‘Swiss Army Knife’ model for DCLK1 expands our view of allosteric regulation as not just a dynamic process facilitated by proteins, but one where adaptive genetic mechanisms, like differential splicing, dexterously tune isoform-specific functions for specific cellular signaling roles; in the case of DCLK1.1, this allows ‘supercharging’ of catalysis between splice variants due to key amino acid differences in the C-tail that are lacking in the DCLK1.2 isoform.</p><p>Multiple members of the human kinome have independently evolved C-tail regions that dock to the N- or C-lobe of the kinase domain in cis. In the case of the AGC kinases, the C-terminal tail is a very well-studied in cis modulatory element that serves to explain a variety of regulatory properties in this kinase sub-family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kannan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Romano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baffi and Newton, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>). Classical deletion studies with members of the CAMK family have also revealed a cis-acting inhibitory element lying C-terminal to the catalytic domain of both CAMK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yokokura et al., 1995</xref>) and CAMK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang and Schulman, 1999</xref>). More recent examples of C-tail functional diversity in CAMK family members are presented by the human pseudokinases TRIB1 and TRIB2, which employ C-tail sequences to either latch (and structurally restrict) the atypical kinase domain or to bind competitively to the ubiquitin E3 ligase COP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eyers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eyers et al., 2017</xref>).

Before the IBS, we observe the formation of an anti-parallel transient beta-sheet with the beta1 strand in the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). During the formation of this transient structure, the C-tail dynamically occludes part of the substrate-binding pocket. A beta-sheet is observed in all three MD replicates of DCLK1.1, but only in a single replicate of DCLK1.2 dynamic analysis. At the other end of the IBS is another pseudosubstrate segment whose structure and dynamics change as a result of alternative exon splicing. In DCLK1.2, the pseudosubstrate segment is stable, with an average RMSF of 1.8 Å, facilitated by key interactions from Lys 692, which coordinates acidic residues in the HRD and DFG motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In DCLK1.1, Lys 692 is replaced by a His, which weakly coordinates with the HRD and DFG motifs, resulting in increased dynamics of the segment and an RMSF of 3.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Together, residue variation between isoforms contributes to differences in stability and alteration of dynamics of the tail. HPCAL1 was recently proposed as a possible substrate that activates DCLK1 in a calcium-dependent manner, but it is unclear how it may bind DCLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patel et al., 2021</xref>). Because only exon 15 of the C-tail is conserved between the isoforms, it is possible that the location of binding occurs in this dynamic pseudosubstrate segment prior to the IBS, where increased flexibility and occlusion of the substrate pocket is reflective of the absence of HPCAL1, or a similar CaM-like substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Discovery of the DCLK1 ATP-mimic region, a splice-variant specific regulatory module</title><p>Our structural analysis of DCLK1 reveals a remarkable structural mimic of ATP located in the C-tail, which differs markedly between DCLK1.1 and DLCK1.2 splice variants. We note for the first time that a set of three residues in the ATP-mimic, Val 682, Val 684, and Ile 685, are conserved across all isoforms of DCLK1 and DCLK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and serve to extend the kinase C-spine. Mutation of these residues in DCLK1.2 uncouples tail binding and activates the kinase. Proximal to these residues are two Thr residues (Thr 687 and Thr 688), which are present in DCLK1.2, but absent in DCLK1.1. Based on published phosphoproteomics data, both Thr residues can be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agulto et al., 2021</xref>) and are thus likely to be regulatory in DCLK1.2. Although we could not detect phosphorylation of either of these predicted regulatory sites in the WT form of DCLK1.2, we consistently observed pThr 688 in activated mutant DCLK1.2 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). By analyzing DCLK1 dynamics using MD simulations, we observed multiple key interactions between the G-loop and the C-tail in DCLK1, such as dipole interactions with the second glycine in the G-loop by the phosphothreonine. In addition, Thr 687 contributes to increased stabilization of DCLK1.2 tail by forming a C-cap with the helical ATP-mimic segment. We aligned the intensively-studied protein kinase (PKA, PDB: 1ATP), a DCLK1.2 structure (PDB: 6KYQ), and frames of our MD trajectory, which demonstrate remarkable overlap of the ATP gamma phosphate and C-tail phosphothreonine, which seemingly acts as a mimic for the ATP co-factor. As phosphorylation is reported to lead to DCLK1 inhibition, this suggests a complex mechanism of regulation, in which the DCLK-specific constraints in the G-loop, the intrinsic flexibility of the C-tail, and threonine phosphorylation, by cis- or trans-mediated modification, systematically prevent hyperphosphorylation of the doublecortin domains and cellular effects. Somewhat paradoxically, we could only identify phosphorylated Thr 688 in activated DCLK1.2 mutants, but not in the autoinhibited (WT) version form. This suggests that the selected mutations exhibit a regulatory hierarchical dominance over inhibitory Thr 688 phosphorylation and are sufficient to liberate DCLK1.2 from its autoinhibited, C-tail-bound state. This also implies that phosphorylation of Thr 688 may only be minimally required for autoinhibition, especially given its association with the hyperactive variants obtained by mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we have evaluated the terminal residues in the DCLK1 C-tail, which are predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Side-by-side analysis of DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 in which this region is added from a common core terminating at residue 703 shows that increasing the length of the tail in both DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 has little additional effect on the inhibitory or stabilizing effects driven by the highly ordered tail regions that precede it. Kinase domains are regulated by IDRs in a multitude of ways, but the CAMK family is specifically enriched for adapted C-terminal extensions that, as we show here, can block the ATP and substrate binding, and enzymatically inactivate the kinase domain by occlusion of the activation loop through a flexible helical IDS on their C-tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gógl et al., 2019</xref>). We note that the DCLK1.2 kinase domain crystallizes in an ‘active’ closed conformation, despite binding of the C-tail in an autoinhibitory manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2022b</xref>). Repeated packing motions of the IDS against the activation loop in all replicates of DCLK1.1 MD simulations suggest that tail may occlude the activation loop, similar to other CAMKs, possibly pointing to a mode of <italic>cis</italic> autoregulation. Conversely, AlphaFold2 predicts the placement of the DCX domains as adjacent to the IDS in both DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible that, like other CAMKs, the IDS facilitates protein binding, whether to the DCX domains, calcium-modulated proteins, or other kinases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Evolutionary divergence and functional specialization of DCLKs</title><p>For the DCLK family as a whole, we discovered phylogenetic divergence between DCLK1 and -2 as a relatively recent event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in which metazoan DCLK3 is the more ancestral DCLK gene from which DCLK1 and -2 emerged after duplication. Because of shared evolutionary constraints and the recent divergence between DCLK1 and -2, we surmise the functional specialization of the DCLK1 tail is shared between these paralogs. Moreover, we quantify key differences between human DCLK1.1 and -1.2 activity that are impacted by amino acid changes that contribute to the function of the C-tail. The differences between DCLK1 isoforms 1 and 2 are generated by variations in exon splicing, which change both the C-tail protein sequence, and introduce or exclude potential phosphorylation sites. Expression of the highly autoinhibitable DCLK1.2 isoform is believed to be predominant in the brain during embryogenesis, although DCLK1.1 is also thought to be present in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess and Reiner, 2002</xref>). It is therefore possible that an altered ratio in DCLK1.1/1.2 expression, accompanied by changes in the requirement for DCLK1 autoregulation, is relevant for early neurogenesis. The overall sequence similarity at the protein level, despite the loss of a pair of putative phosphorylation sites, suggests a possible exon duplication in the C-tail, whereby polymorphisms have allowed for adaptive regulation during development and proliferation. Indeed, we also speculate that the induced expression of DCLK1.2 splice variants in multiple cancer subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qu et al., 2019</xref>) is likely to be indicative of a survival and drug resistance role that could be targetable with new types of small molecule. Although nanomolar DCLK1 ATP site inhibitors such as DCLK1-IN-1 have been developed that can bind tightly to the DCLK1 ATP site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), the ‘problematic’ existence of human DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 splice variants with distinct autoinhibitory properties may present a challenge to compound engagement in the cell, where relief of autoinhibition through C-tail undocking in DCLK1.2 is likely to require a high concentration of compound in order to compete and disengage interactions at the ATP site. Indeed, although potent chemical DCLK1 inhibitors such as DCLK1-IN-1 are known to influence DCLK1 autophosphorylation and cell motility, they have relatively modest effects in cells in terms of cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferguson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the dual inhibitory effects of the C-tail and the transmission of this information to adjacent DCX domains, which control adaptive cellular phenotypes such as EMT in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Major et al., 1985</xref>), may make allosteric classes of DCLK1 inhibitor a preferred therapeutic option, especially if they can be tailored specifically toward DCLK1.1 or DCLK1.2, whose autoregulation is different in terms of the varied molecular details we have uncovered here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ortholog identification</title><p>To identify orthologs, we used the software KinOrtho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2021</xref>) to query one-to-one orthologous relationships for DCLK1/2/3 across the proteome.

Thermal melting data were processed using the Boltzmann equation to generate sigmoidal denaturation curves, and average <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>/Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values were calculated as described using GraphPad Prism software, as previously described, from three technical repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrne et al., 2020a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>DCLK1 kinase assays</title><p>DCLK1 peptide-based enzyme assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Omar et al., 2023</xref>) were carried out using the LabChip EZ Reader platform, which monitors and quantifies real-time phosphorylation-induced changes in the mobility of the fluorescently labeled DCLK1 peptide substrate 5-FAM-KKALRRQETVDAL-CONH<sub>2</sub>. To assess DCLK1 catalytic domains, or DCLK1.1 or DCLK1.2 variants, 100 ng of purified protein were incubated with a high (1 mM) concentration of ATP (to mimic cellular levels of nucleotide) and 2 μM of the fluorescent substrate in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.001% (vol/vol) Brij 35. DCLK1-IN-1 and DCLK1-NEG (kind gifts from Dr Fleur Ferguson, UCSF) enzyme inhibition was quantified under identical assay conditions in the presence of 10 μM of each compound. Assays are either reported as rates (pmoles/min phosphate incorporation) during linear phosphate incorporation (e.g. total substrate phosphorylation limited to &lt;20–30% to prevent ATP depletion and to ensure assay linearity) or presented as time-dependent percentage substrate phosphorylation (kinetic mode). Rates of substrate phosphorylation (pmol phosphate incorporation per minute) were determined using a fixed amount of kinase and linear regression analysis with GraphPad Prism software; V<sub>max</sub> and K<sub>M[ATP]</sub> values were calculated at 2 µM substrate peptide concentration, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McSkimming et al., 2016</xref>). Rates are normalized to enzyme concentration and all enzyme rate and kinetic data are presented as mean and SD of four technical replicates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-87958-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated in this study are included within the manuscript.

In this work, the authors provide evolutionary and some mechanistic evidence about how c-terminal isoform specific variants generated by alternative splicing can regulate catalytic activity by means of coupling specific phosphorylation sites to dynamical and conformational changes controlling active site and substrate pocket occupancy, as well as interfering with protein-protein interacting interfaces that altogether provides evidence of c-terminal isoform specific regulation of the catalytic activity in protein kinases.</p><p>The paper is overall well written, the rationale and the fundamental questions are clear and well explained, the evolutionary and MD analyses are very detailed and well explained. Overall I think this is a study that brings some new aspects and concepts that are important for the protein kinase field, in particular the allosteric regulation of the catalytic core by c-terminal segments, and how evolutionary cues generate more sophisticated mechanisms of allosteric control in protein kinases.</p><p>Current submission: I have read and gone through the revised manuscript and the rebuttal letter and I confirm that the authors did an excellent job answering all the comments satisfactorily.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87958.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, the authors explore the structure/function of the DCLK kinases, most specifically DCLK1 as it is the most studied to date. Recently, the C-terminal domain has garnered attention as it was found to regulate the kinase domain, however, the different isoforms retain additional amino acid sequences with as-yet-undefined functions. The authors provide an evolutionary and biochemical characterization of these regions and provide evidence for some functionality for these additional C-terminal sequences. While these experiments are informative they do require that the protein is soluble and not membrane-bound as has been suggested to be important for functionality in other studies. Still, this is a major contribution to understanding the structure/function of these proteins that will be important in future experimental designs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

In this work, the authors provide evolutionary and some mechanistic evidence about how c-terminal isoform specific variants generated by alternative splicing can regulate catalytic activity by means of coupling specific phosphorylation sites to dynamical and conformational changes controlling active site and substrate pocket occupancy, as well as interfering with protein-protein interacting interfaces that altogether provides evidence of c-terminal isoform specific regulation of the catalytic activity in protein kinases.</p><p>The paper is overall well written, the rationale and the fundamental questions are clear and well explained, the evolutionary and MD analyses are very detailed and well explained. The methodology applied in terms of the biochemical and biophysical tools falls a bit short in some places and some comments and suggestions are given in this respect. If the authors could monitor somehow protein auto-phosphorylation as a functional readout would be very useful by means of using phospho-specific antibodies to monitor activity. Overall I think this is a study that brings some new aspects and concepts that are important for the protein kinase field, in particular the allosteric regulation of the catalytic core by c-terminal segments, and how evolutionary cues generate more sophisticated mechanisms of allosteric control in protein kinases. However a revision would be recommended.</p><p>Major Comments</p><p>The authors explain in the introduction the role of T688 autophosphorylation site in the function of DCLK1.2. This site when phosphorylated have a detrimental impact on catalytic activity and inhibits phosphorylation of the DCX domain. allowing the interaction with microtubules. In the paper they show how this site is generated by alternative splicing and intron skipping in DCLK1.2. However there is no further functional evidence along the functional experiments presented in this study.</p><p>1. What is the effect of a non-phosphorylable T688 mutant in terms of stability and enzymatic activity? What would be the impact of this mutant in the overall auto-phosphorylation reaction?</p></disp-quote><p>The role of T688 phosphorylation on DCLK1 functions has been explored in previous studies (Agulto et al, 2020: PMID: 34310279), although only relevant to DCLK1.2 splice variants, since this site is lacking in DCLK1.1. These studies showed that mutation of T688 to an alanine increases total kinase autophosphorylation (ie autoactivity) and the subsequent phosphorylation of DCX domains, which in turn decreases microtubule binding. Given this information, our goal was to use an evolutionary perspective to investigate this, alongside less-well characterized aspects of DCLK autoregulation, including co-conserved residues in the catalytic domain and C-terminal tail. However, to address the reviewers question of a non-phosphorylatable T688 mutant, we performed MD simulations of T688A and T688E (a phosphomimic) mutant and include a new supplementary figure (Figure 5-supplement 3) which show the two mutants slightly destabilize the C-tail relative to wt (1 and 2 angstrom increase in RMSF for T688E and T688A respectively), but by themselves cannot dislodge the C-tail from the ATP binding pocket. Thus, other co-conserved interactions as revealed by our analysis, are likely to contribute to the autoregulation of the kinase domain by the C-terminal tail. We have incorporated these observations into the revised results section.</p><p>Furthermore, to address the reviewer’s question in terms of site-specific autophosphorylation as a marker of DCLK1.2 activity, we have now performed a much-more detailed phosphoproteomic analysis of a panel of purified DCLK1.2 proteins after purification from <italic>E. coli</italic> (Figure 8-figure supplement 2). This showed that we are only able to detect Thr 688 phosphorylated in our ‘activated’ DCLK1.2 mutants, and not in the autoinhibited WT DCLK1.2 version of the protein. This apparent contradiction does not necessary discount Thr 688 as an important regulatory hotspot, but, together with the MD simulations, may imply a decreased contribution of pThr 688 in facilitating/maintaining DCLK1.2 auto-inhibition than previously anticipated, especially in the context of the numerous other stabilizing amino acid contacts that we describe between the C-tail and the ATP-binding pocket. We do, however, propose a mechanism for pThr688 as a potential ATP mimic based on MD analysis. However, we only found MS-based evidence for phosphorylation at this (and other sites in the same peptide) in highly active DCLK1.2 mutants, in which the C-tail remains uncoupled from the ATP-binding site, even in the presence of this regulatory PTM. We acknowledge that better understanding of DCLK biology will require a detailed appraisal of how the DCLK auto-inhibited states are subsequently physiologically regulated (PTMs, protein-protein interaction etc.), but this is beyond the scope of our current evolutionary investigation, and the absence of phosphospecific antibodies makes this challenging currently. We intend to expand upon our current work by assessing the relative contribution of multiple DCLK phosphorylation sites (including, but not limited to, Thr 688) with regard to cellular DCLK auto-regulation in future studies, in part by generating such site-specific phospho-antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Have the authors made an equivalent T687/688 tanden in DCLK1.1 instead of the two prolines?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have not considered introducing a T687/688 tandem mutation into DCLK1.1 (at the equivalent position to that of DCLK1.2), primarily because the amino acid composition of their respective C-tail domains are so highly divergent across the tail (due to alternative splicing, as discussed in our paper). As discussed in our present study, there are numerous contacts made between specific amino acids in the regulatory C-tail and the kinase domain of DCLK1.2, which functionally occlude ATP binding, and thus change catalytic output. It is these contacts, which are determined by the specific amino acid sequence identity, and not the extended length of the DCLK1.2 C-tail per se, that drives autoinhibition. The alternate amino acid sequence identity of the C-tail of DCLK1.1 does not enable such contacts to form, which we believe explains the different activities of the two isoforms.</p><p>Furthermore, our mutational analysis reveals clearly that Thr688 and several other sites are more highly autophosphorylated in the artificially activated DCLK1.2 constructs than WT DCLK1.2, and as such it remains our hypothesis that introduction of the tandem phosphorylation sites into DCLK1.1 is unlikely to be sufficient to impose an auto-inhibitory conformation of the enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Could T688 autophosphorylation be used as a functional readout to evaluate DCLK1.2 activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion about using autophosphorylation (including potentially Thr688 for DCLK1.2) as a functional read out for DCLK1 activity. In our present study, we identify phosphorylated peptides containing pThr688 only in the mutationally activated DCLK1.2 variants. We have now taken this analytical approach further and performed a detailed comparative phosphoproteomic characterisation of all of our DCLK1 constructs, where we observe marked differences in the overall phosphorylation profiles of the mutant DCLK1.2 (and DCLK1.1) proteins relative to the less phosphorylated WT DCLK1.2 kinase. This manifests as a depletion in the total number of confidently assigned phosphorylation sites within the kinase domain and C-tail of WT DCLK1.2, and also as a depletion in the abundance of phosphorylated peptides for a given site. To help visualise this, individual phosphorylation sites have been schematically mapped onto DCLK1, which has been included as a new extended supplementary figure (Figure 8-figure supplement 2). For comparative analysis of phosphosite abundance, we could only select peptides that could be directly compared between all mutants (identical amino acid sequences) and those found to be phosphorylated in all proteins (these are Ser660 and Thr438); these are now shown in figure supplement 2 as a table. These site occupancies follow what we see with respect to the increased catalytic activity between DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 mutants versus DCLK1.2. We also detect increased phosphorylation of DCLK1.1 and activated DCLK1.2 mutants in comparison to (autoinhibited) DCLK1.2, supporting the hypothesis that these mutants are relieving the autoinhibited conformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. What are the evidences of the here described c-terminal specific interactions to be intra-molecular rather than inter-molecular? Have the authors looked at the monodispersion and molecular mass in solution of the different protein evaluated in this study? Basically, are the proteins in solutions monomers or dimers/oligomers?</p></disp-quote><p>Analysis of symmetry mates in the crystal structure of DCLK1.2 (PDB ID: 6KYQ) provide no evidence for inter-molecular interactions. Furthermore, to evaluate oligomerization status in solution, we conducted an analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and our analysis reveals that both DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2 predominantly exist as monomers in solution (Figure 3-Supplements 1-3). These results suggest that the C-terminal tail interactions are primarily intra-molecular.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. (Figure 3) Did the authors look at the mono-dispersion of the protein preparation? The sec profile did result in one single peak or multiple peaks? Could the authors show the chromatogram? how many species do you have in solution? Was the tag removed from the recombinant proteins or not?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, as mentioned above, the SEC profile resulted in a single peak for both DCLK1.1 and DCLK1.2, which was confirmed as DCLK1 by subsequent SDS-PAGE. We have included the chromatogram and gels in supporting data (Figure 3-supplements 1-3) in the revised manuscript and updated the Methods section. ‘The short N-terminal 6-His affinity tag present on all other DCLK1 proteins described in this paper was left in situ on recombinant proteins, since it does not appear to interfere with DSF, biochemical interactions or catalysis.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Authors should do Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics as shown in Figure 3C with the WT when comparing all the functional variant analysed in the study. So we can compared the catalytic rates and enzymatic constants (depicted in a table also) kcat, Km and catalytic efficiency constants (kcat/Km)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have performed the requested comparative kinetics analyses for selected functional DCLK1 variants at the same concentration as suggested, using our real-time assay to determine Vmax for peptide phosphorylation as a function of ATP, but at a fixed substrate concentration (we are unable to assess Vmax above 5 µM peptide for technical reasons). The results of these analyses have been included in the revised version of Figure 8-Supplement 1, where they support differences in both Vmax and Km[ATP]; the ratio of these values very clearly points to differences in activities falling into ‘low’ or ‘high’. This kinetic analysis fully supports our initial activity assays, where mutations predicted to uncouple the auto-inhibitory C-tail rescue DCLK1.2 activity to levels similar to DCLK1.1 towards a common substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments</p><p>It is very interesting how the IBS together with the pT688 mimics ATP in the case of DCLK1.2 to reach full occupancy of the active site. On Figure 8 you evaluate residues of the GRL and IBS interface to probe such interactions.</p><p>1. Did the authors look at the T688 non-phosphorylable mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to Major Comment 1 above. In addition, due to the absence of T688 in DCLK1.1, we did not look at the T688A mutant of DCLK1.2 biochemically, partially because it has been characterized in previous studies, but partially because this site is preceeded by another Thr residue. The lack of a selective antibody towards this site makes it difficult to evaluate the role of T688 phosphorylation specifically with respect to DCLK cellular functions and interactions. Therefore, we focused our in vitro efforts to understand how mutations in the IBS impact the catalytic activity of DCLK1.2 by comparing different variants to DCLK1.1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Classification of DCLK C-terminal regulatory elements.</p><p>It would be useful to connect the different regulatory elements described in this study to a specific functional and biological setting where these different switches play a role e.g. microtubule interactions and dynamics, cell cycle, cancer, etc..</p></disp-quote><p>While the primary focus of our paper is on the mechanism of allosteric regulation of DCLK1, we have indeed touched upon the potential implications of the various regulatory elements of the tail on functions such as microtubule binding and phenotypic effects like cancer progression. However, we acknowledge that a comprehensive understanding of these effects would necessitate a more detailed investigation. This could potentially involve the integration of RNA-seq data with extensive cell assays to evaluate phenotypic effects. We believe that such a future study would be a valuable extension of our current work and could provide further insights into the functional roles of DCLK1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. (Figure 3) Could the authors explain the differences in yield between the WT and the D531A mutant. Apparently, it [the yield] does not appear to be caused by a lower stability as indicated by the Tm. Could the authors comment on this?It is important to compare different samples in parallel, in the same experiment and side by side. This applies to the thermal shift data comparing WT and a D531A mutant on panel D and also on panel C a comparison between WT and D531A as negative control should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>WT and D533A (kinase-dead) were indeed analysed in parallel, but have been split in two panels to make the data easier to interpret. The modest differences in yield is likely explained by experimental prep-to-prep variations. Our experience shows that many protein kinase yields vary between kinase and kinase-dead variants, likely due to bacterial toxicity related to enzyme activity. In regards to thermal stability, we would like to emphasize that Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF) is to our mind a more informative and quantitative measure of protein stability than yield from bacteria, because both assess purified proteins at the same concentration. We believe that the DSF data provide a more accurate representation of the real stability differences between the WT and D533A mutant.</p></body></sub-article></article>
