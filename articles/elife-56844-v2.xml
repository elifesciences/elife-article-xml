We used this system to explore two aspects of cargo protein traffic through prevacuolar endosome (PVE) compartments to the vacuole. First, at what point during Golgi maturation does a biosynthetic vacuolar cargo depart from the maturing cisternae? To address this question, we modified a regulatable fluorescent secretory cargo by adding a vacuolar targeting signal. Traffic of the vacuolar cargo requires the GGA clathrin adaptors, which arrive during the early-to-late Golgi transition. Accordingly, the vacuolar cargo begins to exit the Golgi near the midpoint of maturation, significantly before exit of a secretory cargo. Second, how are cargoes delivered from PVE compartments to the vacuole? To address this question, we tracked biosynthetic and endocytic cargoes after they had accumulated in PVE compartments. The results suggest that stable PVE compartments repeatedly deliver material to the vacuole by a kiss-and-run mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>vacuole</kwd><kwd>carboxypeptidase Y</kwd><kwd>endosomes</kwd><kwd>Golgi</kwd><kwd>membrane traffic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM104010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glick</surname><given-names>Benjamin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casler</surname><given-names>Jason C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA014599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glick</surname><given-names>Benjamin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In yeast, a fluorescent vacuolar cargo departs from Golgi cisternae early in the TGN stage of maturation, and traffic from prevacuolar endosomes to the vacuole apparently involves a kiss-and-run mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Budding yeast has been instrumental for defining mechanisms of membrane traffic. Genetic screens of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have identified many conserved components of the biosynthetic and endocytic machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaiser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Novick et al., 1980</xref>). In addition, 4D (time-lapse 3D) fluorescence microscopy of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has been powerful for characterizing membrane traffic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Day et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kurokawa et al., 2013</xref>). Unlike most eukaryotes, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has a non-stacked Golgi in which individual cisternae are optically resolvable by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Preuss et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wooding and Pelham, 1998</xref>). This property enabled the first direct visualization of Golgi cisternal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</xref>) as well as later studies of how maturation is regulated by GTPases and vesicle coat proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ishii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Papanikou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rivera-Molina and Novick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Suda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thomas and Fromme, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Observations of the yeast Golgi can be synthesized in the following scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pantazopoulou and Glick, 2019</xref>). New Golgi cisternae arise at ER exit sites and capture biosynthetic cargoes from the ER. These cisternae then mature by recycling resident Golgi proteins to the ER and to younger cisternae. During the early stage of maturation, one set of resident Golgi membrane proteins recycles with the aid of the COPI vesicle coat, whereas during the late stage of maturation, another set of resident Golgi membrane proteins recycles with the aid of the AP-1 clathrin adaptor. Biosynthetic cargoes are present in the cisternae throughout the maturation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kurokawa et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, the terminally mature Golgi cisternae fragment into secretory vesicles.</p><p>Recently, we expanded this analysis by examining the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> endocytic pathway. Our work was based on earlier studies of prevacuolar endosome (PVE) compartments, which are multivesicular bodies reminiscent of mammalian late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma and Burd, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pelham, 2002</xref>). The evidence indicates that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has a minimal endomembrane system in which the late Golgi, also known as the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN), plays an additional role as an early and recycling endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Day et al., 2018</xref>). According to this view, yeast cells have two types of endosomes: (a) the late Golgi/TGN, and (b) PVE compartments that are typically attached to the vacuole.</p><p>4D microscopy can integrate these pictures of the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways by enhancing our understanding of cargo delivery to the vacuole. Such experiments require a way to visualize the transport of a biosynthetic vacuolar cargo in live yeast cells. To this end, we built on our recent engineering of a regulatable fluorescent secretory cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casler and Glick, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>). A tetrameric red fluorescent protein is fused to an improved dimerizing variant of the FK506-binding protein FKBP, and this construct is targeted to the ER lumen to generate aggregates, which are then solubilized with a ligand to create a fluorescent cargo wave that passes through the Golgi. We have now modified this construct by appending a tetrapeptide vacuolar targeting signal from the precursor to carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Valls et al., 1990</xref>). This targeting signal is recognized in the Golgi by the Vps10 cargo receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marcusson et al., 1994</xref>), which in turn is packaged, with the aid of the GGA adaptors Gga1 and Gga2, into clathrin-coated vesicles destined for PVE compartments (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers and Payne, 2013</xref>). The result is that we have a regulatable fluorescent biosynthetic vacuolar cargo, which can be tracked as it moves from the ER through the Golgi to PVE compartments and then to the vacuole.</p><p>Our data extend prior results from other methods, which revealed the existence of traffic pathways for both biosynthetic and endocytic vacuolar cargoes. Biosynthetic vacuolar cargoes initially move from the ER to the Golgi. Some vacuolar membrane proteins traffic directly from the Golgi to the vacuole with the aid of the Golgi-associated AP-3 adaptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cowles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Llinares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Odorizzi et al., 1998</xref>). By contrast, CPY and certain other vacuolar hydrolases first traffic from the Golgi to PVE compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conibear and Stevens, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vida et al., 1993</xref>). The same PVE compartments also contain endocytosed cargoes, such as the methionine permease Mup1, that are in transit to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Menant et al., 2006</xref>). Within PVE compartments, transmembrane cargo proteins such as Mup1 are packaged into intraluminal vesicles that are transferred from the PVE compartments to the vacuole, where the intraluminal vesicles are degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">MacDonald et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these insights, the understanding of vacuolar protein sorting remains incomplete. We have focused on two questions.</p><p>First, how is traffic from the Golgi to PVE compartments coordinated with cisternal maturation? The conventional view is that biosynthetic cargoes all travel together through the Golgi until reaching a terminal sorting stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Matteis and Luini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffiths and Simons, 1986</xref>), implying that vacuolar cargoes would remain in a cisterna throughout the maturation process. However, this idea is called into question by studies of GGA dynamics at the Golgi. We have now replicated work from the Payne lab showing that GGAs arrive earlier than AP-1 and at about the same time as Sec7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daboussi et al., 2012</xref>), an Arf guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is recruited and activated during the early-to-late Golgi transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>). In addition, as described below, we have now tracked the passage of a fluorescent biosynthetic vacuolar cargo through the Golgi. The results indicate that the vacuolar cargo begins to depart when GGAs arrive, well before the final maturation of late Golgi cisternae into secretory vesicles. Thus, the late/TGN stage of Golgi maturation can be divided into a first sub-stage marked by the exit of vacuolar cargoes to PVE compartments, followed by a second sub-stage marked by AP-1-dependent intra-Golgi recycling and by the exit of secretory cargoes to the plasma membrane.</p><p>Second, how is material transferred from PVE compartments to the vacuole? Again, the answer was thought to be known, but 4D microscopy offers a new perspective. By analogy to mammalian cells, it was assumed that in yeast, early endosomes would mature into PVE compartments that would be consumed by fusing with the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feyder et al., 2015</xref>). Yet maturation of PVE compartments has not been observed—and indeed, if we are correct that yeast cells lack distinct early endosomes, then maturation of yeast endosomes is logically precluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Day et al., 2018</xref>). The implication is that PVE compartments are not continually regenerated and must therefore be stable organelles. In support of this concept, our previous live-cell imaging revealed that PVE compartments undergo fission and homotypic fusion but otherwise persist indefinitely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Day et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence presented here suggests that stable PVE compartments deliver their contents to the vacuole by transient kiss-and-run fusion events.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Addition of a tetrapeptide generates a fluorescent biosynthetic vacuolar cargo</title><p>To create a wave of fluorescent vacuolar cargo, we modified a recently developed regulatable fluorescent secretory cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casler and Glick, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>). Our secretory cargo consists of the tetrameric red fluorescent protein DsRed-Express2 fused to a dimerizing variant of FKBP, with a cleavable N-terminal signal sequence to direct cotranslational translocation into the ER. The signal sequence is followed by a tripeptide ER export signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yin et al., 2018</xref>) and a signal for <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This fusion protein forms fluorescent aggregates within the ER lumen, and the aggregates can be dissolved by adding a synthetic ligand of FKBP (SLF) that blocks dimerization of FKBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Soluble tetramers then exit the ER in a nearly synchronized wave. Efficient dissolution of the aggregates requires a drug-sensitive yeast strain. Thus, all of our experiments with the regulatable cargoes employed yeast strains containing deletions of the transcription factors Pdr1 and Pdr3, which mediate pleiotropic drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coorey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schüller et al., 2007</xref>). We found previously that the regulatable secretory cargo persists in cisternae through the early-to-late transition of Golgi maturation, and that a fraction of the cargo molecules are recycled within the Golgi in an AP-1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>). The goal was to perform similar experiments with a modified cargo that was targeted to the vacuole.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A regulatable vacuolar cargo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) General strategy for the use of reversibly aggregating fluorescent cargoes.

An obvious candidate for this signal was the propeptide of the vacuolar hydrolase CPY. Prior studies showed that within the propeptide, the tetrapeptide QRPL is necessary and sufficient to direct CPY from the Golgi to PVE compartments by means of the sorting receptor Vps10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marcusson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Valls et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Valls et al., 1990</xref>). We flanked QRPL with glycine/serine spacers by appending at the C-terminus of the fusion protein the peptide GSQRPLGGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The C-terminus was chosen because insertion of QRPL near the N-terminus of the mature protein prevented robust ER aggregation (data not shown). Addition of the QRPL-containing peptide at the C-terminus preserved the formation of aggregates within the lumen of the ER, which was marked by GFP-tagged Erg11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Some cargo molecules were already present in the vacuole prior to dissolution of the aggregates (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), presumably because signal-dependent ER exit allowed a fraction of the cargo molecules to escape from the ER and reach the vacuole while others became trapped in ER-localized aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these observations, the QRPL-containing construct was a candidate for a regulatable fluorescent vacuolar cargo.</p><p>To test if the QRPL signal worked as intended, we tested non-aggregating (and therefore non-regulatable) versions of the secretory and vacuolar cargoes. The vacuolar membrane was visualized with Vph1-GFP. Compared to the non-aggregating secretory cargo, which accumulated at low levels in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>), the non-aggregating vacuolar cargo accumulated at high levels in the vacuole in a Vps10-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). A final control experiment employed the regulatable versions of the cargoes once again. At 30 min after addition of SLF, the regulatable secretory cargo was detected in the culture medium whereas the regulatable vacuolar cargo was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results confirm that the vacuolar cargo traffics efficiently to the vacuole. For convenience, from now on we will refer to the regulatable fluorescent secretory cargo and the regulatable fluorescent vacuolar cargo as the secretory and vacuolar cargoes, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Traffic of the vacuolar cargo can be visualized</title><p>We first measured the overall rate of cargo traffic from the ER to the vacuole.

We addressed this issue by repeating the experiment after pre-treating the cells with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. Following SLF addition, untreated and cycloheximide-treated cells showed similar traffic kinetics, with cycloheximide causing only a modest reduction in the amount of cargo accumulating in the vacuole even though cell growth was arrested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that to a close approximation, the kinetics observed in the absence of cycloheximide reflect traffic of the vacuolar cargo molecules that were originally in ER-localized aggregates.</p><p>Why is traffic to the vacuole so slow? For comparison, secretory cargo molecules can travel from the ER to the plasma membrane within 5–10 min, and nearly all of them are secreted within 20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losev et al., 2006</xref>).

For three-color 4D movies, the red fluorescent vacuolar cargo was visualized together with the early Golgi marker GFP-Vrg4 and the late Golgi marker Sec7-HaloTag, or together with the PVE marker Vps8-GFP and the vacuole marker Vph1-HaloTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arlt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Day et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losev et al., 2006</xref>).

After the cargo aggregates were solubilized with SLF, a strain expressing the vacuolar cargo plus the Golgi markers was imaged every 30 s for 29.5 min, and a strain expressing the vacuolar cargo plus the PVE and vacuole markers was imaged every 60 s for 60 min. The results showed cargo accumulation within Golgi compartments 1–5 min after SLF addition, followed by nearly complete transfer of the cargo to PVE compartments by 10 min (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>).

It was previously reported that yeast GGAs function upstream of AP-1 and that GGAs display similar kinetics of arrival and departure as the late Golgi reference marker Sec7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daboussi et al., 2012</xref>). However, a somewhat different conclusion was presented in a more recent study, which reported that GGAs arrived at Golgi cisternae significantly later than Sec7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). To clarify the functions of these adaptors in sorting the vacuolar cargo, we combined a kinetic analysis of AP-1 and GGA dynamics with tests of deletion mutants.</p><p>If a given adaptor is involved in transporting the vacuolar cargo out of the Golgi, then arrival of that adaptor is expected to coincide with initiation of cargo departure. In a kinetic analysis, we first compared Sec7 with the AP-1 subunit Apl2 and with the major GGA isoform Gga2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers and Payne, 2013</xref>). Three-color imaging was performed with Apl2-GFP, Gga2-HaloTag, and Sec7-mScarlet. Gga2 consistently showed arrival and departure kinetics nearly identical to those of Sec7, whereas Apl2 consistently arrived ~20–40 s later and departed ~10–15 s later than Gga2 and Sec7 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Thus, GGAs arrive at the Golgi at about the same time that the vacuolar cargo begins to depart. Indeed, when the vacuolar cargo was visualized in maturing cisternae together with the early Golgi marker GFP-Vrg4 and with Gga2-HaloTag, the first appearance of Gga2 occurred at about the same time that the vacuolar cargo signal started to decline (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5—video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the cargo signal sometimes began to drop a short time before Gga2 was visible at the Golgi. A potential explanation is that when GGAs are first recruited, they are immediately packaged into vesicles that transport vacuolar cargoes from the Golgi, so the pool of Golgi-associated Gga2 initially remains low. Regardless of whether this interpretation is correct, GGA arrival kinetics closely match the departure kinetics of the vacuolar cargo, whereas AP-1 arrival kinetics do not.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Kinetics of GGA arrival at the Golgi.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Visualizing the dynamics of the GGA and AP-1 adaptors during cisternal maturation.

Apm3 serves as an additional control because it is a subunit of the AP-3 adaptor complex, which functions in a parallel pathway that targets certain membrane proteins directly from the Golgi to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers and Payne, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Odorizzi et al., 1998</xref>).

Such pores would allow the passage of soluble cargoes as well as intraluminal vesicles that carry membrane-bound cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Henne et al., 2011</xref>). This type of partial fusion mechanism could explain why the movement of cargoes from PVE compartments to the vacuole is relatively slow.</p><p>To test this concept, we developed an assay in which a pool of labeled cargo molecules in a PVE compartment can be tracked during passage to the vacuole. This approach had two technical hurdles: (1) prior to imaging, a fraction of the fluorescent cargo molecules are in the vacuole or other non-PVE compartments, and (2) a typical cell contains several PVE compartments that can undergo fission and homotypic fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Day et al., 2018</xref>), making it difficult to follow individual organelles. The problem with background fluorescence was addressed by photobleaching cargo molecules outside the PVE compartments. Bleaching occurred in the interior of the vacuole and in the portion of the cell outside the vacuole, leaving a ring of non-bleached fluorescence that included vacuole-associated PVE compartments. The problem of tracking multiple PVE compartments was addressed by focusing on cells that happened to contain just one or two punctate PVE structures.</p><p>Traffic of the biosynthetic vacuolar cargo from PVE compartments to the vacuole was visualized by generating a yeast strain expressing the vacuolar cargo together with the PVE marker Vps8-GFP and the vacuole marker Vph1-HaloTag. At 10–15 min after SLF addition, the majority of the cargo molecules had passed through the Golgi and accumulated in PVE compartments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> above). 4D confocal imaging was then performed after photobleaching the signal outside the PVE compartments. As previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Day et al., 2018</xref>), the Vps8-GFP-labeled PVE compartments were persistent structures. Meanwhile, cargo fluorescence moved from PVE compartments to the vacuole. This process was examined by capturing 10 min movies. Some PVE compartments were quiescent for cargo delivery as described above, so the analysis focused on PVE compartments that were active throughout the imaging period. During the majority of a typical time course, the fluorescence in a PVE compartment gradually declined, and this decrease was matched by a gradual increase of fluorescence in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Occasionally, a discrete event rapidly transferred a substantial fraction of the cargo fluorescence to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">Figure 7—video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Although the Vps8-GFP signal varied, and sometimes dropped after a discrete event, the punctate PVE compartments marked with Vps8-GFP were never seen to disappear. Our interpretation is that the vacuolar cargo moves from long-lived PVE compartments to the vacuole by a series of kiss-and-run events that are frequently small and sometimes large.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Visualizing transfer of the vacuolar cargo from PVE compartments to the vacuole.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gradual movement of the vacuolar cargo from a PVE compartment to the vacuole.

In the absence of methionine in the culture medium, Mup1 resides in the plasma membrane, and upon addition of methionine, Mup1 is ubiquitinated, internalized, and sent to the vacuole for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2008</xref>).

Recently, we engineered a regulatable fluorescent secretory cargo that can be visualized during yeast Golgi maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casler and Glick, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>). This secretory cargo is present in Golgi cisternae throughout the maturation process, and a fraction of the cargo molecules recycle from older to younger cisternae by an AP-1-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>). As an extension of that work, we have now generated a regulatable fluorescent vacuolar cargo that can be tracked in yeast cells. This vacuolar cargo follows the well characterized pathway by which CPY travels from the Golgi to PVE compartments, with the aid of Vps10 and GGAs, before reaching the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowers and Stevens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hecht et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The convenience of working with an artificial vacuolar cargo is accompanied by some caveats. Compared to CPY, which is monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Endrizzi et al., 1994</xref>), our vacuolar cargo is a tetramer and thus contains four copies of the Vps10 recognition signal. Moreover, Vps10 has a quality control domain that recognizes the fluorescent protein component of the cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fitzgerald and Glick, 2014</xref>), so there are multiple points of interaction between Vps10 and the artificial vacuolar cargo. A consequence is that our vacuolar cargo might dissociate from Vps10 more slowly than CPY dissociates, leading to slower PVE-to-vacuole delivery. However, this possible effect on traffic kinetics should not compromise interpretations about the pathway of cargo transport from the Golgi to the vacuole.</p><p>Using the vacuolar cargo, we asked a basic question: at what point during cisternal maturation does the vacuolar cargo depart from the Golgi? Unlike the regulatable fluorescent secretory cargo, which persists in Golgi cisternae until they are terminally mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>), the vacuolar cargo begins to depart during the early-to-late Golgi transition. Departure of the vacuolar cargo begins at about the same time that GGAs arrive at the Golgi, and well before AP-1 arrives. Moreover, departure of the vacuolar cargo is abolished by deleting the GGAs but is unaffected by deleting AP-1. These results fit with previously published data indicating that the CPY pathway from the Golgi to the PVE involves GGAs but not AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dell'Angelica et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hirst et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hirst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhdankina et al., 2001</xref>). The new insight is that departure of the vacuolar cargo from the Golgi begins relatively early, about halfway through the time course of cisternal maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for sorting of biosynthetic cargoes in the late Golgi.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequential formation of GGA vesicles and AP-1 vesicles in yeast cells. The thick arrows represent progressive maturation of a Golgi cisterna over time. During the early-to-late Golgi transition of cisternal maturation, GGA adaptors arrive, and GGA vesicles that carry vacuolar cargoes (white squares) begin to form. Subsequently, the AP-1 adaptor arrives, and AP-1 vesicles that recycle resident Golgi proteins (not shown) as well as some secretory cargoes (black dots) begin to form. GGAs depart before AP-1 departs, but the formation phases for GGA vesicles and AP-1 vesicles overlap. (<bold>B</bold>) Comparison of Golgi structures in yeast and mammalian cells. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the late Golgi or TGN stage accounts for about half of the maturation process, so the sequential arrival times and activities of GGAs and AP-1 are easy to detect. In mammalian cells, Golgi cisternae are stacked, with the youngest early Golgi cisterna at the opposite side of a stack from the oldest late Golgi/TGN cisterna. Only the <italic>trans</italic>-most cisterna of a mammalian Golgi stack functions as late Golgi/TGN, but during the lifetime of this cisterna, GGAs and AP-1 may arrive and act sequentially as in yeast.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56844-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Superficially, these results are at odds with the established view that various types of biosynthetic cargoes travel through the entire Golgi until being packaged into distinct carriers at the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Matteis and Luini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffiths and Simons, 1986</xref>). While there is evidence that biosynthetic cargoes begin to segregate early in the mammalian Golgi, all of those cargoes are thought to reach the terminal TGN compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). But we suggest that there is actually no discrepancy between the yeast and mammalian data. In a typical cultured mammalian cell, the early Golgi consists of about six cisternae whereas the clathrin-labeled TGN is a single cisterna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ladinsky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mogelsvang et al., 2004</xref>). In yeast, the ratio is different because the clathrin-labeled late Golgi/TGN stage occupies about half of the maturation time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In both cell types, GGA-dependent transport occurs during the TGN stage, but the yeast system has allowed us to define a first TGN sub-stage marked by GGA activity followed by a second TGN sub-stage marked by AP-1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Mammalian TGN structures probably undergo a similar kinetic evolution because the interactions of clathrin adaptors at the mammalian TGN resemble those at the yeast TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daboussi et al., 2017</xref>). A proposed unified view is that during traffic to either yeast PVE compartments or mammalian late endosomes, GGA-dependent export from the TGN begins prior to secretory vesicle formation and AP-1-dependent intra-Golgi recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pantazopoulou and Glick, 2019</xref>).</p><p>After the vacuolar cargo reaches PVE compartments, how does it move to the vacuole? Previously, based on evidence that PVE compartments are long-lived organelles that rarely if ever fuse completely with the vacuole, we proposed that transfer of material from PVE compartments to the vacuole might involve kiss-and-run fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Day et al., 2018</xref>). This model seemed plausible because mammalian cells can employ kiss-and-run fusion to exchange material between lysosomes and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bright et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bright et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saffi and Botelho, 2019</xref>). Here, we have tested the kiss-and-run hypothesis by fluorescence microscopy. A photobleaching protocol generated a cell in which we could image a single PVE compartment containing fluorescent vacuolar cargo molecules, and the fate of that cohort of molecules was tracked over time. We observed gradual transfer of the cargo molecules to the vacuole over tens of minutes, punctuated by occasional larger events involving sudden transfer of a significant fraction of the cargo molecules. The PVE compartments persisted after cargo transfer. Similar results were seen when PVE compartments were loaded with fluorescently tagged molecules of the methionine permease Mup1, which is internalized for degradation after methionine is added to the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Menant et al., 2006</xref>). Mup1 is packaged into intraluminal vesicles within PVE compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2008</xref>), so kiss-and-run fusion pores would need to be large enough to transfer intraluminal vesicles. The observed fluctuations in the rate of cargo delivery from PVE compartments to the vacuole suggest that kiss-and-run fusion events vary in size and duration.</p><p>Our inference about the kiss-and-run mechanism is based on fluorescence microscopy and will benefit from validation by other techniques. Notably, an electron tomographic reconstruction carried out by the Odorizzi group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McNatt et al., 2007</xref>), reprinted here as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, shows tubular membrane connections between PVE compartments and the vacuole. Our results suggest that such tubular connections should be common, so their prevalence could be quantified in future morphological studies. A separate electron tomographic analysis highlighted a possible complication—PVE compartments were sometimes observed to form clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adell et al., 2017</xref>). If a single PVE compartment in a cluster fused completely with the vacuole, the fluorescence from the remaining PVE compartments in the cluster would persist, yielding a false impression of kiss-and-run fusion. Although we cannot rule out this scenario, it seems unlikely, because some PVE compartments are presumably solitary and yet we have never seen one disappear by fusing completely with the vacuole. The kiss-and-run hypothesis could be revisited if new methods make it possible either to prevent clustering of PVE compartments or to identify solitary PVE compartments by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>If kiss-and-run transfer occurs between PVE compartments and the vacuole, the transient continuities between these organelles might permit exchange of freely diffusing transmembrane proteins. For example, the transmembrane precursor to the vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase S is normally internalized into intraluminal vesicles of PVE compartments, but a mutant carboxypeptidase S precursor that cannot be internalized moves from the limiting membranes of PVE compartments to the vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katzmann et al., 2001</xref>). Although other transmembrane proteins such as Vps10 and the SNARE protein Pep12 normally reside in PVE compartments and not in the vacuole membrane, overexpressed Vps10 and Pep12 do reach the vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black and Pelham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cereghino et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chi et al., 2014</xref>). It seems plausible that during transient fusions of PVE compartments with the vacuole, saturable interactions with the trafficking machinery retain proteins such as Vps10 and Pep12 in the PVE compartments. Hence, the kiss-and-run model can explain how some transmembrane PVE proteins reach the vacuole while others do not, whereas this phenomenon would be hard to understand if PVE compartments fused completely with the vacuole.</p><p>Cargo transfer from PVE compartments to the vacuole is slow relative to other membrane traffic steps in budding yeast. Historically, kinetics of traffic to the vacuole have been measured by pulse-chase experiments that rely on the maturation of CPY by vacuolar proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stevens et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vida et al., 1993</xref>), but those results may be misleading because kiss-and-run fusion could result in some vacuolar proteases being present and active in PVE compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bright et al., 2016</xref>). As judged by fluorescence microscopy, PVE-to-vacuole transfer often requires 30 min or more to reach completion. By comparison, transit from the ER to the PVE along the biosynthetic pathway or from the plasma membrane to the PVE along the endocytic pathway is largely complete within 10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Day et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Losev et al., 2006</xref>). A possible reason for PVE-to-vacuole traffic being rate-limiting is that the cell has the option to ‘change its mind’ by recycling membrane proteins from the PVE instead of degrading them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma and Burd, 2020</xref>). Meanwhile, the AP-3-driven pathway of direct Golgi-to-vacuole traffic offers an alternative for rapid delivery of membrane proteins to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Odorizzi et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Hygromycin</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>Cat. #: <break/>10687010</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>G418</td><td>Teknova</td><td>Cat. #: <break/>G5001</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Nourseothricin</td><td>Neta Scientific</td><td>Cat. #: <break/>RPI-N51200-1.0</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>JF<sub>646</sub> HaloTag Ligand</td><td>Dr. Luke Lavis <break/>(Janelia Research Campus) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grimm et al., 2015</xref></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>SLF</td><td>Cayman Chemical</td><td>Cat. #: <break/>10007974–5</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Cycloheximide</td><td>Neta Scientific</td><td>Cat. #: <break/>RPI-C81040-1.0</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Concanavalin A</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat. #: <break/>C2010-250MG</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-FKBP12 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat. #: ab2918</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit <break/>(goat polyclonal)</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>Cat. #: <break/>A21245</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Graphpad Prism</td><td>Insightful Science <break/>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com">https://www.graphpad.com</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SnapGene</td><td>Insightful Science <break/>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.snapgene.com">https://www.snapgene.com</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015052">SCR_015052</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast growth and strain construction</title><p>The parental haploid strain was JK9-3da (<italic>leu2-3,112 ura3-52 rme1 trp1 his4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kunz et al., 1993</xref>).

an earlier Golgi compartment than previously thought, and secondly, that transfer of vacuolar cargo from the pre-vacuolar endosome to the vacuole is gradual and does not 'consume' the endosome. The results suggest that cargo transfer between the pre-vacuolar endosome and the vacuole occurs via a 'kiss and run' mechanism.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A microscopy-based kinetic analysis of yeast vacuolar protein sorting&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Christopher G Burd as the Reviewing Editor and reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David Teis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found your manuscript to clearly present a well-executed study of biosynthetic and endocytic protein trafficking to the yeast vacuole. Regarding the two major conclusions of the manuscript, all three reviewers considered the finding that a fluorescent vacuolar enzyme reporter is exported from the Golgi at the early-to-late cisterna transition interesting and well supported by the analyses. The reviewers found the analysis of content transfer between the pre-vacuolar endosome and the vacuole interesting and potentially important. However, each reviewer considered the conclusion that content is transferred by a kiss and run fusion mechanism to be poorly supported. Their consensus opinion is that substantial additional experimentation is necessary to rigorously prove this point. The core points that the reviewers suggest need to be addressed are the following.</p><p>1) The use of Vps8 as an accurate marker of the PVE needs to be more firmly established. It is a component of the CORVET complex that tethers clusters of late endosomes with Vps21, hence, it is a reasonable possibility that individual late endosomes from the cluster fuse with the vacuole. The reviewers also point several concerns with tagged/inappropriately expressed Vps8 that need to be addressed.</p><p>2) An ultra-structural analysis of the PVE and vacuole is required to clarify the nature of the tethered PVE (single vs. multiple compartments) and to define the structural relationship between the PVE and vacuole (fused?). The single reprinted micrograph showing MVBs apparently fused to the vacuole membrane via a stalk underscores the importance of the approach, which seems suitable for rigorously characterizing the PVE-vacuole junctions.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to the research community, the reviewers considered the strength of the study as it currently stands. From this perspective, the reviewers agreed that the results presented in the study would provide a substantial and healthy advance to the field if the following considerations were addressed by additional analysis of data already in hand and modifications to the presentation, as follows:</p><p>1) The presentation of transfer by kiss and run fusion should be consistent throughout the manuscript. For example, the Abstract states that the data &quot;imply&quot; kiss and run. The last sentence of the Introduction states that transfer during kiss and run fusion has been &quot;demonstrate(d)&quot;. The reviewers agree that the results can be explained by a kiss and run fusion mechanism, as indicated in the Abstract, but not that cargo transfer via kiss and run fusion has been demonstrated. The text should accurately and consistently indicate that kiss and run fusion remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>2) In Figures 7B/C and 8B/C, the two distinct types of PVE-to-vacuole transfer events (slow/gradual versus rapid) should be quantified so that it can be determined which occurrence, if either, is most prevalent.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>An ultra-structural analysis of the PVE and vacuole is required to clarify the nature of the tethered PVE (single vs. multiple compartments) and to define the spatial relationship between the PVE and vacuole.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56844.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found your manuscript to clearly present a well-executed study of biosynthetic and endocytic protein trafficking to the yeast vacuole.

We have enhanced the text to allay this concern. In our previous work (Day et al., 2018), we showed that Vps8GFP colocalizes with a variety of other PVE markers, and that PVE compartments showed similar dynamics when labeled with Vps8-GFP or with other PVE markers. There was no hint that any PVE compartments might fail to label with Vps8.</p><p>The use of Vps8-GFP as a PVE marker is based on a paper from the Ungermann lab (Arlt et al., 2015), who have studied Vps8 and related topics extensively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) An ultra-structural analysis of the PVE and vacuole is required to clarify the nature of the tethered PVE (single vs. multiple compartments) and to define the structural relationship between the PVE and vacuole (fused?).

An ideal experiment would reveal ultrastructural data of the same PVE compartments before and after bursts of cargo transfer to the vacuole, but such an experiment is not feasible. We are more optimistic about the prospect of distinguishing single from clustered PVE compartments by fluorescence microscopy, perhaps with some form of super-resolution imaging. However, such a method remains to be developed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
