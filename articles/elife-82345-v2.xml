target (phospho)tyrosine residue. Although the preferred recognition motifs of many kinases and SH2 domains are known, we lack a quantitative description of sequence specificity that could guide predictions about signaling pathways or be used to design sequences for biomedical applications. Here, we present a platform that combines genetically encoded peptide libraries and deep sequencing to profile sequence recognition by tyrosine kinases and SH2 domains. We screened several tyrosine kinases against a million-peptide random library and used the resulting profiles to design high-activity sequences. We also screened several kinases against a library containing thousands of human proteome-derived peptides and their naturally-occurring variants. These screens recapitulated independently measured phosphorylation rates and revealed hundreds of phosphosite-proximal mutations that impact phosphosite recognition by tyrosine kinases. We extended this platform to the analysis of SH2 domains and showed that screens could predict relative binding affinities. Finally, we expanded our method to assess the impact of non-canonical and post-translationally modified amino acids on sequence recognition. This specificity profiling platform will shed new light on phosphotyrosine signaling and could readily be adapted to other protein modification/recognition domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sequence specificity</kwd><kwd>phosphotyrosine</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd><kwd>variant effects</kwd><kwd>deep sequencing</kwd><kwd>amber suppression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM138014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Neel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFS 31-18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Neel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A high-throughput method to profile tyrosine kinases and phosphotyrosine recognition domains reveals new rules for sequence specificity and maps the effects of mutations on the recognition of tyrosine phosphorylation sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells respond to external stimuli by activating a finely-tuned cascade of enzymatic reactions and protein-protein interactions. This signal transduction is governed, in large part, by post-translational modifications that alter protein activity, stability, and localization, as well as the formation of higher-order macromolecular complexes. Despite its low abundance relative to serine and threonine phosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation is an essential post-translational modification in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lim and Pawson, 2010</xref>). Tyrosine kinases, the enzymes that phosphorylate tyrosine residues on proteins, and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, protein modules that bind tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences, must have the ability to discriminate among a myriad of potential phosphorylation sites (phosphosites) in the proteome, in order to ensure proper signal transduction. The preferential engagement of specific phosphosites by tyrosine kinases and SH2 domains is dependent on the amino acid sequence surrounding the tyrosine or phosphotyrosine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Songyang et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Isolated tyrosine kinase domains most efficiently engage phosphosites that conform to specific sequence motifs, which are defined by a small number of key residues that contribute significantly to recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>). These motifs suggest a mechanism by which a specific set of phosphosites in a proteome is selectively engaged by an individual kinase, based on the presence of favorable sequence features around that site. Negative selection of specific sequence features can also play a role in kinase specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2011</xref>). For example, the T cell tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 cannot readily phosphorylate co-localized proteins that contain even a modest positive charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shah et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Phosphosite sequence recognition by kinase domains is just one mechanism of substrate selection for tyrosine kinases, and other interactions are necessary to achieve efficient substrate targeting <italic>in vivo</italic>. Binding domains, such as SH2 domains, can strongly influence specificity by localizing kinases to the vicinity of phosphorylation targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pawson and Nash, 2000</xref>). Secondary interactions between SH2 and kinase domains can also refine the substrate preferences of a tyrosine kinase by stabilizing its active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Filippakopoulos et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, for signaling systems that involve a tyrosine kinase domain and a tethered SH2 domain, the sequence specificities of both domains contribute to the intricate control of phosphotyrosine signaling responses.</p><p>Many methods have been developed to characterize sequence recognition by tyrosine kinases and SH2 domains. The most prominent approach employs purified kinases/SH2 domains and oriented peptide libraries, which are synthetic, degenerate peptide libraries with a central tyrosine or phosphotyrosine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Songyang et al., 1993</xref>). Several variations on this technique have been reported to improve the throughput and quantification of sequence preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hutti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mok et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, this method is also applicable to serine/threonine kinases, and large swaths of the yeast and human kinomes have been characterized using oriented peptide libraries, providing significant insights into kinase-substrate recognition and phospho-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mok et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>). Oriented peptide library screens have primarily been useful for determining the preference for each amino acid at a given position, independent of sequence context, but evidence suggests that some amino acid preferences may depend on the surrounding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantor et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several groups have developed strategies to compare the phosphorylation of specific sequences, rather than obtain position-averaged amino acid preferences from pooled degenerate libraries. Strategies include âone-bead-one-peptideâ combinatorial libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Imhof et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sweeney et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trinh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wavreille et al., 2007</xref>) and protein/peptide microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amanchy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koytiger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mok et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schutkowski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Uttamchandani et al., 2003</xref>). One-bead-one-peptide methods often require manual isolation and individual sequencing of positive (phosphorylated or SH2-bound) beads, making the method technically challenging. Microarrays offer the capacity to analyze thousands of discrete sequences and require small quantities of proteins, but their use can be limited by the high cost of reagents. As an alternative, several groups have conducted mass spectrometry proteomics on heterologously expressed purified peptide libraries, kinase-treated cell extracts, and cells over-expressing a kinase of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corwin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Douglass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Finneran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Imamura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kettenbach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lubner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sugiyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xue et al., 2012</xref>). This strategy has enabled the identification of potential substrates and can also be used to infer position-specific amino acid preferences. Studies using intact proteomes have the added benefit that the kinase of interest is operating on intact proteins, rather than isolated peptides, but interpretation of the results can be convoluted by the presence of endogenous kinases.</p><p>Molecular display techniques, such as mRNA, phage, yeast, and bacterial display, have also been used for specificity profiling. Early investigations employed phage or mRNA display to profile tyrosine kinase and SH2 specificity. These methods were relatively low-throughput, as they relied on Sanger sequencing of individual clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cujec et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dente et al., 1997</xref>). The advent of deep sequencing technologies has transformed this style of specificity profiling, by enabling rapid, quantitative analysis of library composition without requiring the sequencing of individual clones. This was demonstrated recently in a series of studies that employed bacterial/yeast peptide display, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and deep sequencing to profile tyrosine kinase and SH2 domain specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Taft et al., 2019</xref>). A key facet of these investigations was the facile generation of peptide libraries tailored to specific mechanistic questions: these included scanning mutagenesis libraries derived from individual substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shah et al., 2016</xref>), as well as diverse peptide libraries encoding known phosphosites in the human proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shah et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we describe a high-throughput platform to profile the recognition of large peptide libraries by any tyrosine kinase or SH2 domain. Our approach uses biotinylated bait proteins (pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies or SH2 domains) and avidin-functionalized magnetic beads to isolate tyrosine kinase-phosphorylated bacterial cells, and is coupled to deep sequencing for a quantitative readout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The use of magnetic bead-based separation, rather than FACS, permits simultaneous, benchtop processing of multiple samples and enables the analysis of larger libraries for less time and cost. Libraries can be custom-made for specific readouts: mutational scanning for structure-activity relationships, libraries derived from natural proteomes to answer specific signaling questions, or degenerate libraries for the generation of predictive models.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High-throughput profiling of tyrosine kinase substrate specificity using bacterial peptide display.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the workflow for kinase specificity profiling.

The first library contains 10<sup>6</sup>â107 random 11-residue sequences with a central tyrosine (referred to as the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library). Screens with the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library recapitulate previously reported specificity motifs and can be used to generate highly efficient peptide substrates. The second library contains defined sequences spanning 3000 human tyrosine phosphorylation sites, along with 5000 variant sequences bearing disease-associated mutations and natural polymorphisms (referred to as the pTyr-Var library). Kinase and SH2 screens with the pTyr-Var library reveal hundreds of phosphosite-proximal mutations that significantly impact phosphosite recognition by individual protein domains. These datasets will be a valuable resource in the growing efforts to understand the functional impact of protein variants across the human population that may contribute to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stein et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, we show that our peptide display platform is compatible with Amber codon suppression, enabling analysis of how non-canonical or post-translationally modified amino acids impact sequence recognition. Overall, the method described in this report provides an accessible, high-throughput platform to study the specificity of phosphotyrosine signaling proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A bacterial display and deep sequencing platform to screen tyrosine kinases against large peptide libraries</title><p>We expanded upon a previously established screening platform that combines bacterial display of genetically encoded peptide libraries and deep sequencing to quantitatively compare phosphorylation efficiencies across a substrate library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shah et al., 2016</xref>). In the published approach, peptides are displayed on the surface of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells as fusions to an engineered bacterial surface-display protein, eCPX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rice and Daugherty, 2008</xref>), then phosphorylated by a purified kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henriques et al., 2013</xref>). Following this, the cells are labeled with a pan-phosphotyrosine antibody, and cells with high phosphorylation levels are separated by FACS. The DNA encoding the peptides is then amplified and analyzed by Illumina deep sequencing to determine the frequency of each peptide in the library before and after selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shah et al., 2016</xref>). In order to determine the phosphorylation efficiency of each peptide by a particular kinase, an enrichment score is determined by calculating the frequency of that peptide in the kinase-selected sample normalized to the frequency in the input sample.</p><p>While peptide libraries of virtually any composition can theoretically be screened using this approach, previous implementations focused on libraries containing less than 5000 peptides, due to the low throughput of FACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). In those experiments, the objective was to over-sample the library at the cell sorting step by a factor of 100â1000, to ensure that enrichment or depletion of every member of the library could be accurately quantified by deep sequencing. When multiple screens were conducted in parallel, the throughput of FACS limited experiments to small libraries (less than 5000 sequences). To improve the scalability and cost-effectiveness of this approach, we switched to a bead-based sorting method, using avidin-coated magnetic beads to enrich highly-phosphorylated cells, thus circumventing the need for FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). With this approach, the cells are instead labeled with biotinylated pan-phosphotyrosine antibodies and then sorted using magnetic beads. The use of magnetic beads permits simultaneous separation of multiple samples of virtually any size, enabling larger library analysis for less time and cost. Notably, these screens can be carried out in any laboratory, without the need for a fluorescence-activated cell sorter.</p><p>To test our upgraded screening platform, we generated a random library of 11-residue sequences with a central tyrosine (the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library, where X is any of the 20 canonical amino acids). The library was generated using a degenerate synthetic oligonucleotide with five NNS codons (N=A,T,G,C and S=G,C) before and after the central codon that encodes for tyrosine (TAT). The NNS triplet has the benefit of encoding all 20 amino acids, but it can still contain an Amber stop codon (TAG) roughly 3% of the time. Therefore, up to 30% of the peptide-coding sequences in the library are expected to have an Amber stop codon â a feature that we take advantage of later in this study. The degenerate oligonucleotide mixture was cloned into a plasmid in between the DNA encoding a signal sequence and the eCPX surface-display scaffold. In a previously reported version of this platform, the eCPX scaffold contained a C-terminal strep-tag to detect surface-display level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shah et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the potential background binding of the strep-tag with the avidin-coated magnetic beads during cell enrichment, we cloned both a strep-tagged and a myc-tagged version of the library. Deep sequencing of both versions of the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library confirmed that they have 1â10 million unique peptide sequences, 20% of which contain one or more stop codons. Furthermore, all 20 canonical amino acids were well-represented at each of the 10 variable positions surrounding the fixed tyrosine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, our library includes peptides containing Cys residues and non-central Tyr residues, both of which are often excluded from tyrosine kinase specificity screens to avoid oxidation-related artifacts and challenges in interpreting signal from multi-Tyr sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2014</xref>). These sequences can be filtered during data analysis, if needed, although they did not pose significant issues in our studies.</p><p>Using the myc-tagged X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library, we determined the position-specific amino acid preferences of the kinase domain of c-Src. Cells displaying the library were phosphorylated by c-Src to achieve roughly 20â30% phosphorylation, as determined by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The phosphorylated cells were labeled with a biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and enriched with magnetic beads, then peptide-coding DNA sequences were counted by deep sequencing. We visualized the sequence preferences of c-Src by generating a heatmap and sequence logo based on the position-specific enrichment scores of each amino acid residue surrounding the central tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Sequences containing a stop codon were not considered in these calculations, but the depletion of stop codons at each position was separately confirmed and is reported below the heatmap on the same color scale. The preferences determined from this screen matched the sequence specificity of c-Src defined by prior reports using oriented peptide libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>). We observed a strong preference for bulky aliphatic residues (Ile/Leu/Val) at the â1 position relative to the central tyrosine and a phenylalanine at the +3 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Our results showed modest differences from the specificity observed by oriented peptide libraries, including a strong preference for a+1 Asp/Glu/Ser in addition to the previously reported +1 Gly. To test whether these differences were due to biases introduced by the specific pan-phosphotyrosine antibody used, we obtained a different commercially available biotinylated pan-phosphotyrosine antibody and repeated the screen. The position-specific amino acid enrichments obtained using both antibodies were nearly identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests that there is no significant bias in the enrichment of peptides introduced by the pan-phosphotyrosine antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Degenerate library screens capture specificity profiles for diverse tyrosine kinases</title><p>We next used the degenerate X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library to characterize the sequence preferences of four additional tyrosine kinase domains, derived from the non-receptor tyrosine kinases c-Abl and Fer, and the receptor tyrosine kinases EPHB1 and EPHB2. The kinases were selected because they represent a few distinct branches of the tyrosine kinome and can be easily produced through bacterial expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanese et al., 2018</xref>). The X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library was screened against the kinases in triplicate, and the data from replicates were averaged to generate specificity profiles for each kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>). The amino acid preferences for c-Abl are well-characterized and were recapitulated in this screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Till et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Till et al., 1994</xref>). Like c-Src, c-Abl preferred bulky aliphatic residues at the â1 position with respect to the central tyrosine. Unlike c-Src, c-Abl preferred an alanine at the +1 position and had a notably strong preference for proline at the +3 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Fer showed a specificity pattern distinct from both c-Src and c-Abl, which included a preference for tryptophan residues at the +2,+3, and +4 positions. As expected, the closely related EPHB1 and EPHB2 kinases had similar specificities, which included a unique preference for Asn and Asp at the â1 residue that was not observed for the tested non-receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Specificity profiling of tyrosine kinases using the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmaps depicting the specificities of c-Abl, Fer, EPHB1, and EPHB2.

We wanted to assess whether our method could also be used to generate high-efficiency substrates, and whether these would differ from sequences identified using oriented peptide libraries. To test this, we combined the most favorable amino acids in each position flanking the central tyrosine residue in our specificity profiles, excluding tyrosine, to generate unique consensus peptide substrates for c-Src, c-Abl, Fer, EPHB1, and EPHB2. Consensus sequences for c-Src and c-Abl have been identified previously using oriented peptide libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>). These sequences, often referred to as SrcTide and AblTide, are different than our consensus sequences at a few residues surrounding the phospho-acceptor tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The SrcTide and AblTide peptides are canonically embedded within a conserved peptide scaffold containing N-terminal Gly and C-terminal (Lys)<sub>3</sub>-Gly flanks. For direct comparison, we embedded our consensus peptides in the same scaffold and conducted a series of kinetic studies.</p><p>First, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> continuous fluorimetric assay to compare the steady-state kinetic parameters (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) for our c-Src and c-Abl consensus peptides with the SrcTide and AblTide peptides. The Michaelis-Menten parameters for our Src Consensus peptide were on par with one of the previously reported SrcTide substrates (SrcTide 1995, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>), but the <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> value for a more recently reported SrcTide variant (SrcTide 2014, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2014</xref>) was substantially tighter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Our Src Consensus peptide had a higher maximal catalytic rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) but a lower apparent binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>) when compared to both SrcTides. We were surprised to see that our Src Consensus peptide had a+1 Asp residue, as opposed to the +1 Gly residue in both SrcTides. Substitution of the +1 Asp for a Gly in a related peptide marginally improved the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value but reduced <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

For the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (c-Src, c-Abl, and Fer), the corresponding consensus peptides were the best substrates tested. At a higher substrate concentration (100 Î¼M), c-Abl also efficiently phosphorylated the Src and EPHB2 consensus peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but selectivity for the Abl Consensus improved at a lower concentration (20 Î¼M), consistent with selectivity being driven by <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for this set of peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). By contrast, c-Src was selective for the Src Consensus peptide at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but showed significant off-target activity toward the Fer Consensus at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Both of these sequences contain a â1 Ile and +3 Pro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). These experiments demonstrate the applicability of our bacterial peptide display method to the design of high-activity substrates.

If so, this would be a potentially powerful tool for the identification of native substrates and the dissection of phosphotyrosine signaling pathways. Indeed, oriented peptide libraries have been applied extensively to predict the native substrates of protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Obenauer et al., 2003</xref>). We are particularly interested in using high-throughput specificity screens to predict how mutations proximal to phosphorylation sites affect tyrosine kinase selectivity. The PhosphoSitePlus database documents thousands of missense mutations within five residues of tyrosine phosphorylation sites, many of which are associated with human diseases or are human polymorphisms, but the functional consequences of most of these mutations are unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hornbeck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hornbeck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krassowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Landrum et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We used the c-Src X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> screening data to predict the relative phosphorylation rates of six peptide pairs, corresponding to reference and variant sequences derived from human phosphorylation sites.

Including these tyrosine mutants and additional control sequences, such as previously designed consensus substrates, the library totaled ~10,000 unique sequences. As with the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library, we generated two versions of this library, bearing a C-terminal strep-tag or myc-tag. We conducted specificity screens with the myc-tagged pTyr-Var library against 7 non-receptor tyrosine kinases (c-Src, Fyn, Hck, c-Abl, Fer, Jak2, and AncSZ, an engineered homolog of Syk and ZAP-70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hobbs et al., 2022</xref>) and 5 receptor tyrosine kinases (EPHB1, EPHB2, FGFR1, FGFR3, and MERTK).

For every kinase tested, the tyrosine-free sequences showed distinctly low enrichment scores, consistent with signal in these screens being driven by tyrosine phosphorylation of the surface-displayed peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For each kinase, a subset of the library (between 7% and 10%) showed enrichment scores above this background level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). To confirm that the pTyr-Var screens were reporting on unique substrate specificities across these tyrosine kinases, we calculated Pearsonâs correlation coefficients for the average datasets of each kinase pair and visualized position-specific amino acid preferences as heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4âsource data 2</xref>). We found strong correlation in specificity between kinases of the same family (the Src-family kinases c-Src/Fyn/Hck, and receptor pairs EPHB1/EPHB2 and FGFR1/FGFR3). We also observed that the specificity of Src-family kinases partly overlapped with the Ephrin receptors and MERTK. The specificity of AncSZ and Jak2 correlated with that of FGFRs.</p><p>Next, we compared the results of our pTyr-Var library screens with a curated list of kinase-substrate pairs found in the PhosphositePlus database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hornbeck et al., 2019</xref>). For c-Src, Fyn, and c-Abl, out of the sequences that overlapped between our library and the curated list, 30â40% of the kinase-substrate pairs showed efficient phosphorylation in the peptide-display screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>). This is consistent with a previous study using bacterial display and a different proteome-derived peptide library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). The modest overlap between peptide screens and literature-reported kinase-substrate pairs is not surprising, given that other mechanisms in kinase-substrate recognition, such as localization, may override kinase domain sequence preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miller and Turk, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the curated list of kinase-substrate pairs comes from both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies and may not accurately represent <italic>bona-fide</italic> substrates for each kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Natural variants of tyrosine phosphorylation sites impact kinase recognition</title><p>For pairs of peptides in the pTyr-Var library that correspond to a disease-associated variant and a reference sequence, we calculated the log<sub>2</sub>-fold change in enrichment for the variant relative to the reference. The large number of replicates for each screen afforded a robust analysis of phosphosite-proximal mutational effects for each kinase. We filtered the results in five steps to identify significant mutations: (1) We omitted phosphosite pairs where there was no statistically significant difference in enrichment between the variant and reference (p-value cutoff of 0.05). (2) We then applied a second filtering step to remove phosphosite pairs where the fold-change in enrichment between the variant and reference sequence was less than two. (3) Next, we excluded pairs where both sequences were low-activity substrates (enrichment score less than 1.5). (4) We removed mutations that added or removed a tyrosine residue, as their interpretation is ambiguous in our assay. (5) Lastly, we excluded phosphosite pairs in which the average read count of either the variant or wild-type sequence was less than 50. This left us with unique set of 50â400 high-confidence candidates for each tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4âfigure supplement 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>). From this filtered list, we found that kinases showed distinct patterns of mutational sensitivity at each position around the central tyrosine, consistent with their distinct sequence preferences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4âfigure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>For c-Src, we identified 381 high-confidence mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). A number of these mutations were on proteins involved in neurotrophin-regulated signaling, cyclin-dependent serine/threonine kinase activity, and other receptor/non-receptor tyrosine kinase activity. We found notable mutational effects at a known target of c-Src, Tyr 149 of the tumor suppressor protein FHL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), as well as on other proteins known to interact with c-Src, such as the lipid and protein phosphatase PTEN and the immune receptor LILRB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lu et al., 2003</xref>). We were particularly interested in cases where a kinase not previously known to phosphorylate a specific phosphosite showed a dramatic gain-of-function upon phosphosite-proximal mutation. For example, we found that the R982C mutation, proximal to Tyr 981 on the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, significantly enhanced phosphorylation by c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4âfigure supplement 8</xref>). This phosphosite is a known to engage the SH2 domain of c-Src and facilitate c-Src activation upon recruitment to RET, but it is not considered a kinase substrate of c-Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Encinas et al., 2004</xref>). This mutation could potentially rewire signaling by promoting phosphorylation of RET by c-Src, and in doing so, sustaining c-Src activation by its binding to phospho-RET. The RET R982C mutation also enhanced Tyr 981 phosphorylation by several other kinases, most notably Fer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4âfigure supplement 8</xref>). These examples show how the pTyr-Var data could be used as a resource to guide mutation-focused signaling studies.</p><p>To further validate our approach, we examined the effects of phosphosite-proximal mutations on the phosphorylation of an intact protein, rather than a peptide. Tyr 62 in the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 sits within a region of this protein that is frequently mutated in various human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tartaglia et al., 2006</xref>), and this residue is highly phosphorylated in receptor tyrosine kinase-driven cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gillette et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pfeiffer et al., 2022</xref>). Several Tyr 62-proximal mutations are encoded in the pTyr-Var library. In our screens, the reference peptide for Tyr 62 was preferentially phosphorylated by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as FGFR1, over non-receptors such as c-Src and Fyn, and nearby mutations showed varied effects on Tyr 62 phosphorylation, depending on the kinase tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4âfigure supplement 9</xref>). For example, D61V enhanced and D61N attenuated phosphorylation by Src-family kinases, but these mutations had little impact on recognition by FGFR1. To assess whether the effects of D61 mutations in the screens were retained in the context of the intact protein, we monitored phosphorylation of wild-type, D61V, and D61N SHP2 by c-Src, Fyn, and FGFR1 using intact protein mass spectrometry. We made two modifications to SHP2 to facilitate measurements: (1) substitution of the catalytic residue (C459E) to prevent dephosphorylation by the SHP2 phosphatase domain and (2) deletion of the disordered C-terminal tail to avoid background phosphorylation of an accessible site. Our measurements recapitulated the relative phosphorylation efficiencies for the Tyr 62 reference peptides, with Fyn being the slowest, and FGFR1 being the fastest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4âfigure supplement 9</xref>). Both D61V and D61N dramatically enhanced phosphorylation by all three kinases, consistent with reports that mutations at this site dramatically alter SHP2 structure and probably also increase Tyr 62 accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keilhack et al., 2005</xref>). For c-Src and Fyn, but not FGFR1, D61V showed a stronger enhancement of phosphorylation than D61N, consistent with our peptide screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4âfigure supplement 9</xref>). The effects of these mutations in SHP2 on signal rewiring in cells warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Position-specific amino acid preferences for tyrosine kinases are context-dependent</title><p>As noted earlier, position-specific scoring matrices do not reflect context-dependent sequence preferences. To illustrate this further, we scored peptide sequences in the pTyr-Var library using the position-specific scoring matrices generated from the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library. For peptides that showed significant enrichment in the pTyr-Var screens (enrichment &gt;1), there was a modest correlation with the scores predicted using the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library, with many outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We selected peptides for c-Src and c-Abl that were high-activity sequences based on the pTyr-Var screens (enrichment &gt;4) but deviated significantly from canonical recognition motifs, and therefore were low scoring (score &lt;0.5). The peptides selected for c-Src had unfavorable residues downstream of the central tyrosine (+1 Arg and +3 Gly for MISP_Y95;+1 Asn,+2 Arg, and +3 Glu for HLA-DPB1_Y59_F64L_YF). For c-Abl, the peptides had an unfavorable â1 Glu and +2 Ser (SIRPA_Y496_P491L) or an unfavorable +2 Glu and +3 Gly (HGD_Y166_F169L). We measured phosphorylation rates for these peptides using our RP-HPLC assay. Phosphorylation rates for these peptides deviated from what would be expected based on a position-specific scoring matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>).

The same substitution could have different effects depending on the composition of the surrounding sequence. This phenomenon is uniquely visible in our screening approach, as we are measuring the phosphorylation of defined peptide sequences, and we are conducting screens with thousands of peptide pairs that vary by only a single amino acid substitution. To test our hypothesis, we assessed whether the directionality of mutational effects observed for specific peptides in the pTyr-Var screen could be predicted using the position-specific scoring matrix derived from the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> screen (which would represent the effect of making a substitution averaged over all sequence contexts). While the directionality of the effect of most mutations could be predicted by the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> screen, we observed many mutations that showed a significant effect where none was predicted, as well as mutations where the effect was the opposite of what was predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5âsource data 2</xref>).</p><p>To validate this observation, we selected a peptide pair in the pTyr-Var library where a mutation (â2 Ser to Pro) had the opposite effect of that predicted by our X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> screen for c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), as well as published results with oriented peptide libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Begley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Obenauer et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, we made the same substitutions to the c-Src consensus peptide to determine whether the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> predictions would hold true in that context. Measurements of these purified peptides by c-Src show that the same amino acid substitution had different impacts on c-Src recognition, depending on the sequence context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). A previous study that analyzed the specificity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase using bacterial peptide display showed that the effect of mutations at the â2 position was sometimes dependent on the identity of the â1 residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantor et al., 2018</xref>). Molecular dynamics analyses in that report suggested that the amino acid identity at the â1 position determined how the side chain of the â2 residue was presented to the kinase, and vice versa, thereby dictating context-dependent preferences at both positions. Our pTyr-Var screens suggest that context dependent sequence preferences may be commonplace. Depending on the kinase, 5â15% of all significant mutations in the pTyr-Var screen had the opposite effect of that predicted using the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library data. Mapping these context-dependent effects comprehensively could have a significant impact on our ability to predict native substrates of kinases, and it will improve our understanding of the structural basis for substrate specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Phosphorylation of bacterial peptide display libraries enables profiling of SH2 domains</title><p>In previous implementations of our bacterial peptide display and deep sequencing approach, the specificities of phosphotyrosine recognition domains (e.g. SH2 domains and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains) were analyzed in addition to tyrosine kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lo et al., 2019</xref>). This approach required two amendments to the kinase screening protocol. First, the surface-displayed libraries were phosphorylated to saturating levels using a cocktail of tyrosine kinases. Second, because phosphotyrosine recognition domains generally have fast dissociation rates from their ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morimatsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oh et al., 2012</xref>), making binding-based selection assays challenging, constructs were generated in which two identical copies of an SH2 domain were artificially fused together. The tandem-SH2 constructs enhanced avidity for phosphopeptides displayed on the cell surface through multivalent effects, thereby enabling enrichment of cells via FACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantor et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>For this study, we reasoned that a multivalent SH2 construct could be mimicked by functionalizing avidin-coated magnetic beads with biotinylated SH2 domains.

Since the biotinylated SH2 domains could be produced in high yields through bacterial expression, the recognition domains were immobilized on the magnetic beads at saturating concentrations to ensure a uniform concentration across experiments.

The phosphorylated library was screened against three SH2 domains that fall into distinct specificity classes and are derived from three different types of signaling proteins: the SH2 domain from the tyrosine kinase c-Src, the C-terminal SH2 (C-SH2) domain from the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, and the SH2 domain from the non-catalytic adaptor protein Grb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6âsource data 1</xref>). The X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library screens recapitulated known sequences preferences for each SH2 domain. For c-Src, there was a distinctive preference for â2 His,+1 Asp/Glu, and +3 Ile, as previously reported from oriented peptide libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). For Grb2, a characteristic +2 Asn preference dominated the specificity profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kessels et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rahuel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Songyang et al., 1994</xref>). Notably, our Grb2 screen also reveals subtle amino acid preferences at other positions, which could tune the affinity for +2 Asn-containing sequences. Several studies have measured the sequence specificity of the SHP2 C-SH2 domain using diverse methods, including peptide microarrays, oriented peptide libraries, and one-bead-on-peptide libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sweeney et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tinti et al., 2013</xref>). The results of these reported screens are not concordant. Our method indicates a preference for Î²-branched amino acids (Thr/Val/Ile) at the â2 position, a small residue (Ala/Ser/Thr) at the +1 position, and strong preference for an aliphatic residue (Ile/Val/Leu) at the +3 position. Our results are most in-line with the one-bead-one-peptide screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sweeney et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We next phosphorylated and screened the pTyr-Var library against the same three SH2 domains in triplicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6âsource data 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata3">Figure 6âsource data 3</xref>). The replicates for each SH2 domain were highly correlated, but datasets between SH2 domains had poor correlation, suggesting distinct ligand specificities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4</xref>). As observed for kinases, we saw negligible enrichment of peptides lacking a tyrosine residue, but each SH2 domain showed strong enrichment of a few hundred peptides containing one or more tyrosines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). With the phosphorylated pTyr-Var library, we also carried out selection with a biotinylated pan-phosphotyrosine antibody to assess the level of bias in phosphorylation across the library. Compared to selection with SH2 domains, selection with the antibody yielded a narrower distribution of enrichment scores, with very few highly enriched sequences, suggesting relatively uniform phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We further validated the SH2 screening method by measuring the binding affinities of 9 peptides from the pTyr-Var library with the c-Src SH2 domain, using a fluorescence polarization binding assay. Enrichment scores from the pTyr-Var screen showed a good linear correlation with measured <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values over two orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>The pTyr-Var library screens with the SH2 domains were analyzed and filtered similarly to those with kinase domains. For each SH2 domain, we identified 50â300 phosphosite-proximal mutations that significantly and reproducibly enhanced or attenuated binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6âfigure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6âsource data 2</xref>). As expected, given their distinct specificities, the c-Src, SHP2-C, and Grb2 SH2 domains showed unique sensitivities to mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6âfigure supplement 6</xref>). We identified several phosphosite-proximal mutations that were selectively gain-of-function for one or two SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6âsource data 2</xref>). These mutations could drive the rewiring of signaling pathways by changing which downstream effector engages a phosphosite. This phenomenon was recently reported for lung-cancer associated mutations near phosphorylation sites in EGFR, which impacted the recruitment of Grb2 and SHP2 to the receptor and altered downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lundby et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we note that our pTyr-Var datasets included screens with both the kinase and SH2 domains of c-Src. When the SH2 domain of c-Src interacts with phosphoproteins, it both localizes the kinase domain in proximity to its substrates and activates the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 1993</xref>). Our screens revealed that the phosphorylation profiles of c-Src kinase and SH2 domains against the pTyr-Var were completely orthogonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6âfigure supplement 7</xref>). Their starkly different activities toward the pTyr-Var library can largely be attributed to kinase domain preference for a+3 Phe and SH2 domain preference for a+3 Ile/Val/Leu/Met. This is in contrast to previous observations for c-Abl, which has kinase and SH2 domains with largely overlapping sequence specificities, dominated by a+3 Pro preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>). For c-Src, phosphosite mutations that impacted recognition by one domain generally had no effect on the other, because preferred sequence features for one domain were typically tolerated (neutral) for the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6âfigure supplement 8</xref>). A consequence of this is that phosphosite-proximal mutations may alter c-Src function in two mechanistically distinct ways: (1) mutations that enhance SH2 binding can alter the localization and local activation of c-Src or (2) mutations that enhance kinase recognition will directly increase phosphorylation rates by c-Src. These insights highlight value in profiling multiple domains of the same signaling protein against the same peptide library.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Amber codon suppression yields an expanded repertoire of peptides for specificity profiling</title><p>The specificity profiling screens described thus far were constrained to sequences that contain the canonical twenty amino acids. Several studies have suggested that non-canonical amino acids and post-translationally modified amino acids can also impact sequence recognition by kinases and SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfaro-Lopez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Begley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapelat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yeh et al., 2001</xref>). The most notable example of this is phospho-priming, whereby phosphorylation of one residue on a protein enhances the ability of a kinase to recognize and phosphorylate a proximal residue. This phenomenon was recently described for EGFR, which preferentially phosphorylates sequences containing a tyrosine followed by a+1 phosphotyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Begley et al., 2015</xref>). Other prevalent post-translational modifications, such as lysine acetylation, may also impact the ability of kinases or SH2 domains to recognize a particular phosphosite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Parker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rust and Thompson, 2011</xref>).</p><p>We sought to expand our specificity profiling method to incorporate non-canonical and post-translationally modified amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Since our libraries are genetically encoded, we employed Amber codon suppression and repurposing, using engineered tRNA molecules and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amiram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). The degenerate (X) positions in our X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library are encoded using an NNS codon, which means that an Amber codon (TAG) is sampled at each position 3% of the time. Thus, this library theoretically contains a sufficiently large number of diverse sequences to profile specificity with a 21 amino acid alphabet. For Amber suppression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, tRNA/synthetase pairs are commonly expressed from pEVOL or pULTRA plasmids (chloramphenicol and streptomycin resistant, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>). Both of these systems are incompatible with our surface-display platform, which uses MC1061 cells (streptomycin resistance encoded in the genome) and libraries in a pBAD33 vector (chloramphenicol resistant). Thus, we designed a variant of the pULTRA plasmid in which we swapped the streptomycin resistance gene for an ampicillin resistance gene from a common pET vector for protein expression (pULTRA-Amp).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Expansion of peptide display libraries using Amber suppression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Non-canonical amino acids used in this study.

We measured peptide display levels by flow cytometry for cultures that were grown with or without CMF in the media. For the cultures grown without CMF, roughly 20% of the cells had no surface-displayed peptides, consistent with termination of translation at Amber codons within the peptide-coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In the presence of CMF, this premature termination was significantly suppressed, and a larger fraction of the cells displayed peptides. As an additional test, we incorporated 4-azido phenylalanine (AzF) into the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amiram et al., 2015</xref>). Cells expressing this expanded library were treated with a dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO)-functionalized fluorophore, which should selectively react with the azide on AzF via strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ning et al., 2008</xref>). Only cells expressing the synthetase and grown in the presence of AzF showed significant DIBO labeling, confirming Amber suppression and non-canonical amino acid incorporation into our library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Using this library expansion strategy, we assessed how substrate recognition by c-Src is impacted by neighboring CMF or acetyl-lysine residues. We subjected CMF- or AcK-containing X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> libraries to c-Src phosphorylation, selection, and sequencing, using the same methods described above. When analyzing X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> libraries in standard kinase and SH2 screens, we typically omit all Amber-containing sequences from our calculations, as they do not encode expressed peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For these experiments, we included Amber-containing sequences in our analysis. Using this strategy, we found that the Amber codon was less depleted at each position surrounding the central tyrosine than we observed for libraries without Amber suppression, but the log-transformed enrichment scores for Amber codons at all positions surrounding the tyrosine residue were still negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We reasoned that, if Amber suppression efficiency was not 100%, any Amber-containing sequence would still be depleted relative to a sequencing lacking a stop codon, due to some premature termination. Thus, we re-analyzed the data by exclusively counting sequences that contained one Amber codon, under the assumption that every sequence would have approximately the same amount of premature termination. This revealed positive enrichment for CMF and AcK at select positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Although we only included a fraction of the total library in our new analysis, the overall specificity profile was almost identical to that observed when including the whole library, indicating that this sub-sampling approach was valid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we compared the preferences for CMF and AcK at each position to their closest canonical amino acids, phenylalanine (Phe) and lysine (Lys). CMF was enriched at the â3 and â2 positions, where Phe is not tolerated by c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Negatively-charged amino acids (Asp and Glu) are also preferred at these positions, and the negative charge on the carboxymethyl group of CMF at neutral pH may be able to mimic this recognition. c-Src has a strong selective preference for Phe at the +3 position, which it engages via a well-formed hydrophobic pocket near the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bose et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). The charged carboxymethyl group on CMF is likely to be incompatible with this mode of binding, consistent with depletion of CMF at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The difference between Lys and AcK was even more striking. Lys is unfavorable for c-Src at every position around the phospho-acceptor tyrosine. By contrast, AcK was not only tolerated, but even favorable at a few positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the position-specific responsiveness to lysine acetylation was kinase-dependent, we also performed additional screens of the AcK-containing X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library with Hck and c-Abl. These screens showed that all three kinases had very similar position-dependent tolerance for AcK over Lys, with the closely-related c-Src and Hck being more similar to one another than their distant relative c-Abl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Finally, we assessed how the effect of lysine acetylation translated to actual changes in phosphorylation rates. We produced variants of the c-Src and c-Abl consensus peptides with Lys or AcK at various positions and measured their rates of phosphorylation by their respective cognate kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Of the positions tested (â2,+1, and +5 relative to the tyrosine), we saw the largest effect at the +1 position, consistent with the screens. At the +1 position, where Lys is not tolerated, acetylation enhanced activity as much as five-to-ten-fold, depending on the peptide concentration. In the long-term, we envision using this approach to predict sites in the proteome where lysine acetylation creates new, high-activity substrates for tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, the same analysis could be applied to other tyrosine kinases and to SH2 domains, and our strategy could be readily expanded to other post-translational modifications that can be encoded using Amber suppression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>In this report, we describe a significant expansion to a previously developed method for profiling the sequence specificities of tyrosine kinases and SH2 (phosphotyrosine recognition) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shah et al., 2016</xref>). Our method relies on bacterial display of DNA-encoded peptide libraries and deep sequencing, and it enables the simultaneous analysis of multiple phosphotyrosine signaling proteins against thousands-to-millions of peptides or phosphopeptides. The resulting data can be used to design high-activity consensus sequences, predict the activities of uncharacterized sequences, and accurately measure the effects of amino acid substitutions on sequence recognition. A notable feature of our platform is that it relies on deep sequencing as a readout, yielding quantitative results. Furthermore, the data generated from our screens show a strong correlation with phosphorylation rates and binding affinities measured using orthogonal biochemical assays.</p><p>We envision a number of exciting applications of this expanded specificity profiling platform. Several recent reports have aimed to explain the molecular basis for tyrosine kinase and SH2 sequence specificity and affinity, by combining protein sequence and structure analysis with specificity profiling data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Creixell et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaneko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). The rich datasets generated using our platform will augment these approaches, particularly when coupled with screening data for additional proteins. A long-term goal of these efforts will undoubtedly be to accurately predict the sequence specificity and signaling properties of any uncharacterized phosphotyrosine signaling protein, such as a disease-associated kinase variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Creixell et al., 2015b</xref>). Given the nature of the data generated by our platform, we expect that it will also aid the development and implementation of machine learning models for sequence specificity and design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Creixell et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunningham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kundu et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, our initial efforts in this realm suggest that specificity profiling data using the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library, without any protein structural information, may be sufficient to build models of sequence specificity that can accurately predict phosphorylation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rube et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The pTyr-Var Library described in this report provides a unique opportunity to investigate variant effects across the human proteome. The vast majority of mutations near tyrosine phosphorylation sites are functionally uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hornbeck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krassowski et al., 2018</xref>). Our screens are yielding some of the first mechanistic biochemical hypotheses about how many of these mutations could impact cell signaling. For example, these datasets will allow us to identify mutations that tune signaling pathways by altering the phosphorylation efficiency of specific phosphosites or the binding of SH2-containing effector proteins to those sites. Alternatively, these screens may help identify instances of network rewiring, in which a phosphosite-proximal mutation alters the canonical topology of a pathway by changing which kinases phosphorylate a phosphosite or which SH2-containing proteins get recruited to that site. The biological effects of signal tuning and rewiring caused by phosphosite-proximal mutations remain largely unexplored.</p><p>Our high-throughput platform to profile tyrosine kinase and SH2 sequence recognition is accessible and easy to use in labs that are equipped to culture <italic>E. coli</italic> and execute common molecular biology and biochemistry techniques. Screens can be conducted on the benchtop with proteins produced in-house or obtained from commercial vendors. Peptide libraries of virtually any composition, tailored to address specific biochemical questions, can be produced using commercially available oligonucleotides and standard molecular cloning techniques. Furthermore, facile chemical changes to the library (e.g. enzymatic phosphorylation or the introduction of non-canonical amino acids via Amber suppression) afford access to new biochemical questions. For example, the tyrosine-phosphorylated libraries described here will also be useful for the characterization of tyrosine phosphatase specificity, and acetyl-lysine-containing libraries could be used to profile lysine deacetylases and bromodomains. Additional amendments to this platform will enable the analysis of serine/threonine kinases and other protein modification or recognition domains, adding to the growing arsenal of robust methods for the high-throughput biochemical characterization of cell signaling proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Expression and purification of tyrosine kinase domains</title><p>Constructs for the kinase domains of c-Src, c-Abl, Fyn, Hck, AncSZ, Fer, FGFR1, FGFR3, EPHB1, EPHB2, and MERTK all contained an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site.

In this initial list, about 2,133 sequences had more than one tyrosine residue, and so a second version of those sequences were included in which the tyrosines except the central tyrosine were substituted with phenylalanine (denoted with a â_YFâ suffix). In addition, 24 previously reported consensus substrate sequences were included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Begley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marholz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rube et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Songyang et al., 1995</xref>). In total, our designed pTyr-Var library contained 9,898 unique 11-residue peptide sequences, which were then converted into DNA sequences using the most frequently used codon in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The DNA sequences were further optimized, swapping synonymous codons to achieve a GC content of all sequence between 30% and 70%.

The coding sequences for the eCPX-strep and eCPX-myc constructs were amplified from these plasmids by PCR using the link-eCPX-fwd primer and the link-eCPX-rev primer. These PCR products contained a 3â SfiI restriction site. The peptide-coding sequences were then fused to the eCPX scaffold at the 5â end of the scaffold in another PCR step to generate the library-scaffold inserts. For the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> Library, this step used the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library oligo and the link-eCPX-rev primer, along with the amplified eCPX gene. For the pTyr-Var library, this step used the amplified oligo-pool, the amplified eCPX gene, and the Oligopool-fwd-primer and link-eCPX-rev primer. The resulting PCR products contained the peptide-scaffold fusion constructs flanked by two unique SfiI sites.</p><p>In parallel, the pBAD33-eCPX backbone was amplified by PCR from the pBAD33-eCPX plasmid using the BB-fwd-primer and BB-rev primer. Both the amplified insert and backbone were purified over spin columns and then digested with the SfiI restriction endonuclease overnight at 50 Â°C. After digestion, the backbone was treated with Quick CIP (NEB) to prevent self-ligation from occurring. Both the digested insert and backbone were gel purified. The purified library insert was ligated into the digested pBAD33-eCPX backbone using T4 DNA ligase (NEB) overnight at 16 Â°C. Typically, this reaction was done with a total of approximately 1.5 Î¼g of DNA, with a 1:5 molar ratio of backbone:insert.

In one format of this analysis, we used the countPeptides.py script on a trimmed input file, or batch-countPeptides.py script for multiple input files, to generate a list of every unique peptide and its corresponding counts. In a second format of this analysis, we used the countPeptides-var-ref.py (or batch-countPeptides-var-ref.py), along with paired text files listing each variant (pTyr-Var_variant.txt) and their corresponding reference sequence (pTyr-Var_reference.txt), line-by-line, to yield side-by-side counts for each variant-reference pair. These processing steps were conducted for both selected samples (after kinase phosphorylation or SH2 binding), as well as unselected input samples. Next, the number of reads for every sequence (n<sub>peptide</sub>) was normalized to the total number of peptide-coding reads in that sample (n<sub>total</sub>), to yield a frequency (f<sub>peptide</sub>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">equation 1</xref>). Then, the frequency of each peptide in a selected sample (f<sub>peptide,selected</sub>) was further normalized to the frequency of that same peptide in the unselected input sample (f<sub>peptide,input</sub>) to yield an enrichment score (E<sub>peptide</sub>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">equation 2</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ1"> <label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s3-9-2"><title>Analysis of data from screens with the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> Library</title><p>For data from the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library, we did not calculate enrichments for individual sequences, as the sequencing depth per sample was generally on-par with the library size was (10<sup>6</sup>â107 sequences). Instead, we computed the counts for each amino acid (or a stop codon) at every position along peptides of the expected length (11 amino acid residues). To accomplish this, we first translated all of the DNA sequences in the trimmed sequencing files using the translateUnique.py (or batch-translateUnique.py) script. When stop codons were encountered, they were translated as an asterisk symbol. In addition to producing a file of translated reads named âSampleName.translate.fastaâ, this script also produced lists of every unique translated 11-residue peptide and the corresponding counts for that peptide. These files allowed us to assess whether any individual sequence was disproportionately enriched (not expected for a single round of selection with a library of this size), how many unique sequences were in each sample, and what fraction of the unique sequences contained a stop codon.</p><p>Using the translated read files, we then calculated the position-specific amino acid counts in three formats. In the simplest format, we exclusively counted 11-residue sequences that contained a central tyrosine and no stop codons (AA-count-nostop.py and batch-AA-count-nostop.py). In order to calculate stop codon depletion, we run a version of the script that counted amino acid and stop codon composition across all 11-residue sequences (AA-count-full.py and batch-AA-count-full.py). Finally, for Amber suppression datasets, we exclusively counted sequences containing one stop and a central tyrosine residue (AA-count-1stop.py and batch-AA-count-1stop,py). Each of these scripts generated an 11x21 counts matrix with each position in the peptide represented by a column (from â5 to +5), and each row represented by an amino acid (in alphabetical order, with the stop codon in the 21st row). Frequencies of each amino acid at each position were determined by taking the position-specific count for each amino acid and dividing that by the column total. Frequencies in a matrix from a selected sample were further normalized against frequencies from an input sample, and the resulting enrichment values were log<sub>2</sub>-transformed to yield the data represented in the heatmaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9-3"><title>Scoring sequences using data from the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> Library</title><p>In order to score peptides using position-weighted counts matrixes from the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> Library, we wrote a Python script called score_peptide_nostop.py. This script requires the selected and input counts matrices for a kinase or SH2 domain, produced by the AA-count-nostop.py script, along with a list of peptides as a text file, with one peptide per line. The script first calculates the normalized enrichments for each amino acid at each position across the matrices. Then, it reads each target sequence, sums up the log<sub>2</sub>-normalized enrichments for each residue according to the enrichment matrix, ignoring the central tyrosine, and divides the sum by the number of scored residues (10 for the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> Library). The script also calculates the score for the best and worst sequence, according to the enrichment matrix. Both unnormalized and normalized scores for the whole peptide list are outputted as text files.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> measurements of phosphorylation rates with purified kinases and peptides</title><sec id="s3-10-1"><title>RP-HPLC assay to measure peptide phosphorylation kinetics</title><p>To validate the enrichment scores observed in the c-Src screening data, the phosphorylation rates were measured <italic>in vitro</italic> with the purified catalytic domain of c-Src and synthetic 11-residue peptides derived from sequences in the pTyr-Var library. Kinetic measurements were carried out at 37 Â°C by mixing 500 nM c-Src and 100 Î¼M peptide in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM TCEP, and 2 mM activated sodium orthovanadate. Reactions were initiated by adding 1 mM ATP. At various time points, 100 Î¼L aliquots were removed and quenched by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mM. Each time point sample was analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC, monitoring absorbance at 214 nm. Forty Î¼L of each time point was injected onto a C18 column (ZORBAX 300 SB-C18, 5 Î¼m, 4.6x150 mm). The solvent system used was water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, using the following set of linear gradients: 0â2 min: 5% B, 2â12 min: 5â95% B, 12â13 min: 95% B, 13â14 min: 95â5% B, and 14â17 min: 5% B. The areas under the peaks corresponding to the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides were calculated using the Agilent OpenLAB ChemStation software. The fractional product peak area was plotted as a function of reaction time, and the initial linear regime of this plot was fitted to a straight line to determine a reaction rate. Rates were corrected for substrate and enzyme concentration. Reactions were done in triplicate or quadruplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10-2"><title>Michaelis-Menten analysis using the ADP-Quest assay</title><p>A fluorescence-based assay from Eurofins (ADP Quest) was used to measure the Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters for phosphorylation of the consensus peptides by purified tyrosine kinase domains. In this assay, ADP production as a result of kinase activity is coupled to the production of resorufin, a fluorophore that emits signal at 590 nm. For all experiments, the assay reactions were set up as described in the provided assay kit protocol, in a 384 well plate format. The peptide solutions were serially diluted in 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and the kinases were diluted to 50 nM in buffer (10 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The final reaction mixtures contained 10 nM of kinase with 100 Î¼M of ATP. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 1 mM ATP into a 50 Î¼L reaction mixture for a final concentration of 100 Î¼M ATP. Phosphorylation reaction progress was monitored by measuring fluorescence at excitation 530 nm and emission 590 nm every 2 min at 37 Â°C on a plate reader (BioTek Synergy Neo 2). The fluorescence units (RFU) were converted to Î¼M ADP by comparison to a standard curve, and the initial rates were extracted from the linear regime of the reaction progress curves. Initial rates were also measured for samples containing each kinase but lacking a peptide substrate, to account for background ATP hydrolysis. This background rate was subtracted from the rates measured in the presence of peptide. The subtracted rates were plotted as a function of substrate concentration and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to extract <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> measurements of binding affinities with purified SH2 and phospho-peptides</title><p>Binding affinities of SH2 domains and phospho-peptides were measured using fluorescence polarization-based competition binding assay, following previously reported methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cushing et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article is being evaluated by 4 peer reviewers, including Tony Hunter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation is being overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers were impressed by the new sequence specificities you have obtained for additional tyrosine kinases and SH2 domains by using your improved bacterial peptide surface display technology. However, in their opinion, the technical improvements you describe are not a significant enough advance to warrant publication of the paper as it stands. The reviewers indicate that validation of the biological significance of at least one of your novel findings is required to establish that the specificities obtained by your approach will be useful to the community. For this reason, prior to requesting you to submit a revised version, we ask you to submit a written plan outlining additional experiments that you could do within a reasonable time frame to validate one of your new findings. Each of the reviewers has suggestions for the sort of experiments you might be able to do.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here, the authors report an improved version of the X5-Tyr-X5 peptide bacterial surface display technology, which they had developed previously to determine the primary sequence specificities of the LCK and ZAP70 tyrosine kinases (TKs) and the EGF receptor. Taking advantage of the new protocol they defined the primary sequence specificities of five additional TKs: the c-Src, c-Abl, and Fer nonreceptor TKs, and the EPHB1 and EPHB2 RTKs. Consensus peptide substrates were synthesized for the five TKs using the most favorable amino acid at every position, and their kinetic properties and TK selectivity were compared with those of the SrcTide and AblTide substrate peptides. The consensus peptides had reasonable (10-200 Î¼M Km) affinities and were relatively selective substrates for the c-Src, cAbl, and Fer TKs, respectively. However, although consensus sequences were deduced for EPHB1 and EPHB2, these kinases showed relatively little sequence selectivity. Next, they used their specificity data to predict the consequences of known naturally occurring single amino acid sequence variations â either disease-associated mutations or polymorphisms â in the five residues on either side of c-Src phosphosites on phosphorylation, and compared these predictions with actual experimental data, showing that they could predict relative rates of phosphorylation of the variant peptides with reasonable accuracy. Based on this success, they built a 10,000 member MYC-tagged variant expression library (pTyr-Var), which excluded Tyr in the X5 flanking residues, and tested the ability of the c-Src, Fyn, and Hck SFKs, c-Abl, Fer, JAK2, and AncSZ, an engineered homologue of the SYK/ZAP-70 family members, and five RTKs â EPHB1, EPHB2, <italic>FGFR1</italic>, FGFR3, and MERTK. They found that the different TKs exhibited distinct patterns of sensitivity to sequence variation at each position around the Tyr, consistent with individual sequence preferences. As an example, the variant R982C RET peptide was strongly preferred by several TKs compared to the Tyr981 reference peptide. They also showed that there were sequence context-dependent effects of mutations proximal to a phosphosite, which were not predicted based on the X5-Y-X5 library results. In addition, they exploited expanded genetic code technology to incorporate CMF, a pTyr analogue, or acetyl-lysine (AcK) residues randomly in the X5-Y-X5 library. They found that unlike Lys, AcK was not only tolerated but preferred in some positions for c-Src phosphorylation, whereas CMF could not replace Phe at preferred positions in c-Src peptide substrates. The authors had previously used pre-phosphorylated peptide surface displays to survey the binding specificity of the GRB2 SH2 domain, and here they extended this to two additional SH2 domains, SHP2-C and c-Src. For this purpose, they pre-phosphorylated the X5-Y-X5 library with a mix of c-Src, c-Abl, AncSZ, and EPHB1 TKs, and then used biotinylated SH2 constructs, tandemized to increase binding avidity, to screen the c-Src, SHP2-C and GRB2 SH2 domains. With the exception of SHP2-C, they found sequence preferences largely concordant with those reported using other approaches. By screening the pTyr-Var library for SH2 binding they also found natural variant phosphosite sequences that exhibited gain of function for SH2 binding that could be of functional significance.</p><p>This extension of the authors' previous studies with bacterial surface peptide display technology has provided some additional insights into the primary sequence specificities of the large tyrosine kinase family by examining a broader range of TKs, and by checking the consequences of natural positional variations around sites of Tyr phosphorylation on the efficiency of phosphorylation. They demonstrated the versatility of this approach by using expanded genetic code technology to investigate the consequences of installing post-translationally modified amino acids at specific positions upstream and downstream of the target Tyr on the efficiency of phosphorylation by different TKs. They also exploited pre-phosphorylated peptide display libraries to interrogate the primary sequence specificities of two additional SH2 domains.</p><p>One advantage of the surface display method is that in principle it provides individual sequences that are preferred substrates for a TK, but in practice this information is not used, and preferred residues at each position are obtained. The new TK specificities they have determined reveal some interesting motifs, and the use of this method to define the effects of sequence variants in the vicinity of target phosphosites on their phosphorylation or SH2/PTB domain binding will be valuable in predicting possible functional consequences of such variants, for instance in disease. The use of the display method to detect the consequences of posttranslational modifications of amino acids in the vicinity of a phosphosite is also an advance, but it is limited by the availability of cell permeant, stable unnatural amino acid analogues and cognate evolved tRNA charging enzymes</p><p>Overall, given their prior publications using the original version of this technology, this paper is a relatively modest technical advance, but the significant amount of new TK and SH2 specificity information they have obtained will no doubt be useful to aficionados of tyrosine phosphorylation signaling systems. Even though this paper was submitted for the Tools and Resources category, it would be strengthened by inclusion of a follow-up experimental analysis of at least one or two instances where a novel specificity was observed to demonstrate its biological relevance.</p><p>Points:</p><p>1. The potential issues with including Cys in the peptide libraries were not discussed. For instance, a Cys residue in a peptide may be partially oxidized on the surface because of its exposure to oxygen, or, because the Cys is unpaired, disulfide bonds may form between adjacent peptide molecules on the surface. In addition, having multiple Tyr in addition to the central Tyr and using high phosphorylation stoichiometries means that the extra tyrosine in the peptide may be the preferred target.</p><p>2. As the authors showed, the method will be useful for studying the influence of neighboring modified amino acids on TK phosphosite selectivity. Indeed, it is already known that pTyr can serve as a positive determinant for TK phosphorylation. Presumably, it was for this reason that the authors tested whether incorporation of CMF, a pTyr mimic, at different positions affected the ability of the c-Src kinase to phosphorylate preferrred sequences. However, CMF is not a very good pTyr mimic, and if the authors wanted to determine possible roles for pTyr itself they should have used one of the recently described methods for incorporating pTyr as an unnatural amino acid into proteins expressed in bacteria (e.g., PMID: 28604693; PMID: 28604697).</p><p>3. From a methods perspective, some of the recombinant catalytic domains were preactivated by incubation with ATP, presumably leading to autophosphorylation. The sites phosphorylated on the activation loop of TKs can affect primary sequence specificity. Electrospray MS was used to show these preparations were multiply phosphorylated, but which autophosphorylation sites were occupied in the protein that was used to phosphorylate the library were not determined.</p><p>4. It is not clear why the surface display method should be &quot;tuned to select a high Kcat&quot;. Does the <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5a strain used here secrete a nonspecific phosphatase that could act on the phosphorylated peptides; the assay buffer included orthovanadate, but it is not clear whether this would inhibit such a generic phosphatase?</p><p>5. The authors' c-Src results showed a strong preference for a +1 Asp/Glu/Ser in addition to the +1 Gly previously reported using oriented peptide libraries. However, in the end the improvements in kinetic parameters for their Src and Abl consensus peptides were relatively modest compared to prior published examples.</p><p>6. Figure 2B and Figure 2S1: Src, Abl, EPHB1 and EPHB2 all showed a preference in their display consensus for Pro at +4. While a preference for Pro at +4 is observed in natural Src and Abl substrates, one wonders whether this is a hidden constraint/bias of the method. In addition, the +2 â +4 WWW motif preferred by Fer is curious. Are there any reported (Fer) TK sites with this WWW motif, and does the closely related Fes TK also exhibit this preference? No Trp residues are found in the PhosphoSitePlus motif logo for Fer. Do these Trp residues contribute to the low Î¼M Km for the Fer consensus peptide? Can the WWW peptide be modeled into the active site of the FES TK catalytic domain? Finally, in this regard, it would help the reader if this panel included -5 to +5 numbering under the alignment.</p><p>7. The SRC consensus has a preferred Cys at -2, which was not discussed â do the authors know whether this Cys was oxidized on the bacterial surface. If so, it could have provided a partial negative charge and serve a similar purpose to the -2 Glu in SrcTide. How important is the -2 Cys in the synthetic peptide substrates?</p><p>8. Figure 2C: The authors' data showed that EPHB1 displayed little selectivity across the consensus peptides and did not even prefer its own cognate consensus sequence. Moreover, although they did not comment on this, the same seems to be true for EPHB2. The basis for this lack of selectivity needs fuller discussion.</p><p>9. Figure 4F: The authors did not explain why the inclusion of Cys at +1 in the Ret Y981 peptide made it a better substrate for several of the 13 tested TKs.</p><p>10. While the authors showed that unnatural amino acids incorporation is compatible with the surface display method, only those modified amino acids for which a cell-permeant modified amino acid and a cognate tRNA charging enzyme have been developed can readily be used. In contrast, any modified amino acid can be used in the position-oriented peptide display approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a well-designed study addressing important biological issues â what are the specificities of the tyrosine kinases and SH2 domains which work in tandem in cell signal transduction and deregulation of the TK-SH2 signaling axis is associated with a host of diseases, notably cancer. Although these issues have been investigated in previous studies, the current study established a platform that is complementary to previous ones (eg., those based on synthetic peptide libraries) and potentially more quantitative. The application of this approach to known Tyr/pTyr sites with mutations in the flanking residues is novel and provides insights into the biochemical and functional consequences of the mutations. Although the work is comprehensive, and the data presented are of high-quality and supportive of the conclusions in general, there are a few concerns as enumerated below.</p><p>1. The authors appear to focus on justifying how their platform identifies the same specificity profiles as previous methods when it is more important to highlight the differences and discuss what they mean. While it is challenging to verify whether the specificity profiles obtained from the current study are closer to the physiological specificity of the TKs/SH2s, it'd be helpful to use the specificity information to predict in vivo substrates and to find out how many known substrates can be identified and how many are missed. After all, the specificity profile is valuable only when it can predict in vivo targets and the effect of mutations on TK/SH2-target interaction (the authors are to be commended for doing a decent job on the latter).</p><p>2. A systematic comparison of the context-independent specificity (obtained from the X5-Y-X5 library) with context-dependent effect (obtained from the pTyr-var library) is missing. It would be important to systematically compare the specificity profiles obtained from the two libraries and identify the common and distinct features (and explain why).</p><p>3. The platform seems to work better for certain TKs (eg., Src, Abl) than others (eg., EphB1/B2). Is this due to the distinct specificity of these kinases or differences in enzymatic activity? In this regard, how is the activity of the TKs benchmarked?</p><p>4. By the same token, what's the affinity of an SH2 domain used in the study for its cognate ligand? It should also be discussed/justified in more detail why the SHP2-C SH2 domain was picked when the tandem SH2 domains in SHP2 often work together in ligand recognition.</p><p>5. The manuscript would be significantly improved if one or more novel sites/substrates predicted using the specificity data are validated on the peptide and protein level.</p><p>6. The heatmaps (eg., Figure 5-SI5) look similar at a glance. Is there another way to present the data and show the differences in specificity in a more conspicuous manner? Bar graph â which is more tedious- may be a better choice especially for important positions. Grouping residues based on their physiochemical properties may also simplify the profile pattern and make it easier to read and understand.</p><p>7. The inclusion of Tyr in the X positions of the X5-Y-X5 library may obscure the specificity patter as Tyr at any position may be phosphorylated. I'd suggest repeating a couple of TKs using a library that contains only a central Tyr.</p><p>8. The AA read counts (eg. Figure S1) varied widely, why? Does this have an effect on the screening?</p><p>9. Figure 5-SI1, provide correlation coefficient; why is the apparent correlation for Abl poorer compared to EphB1 when the former appears to have a more defined specificity pattern?</p><p>10. Figure 6 â SI6 â The orthogonal specificity pattern for the CTK kinase and SH2 domains seems at odds with the established notion that the CTK kinase and SH2 domain specificities are related., eg, the pTyr sites created by the kinase are preferably bound by its own SH2 domain or closely related SH2 domains (Songyang et al. Nature 1995; 373:536-9). This needs to be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports modifications to previously published methods in which the substrate specificity of tyrosine kinases and binding specificity of phosphotyrosine interaction domains is analyzed using a bacterial surface display coupled to next-generation sequencing. This report modifies these methods in that phosphorylated bacteria are selected by magnetic bead immunoprecipitation rather than fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). This allows for larger libraries of higher complexity to be used and for parallel processing to increase throughput. The strength of this manuscript lies in the use of a cutting edge technique offering substantial benefit over other methods. Its main weakness is that the major capabilities of the method are similar to those of the FACS-based approach, and the conclusions drawn here were also reached across the series of papers originally reporting that method. For example, the previous papers reported good correlations between enrichment scores and phosphorylation rates measured <italic>in vitro</italic>, the capacity to infer changes in phosphorylation rate from single amino acid substitutions, and the context-dependent impact of those substitutions; the orthogonal nature of SH2 binding and kinase specificity observed here has been seen in other studies using different methods. Given the precedent, one would have hoped to see the method applied in a way that new insight is gained to the nature of Tyr kinase specificity in general, or to how a particular kinase signals. One modification to the protocol that had not been previously reported was the use of an amber suppression-based orthogonal translation system allowing incorporation of non-natural or modified amino acids. Libraries incorporating carboxymethyl-Phe (a pTyr mimic) and acetylated lysine residues were generated and screened with the kinase c-Src. This is an interesting extension of the technique, and one could imagine bringing in other known PTMs such as methylated Lys or Arg. However, there is a potential limitation in that each non-native residue requires a separate screen to be performed. Overall, this manuscript employs state-of-the-art screening methods, but its impact is tempered by literature precedent.</p><p>Manuscript presentation:</p><p>1. The introduction provides an overview of existing methods for determining kinase specificity. However, the authors neglect to mention a couple of approaches that arguably best rival methods employed in the current manuscript from the standpoint of identifying context-dependent selectivity. These include MS-based approaches that use proteome-derived peptide libraries, from either protease digests of cell lysates or genetically encoded libraries (the cited Barber et al. paper is mischaracterized as performing analysis on cell lysates, and these papers were not cited: Kettenbach, et al. PMID: 22633412, Douglass et al. PMID: 22723110, Imamura et al. PMID: 24869485 and Xue, et al. PMID: 22451900). In addition, an approach using yeast surface display in which Tyr kinases are targeted to the secretory pathway deserves mention (Taft et al. PMID: 31339688). The authors could also consider less extensive referencing of historical methods from the 1990s that are no longer used.</p><p>Data availability:</p><p>2. I could not find the deep sequencing data for kinase selections of the X5-Y-X5 library. Did they apply a cutoff for the number of read counts to be included in their analysis?</p><p>Technical points:</p><p>3. Two versions of the X5-Y-X5 library were made â one with a strep tag and one with a myc tag. Were both subjected to quality control sequencing as shown in Figure 1 supp 1, and which is shown in the table? Were both of them used for screens?</p><p>4. It is not clear that the authors estimated the representation of the X5-Y-X5 library other than from the standpoint of pooled representation of each residue at each position (&quot;1-10 million unique peptide sequences&quot; were observed by sequencing). How many transformants were recovered during library cloning, and how does this compare to the number of sequencing reads used for quality control?</p><p>5. Selection of Tyr residues from the X5-Y-X5 library are likely due to &quot;off target&quot; phosphorylation of the non-central residue. This could muddy the specificity analysis as there would contribution of other selected residues at the &quot;wrong&quot; positions. For the Tyr-Var library, the authors avoided this issue by including Tyr to Phe substitutions. Do any of the results for X5-Y-X5 change if they exclude all peptides with Tyr at a non-central position?</p><p>6. Based on the concentration bacterial cells used in the kinase reactions, it seems likely that the authors are observing single turnover rather than multiple turnover kinetics. This could explain some of the differences between the results described here and prior analyses with the same kinases. Can the authors estimate the effective substrate concentration in their experiments? Can they comment on the potential impact of single vs multiple turnover kinetics on their results?</p><p>7. For Tyr kinases that were analyzed with both libraries, how do the specificity matrices derived from the Tyr-Var data (Figure 4 â Figure supp 5) compare to those from the X5-Y-X5 data (Figure 1B and Figure 2A)?</p><p>8. The observation that there is context dependence â the impact of a given amino acid substitution differs depending on the surrounding sequence â is not surprising given the author's previous work. However, the specific example shown here should be interpreted with caution, as undersampling may impact what is construed to be the &quot;average&quot; signal in the X5-Y-X5 library. It would be most convincing if there were examples where the impact of a given amino acid substitution were observed on two different peptide sequences, i.e. where enrichment scores for both the &quot;WT&quot; and variant sequence could be calculated. One would also want to see some verification by <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay that the same substitution caused different effects on reaction rates in the context of two different peptides.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In work by Li and colleagues, they utilized phage display technology to characterize phosphorylation site motifs of tyrosine kinases and pY binding motifs of SH2 domains. Building on previously published work by the corresponding author, they have significantly improved and broadened the application of their platform. The experimental approach here involves the external display of peptides on the surfaces of bacteria. These peptides contain tyrosines surrounded by defined amino acid sequences where each bacterium encodes a single sequence. The cells are subjected to <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase phosphorylation reactions, and the phosphorylated population is examined by deep sequencing to quantify the enrichment of amino acid residues and infer phosphorylation site motifs. In this manuscript, the authors have improved the sampling rate of their platform from &lt;5000 to 1-10 million unique peptide sequences analyzed per experiment, made it more accessible (no longer requiring FACS instrumentation), combined it with amber codon suppression methods to expand the list of amino acids that can be incorporated, and repurposed it to profile SH2 binding.</p><p>Overall, this is a very nice extension of the corresponding author's previous work and is likely to make helpful contributions to the tyrosine kinase signaling field. Their manuscript surveys multiple applications of their phage display platform and provides reliable supporting experimental data. Additionally, the authors have identified 50-400 disease-associated mutation variants proximal to tyrosine phosphorylation sites that potentially alter phosphorylation by the kinases examined in this study, and 50-300 that potentially alter binding to the SH2 domains examined, which are all provided as resources. Along the way, they made interesting observations (e.g., mutations on RET and PTEN predicted to enhance tyrosine phosphorylation). Lastly, the authors utilized Amber codon suppression to incorporate non-canonical and PTM amino acids into their displayed peptides. They then showed that the SRC kinase prefers to phosphorylate tyrosine substrates nearby acetylated lysines versus unmodified lysines. This was perhaps to be expected, considering that SRC and many other tyrosine kinases generally disfavor positively charged amino acids, but it also highlights the interesting possibility of this form of PTM crosstalk between metabolism and growth factor signaling.</p><p>1. Concerning the peptide design in their random library (sequence: X5-Y-X5, where X = 20 natural amino acids falling within their 'NNS' codon constraint), neighboring tyrosines (TAC codons) theoretically account for ~3% (1/32) of residues at all random positions, meaning that as much as 30% of the peptide pool contains at least two potential tyrosine phosphoacceptors per peptide. For the heatmap motifs presented in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 4âfigure supplement 5, and Figure 7, we can observe strong enrichment of tyrosines at multiple positions, especially for JAK2 and the RTKs, and it is not certain whether this is due to positional selection (that facilitates phosphorylation of the tyrosine at position zero) or direct phosphorylation of the neighboring tyrosine. This double phosphorylation effect may limit interpretation of the motif heatmaps presented in the figures that assume phosphorylation occurs only at the tyrosine at position zero. Have the authors considered generating separate heatmaps that omit the subset of enriched peptides containing two or more tyrosines? That might reduce background and further improve the quality of the data.</p><p>2. Figure 6B: Given that the authors have demonstrated essentially complete phosphorylation of the displayed peptides by their kinase cocktail in Figure 6âfigure supplement 2, it seems more appropriate to replace the label above the heatmaps in 6B &quot;position relative to tyrosine&quot; with &quot;position relative to phosphotyrosine&quot;. Moreover, this indicates that they have probably phosphorylated most of the neighboring tyrosines in the displayed peptides containing two or more tyrosines. How would the heatmap motifs for the SH2 domains appear if the authors excluded the subset of enriched peptides containing two or more (likely to be phosphorylated) tyrosines?</p><p>3. The authors have not included a single sequence logo to represent their phosphorylation site motifs or pY binding motifs. Is there a specific reason for this? Researchers less familiar with these approaches generally have an easier time interpreting sequence logos than heatmaps.</p><p>4. An advantage of the authors' platform over alternative approaches is its potential to decipher pairwise interactions between amino acids on substrate peptides. The authors report that, depending on the kinase, 5-15% of all significant mutations in the pTyr-Var screen (which are pairwise comparisons of single substitutions in fixed sequences) had the opposite effect of predictions from the randomized library (ensembles). And indeed, the correlation plots in Figure 5 âfigure supplement 1 show quite a bit of scattering and hence negatively correlated sites between their predictions and their results. The authors explored one example of this for SRC, which preferred proline over serine at -2 in the randomized library, yet it more efficiently phosphorylated a site containing -2 serine versus proline in the context of the sequence XEYSFK, where X is the substituted position. Interestingly, this is the opposite effect of what has been previously published and referred to by the authors for EGFR, where -2 proline was preferred over serine in the context of -1 acidic residues (Cantor et al. 2018), indicating that these pairwise rules may not only be unique to specific kinase groups but mutually exclusive between different groups. Are the authors able to identify kinase-specific trends from their datasets for the pairwise selection of amino acids at positions -1 and -2 that negatively correlate with predictions?</p><p>5.

Furthermore, in the data analysis pipeline for any library used with our platform, sequences containing cysteine residues or multiple tyrosine residues can trivially be filtered out prior to calculating enrichment values.

As the authors showed, the method will be useful for studying the influence of neighboring modified amino acids on TK phosphosite selectivity. Indeed, it is already known that pTyr can serve as a positive determinant for TK phosphorylation. Presumably, it was for this reason that the authors tested whether incorporation of CMF, a pTyr mimic, at different positions affected the ability of the c-Src kinase to phosphorylate preferrred sequences. However, CMF is not a very good pTyr mimic, and if the authors wanted to determine possible roles for pTyr itself they should have used one of the recently described methods for incorporating pTyr as an unnatural amino acid into proteins expressed in bacteria (e.g., PMID: 28604693; PMID: 28604697).</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we did not use CMF for the purposes of studying phospho-priming. CMF was used to show that non-canonical amino acids could be incorporated in our screens. We agree that if we were to study the possible roles of phosphotyrosine on substrate specificity, the most ideal amino acid would be phosphotyrosine itself. To avoid confusion, we no longer refer to CMF as a âphosphotyrosine analogâ in the main text. Furthermore, the studies mentioned by the reviewer would definitely be a useful starting point for incorporating phosphotyrosine (or its analogs) into our libraries. The method in PMID 28604697 may prove challenging, as it requires a chemical transformation that is not likely to be tolerated by <italic>E. coli</italic>.

For the Src-family kinases, under the screening conditions used, the kinase domains rapidly autophosphorylate. This is not likely to be true for c-Abl or AncSZ, but these kinases showed sufficient activity without pre-activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is not clear why the surface display method should be &quot;tuned to select a high Kcat&quot;.

Furthermore, we note that the <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5a strain does not secrete a nonspecific phosphatase. We use sodium orthovanadate to inhibit any residual tyrosine phosphatase, YopH, from co-expression with the tyrosine kinase. While our purification methods remove any detectable amounts of YopH, orthovanadate is added as a precaution. This is a standard practice for many tyrosine kinase activity assays.

This difference in the antibody used may account for why we see less of an exclusive preference for +1 Gly. Regardless, we have characterized sequences with a change in the +1 position, and the effects on kinetic activity are marginal (Table 1). We also note this broader +1 preference has been observed for c-Src previously (PMID: 29547119). These experiments collectively suggest that the +1 Gly preference for c-Src is not as exclusive as previously observed using oriented peptide libraries.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82345-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 2B and Figure 2S1: Src, Abl, EPHB1 and EPHB2 all showed a preference in their display consensus for Pro at +4. While a preference for Pro at +4 is observed in natural Src and Abl substrates, one wonders whether this is a hidden constraint/bias of the method. In addition, the +2 â +4 WWW motif preferred by Fer is curious. Are there any reported (Fer) TK sites with this WWW motif, and does the closely related Fes TK also exhibit this preference? No Trp residues are found in the PhosphoSitePlus motif logo for Fer. Do these Trp residues contribute to the low Î¼M Km for the Fer consensus peptide? Can the WWW peptide be modeled into the active site of the FES TK catalytic domain? Finally, in this regard, it would help the reader if this panel included -5 to +5 numbering under the alignment.</p></disp-quote><p>The observation about the +4 Pro is very interesting. We do not know if this is a hidden bias/constraint of the method, but we do note that Pro is not the most preferred amino acid at the +4 position for every kinase tested (see Fer in the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library screens, and this can be seen for other kinases from the pTyr-Var screens). To our knowledge, the +2 to +4 WWW motif preferred by Fer has not been reported elsewhere, nor does it appear to be a feature of the few reported natural Fer substrates. The tryptophan residues seem to be contributing to high binding affinity (low K<sub>M</sub>), but this might manifest in two different ways that warrant a follow-up study: (1) For Fer, specifically, there is very strong +2 Trp enrichment, and this is also seen in the pTyr-Var library, where +2 Trp sequences are uniquely enriched for Fer. (2) It appears that downstream Trp residues show moderate enrichment for many of the kinases tested against both libraries, particularly at +3 and +4 positions. While this could be an artifact of the screens, indirect evidence suggests that these Trp residues actually contribute to substrate binding. For example, when the Fer consensus peptide is measured against c-Src, we observe a low K<sub>M</sub> value (12 Î¼M), similar to that of Fer (8 Î¼M). This is much tighter than the Src consensus peptide (196 Î¼M). However, the k<sub>cat</sub> value for the Fer consensus peptide with c-Src is much lower than that of the Src consensus peptide (0.74 s<sup>-1</sup> vs 4.9 s<sup>-1</sup>). Additionally, at low substrate concentrations, the Fer consensus peptide appears to be the preferred substrate for EPHB1, of the consensus peptides tested. These observations point to a potential role for Trp residues in enhancing kinase-substrate interactions in a productive way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The SRC consensus has a preferred Cys at -2, which was not discussed â do the authors know whether this Cys was oxidized on the bacterial surface. If so, it could have provided a partial negative charge and serve a similar purpose to the -2 Glu in SrcTide. How important is the -2 Cys in the synthetic peptide substrates?</p></disp-quote><p>We expect that the cysteine is predominately reduced in our screening conditions due to the addition of TCEP. In regards to the importance of the -2 cysteine, we have synthesized variants of the Src consensus peptide in which the cysteine was replaced with an aspartate and did not see a substantial effect on the catalytic activity. Additionally, with the recent revisions, we measured the activity of the Src consensus peptide with a -2 proline using the RP-HPLC assay and observed activity comparable to that seen for the original Src consensus. Therefore, we do not think the -2 cysteine plays a critical role for c-Src, but we also do not think that its enrichment is due to oxidation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 2C: The authors' data showed that EPHB1 displayed little selectivity across the consensus peptides and did not even prefer its own cognate consensus sequence. Moreover, although they did not comment on this, the same seems to be true for EPHB2. The basis for this lack of selectivity needs fuller discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>It was surprising to us that both EPHB1 and EPHB2 displayed little selectivity across the consensus peptides. It is unclear why this is the case for EPHB1, however, upon closer inspection, we find that EPHB2 actually does show some selectivity. This was difficult to see in our original figures, where data for every kinase was displayed on an absolute scale. We have reformatted those graphs so that the data for each kinase is normalized to its own consensus peptide. Now, we can see that EPHB2 actually phosphorylates its own consensus, and the c-Abl consensus, preferentially over the other three peptides. Notably, the c-Abl and EPHB2 peptides are very similar, as noted in the main text.</p><p>We also wondered if our poor consensus designs for EPHB1/2 might reflect some unfavorable coupling between the most enriched amino acids in the position-weighted scoring matrices. To test this, we looked at the EPHB2 consensus sequence and calculated the enrichment scores of every possible residue pair in that sequence from data generated in the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> screen. Based on this analysis, we observed that the -3 Glu sequences were enriched overall, but were distinctly depleted in the context of a +1 Glu. Thus, we modified the -3 position in EPHB2 sequence to an apparently more favorable residue in the +1 Glu context, a tryptophan. Measurement of the activity of EPHB2 against this peptide showed an enhancement of activity with the -3 Glu to Trp substitution. This suggests that the combination of the most favorable amino acids in each position does not always yield the best substrate. Finally, although this is an enticing approach to sequence design, we hope that the reviewers appreciate that we are still developing this idea and an in-depth exposition of this approach is out of the scope of this manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82345-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

Furthermore, this mutational effect is conserved for Src, <italic>FGFR1</italic>, FGFR3, and MERTK in another peptide: CRYAA_Y48, and Src and MERTK in the peptide U2SURP_Y634. This might be due to the removal of an unfavorable positive charge from the +1 Arg, coupled with the other favorable sequence features in the resulting peptide. It is also possible that other mutations to +1 Arg, such as Ser, could show the same enhancement, but these other substitutions are not represented in our pTyr-Var library. Due to the addition of new data from revision experiments, we have moved the Ret Y981 panel to a figure supplement.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82345-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. While the authors showed that unnatural amino acids incorporation is compatible with the surface display method, only those modified amino acids for which a cell-permeant modified amino acid and a cognate tRNA charging enzyme have been developed can readily be used. In contrast, any modified amino acid can be used in the position-oriented peptide display approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a limitation to the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids in the peptide display platform.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors appear to focus on justifying how their platform identifies the same specificity profiles as previous methods when it is more important to highlight the differences and discuss what they mean. While it is challenging to verify whether the specificity profiles obtained from the current study are closer to the physiological specificity of the TKs/SH2s, it'd be helpful to use the specificity information to predict in vivo substrates and to find out how many known substrates can be identified and how many are missed. After all, the specificity profile is valuable only when it can predict in vivo targets and the effect of mutations on TK/SH2-target interaction (the authors are to be commended for doing a decent job on the latter).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we compared a curated list of reported kinase-substrate pairs from the PhosphositePlus database with our screening results. Although there is not a lot of overlap between our library and the substrates reported in this curated list, we were able to compare dozens of sequences for c-Src, Abl, and Fyn. Based on this analysis, we find that approximately ~30-40% of the reported substrates are efficiently phosphorylated in our screen (cSrc: 26/79, c-Abl: 8/21, Fyn: 6/17). This disparity is not surprising because we know there are other mechanisms for gaining kinase specificity and the curated list may not accurately represent bona-fide substrates for each kinase. We have added this discussion to the main text and added this annotated list to Figure 4-source data 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A systematic comparison of the context-independent specificity (obtained from the X5-Y-X5 library) with context-dependent effect (obtained from the pTyr-var library) is missing. It would be important to systematically compare the specificity profiles obtained from the two libraries and identify the common and distinct features (and explain why).</p></disp-quote><p>The position-specific amino acid preferences obtained using both libraries are very similar, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>. Importantly, those residues that are significantly enriched or depleted in one library show the same effect in the other library, and there are generally very few outlier features for the five kinases tested. While we can observe specific cases where amino acid substitutions have a context-dependent effect, as shown in Figure 5 and discussed in the associated text, the pTyr-Var library does not sample a large enough number of these mutations to extract specific rules. We can envision future experiments that focus on a small number of cognate sequences for each kinase, where libraries of single, double, and triple mutant peptides could be screened to dissect the rules for sequence context dependence.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82345-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The platform seems to work better for certain TKs (eg., Src, Abl) than others (eg., EphB1/B2). Is this due to the distinct specificity of these kinases or differences in enzymatic activity? In this regard, how is the activity of the TKs benchmarked?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not base the success of our platform for each kinase on whether we were able to obtain good selectivity for its consensus sequence. As mentioned earlier, we could not determine the best consensus sequences for EPHB1 and EPHB2 potentially due to unfavorable coupling between amino acid residues in those sequences. We believe our platform worked just as well for EPHB1/2 as the other TKs because we obtained a distinct specificity profile for EPHB1/2 which showed concordance between the two libraries tested. This is further supported by the fact that the two enzymes have very similar specificity (as expected for close paralogs), and that these enzymes showed distinct specificity when compared with other families of TKs. Finally, the activity of each TK was benchmarked by monitoring library phosphorylation rates using flow cytometry under a standardized set of conditions. We adjusted the concentration of each tyrosine kinase so that the phosphorylation levels of the libraries were similar to what we had achieved with c-Src. We chose c-Src as a reference point because much of the methods development and validation was done using c-Src.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. By the same token, what's the affinity of an SH2 domain used in the study for its cognate ligand? It should also be discussed/justified in more detail why the SHP2-C SH2 domain was picked when the tandem SH2 domains in SHP2 often work together in ligand recognition.</p></disp-quote><p>The affinity of an SH2 domain for one of its cognate ligands is usually in the nM range, however this value can vary from single-digit to triple-digit nM. For c-Src, for which validation experiments were shown in Figure 6, the âcognateâ ligand that was fluorescently labeled for competition binding assays had a K<sub>D</sub> of 160 nM. For SHP2, while we acknowledge that the tandem SH2 domains do work together in ligand recognition, there is a benefit to studying the specificity of the SH2 domains independently. There is evidence that the C-SH2 domain of SHP2 can act independently of the N-SH2 domain. For example, the C-SH2 domain of SHP2 can bind one phosphosite on PD1 with high affinity (13 nM), driving SHP2 localization to PD1, whereas the N-SH2 domain of SHP2 binds ligands (e.g. other sites on PD1) with weaker affinity (2 Î¼M) to drive phosphatase activation (see PMID: 32064351). This is in contrast to the more tightly-coupled tandem SH2 domains, such as those in ZAP-70 and Syk, where there is more interdependence. A follow up study to further disentangle the functional importance of SHP2 N- and C-SH2 specificity is currently underway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The manuscript would be significantly improved if one or more novel sites/substrates predicted using the specificity data are validated on the peptide and protein level.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewerâs comment and we attempted to validate the phosphorylation of a near-full-length version of SHP2 by c-Src, Fyn, and <italic>FGFR1</italic>. In this context, we also tested whether the mutational effects of D61V and D61N in our screen could be observed in the context of the full length protein. We have included these experiments in our manuscript (Figure 4F and Figure 4âfigure supplement 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The heatmaps (eg., Figure 5-SI5) look similar at a glance. Is there another way to present the data and show the differences in specificity in a more conspicuous manner? Bar graph â which is more tedious- may be a better choice especially for important positions. Grouping residues based on their physiochemical properties may also simplify the profile pattern and make it easier to read and understand.</p></disp-quote><p>For the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> datasets, we added sequence logos to the figure supplements to accompany heatmaps. We have chosen not to change the pTyr-Var data visualization to logos, both for space considerations, and because we feel that they reflect the data more clearly. We note that the amino acids in our heatmaps have already been ordered in one way that correlates with their physiochemical properties.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The inclusion of Tyr in the X positions of the X5-Y-X5 library may obscure the specificity patter as Tyr at any position may be phosphorylated. I'd suggest repeating a couple of TKs using a library that contains only a central Tyr.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the inclusion of non-central tyrosines could have potentially obscured the specificity patterns. We re-analyzed our data by filtering out peptides with more than one tyrosine residue. We see that the specificity patterns are retained for each tyrosine kinase. This is now reflected in the main text and in figure supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The AA read counts (eg. Figure S1) varied widely, why? Does this have an effect on the screening?</p></disp-quote><p>The variance in read counts are primarily dependent on the quality of the uniformity of the degenerate oligonucleotide mixtures used to construct the library, but they also reflect codon redundancy in an NNS context (some amino acids are still encoded by 2 or 3 codons). The amino acid read counts for each position can be measured with high reproducibility (see the revised Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). The range of frequency values are also narrow; almost all position-specific amino acid frequencies within 5-fold of the mean value (see the revised Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). The variation in read counts does not have an effect on the screen because we normalize our read counts in a selected sample with that of an unselected (input) sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 5-SI1, provide correlation coefficient; why is the apparent correlation for Abl poorer compared to EphB1 when the former appears to have a more defined specificity pattern?</p></disp-quote><p>The correlation coefficient has been included in the revised figure (now Figure 5-supplement figure 2). We do not know exactly why the apparent correlation for Abl is poorer compared to the other tyrosine kinases. We speculate that inter-residue coupling may play more of a role in the mutational effects observed in the screen than the other tyrosine kinases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 6 â SI6 â The orthogonal specificity pattern for the CTK kinase and SH2 domains seems at odds with the established notion that the CTK kinase and SH2 domain specificities are related., eg, the pTyr sites created by the kinase are preferably bound by its own SH2 domain or closely related SH2 domains (Songyang et al. Nature 1995; 373:536-9). This needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We were also initially surprised by the orthogonality in specificity between the kinase and SH2 domain of c-Src, based on the mentioned Songyang et al. paper. However, we noticed our c-Src kinae and SH2 domain specificity patterns matched previously reported data (see the Scansite database). The major difference for c-Src appears to be that the kinase domain prefers a +3 Phe, whereas the SH2 domain prefers a +3 aliphatic residue. By contrast, much of the old data in this field focused on c-Abl, where both the kinase and SH2 domains have a distinctive +3 Pro preference. This is now explicitly addressed in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Manuscript presentation:</p><p>1. The introduction provides an overview of existing methods for determining kinase specificity. However, the authors neglect to mention a couple of approaches that arguably best rival methods employed in the current manuscript from the standpoint of identifying context-dependent selectivity. These include MS-based approaches that use proteome-derived peptide libraries, from either protease digests of cell lysates or genetically encoded libraries (the cited Barber et al. paper is mischaracterized as performing analysis on cell lysates, and these papers were not cited: Kettenbach, et al. PMID: 22633412, Douglass et al. PMID: 22723110, Imamura et al. PMID: 24869485 and Xue, et al. PMID: 22451900). In addition, an approach using yeast surface display in which Tyr kinases are targeted to the secretory pathway deserves mention (Taft et al. PMID: 31339688). The authors could also consider less extensive referencing of historical methods from the 1990s that are no longer used.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript was edited to include the relevant citations and also omit a few older ones. We have also altered the phrasing describing the Barber et al. to indicate that some of these studies have been done using purified genetically-encoded peptide libraries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data availability:</p><p>2. I could not find the deep sequencing data for kinase selections of the X5-Y-X5 library.

A cutoff for the number of read counts was not included in the analysis of the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library. When sequencing, we aimed for around a million reads per sample and that determined the number of read counts for each amino acid in our analysis. You can see an example of the read counts per amino acid per position in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, which shows thousands of reads per feature (except at the central tyrosine, where other amino acids were omitted by design).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Technical points:</p><p>3. Two versions of the X5-Y-X5 library were made â one with a strep tag and one with a myc tag. Were both subjected to quality control sequencing as shown in Figure 1 supp 1, and which is shown in the table? Were both of them used for screens?</p></disp-quote><p>Both the myc and strep-tag versions of the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> libraries were sequenced for quality control and were found to be comparable in quality. The data shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 was obtained using the strep-tag library. For the kinase domain screens, we used the myc-tagged X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library to avoid any potential background binding between strep-tag and avidin bead. We used the strep-tagged library for the SH2 domain screens since our protocol was modified so that the avidin beads were already saturated with SH2 domains, although both libraries work fine in this format.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is not clear that the authors estimated the representation of the X5-Y-X5 library other than from the standpoint of pooled representation of each residue at each position (&quot;1-10 million unique peptide sequences&quot; were observed by sequencing). How many transformants were recovered during library cloning, and how does this compare to the number of sequencing reads used for quality control?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our estimations, we recovered ~40,000,000 transformants for the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library during library screening. We get ~1,000,000 reads per sample by deep sequencing, which does not cover the number of possible sequences in the library. While each replicate samples a different subset of the library, we find that the distribution of amino acid frequencies is conserved across replicates (see the correlation graph in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 for an example). The way we have estimated the total sequence diversity of the library is through an analysis of the unique sequences observed across all of our input and selected sequencing runs. Over the course of dozens of sequencing runs with the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library, we have observed roughly 10 million unique translated sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Selection of Tyr residues from the X5-Y-X5 library are likely due to &quot;off target&quot; phosphorylation of the non-central residue. This could muddy the specificity analysis as there would contribution of other selected residues at the &quot;wrong&quot; positions. For the Tyr-Var library, the authors avoided this issue by including Tyr to Phe substitutions. Do any of the results for X5-Y-X5 change if they exclude all peptides with Tyr at a non-central position?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the responses to previous reviewersâ comments, we amended our X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> analysis to exclude peptides with tyrosines at non-central positions. We observed that this amendment of our analysis did not significantly alter the specificity profiles obtained for each kinase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Based on the concentration bacterial cells used in the kinase reactions, it seems likely that the authors are observing single turnover rather than multiple turnover kinetics. This could explain some of the differences between the results described here and prior analyses with the same kinases. Can the authors estimate the effective substrate concentration in their experiments? Can they comment on the potential impact of single vs multiple turnover kinetics on their results?</p></disp-quote><p>We have also suspected that the concentration of bacterial cells might dictate what the resulting consensus sequences are and how they differ from other reported consensus sequences. In the past, we have conducted experiments with the library at ~10-fold lower cell densities and do not see a major difference in specificity. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve higher cell densities. In our experiments, the cells are approximately at an OD600 of 1, which equates to round 10<sup>9</sup> cells/mL (1-2 pM cells). Even at a surface display density of 1,000 or 10,000 molecules per cell, this could put the kinase (500 nM) in excess of substrate, putting us in a single-turnover regime. Notably, both the kinase and substrate concentrations are significantly below typical tyrosine kinase-substrate K<sub>M</sub> values. Taken together, it might be the case that our screens are reporting on sequence parameters that dictate enzyme-substrate complex formation and the phosphoryl transfer reaction, but not product release, which is critical for a high k<sub>cat</sub> value. Strangely, our Src consensus peptide has a higher k<sub>cat</sub> value than previously reported SrcTide peptides, although it is unclear if those peptides were designed from screens done in the single- or multi-turnover regime.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. For Tyr kinases that were analyzed with both libraries, how do the specificity matrices derived from the Tyr-Var data (Figure 4 â Figure supp 5) compare to those from the X5-Y-X5 data (Figure 1B and Figure 2A)?</p></disp-quote><p>For each kinase analyzed, specificity profiles obtained from both the pTyr-Var and the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> datasets were similar (Figure 1B, 2A, Figure 4âfigure supplement 5). A comparison of the position-specific amino acid enrichments from each library, excluding multi-Tyr sequences, is shown above, in response to another reviewer. In the manuscript, we chose to emphasize the specificity profile obtained using the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library because the amino acid composition of the peptides in this library is not biased. In contrast, the amino acid composition of peptides in the pTyr-Var library is constrained by the ~10,000 sequences derived from the human proteome. So, we reason that any discrepancies in the specificity profiles between the pTyr-Var and X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library may be due to biases from the pTyr-Var library itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The observation that there is context dependence â the impact of a given amino acid substitution differs depending on the surrounding sequence â is not surprising given the author's previous work. However, the specific example shown here should be interpreted with caution, as undersampling may impact what is construed to be the &quot;average&quot; signal in the X5-Y-X5 library. It would be most convincing if there were examples where the impact of a given amino acid substitution were observed on two different peptide sequences, i.e. where enrichment scores for both the &quot;WT&quot; and variant sequence could be calculated. One would also want to see some verification by in vitro kinase assay that the same substitution caused different effects on reaction rates in the context of two different peptides.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the specific example in our paper would be most convincing if we observed the opposite effect of the same amino acid substitution in a different sequence context. To address this, we made -2 proline and -2 serine mutations to the Src consensus peptide sequence and tested the activity of Src against these peptides. We found that the mutations had the same effect to what we would have predicted from the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library and this effect is opposite to what we observed in our specific example. This new data can be found in Figure 5 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Concerning the peptide design in their random library (sequence: X5-Y-X5, where X = 20 natural amino acids falling within their 'NNS' codon constraint), neighboring tyrosines (TAC codons) theoretically account for ~3% (1/32) of residues at all random positions, meaning that as much as 30% of the peptide pool contains at least two potential tyrosine phosphoacceptors per peptide. For the heatmap motifs presented in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 4âfigure supplement 5, and Figure 7, we can observe strong enrichment of tyrosines at multiple positions, especially for JAK2 and the RTKs, and it is not certain whether this is due to positional selection (that facilitates phosphorylation of the tyrosine at position zero) or direct phosphorylation of the neighboring tyrosine. This double phosphorylation effect may limit interpretation of the motif heatmaps presented in the figures that assume phosphorylation occurs only at the tyrosine at position zero. Have the authors considered generating separate heatmaps that omit the subset of enriched peptides containing two or more tyrosines? That might reduce background and further improve the quality of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>The strong enrichment of tyrosines at multiple positions, especially for JAK2 and the RTKs, could potentially be evidence for phospho-priming. This has also been observed in past screens with another receptor kinase, EGFR (PMIDs: 26551075, 30012625). As mentioned in the response to previous reviewersâ comments, we amended our X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> analysis to exclude peptides with tyrosines at non-central positions (figure supplements associated with Figures 1 and 2). This amendment of our analysis did not significantly alter the specificity profiles obtained for each kinase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 6B: Given that the authors have demonstrated essentially complete phosphorylation of the displayed peptides by their kinase cocktail in Figure 6âfigure supplement 2, it seems more appropriate to replace the label above the heatmaps in 6B &quot;position relative to tyrosine&quot; with &quot;position relative to phosphotyrosine&quot;. Moreover, this indicates that they have probably phosphorylated most of the neighboring tyrosines in the displayed peptides containing two or more tyrosines. How would the heatmap motifs for the SH2 domains appear if the authors excluded the subset of enriched peptides containing two or more (likely to be phosphorylated) tyrosines?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have replaced the label on the heatmaps in Figure 6B with âposition relative to phosphotyrosine.â We also constructed the heatmap profiles of the SH2 domains with the exclusion of peptides with non-central tyrosine residues and saw no difference in the specificity (Figure 6-supplement figure 3). There does not appear to be any significant impact of omitting sequences with non-central tyrosine (probably phosphotyrosine) sequences from these analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors have not included a single sequence logo to represent their phosphorylation site motifs or pY binding motifs. Is there a specific reason for this? Researchers less familiar with these approaches generally have an easier time interpreting sequence logos than heatmaps.</p></disp-quote><p>The specific reason for this is that our group prefers heatmaps over logos. Nonetheless, we appreciate the reviewerâs point that others might find logos more intuitive, so we have added sequence logos for the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> screens to the figure supplements. In addition, we have provided the numerical position-weighted matrices used to make every heatmap and logo in the paper (for both libraries) as source data files, so that other researchers can render the data in the way that best suits their needs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. An advantage of the authors' platform over alternative approaches is its potential to decipher pairwise interactions between amino acids on substrate peptides. The authors report that, depending on the kinase, 5-15% of all significant mutations in the pTyr-Var screen (which are pairwise comparisons of single substitutions in fixed sequences) had the opposite effect of predictions from the randomized library (ensembles). And indeed, the correlation plots in Figure 5 âfigure supplement 1 show quite a bit of scattering and hence negatively correlated sites between their predictions and their results. The authors explored one example of this for SRC, which preferred proline over serine at -2 in the randomized library, yet it more efficiently phosphorylated a site containing -2 serine versus proline in the context of the sequence XEYSFK, where X is the substituted position. Interestingly, this is the opposite effect of what has been previously published and referred to by the authors for EGFR, where -2 proline was preferred over serine in the context of -1 acidic residues (Cantor et al. 2018), indicating that these pairwise rules may not only be unique to specific kinase groups but mutually exclusive between different groups. Are the authors able to identify kinase-specific trends from their datasets for the pairwise selection of amino acids at positions -1 and -2 that negatively correlate with predictions?</p></disp-quote><p>The opposite coupling effect for Src and EGFR is a very good point. This likely reflects a combination of the different sequence specificities for Src and EGFR, coupled with differences in what kinds of peptide conformations are tolerated by each kinase. This definitely warrants a deeper structural investigation. Unfortunately, there was not enough âdepthâ across mutations and sites in the pTyr-Var library to infer any significant rules for coupling (certainly not kinase-specific rules). We did notice that many of the mutations that could not be predicted well using the X<sub>5</sub>-Y-X<sub>5</sub> library were at the -2, -1, +1 and +2 positions, further suggesting a role for local sequence context dictating peptide conformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
