In this study, we investigated if transplanted stem cells are able to rescue a glaucoma mouse model with transgenic myocilin Y437H mutation and explored the possible mechanisms. Human trabecular meshwork stem cells (TMSCs) were intracamerally transplanted which reduced mouse intraocular pressure, increased outflow facility, protected the retinal ganglion cells and preserved their function. TMSC transplantation also significantly increased the TM cellularity, promoted myocilin secretion from TM cells into the aqueous humor to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress, repaired the TM tissue with extracellular matrix modulation and ultrastructural restoration. Co-culturing TMSCs with myocilin mutant TM cells in vitro promoted TMSCs differentiating into phagocytic functional TM cells. RNA sequencing revealed that TMSCs had upregulated genes related to TM regeneration and neuroprotection. Our results uncovered therapeutic potential of TMSCs for curing glaucoma and elucidated possible mechanisms by which TMSCs achieve the treatment effect.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>trabecular meshwork</kwd><kwd>transplantation</kwd><kwd>glaucoma</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY025643</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Yiqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-EY008098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Yiqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Yiqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001607</institution-id><institution>Eye and Ear Foundation of Pittsburgh</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Yiqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stem cell transplantation reduces intraocular pressure and preserves retinal ganglion cell function in a mouse glaucoma model, which could lead to a novel therapy for glaucoma to preserve vision.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common type of glaucoma with a prevalence of 0.5â7.0% in adults, can result in damage of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and irreversible vision lossÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quigley, 2006</xref>). The progression of POAG has been demonstrated to be correlated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heijl et al., 2002</xref>), which is associated with reduced trabecular meshwork (TM) cellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarado et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarado et al., 1981</xref>), malfunction of TM phagocytosisÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buller et al., 1990</xref>) and abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gong, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keller et al., 2009</xref>).

TMSCs maintain stem cell characteristics and regenerative capacity after long-term cryopreservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>), which can be an effective source for cell-based therapy. After intracameral injection, TMSCs exhibit the preference to home to the TM region in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2013</xref>) and to laser-damaged TM tissue, which is correlated with CXCR4/SDF1 chemokine axisÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yun et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, TMSCs can improve the outflow facility in a mouse model with laser-induced TM damageÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yun et al., 2018</xref>). However, the mechanisms for TMSCs repairing the diseased TM and restoring TM function in POAG have not yet been resolved. Intriguingly, the pathogenesis of POAG is apparently different from that of laser-induced glaucomaÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liesenborghs et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, exploring the therapeutic effect of TMSCs on models of POAG and uncovering mechanisms underlying it are crucial steps for future clinical therapies for treating glaucoma.</p><p>Several factors, such as environment and genetics, have been found to contribute to the occurrence and development of POAGÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janssen et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations in the gene encoding myocilinÂ (Myoc) have been confirmed to be associated with glaucomaÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tamm, 2002</xref>) which are responsible for 4% of adult-onset POAG and 10% of juvenile-onset POAG. Although Myoc mutation glaucoma is a subtype of POAG, the pathophysiology of POAG in common is associated with reduced TM cellularity, abnormal deposition of ECM and increased IOP. Myoc mutations alter the structure of Myoc protein and result in the retention of misfolded Myoc in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of TM cells. The accumulated protein can then induce ER stress in TM cells, which is related to glaucomaÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peters et al., 2015</xref>). ER stress can also lead to TM dysfunction, abnormal synthesis and turnover of ECM and loss of RGCsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fingert et al., 2002</xref>). A mouse POAG model with transgenic-Myoc Y437H mutation (Tg-MyocY437H) closely mimics the pathophysiology of human Myoc-associated glaucomaÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zode et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zode et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we report that human TMSCs that are intracamerally transplanted to the Tg-MyocY437H POAG mice, can repopulate the TM cells, repair the abnormal TM tissue and preserve the function of RGCs. By analyzing the RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from three strains of human TMSCs and corneal fibroblasts from different donors, we have identified the expression differences for unveiling the TMSC regeneration mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TMSCs reduce IOP and increase outflow facility of the Tg-MyocY437H mice</title><p>Human TMSCs were isolated as previously describedÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yun et al., 2018</xref>) and characterized by flow cytometry to confirm the positive expression of stem cell markers CD73, CD90, CD105, CD166, and negative expression of CD34 and CD45 as previously reportedÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yun et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate therapeutic effect of TMSCs on POAG, human TMSCs at passage three or four were injected into the anterior chamber of the Tg-MyocY437H mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) when they were at age of 4 months. Age-matched wild-type (WT) mice served as control. The baseline IOP of 4-month-old Tg-MyocY437H mice was 16.5Â Â±Â 0.44 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which was significantly higher than that of WT mice (12.38Â Â±Â 0.41 mmHg, p&lt;0.0001). Tg-MyocY437H mice transplanted with TMSCs started to lower IOP from 1 month after stem cell transplantation, and IOP decreased to 13.30Â Â±Â 0.42 mmHg (Tg-TMSC) at 1 month. This was close to that in WT mice (WT, 12.30Â Â±Â 0.45 mmHg, p=0.4576). The IOP was significantly lower than IOP of Tg-MyocY437H mice without treatment (Tg, 15.23Â Â±Â 0.64 mmHg, p=0.0254) and IOP of Tg-MyocY437H mice with medium only injection (Tg-Sham, 16.00Â Â±Â 0.38 mmHg, p=0.0005). There was no statistically significant difference of IOPs between untreated (Tg, 15.23Â Â±Â 0.64 mmHg) and sham (Tg-Sham, 16.00Â Â±Â 0.38 mmHg, p=0.6715). Indeed, the IOP of Tg-MyocY437H mice at 2 months after TMSC transplantation (Tg-TMSC, 12.65Â Â±Â 0.36 mmHg) reduced to the same level as that of WT (13.03Â Â±Â 0.39 mmHg, p=0.9425) and was lower than untreated Tg-MyocY437H (Tg, 14.96Â Â±Â 0.61 mmHg, p=0.0042) and sham injected mice (Tg-sham, 15.30Â Â±Â 0.21 mmHg, p=0.0006).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transplanted TMSCs reduce the IOP and increase the outflow facility of Tg-MyocY437H mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Day-time IOP was measured in the wildtype mice (WT, n=26), Tg-MyocY437H mice (Tg, n=26), Tg mice treated with basal medium (Tg-Sham, n=26) and Tg mice with TMSC transplantation (Tg-TMSC, n=26).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and Figure 1-figure supplement 2, Tg-MyocY437H mice displayed higher outflow resistance with lower outflow facility (Tg, 0.010Â Â±Â 0.001 Î¼L/min/mmHg), while the WT mice showed higher outflow facility (WT, 0.017Â Â±Â 0.001 Î¼L/min/mmHg, p=0.0219). Tg-MyocY437H mice with TMSC transplantation for 2 months showed a significant facilitated outflow (Tg-TMSC, 0.016Â Â±Â 0.002 Î¼L/min/mmHg) as compared to untreated (Tg, 0.010Â Â±Â 0.001 Î¼L/min/mmHg, p=0.0487) and medium injected Tg-MyocY437H mice (Tg-Sham, 0.009Â Â±Â 0.005 Î¼L/min/mmHg, p=0.029). This confirms that TMSCs reduced IOP via improvement of the TM-Schlemmâs canal conventional outflow pathway.</p><p>Since corneal thickness can affect the accuracy of IOP measurement, anterior OCT was adopted to evaluate the thickness of the cornea, and this revealed that the corneas had the same thickness among all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>). Anterior synechia, which is an important factor for assessing the efficacy and side effect of stem cell transplantation, was not found by OCT examination in the mice with intracameral injection of TMSCs or sham (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TMSCs prevent the RGC loss and preserve the RGC function of the Tg-MyocY437H mice</title><p>Preservation and rescuing of RGC function is the goal for the treatment of POAG, so evaluating the function of RGCs is critical in assessing the therapeutic effect of TMSCs on POAG. We used the Celeris (Diagnosys LLC) to examine the pattern electroretinogram (PERG), an optimal approach to detect RGC function. In PERG by Celeris, the P1 amplitude represents the RGC function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref>). WT mice at 6 month of age had the P1 amplitude at 10.84Â Â±Â 0.86 ÂµV in the PERG recording, while 39.4% of the RGC function was lost in 6-mongth old Tg-MyocY437H mice as calculated with the PERG (Tg, P1Â =Â 6.56Â Â±Â 0.63 ÂµV, p=0.0001). Two months after TMSC transplantation, nearly 90% of the RGC function of the Tg-MyocY437H mice was preserved (Tg-TMSC, P1Â =Â 9.20Â Â±Â 0.45 ÂµV; WT, P1Â =Â 10.84Â Â±Â 0.86 ÂµV, p=0.1934) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref>).

Specifically, transplantation of TMSCs reduced the IOP, increased the outflow facility, restored the RGC function with significantly improved pattern ERG and preserved the RGCs. With TMSC transplantation, the TM cellularity in the Tg-MyocY437H mice dramatically increased and the ECM components fibronectin and elastin dramatically reduced in comparison with untreated and sham injected Tg-MyocY437H mice. Although ER stress marker expression in the TM tissue was not significantly reduced after TMSC transplantation, the secreted Myoc into the aqueous humor was significantly increased, while non-secreted Myoc in the TM tissue was decreased to normal range compared to untreated and sham-treated Tg-MyocY437H mice. In vitro co-culturing study indicated that TMSCs could differentiate into Dex-responsive TM cells with phagocytic function in the presence of normal TM cells or transduced TM cells with Myoc Y437H mutation. The TMSCs did not reverse ER stress of cultured MyocY437H mutant TM cells in the co-culture platform. RNAseq analysis showing upregulation of genes related to TM regeneration including maintenance of TM integrity, motility, and ECM interaction in TMSCs as compared to fibroblasts might explain that TMSCs induce regeneration in the Tg-MyocY437H mice via modulation of ECM, promotion of TM integrity and motility, and increasing the oxidative stress defense mechanism of TM cells. In contrast, fibroblasts having much lower expression of the abovementioned genes were unable to produce any regenerative effect as we showed previouslyÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yun et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Graphical abstract.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63677-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our previous studies have shown that the response to ER stress inducers is different between TMSCs and TM cellsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and TMSCs can differentiate into TM cells after homing in and retained in normal TM of WT miceÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2013</xref>) and in the laser-damaged TM for regenerationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yun et al., 2018</xref>). However, the microenvironment for the stem cells such as oxygen concentration, PH value, osmotic pressure, proteases and cytokines, all affects the maintenance, survival, and regeneration properties of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Urban, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wuertz et al., 2008</xref>). It was therefore crucial to confirm whether TMSCs could convert to the TM cells in the Tg-MyocY437H mice with ER stress in the TM tissue. We demonstrated that TMSCs could differentiate into TM cells expressing the TM cell marker CHI3L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) and possessed phagocytic ability 10 days after co-culturing with the transduced Myoc Y437H mutant TM cells. Phagocytic function of TM cells is responsible for ECM turnover and maintenance of the outflow pathway by removing cell debris, which is crucial for regulation of IOP. Moreover, the differentiated TMSCs were responsive to dexamethasone treatment with increased expression of Myoc, one of the important characteristics of TM cellsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keller et al., 2018</xref>). It indicates that TMSCs can successfully differentiate to functional TM cells under ER stress condition.</p><p>The homeostasis of the TM tissue is known to be important for maintaining IOP in the normal rangeÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vranka et al., 2015</xref>). Some pathological stimuli can elevate IOP by breaking down TM ECM homeostasis, which results in the excessive accumulation of ECM composition and insufficient degradation of ECM in the TM tissue, thereby decreasing the outflow facilityÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acott and Kelley, 2008</xref>). ER stress arising from mutant Myoc aggregates in the ER can destroy assembly procedures of ECM proteins in the TM cells. The ECM components, such as fibronectin, elastin, and collagen IV were increased in the TM tissue due to abnormal ER function and pathological cellular status in the Tg-MyocY437H miceÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasetti et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, excessive ECM can aggravate ER stress in the TM cells, which can form a negative feedback to keep the chronic ER stress existing in the Tg-MyocY437H miceÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kasetti et al., 2017</xref>). We found that transplantation of TMSCs can reverse the expression of fibronectin and elastin to the normal levels in the Tg-MyocY437H mouse TM tissue. Although the reduction of ER stress marker expression after TMSC transplantation was not significant, the expression levels of Myoc reduced in the TM tissue and increased in the aqueous humor, and a large number of cells displayed normal ultrastructure without swollen ER in the TM region of the Tg-MyocY437H mice with TMSC transplantation. These observations suggest that differentiated healthy TM cells from TMSCs replaced the mutant TM cells and remodeled the ECM, improved the function of the diseased TM tissue, which increased the outflow facility and reduced IOP. A previous reportÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) indicated that transplantation of TM cells derived for iPSCs stimulated the endogenous TM cells to proliferate to increase the TM cellularity and reduce IOP. Although the cells and underlying mechanisms for the treatment in their study are different from ours, increased amount of TM cells was found in both studies. It indicates that restoration of TM cellularity and remodeling of the TM ECM are crucial for cell-based therapy for glaucoma.</p><p>Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to reduce IOP in a laser-induced rat glaucoma modelÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manuguerra-GagnÃ© et al., 2013</xref>). The activation of progenitor cells in the ciliary body which can migrate and differentiate into TM cells in the damaged tissue might be induced by laser photocoagulation or injected cells. Further research is needed to elucidate whether TMSCs can recruit the endogenous stem cells to synergistically repair the TM tissue.</p><p>Loss of RGCs is responsible for the impairment of visual field and loss of visual acuity in POAG patientsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rolle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shoji et al., 2017</xref>). Preserving the RGCs is as important as reducing IOP in treatment for glaucomaÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sena and Lindsley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stern et al., 2018</xref>). It is also a critical parameter to evaluate whether stem cell-based therapy is suitable for the management of glaucomaÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pearson and Martin, 2015</xref>). Elevation of IOP and subsequent loss of RGCs were observed in the Tg-MyocY437H miceÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zode et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, attention was also paid to the therapeutic effect of TMSCs on protection of RGC function. In this study, 90% of RGC function was saved 2 months after TMSC transplantation, while only 60% of RGC function remained in the 6-month-old Tg-MyocY437H mice without treatment as compared to age-matched WT mice. It indicates that TMSCs can prevent the RGCs from degeneration resulted from IOP elevation. Nevertheless,Â 10% loss of RGC function may be attributed to the delayed effect of TMSCs on reducing IOP in this glaucoma model, in which IOP starts to elevate from 3 months of age while TMSCs were transplanted at 4 months and the IOP reduction was observed at 5 months. Therefore, whether earlier intervention can achieve more RGC survival needs further investigation.</p><p>We previously reported that TMSCs can regenerate the damaged TM tissue while corneal fibroblasts did not repair the damaged TM tissueÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yun et al., 2018</xref>). Corneal fibroblasts did not express stem cell markers, such as NESTIN or OCT 4, which TMSCs were positive to and the fibroblasts did not home to and anchoring to the TM region after intracamerally injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xiong et al., 2020</xref>). All these suggest that TMSCs and corneal fibroblasts are distinctive in biological characteristics and behavior. Thus, we compared the transcriptomes between TMSCs and corneal fibroblasts.</p><p>Our transcriptome analysis indicates some ECM related genes and genes associated with ECM modulation pathways like PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion pathway, ECM-receptor interaction pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Villegas et al., 2013</xref>) were highly expressed in TMSCs. Whether TMSCs directly participate in ECM remodeling through aforementioned ECM related genes and pathways after transplantation remains to be elucidated. Since we detected that some TMSCs differentiated into TM cells after homing to the TM region, we speculate that both the differentiated TM cells from TMSCs and undifferentiated TMSCs participate in the TM ECM modulation. CHI3L1 has been involved in tissue remodeling and important for normal functioning of TMÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Integrins are crucial for ECM organization in the TM and help in anchoring of stem cells to the site of injury for regenerationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gagen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xiong et al., 2020</xref>). The upregulation of CHI3L1 and integrins in TMSCs as compared to fibroblasts further strengthen their regenerative role in the Tg-MyocY437H glaucoma model, although the CHI3L1 expression in TMSCs is much lower than that in TM cells.</p><p>Some of the genes which are upregulated in TMSCs have been shown to impart neuroprotective functions. CACNA1A uncovered in TMSC transcriptome (involved in dopaminergic, GABAergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic synapse) is responsible for communication between neurons by ion exchange and mutations in this gene results into neurological disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ophoff et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, KCNJ5 (GIRK2) are G-protein-gated potassium channels which are employed in control of hypothermia induced by activation of GABAergic, muscarinic, kappa opioid, adenosine, and serotonergic receptorsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costa et al., 2005</xref>). We speculate that the preservation of RGCs and their function in Tg-MyocY437H model by TMSCs is mainly due to reduced IOP, but these neuroprotective proteins through paracrine secretion by TMSCs might be also involved in the neuroprotective process. Further study is required to uncover it.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Transplanted TMSCs can integrate into the TM tissue and differentiate into functional TM cells that can repopulate the TM tissue, remodel the TM ECM, and reinstate the TM homeostasis to restore the outflow facility, eventually reducing IOP and preserving RGCs and their function in the Tg-MyocY437H mouse model of POAG. GlaucomaÂ withÂ Myoc Y437HÂ geneÂ mutation as a subtype of POAG contains common pathophysiology of POAG that is reduced TM cellularity, which causes abnormal deposition of the ECM and increases IOP and damages the RGCs. Therefore, these results open an important avenue of a novel stem-cell-based strategy to eventually treat human open-angle glaucoma.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Though both reviewers recognize the importance of this area of research, both have significant concerns regarding the quality of the data. In particular, the fate of the grafted cells, and the mechanism whereby the grafted cells achieve a therapeutic effect, has not been adequately addressed. It seems likely that revision to address these points and other key issues would likely entail very considerable experimental work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors report studies of human trabecular meshwork stem cells (TMSC) as a treatment for glaucoma in a transgenic mouse model of glaucoma caused by a myocilin mutation (Tyr437His). Tg-MyocY437H mice loose TM cells; developed reduced outflow facility and high IOP; and reduced PERG. The authors report that intracameral injection of TMSCs in these mice restores outflow facility, lowers IOP, and restores PERG. They also report that the TMSCs help to normalize secretion of Myoc. Normalization of extracellular matrix protein is also reported.</p><p>The authors report using stem cell therapy in a mouse model of glaucoma as a potential therapy for this disease, which is intriguing.

The authors should compare and contrast their findings. The Zhu study reported increased numbers of endogenous TM cells, which raises the question of whether the TMSC delivered in the current study are directly responsible for a therapeutic effect or whether they similarly induce more endogenous TM cells. Are the increased cells seen in the TM in the current study from the TMSC or proliferation of endogenous TM cells? Are they even TM cells?</p><p>2) The authors should more clearly describe and characterize the cells that they are using (TMSC and primary TM cells) to authenticate their identity (i.e. pluripotency assays and markers for TM cells like steroid induction of MYOC)</p><p>3) The authors report PERG as a surrogate for functional damage of glaucoma in the Tg-Myoc-Tyr437His mice, but RGC counts and/or optic nerve axon counts is a more standard assessment for glaucoma in mice.</p><p>4) The analysis of the RNAseq data is inadequate.

The premise is an exciting one for therapy. However, several shortcomings need to addressed before publication. Concerns and comments are listed below.</p><p>1) Please clarify mouse strains. Mouse strain C57BL/6J or N (not C57BL/6) makes a difference. What is the strain background of Tg-MyocY437H mice? Must compare within the same strain, preferably littermate given the variation of IOP, outflow, and PERG within the strain and between strains. Please report the exact p-values.</p><p>2) Day time IOP numbers between WT, Tg, and Tg-TMSC are modest at best. Tg IOP is elevated at night, according to the original paper describing the transgenic mouse. The authors should check the effect of TMSC implantation on IOP at night to claim reduction for the sake of completeness.</p><p>3) The authors should localize TMSC in the angle and demonstrate engraftment of the TM. If TMSCs are present in some other location, this should be shown as well. How can a reader know that the TMSC is even alive in the angle? Also, control should include injecting another unrelated stem cell type different from TMSC to show specificity.</p><p>4) In Figure 1D, why is the AC depth looking so different?</p><p>5) The outflow numbers are very high. The outflow number for C57Bl/6J mouse is around 3-5 nl/min/mmHg. Did the eyes dry out? Drying increases outflow during measurements.</p><p>6) For PERG, any reason why authors changed parameters from previously published numbers? Please report if there were any changes in latency.</p><p>7) In Figures 3 and 4, the sections are inferior quality. Space labeled SC is actually where the tissue has separated. The collagen IV staining does not look correct. ColIV is expected to mark the basement membrane. Why is it looking punctate? For looking at cellularity and tissue, the authors need to do a plastic section of eyes and grade the TM as in Libby (2003) 299-p1578. Hence the accuracy of the cell count is questionable. Are the position of the sections matched between the controls and the experimental eyes?</p><p>8) In Figure 4, the Myoc staining looks very different from the original 2011 Zode paper. WT Myco stain is barely visible. Please explain the discrepancy. Regarding the blot, there is a doublet in Myco blot. Which band was quantified? The same goes for panels D and F. Please show full gels for all blots, at least in supplement.</p><p>9) Please show higher magnification for ER in EM. For rigor, please quantify and report lumen size and percent of ER where lumen size changed. Again, the CHOP and GRP78 levels in the Tg animals are nowhere near as high as the Zode paper. Please explain.</p><p>10) A cartoon of co-culture technique will enhance understanding. Can the TMSC differentiate TM cells form CLANS? On this point, do the in vivo injected TMSC differentiate into TM cells? Do mouse TM cells induce human TMSC to differentiate into TM cells in vivo? (See point 3)</p><p>11) Please change &quot;three strains of TMSC&quot;. All human TMSC. Please explain why you are sequencing fibroblasts and their origin. Please explain the inconsistency of the increase of specific genes between TM1, 2, and 3. A blanket statement that ECM genes are upregulated based on the data shown in Figure 8 is unwarranted.</p><p>12) The authors have not demonstrated the claim made in conclusion i.e., TMSC differentiates into TM cells in the mouse angle after injecting the stem cells, which is the premise on which the entire paper is geared.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Stem Cell Transplantation Rescued A Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Mouse Model&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The Zhu study reported the injection of iPSC derived TM-like cells while we reported the injection of human TMSC. The cells are different. In our study, we showed that neither direct contact nor co-culture without contact of TMSC with TM cells could promote TM cells proliferation in vitro (Figure 7). In the co-culturing system, TMSC can differentiate to the cells expressing TM cell markers and responding to dexamethasone with increased myocilin expression; while TMSC cultured alone without TM cells didn't show any changes (Figure 8). In our new added Figure 4, it shows that many DiO-labeled TMSCs were integrated into the TM tissue, similar to our previous finding (Du, 2013, Yun 2018, Xiong 2020). Some of these DiO-labeled TMSCs expressed TM markers AQP1 and CHI3L1 (new added Figure 4). Our data indicate that after transplantation, the increased TM cellularity is mainly due to differentiated TM cells from TMSC, which remodeled extracellular matrix , rescued outflow facility and protected retinal ganglion cells through decreasing IOP. We have added the results in the revised manuscript and added a discussion as below:</p><p>âA previous report(Zhu et al., 2016) indicated that transplantation of TM cells derived for iPSCs stimulated the endogenous TM cell to proliferate to increase the TM cellularity and reduce IOP. Although the cells and underlying mechanisms for the treatment in their study are different from ours, increased amount of TM cells was found in both studies. It indicates that restoration of TM cellularity and remodeling of the TM ECM are crucial for cell-based therapy for glaucoma.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should more clearly describe and characterize the cells that they are using (TMSC and primary TM cells) to authenticate their identity (i.e. pluripotency assays and markers for TM cells like steroid induction of MYOC)</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We do characterization on all the TMSCs and TM cells we use. We added the following in the manuscript:</p><p>âHuman TMSCs were isolated as previously described (Yun et al., 2018) and characterized by flow cytometry to confirm the positive expression of stem cell markers CD73, CD90, CD105, CD166, and negative expression of CD34 and CD45 as previously reported(Kumar et al., 2020; Yun et al., 2018).â.</p><p>We added a new figure as Figure 7B for the TM characterization and added the related method into the Materials and methods:</p><p>âCultured TM cells were confirmed via Western blotting by their responsiveness to Dex with increased expression of Myoc (Figure 7B) after 100 nM Dex treatment for 5 days, one of the characteristics of TM cells(Keller et al., 2018).â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors report PERG as a surrogate for functional damage of glaucoma in the Tg-Myoc-Tyr437His mice, but RGC counts and/or optic nerve axon counts is a more standard assessment for glaucoma in mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We counted RGCs in the retina sections and put the data as Figure 2C. We added the description in the Materials and methods and added the results as:</p><p>âFurthermore, we counted the RGC numbers on 5-Âµm paraffin sections (Figure 2C, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1). There were 70.48Â±2.26 RGC cells/mm in the retina of 6-month old WT mice, and 49.22Â±1.79 cells/mm in that of 6-month old Tg-MyocY437H mice with RGC loss (p&lt;0.0001). The RGCs were preserved/rescued by TMSC transplantation in Tg-MyocY437H mice with the RGC number increased to 60.60Â±1.25 cells/mm (p&lt;0.0001 as compared to untreated Tg-MyocY437H mice). This confirms that TMSC transplantation prevented/rescued the RGC loss and preserved the RGC function in the Tg-MyocY437H mice.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The analysis of the RNAseq data is inadequate. Significance should be discussed in the context of multiple measures or false discovery rate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the advice. We reanalyzed the RNAseq data as new Figure 9 and edited the Discussion as:</p><p>âWe previously reported that TMSCs can regenerate the damaged TM tissue while corneal fibroblasts did not repair the damaged TM tissue(Yun et al., 2018). [â¦] We speculate that the preservation of RGCs and their function in Tg-MYOCY437H model by TMSCs is mainly due to reduced IOP, but these neuroprotective proteins through paracrine secretion by TMSCs might be also involved in the neuroprotective process. Further study is required to uncover it.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this paper, the authors use stem cell transplantation to rescue POAG.

In consistent with the day-time IOP, there was a significant difference of the baseline night IOP between 4-month old Tg-MyocY437H mice (Figure 1B, 17.73Â±2.25 mmHg) and age-matched WT mice (13.67Â±2.77 mmHg, P&lt;0.0001). 2 months after TMSC transplantation, the night IOP of Tg-MyocY437H mice (11.75Â±2.83 mmHg) reduced to the same level as that of WT mice (11.55Â±2.52 mmHg, P=0.9925).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should localize TMSC in the angle and demonstrate engraftment of the TM. If TMSCs are present in some other location, this should be shown as well. How can a reader know that the TMSC is even alive in the angle? Also, control should include injecting another unrelated stem cell type different from TMSC to show specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we showed that the injected DiO labeled TMSCs were still detectable and alive in TM region by TUNEL staining (Figure 4C) with expression of TM cell markers AQP1 and CHI3L1 (Figure 4A).</p><p>We have previously reported that intracamerally injected fibroblasts were not specifically homed to the TM region and they had gone apoptosis after transplantation (Du 2013, Yun 2018). We added the following in the Discussion:</p><p>âWe previously reported that TMSCs can regenerate the damaged TM tissue while corneal fibroblasts did not repair the damaged TM tissue(Yun et al., 2018). Corneal fibroblasts did not express stem cell markers, such as NESTIN or OCT 4, which TMSCs were positive to and the fibroblasts did not home to and anchoring to the TM region after intracamerally injection (Du et al., 2013; Xiong et al., 2020). All these suggest that TMSCs and corneal fibroblasts are distinctive in biological characteristics and behavior.â</p><p>In Discussion, we have added the following:</p><p>âRNAseq analysis showing upregulation of genes related to TM regeneration including maintenance of TM integrity, motility, and ECM interaction in TMSCs as compared to fibroblasts might explain that TMSCs induce regeneration in the Tg-MyocY437H mice via modulation of ECM, promotion of TM integrity and motility, and increasing the oxidative stress defense mechanism of TM cells. In contrast, fibroblasts having much lower expression of the abovementioned genes were unable to produce any regenerative effect as we showed previously(Yun et al., 2018).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 1D, why is the AC depth looking so different?</p></disp-quote><p>We didn't find the difference of AC depth among the groups in the OCT pictures averaged of all the eyes measured. The OCT analysis was utilized to exclude possibility of IOP elevation due to angle closure arising from TMSC transplantation or due to the central corneal depth changes. We have changed it to a more representative figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The outflow numbers are very high. The outflow number for C57Bl/6J mouse is around 3-5 nl/min/mmHg. Did the eyes dry out? Drying increases outflow during measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We were very careful to keep the eyes moisture throughout the whole perfusion and outflow facility measurement process. Outflow result in this study is consistent with our previous published studies(Zhou et al., 2020 and Yun et al, 2018)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For PERG, any reason why authors changed parameters from previously published numbers? Please report if there were any changes in latency.</p></disp-quote><p>We did PERG on the Celeris apparatus from the Diagnosys LLC and all the parameters analyzed were from the software Epsion V6 from the same company. We added this description in Materials and methods. We didnât find any latency difference between groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figures 3 and 4, the sections are inferior quality. Space labeled SC is actually where the tissue has separated. The collagen IV staining does not look correct. ColIV is expected to mark the basement membrane. Why is it looking punctate? For looking at cellularity and tissue, the authors need to do a plastic section of eyes and grade the TM as in Libby (2003) 299-p1578. Hence the accuracy of the cell count is questionable. Are the position of the sections matched between the controls and the experimental eyes?</p></disp-quote><p>We admit that plastic sections are the best for counting TM cell numbers. We sectioned the eyes with the same direction and counted the TM cells in the sections when optic nerve could be seen so the counting was in the similar position. In some of the sections, the SC space widened because of tissue processing. With the Col IV staining and the bright field images, the TM region cannot be messed up with any adjacent structures. Collagen IV stains both the basement membrane and extracellular matrix in the TM as a fibrotic marker (Vranka et al., 2015). We have changed the figures which have better quality. In Zhu et al., 2016 paper cryosection was used for immunostaining analysis including counting TM cells number. According to the published data and our experience, we believe our TM cellularity counting on the paraffin sections was accurate and plastic section is not mandatory for the TM cellularity analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 4, the Myoc staining looks very different from the original 2011 Zode paper. WT Myco stain is barely visible. Please explain the discrepancy. Regarding the blot, there is a doublet in Myco blot. Which band was quantified? The same goes for panels D and F. Please show full gels for all blots, at least in supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>In current study, Myoc staining was very weak at the TM region in the WT mice and staining intensity increased in Tg group, which was similar to the 2011 Zode paper. According to the published article(N Jacobson , M Andrews, A R Shepard et al. Non-secretion of mutant proteins of the glaucoma gene myocilin in cultured trabecular meshwork cells and in aqueous humor. Hum Mol Genet. 2001, 15;10:117-25), intracellular Myoc protein manifest as two band 55 and 57 kDa, secreted myocilin is variable seen as two bands of 53 and 55KD or single band of 53-55 kDa. We calculated the band density including both bands. Full gels for western blot were submitted for review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Please show higher magnification for ER in EM. For rigor, please quantify and report lumen size and percent of ER where lumen size changed. Again, the CHOP and GRP78 levels in the Tg animals are nowhere near as high as the Zode paper. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. For the ER size, please refer to the answer to reviewer 2âs question 2.</p><p>In Zode paper, the CHOP and GRP78 levels didn't normalized to internal control. According to gel picture in his paper, the difference of GRP78 protein level between WT and Tg group was not as obvious as CHOP level, which is similar to our result. We speculate the time of explosion while capturing picture or the picture contrast gives rise to different gel looking between ours and Zodeâs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) A cartoon of co-culture technique will enhance understanding. Can the TMSC differentiate TM cells form CLANS? On this point, do the in vivo injected TMSC differentiate into TM cells? Do mouse TM cells induce human TMSC to differentiate into TM cells in vivo? (See point 3)</p></disp-quote><p>We added cartoon to explain the co-culture technique (Figure 7C and Figure 8A). After co-culturing with myocilin mutant TM cells, TMSCs expressed TM cell markers and possessed more potent phagocytic ability, and myocilin was increased in the TMSCs after dexamethasone treatment for. In contrast, TMSCs without co-culturing didn't show aforementioned changes. We didn't examine CLAN formation in TMSC differentiated TM cells. According to the suggestion, we also confirmed that transplanted TMSCs can express AQP1 and CHI3L1 at the TM tissue two month after injection, indicating TMSCs can differentiate into TM cells in Tg mice. We can speculate mouse TM cells can stimulate human TMSC to differentiate into TM cells in vivo according to the results from in vitro study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please change &quot;three strains of TMSC&quot;. All human TMSC. Please explain why you are sequencing fibroblasts and their origin. Please explain the inconsistency of the increase of specific genes between TM1, 2, and 3. A blanket statement that ECM genes are upregulated based on the data shown in Figure 8 is unwarranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We did RNAseq on 3 strains of TMSCs and 3 strains of fibroblasts.</p><p>The fibroblast used in this study was originated from donor human cornea. We changed âfibroblastsâ as âcorneal fibroblastsâ in the manuscript and added the description in the Materials and methods:</p><p>âThree strains of cultured TMSCs and corneal fibroblasts isolated and cultured as previously described (Du et al., 2009; Yun et al., 2018) from different donors were lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen).â</p><p>We added the description in the text:</p><p>âWe previously reported that TMSCs can regenerate the damaged TM tissue while corneal fibroblasts did not repair the damaged TM tissue(Yun et al., 2018). Corneal fibroblasts did not express stem cell markers, such as NESTIN or OCT 4, which TMSCs were positive to and the fibroblasts did not home to and anchoring to the TM region after intracamerally injection (Du et al., 2013; Xiong et al., 2020). All these suggest that TMSCs and corneal fibroblasts are distinctive in biological characteristics and behavior. Thus we compared the transcriptomes between TMSCs and corneal fibroblasts.â</p><p>The RNAseq data were from different TMSCs and fibroblasts from different donors so there are variations among donors. We re-analyzed the RNAseq data and changed the Results and the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors have not demonstrated the claim made in conclusion i.e., TMSC differentiates into TM cells in the mouse angle after injecting the stem cells, which is the premise on which the entire paper is geared.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. In the revision, we have added a new Figure 4 to show the TMSCs differentiates into TM cells expressing AQP1 and CHI3L1. Please refer to the answer to the reviewer 2âs question 1.</p><p>We have reworded the conclusions in the manuscript to make it clear:</p><p>âConclusion</p><p>Transplanted TMSCs can integrate into the TM tissue and differentiate into functional TM cells that can repopulate the TM tissue, remodel the TM ECM, and restore the TM homeostasis to resolve the outflow facility, eventually reducing IOP and preserving RGCs and their function in the Tg-MyocY437H mouse model of POAG. Myoc mutation glaucoma as a subtype of POAG contains common pathophysiology of POAG that is reduced TM cellularity, which causes abnormal deposition of the ECM and increases IOP and damages the RGCs. Therefore, these results open an important avenue of a novel stem cell-based strategy to eventually treat human open-angle glaucoma.â</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 2: SC in the frozen sections is better but still does not match the quality of the image that is standard in the field.
