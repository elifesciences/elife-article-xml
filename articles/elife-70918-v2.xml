effects in other environments. These pleiotropic consequences of adaptation can influence the emergence of specialists or generalists, and are critical for evolution in temporally or spatially fluctuating environments. While many experiments have examined the pleiotropic effects of adaptation at a snapshot in time, very few have observed the dynamics by which these effects emerge and evolve. Here, we propagated hundreds of diploid and haploid laboratory budding yeast populations in each of three environments, and then assayed their fitness in multiple environments over 1000 generations of evolution. We find that replicate populations evolved in the same condition share common patterns of pleiotropic effects across other environments, which emerge within the first several hundred generations of evolution. However, we also find dynamic and environment-specific variability within these trends: variability in pleiotropic effects tends to increase over time, with the extent of variability depending on the evolution environment. These results suggest shifting and overlapping contributions of chance and contingency to the pleiotropic effects of adaptation, which could influence evolutionary trajectories in complex environments that fluctuate across space and time.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>evolutionary dynamics</kwd><kwd>pleiotropy</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014037</institution-id><institution>National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bakerlee</surname><given-names>Christopher W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bakerlee</surname><given-names>Christopher W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hanna H.

Because these mutations can also affect fitness in other environments, adaptation will tend to lead to pleiotropic fitness changes in other conditions. These pleiotropic consequences of adaptation need not be negative: evolution in one condition can lead to correlated fitness increases in similar environments as well as fitness declines in more dissimilar conditions. It is also natural to expect these consequences to vary over shorter or longer evolutionary timescales. For example, after a sufficiently long time adapting to a single condition, we might expect a population to increasingly specialize to that condition at the expense of its fitness elsewhere.</p><p>Numerous laboratory evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jerison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ostrowski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leiby and Marx, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kinsler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jasmin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Novak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper and Lenski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey and Kassen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dillon et al., 2016</xref>) as well as empirical studies of natural variation in diverse model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mackay and Huang, 2018</xref>) have analyzed the pleiotropic consequences of adaptation. These studies have found examples of specialization, as well as cases of correlated adaptation and the evolution of more generalist phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duffy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duffy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jerison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leiby and Marx, 2014</xref>). Pleiotropic fitness tradeoffs, such as those underlying specialization, can arise from either antagonistic pleiotropy (i.e., direct tradeoffs between the fitness effects of individual mutations across conditions), mutation accumulation (i.e., accumulation of mutations that are neutral in the evolution environment but impose fitness costs in other conditions), or some combination of these phenomena. More complex patterns of correlated fitness changes across conditions, such as those that underlie more generalist phenotypes, can result from more general relationships between fitness effects in different environments. Recent experimental and theoretical work has also analyzed how these distributions of mutational effects across environments can lead to an interplay between chance and contingency in determining both the typical pleiotropic consequences of adaptation and the predictability of these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jerison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardell and Kryazhimskiy, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The way in which these pleiotropic consequences of adaptation change as populations evolve is less well understood. That is, as a population adapts to a given environment, how steadily and consistently does its fitness change in alternate environments? Do these pleiotropic effects change systematically with time? For example, do fitness tradeoffs tend to become stronger the longer a population adapts to its home environment? And do the pleiotropic consequences of adaptation between replicate lines become more or less similar over time? These questions are critical both for understanding the nature of pleiotropic tradeoffs and for predicting the dynamics and outcomes of evolution in environments that fluctuate across time or space.</p><p>Previous studies have shed some light on these questions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meyer et al., 2010</xref> reported on changes in phage susceptibility over 45,000 generations of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> evolution, finding variable yet somewhat consistent trends across six evolved lines. Studying lines from the same evolution experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leiby and Marx, 2014</xref> found a patchwork of pleiotropic patterns across 12 populations assayed for growth rate in 29 environments at two timepoints. While fitness changed predictably across replicates in some environments, changes were much more variable in others, with mutation rate modifying these patterns. However, these and other studies of the evolutionary dynamics of pleiotropy have been limited to a small number of timepoints, replicate populations, or evolution and assay environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper and Lenski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Novak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey and Kassen, 2012</xref>). These limitations constrain the degree to which we can make useful inferences about how chance and contingency influence the pleiotropic consequences of adaptation, and how these consequences change over time.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we experimentally evolved hundreds of uniquely barcoded haploid and diploid yeast populations in three environments for 1000 generations. Using sequencing-based bulk fitness assays (BFAs), we assayed the fitness of each evolving population in five environments at 200-generation intervals spanning the 1000 generations of evolution. We then used the resulting data to quantify how the pleiotropic consequences of adaptation unfold in different evolution environments, along with the extent of variation among replicate populations. Our results allow us to investigate differential roles for chance and contingency over evolutionary time, with implications for the outcomes of adaptation in more complex fluctuating environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study the dynamics of the pleiotropic consequences of adaptation, we experimentally evolved 152 diploid yeast populations for about 1000 generations in one of three different environments (48 populations in rich media (YPD) at 30°C, 54 populations in YPD +0.2% acetic acid at 30 °C, and 50 populations in YPD at 37°C). We chose these environments to facilitate comparisons with previous experimental evolution studies in yeast (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nguyen Ba et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jerison et al., 2020</xref>), which have used YPD at 30 °C as a rich environment and acetic acid and high temperature to apply distinct types of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taymaz-Nikerel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giannattasio et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, we evolved 20 haploid (MATα) yeast populations in YPD at 37°C; these are a subset of populations that did not autodiploidize from a larger haploid evolution experiment (see Methods for details).</p><p>Each haploid population was founded by a single clone of a putatively isogenic laboratory strain, labeled with a unique DNA barcode at a neutral locus prior to the evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Diploid populations were founded by mating uniquely barcoded haploids and selecting for diploids. We then propagated each population for 1000 generations in batch culture, with a 1:2<sup>10</sup> dilution every 24hr; this corresponds to a population bottleneck size of 10<sup>4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; see Methods for details).

In each BFA, we pooled all populations of a given ploidy from a given generation along with a small number of common reference clones and propagated them for 50 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then sequenced the barcode locus at generations 10, 30, and 50, and we inferred the fitness of each population from the change in log frequency of each corresponding barcode. By exploiting the fact that each population is uniquely barcoded, these BFAs allowed us to estimate the fitness of all 172 populations at each of the five 200-generation intervals in each of the five environments with minimal cost and effort (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> see Methods for details).</p><p>Based on the measured fitness of the generation 0f ancestral populations, we found that some diploid populations had substantially higher ancestral fitness in certain assay environments, likely because they acquired mutations prior to the start of the evolution.

In general, these fitness changes tend to have a consistent direction over time for each environment pair. For example, populations adapted to YPD+ acetic acid and YPD at 37 °C steadily gained fitness in the YPD at 30 °C and YPD +0.4 M NaCl environments over time, with the average fitness across populations largely following the same trend seen at home: initial rapid fitness gains followed by slower increases over time. In other instances, fitness gains at home correspond to fitness declines in away environments. For example, populations evolved in YPD+ acetic acid tend to lose fitness in YPD at 21 °C. However, pleiotropic effects are less predictable than the fitness gains in the home environment: we see more variability among replicate lines in away environments, both in the shapes of their fitness trajectories and in their ultimate evolutionary outcomes (see analysis below).</p><p>To review the extent of specialization across evolution environments, we summarize the changes in fitness for populations evolved in each environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). Overall, we find that specialization is quite rare, as the majority of populations improve in fitness in each assay environment. The major exception is that a substantial fraction of populations decline in fitness at 21 °C after evolution in other conditions. Additionally, some populations evolved at 37 °C (diploid and haploid) decline in fitness in YPD+ acetic acid, and some populations evolved in YPD+ acetic acid decline in fitness at 37 °C. Importantly, even in the 21 °C environment, specialization is not inevitable, as there are indeed populations evolved in other environments that gain fitness at 21 °C.</p><p>To visualize how these pleiotropic effects change over time, we plot these fitness trajectories across pairs of environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This representation of the data shows clear but sometimes subtle differences in patterns of pleiotropy depending on evolution environment and ploidy. For instance, while almost all populations gained fitness in both YPD at 30 °C and YPD+ NaCl, the dynamics of fitness change differed based on evolution environment: populations evolved at 37 °C (orange lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) initially made substantial fitness gains in YPD+ NaCl sometimes followed by more significant gains in YPD at 30 °C, whereas the populations evolved in YPD at 30 °C (cyan lines) and YPD+ acetic acid (green lines) only gained substantial fitness in YPD+ NaCl after initial fitness increases in YPD at 30 °C (Figure 3—animation 1).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>E × E evolutionary trajectories over 1000 generations of evolution in a constant environment.</title><p>Axes correspond to fitness in the indicated assay environments.

To provide an intuition for the meaning of distance and location in this principal component space, we show home and away environment fitness trajectories for select populations indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>. The extent of evolution condition-specific clustering in this two-dimensional PCA is indicative of characteristic pleiotropic profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and it appears comparable to that observed in analyses conducted independently for generations 600, 800, and 1000. This is unsurprising given the outsized weighting of later generations in each principal component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To more formally quantify the emergence of characteristic pleiotropic profiles over time in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, we developed a simple clustering metric, which counts how many of a given population’s five nearest neighbors belong to the same evolution condition on average. We see that the degree of clustering in this two-dimensional space rises appreciably until the 600-generation mark, at which point it plateaus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The observed clustering from generation 200 onward is much greater than expected by chance, as is clustering for the total-data PCA shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (compared to a null expectation constructed by randomly permuting the evolution condition assigned to each population; p &lt; 0.001). Note that this trend is consistent when the number of neighbors in the analysis is lowered to 3 or elevated to 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).

However, it is apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> that there remains significant stochastic variability in the pleiotropic effects of adaptation among populations evolved in the same environment. For instance, populations evolved in the acetic acid environment splay out into all four quadrants when plotting fitness at 37 °C against fitness at 21 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; Figure 3—animation 1). This variability can also be seen in the wide dispersion of populations within clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, particularly among diploids evolved in the acetic acid environment and at 37 °C.</p><p>We find that these patterns of variability are structured, with specific evolution conditions fostering more variable outcomes in certain assay environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For example, populations evolved in YPD+ acetic acid exhibit generally wider variation in home and away environments than populations evolved in other environments. While it is tempting to link this pattern to the large fitness gains these populations make in their home environment, we note that populations evolved in YPD at 30 °C also make significant correlated gains in YPD+ acetic acid without generating such variable results across other assay environments. This suggests that, with respect to the distribution of pleiotropic effects of fixed driver or hitchhiking mutations, paths to higher fitness in YPD+ acetic acid are qualitatively different for the populations evolved in YPD at 30 °C. In another example, while diploid and haploid populations evolved at 37 °C show similar variability in 37 °C, 30 °C, and YPD+ NaCl across the experiment, they experience more variable outcomes in YPD+ acetic acid and 21 °C, respectively. Together, these results suggest that the role for chance in the pleiotropic trajectories of evolving populations is contingent on the condition to which the population is adapted.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Variability in fitness over time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Box plots summarizing population mean fitness over time for each evolution condition (columns) in each assay environment (rows).

In other words, selection appears to suppress variation among trajectories in the home environment, at least on the timescales studied. To assess the statistical significance of these differences in variance, we used a one-tailed variant of a Brown–Forsythe test to perform pairwise comparisons of home and away fitness variance among replicate lines evolved in a given condition at each evolution timepoint. Of the 80 nonancestral pairwise comparisons, over half (48/80) indicated significantly greater variance in the away environment (at a threshold of p &lt; 0.05) and only six showed significantly greater variance at home (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The role of stochasticity and temporal shifts in pleiotropic dynamics also can be seen in the relative nonmonotonicity of fitness trajectories in away environments compared to home environments.

Our results offer insight into how pleiotropic effects emerge and change on an evolutionary timescale. Consistent with earlier work, we observe repeatable fitness trajectories across many replicate populations in their home environments, which follow a pattern of initial rapid fitness gains followed by declining adaptability over time. Replicate populations also tend to follow consistent fitness trajectories in away environments, whether gaining or losing fitness on average. Looking across populations and environments, characteristic patterns of pleiotropy specific to each evolution condition emerge rapidly and stabilize within about 600 generations.</p><p>Despite these characteristic patterns, we also observe ample variability within these trends. Examining the fitness trajectories of populations individually, we find that about 17 % of away-environment trajectories are nonmonotonic, compared to just 3 % of home-environment trajectories. This nonmonotonicity is indicative of the sequential establishment of mutations with opposing pleiotropic effects in these populations. Meanwhile, across replicate populations, there is substantial variability in the pleiotropic consequences of evolution in each condition. Consistent with past work, we observe more variability in away than in home environments at the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Travisano and Lenski, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ostrowski et al., 2005</xref>). However, our results also reveal how populations can follow very different trajectories in arriving at these endpoint fitnesses. Diverse away-environment trajectories manifest as changes in the variance among replicate populations over time, with a general tendency for variance to increase over the course of the experiment.</p><p>Together, patterns of pleiotropy along with variability among replicate populations suggest an important and dynamic role for chance and contingency in the fates of populations evolving in environments that fluctuate in space and time. Whether populations trend toward specialist or generalist phenotypes will not simply reflect physiological constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bono et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jerison et al., 2020</xref>). Rather, as we observe, mutational opportunities to move toward higher or lower fitness in alternate environments may be accessible at all times. Thus, the emergence of specialism or generalism will be a product of both the distribution of pleiotropic effects of mutations that establish and dynamical factors that influence the timescale, sequence, and likelihood of their fixation (e.g., epistasis, ploidy, clonal interference, mutation rate, and population size). For instance, while previous studies observe substantial specialization in high-salt environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jerison et al., 2020</xref>), here we observe general improvement in fitness in high-salt across evolution environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which may be attributable to differences in the strain background or ploidy, the salt concentration used, or some combination of these factors.</p><p>Furthermore, the timescale over which pleiotropic effects emerge and change will interact with patterns of environmental fluctuations to determine evolutionary outcomes. In the conditions studied here, we observe that pleiotropic profiles generally emerge early and stabilize by 600 generations. Independent of other dynamical consequences of the rate of environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cvijović et al., 2015</xref>), it is therefore likely that fluctuations on longer timescales (e.g., longer than 600 generations in this system) will lead to qualitatively different outcomes than fluctuations on shorter timescales. Our data show that both the average and variance in these outcomes will also depend critically on the specific sequence of environments experienced by a population.</p><p>These results underscore the need for further empirical and theoretical work to understand patterns of pleiotropic effects over time and their effects on evolutionary trajectories. Additional experiments will be required to describe how general pleiotropic trends and variability within these trends arise and shift across a wider array of environments, as well as in different model systems. Likewise, studies of pleiotropy in populations evolved for longer periods, such as those described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>, may provide a richer perspective on the repeatability, diversity, and stability of pleiotropic trajectories. Finally, this work motivates further theoretical inquiry into how the dynamics and variability of pleiotropic effects will interact with other important parameters – such as patterns of environmental fluctuation, mutation rate, sexual recombination, and the underlying distributions of fitness effects – to influence evolutionary outcomes. Integrating empirical datasets like the one presented here with such theoretical insight will enable better prediction of adaptation in complex environments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YCB140B</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>MAT<bold>a</bold></italic>, <italic>his</italic>3Δ1, <italic>leu2</italic>Δ0, <italic>lys2</italic>Δ0, <italic>RME1</italic>pr::ins-308A, <italic>ycr043c</italic>Δ0::<italic>NatMX</italic>, <italic>can1</italic>::<italic>STE2</italic>pr_<italic>SpHIS5</italic>_<italic>STE3</italic>pr_<italic>LEU2</italic>, <italic>ybr209w</italic>::<italic>GAL10</italic>pr-<italic>CRE</italic>, <italic>trp1</italic>Δ, <italic>URA3</italic>::<italic>STE5</italic>pr_<italic>URA3</italic>, <italic>HO</italic>::<italic>CgTRP1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YCB137A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>MAT</italic>α, <italic>his</italic>3Δ1, <italic>leu2</italic>Δ0, <italic>lys2</italic>Δ0, <italic>RME1</italic>pr::ins-308A, <italic>ycr043c</italic>Δ0::<italic>NatMX</italic>, <italic>can1</italic>::<italic>STE2</italic>pr_<italic>SpHIS5</italic>_<italic>STE3</italic>pr_<italic>LEU2</italic>, <italic>ybr209w</italic>::<italic>GAL10</italic>pr-<italic>CRE</italic>, <italic>trp1</italic>Δ, <italic>URA3</italic>::<italic>STE5</italic>pr_<italic>URA3</italic>, <italic>HO</italic>::<italic>CgTRP1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Barcoding plasmid landing pad 1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmid map in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Barcoding plasmid landing pad 2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmid map in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Illumina sequencing primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IDT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequences listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Zymolyase 20T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nacalai Tesque</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Zymolyase 20T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Custom code</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/amphilli/pleiotropy-dynamics">https://github.com/amphilli/pleiotropy-dynamics</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain generation</title><p>Strains in this study are derived from YAN404 and YAN407 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nguyen Ba et al., 2019</xref>), which were constructed on the BY4742 background (S288C: <italic>MATα</italic>, <italic>his</italic>3∆1, <italic>ura</italic>3∆0, <italic>leu</italic>2∆0, <italic>lys</italic>2∆0) to add the <italic>RME1</italic>pr::ins-308A mutation, meant to improve transformation efficiency in both the <italic>MAT<bold>a</bold></italic> and <italic>MAT<bold>α</bold></italic> cell types.

Each population was founded by a uniquely barcoded single colony or uniquely barcoded colonies that were then mated to form a diploid (see ‘Strain generation’), and was subsequently propagated in a well of an unshaken flat-bottom polypropylene 96-well plate in one of three conditions: YPD (1 % Bacto yeast extract [VWR #90000-726], 2 % Bacto peptone [VWR #90000-368], 2 % dextrose) at 30 °C, YPD at 37 °C, and YPD +0.2 % acetic acid (Sigma Aldrich #A6283) at 30 °C (128 µl/well). Each 96-well plate contained diploid and haploid populations of both mating types (with each mating type occupying one side of the plate) and five empty wells to monitor for potential cross contamination. With the exception of the YPD at 37 °C condition, the evolution conditions were arranged in a checkered pattern on each 96-well plate to minimize potential plate effects.

Populations underwent daily transfers for ~1000 generations (~10 generations/day); every 50 generations, populations were mixed with glycerol to a final concentration of 8 % for long-term storage at −80 °C. No contamination of blank wells was observed over the course of the evolution experiment. One of the 96-well plates was dropped at generation 170 and evolution was resumed by thawing and reviving populations from the generation 150 archive; thus, all future archives of populations on this plate lagged 40 generations behind the populations on all other plates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Population growth curve and bottleneck size measurements</title><p>Growth curves were observed and population bottleneck sizes were determined for two haploid and two diploid ancestral clones in each of the evolution and assay environments.

The following day, once these cultures had grown to saturation, equivalent volumes of each population were pooled by ploidy for each generation (12 pools total). For the haploid populations, evolved populations were only pooled if they were verified to be haploid at the end of the evolution experiment (see ‘Nucleic acid staining for ploidy’). Each of the haploid pools was spiked with five uniquely barcoded ancestral reference strains of the same mating type at 4× the volume of each evolved population; each of the diploid pools was spiked with 10 reference strains at 4× the volume of each evolved population. The resulting pools comprised time point zero for the BFA and were diluted 1:2<sup>10</sup> in the appropriate media (described below) and divided between 16 wells (128 µl/well) of flat-bottom polypropylene 96-well plates. The BFA was performed in each of the three evolution environments (YPD at 30 °C, YPD at 37 °C, and YPD +0.2 % acetic acid at 30 °C), in addition to two novel environments (YPD at 21 °C and YPD +0.4 M NaCl at 30 °C).

We removed all apparently cross-contaminating reads from our analysis.</p><p>Then, we summed reads associated with all barcodes in a given population, since some populations contained more than one unique barcode (or, in the case of diploids, more than two unique barcodes). In addition, some barcodes were present in the BFAs that could not be confidently assigned to a single well, representing 0.3 % of all reads. These were summed together and retained in the dataset.</p><p>To determine the fitness of each population over time and across environments and technical replicates, we measured the log-frequency slope for each population in two intervals: between assay timepoints 10 and 30 and between timepoints 30 and 50 generations.

These libraries were then normalized, pooled, and sequenced on a NextSeq500 High flow cell (150 bp paired-end reads).</p><p>To extract barcode information from sequencing reads, we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>, using a list of decreasingly strict regular expressions (using the python regex module <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.org/project/regex/">https://pypi.org/project/regex/</ext-link>).

These data allowed us to determine the wells in which barcodes belonged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Changes in fitness analysis</title><p>To summarize changes in fitness at each generation since the beginning of the experiment, we assessed the fraction of populations in each assay environment and evolution condition that had increased in fitness, decreased, or remained the same. To categorize a population in one of these three categories, we performed a Welch’s unequal variances <italic>t</italic>-test comparing the fitness of that population in a given assay environment at 0 generations to the fitness of that population at 200, 400, 600, 800, or 1000 generations. Since each fitness measurement is the result of two independent technical replicate measurements, we treated each as the mean of two observations. If the fitness at the later timepoint was greater than the ancestral fitness, we applied a one-sided test to determine whether that difference was significant. We did the converse one-sided test for populations that appeared to have declined in fitness. Populations for which we rejected the alternate hypothesis were considered to have maintained the same fitness (i.e., ‘equally fit’).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>IQR variability analysis</title><p>Fitness variability was examined by plotting box-and-whisker plots of population mean fitness values, where the line, box, and whiskers represent the median, quartiles, and data within 1.5 × IQR, respectively, and outlier populations beyond whiskers are shown as points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To compare the resulting IQR for various evolution conditions and fitness assay environments, 95 % confidence intervals of the IQR were calculated from bootstrapped interval-specific replicate s measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate whether home environment fitness variance was less than away environment fitness variances at each evolution timepoint, we applied a Brown–Forsythe test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Forsythe, 1974</xref>). Since this test is typically a two-tailed test, and we wanted instead to employ a one-tailed test, we used the <italic>z</italic> scores from the Brown–Forsythe test to arrive at a two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-statistic. We could then obtain a one-tailed p value with this <italic>t</italic>-statistic, evaluated at <italic>N</italic> − 1 degrees of freedom, where <italic>N</italic> is the number of populations in consideration. No multiple hypothesis testing correction was applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Principal components analysis</title><p>All principal components analysis excluded ancestral reference populations. To minimize the influence of varying scales of data features on the analysis, fitness values for each field – corresponding to fitness in a given assay environment, possibly at a specific evolutionary timepoint – were standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 using the scikit-learn StandardScaler function. We then used the scikit-learn PCA() function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Clustering metric</title><p>To quantify the degree of clustering by evolution condition in the two-dimensional principal component analyses, the NearestNeighbors algorithm in the scikit-learn python package was implemented to identify the five nearest neighbors for each population in the two-dimensional PC1 versus PC2 plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The clustering metric plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> is the number of five nearest neighbors that belong to the same evolution condition as the focal population, averaged for each evolution condition. Error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals of the mean clustering metric, which were calculated by performing the PCA and clustering analysis on bootstrapped interval-specific replicate <italic>s</italic> measurements. The null expectation for populations to cluster by evolution condition was computed by permuting the evolution condition 1000 times and calculating the clustering metric as described above. The true mean clustering metrics were then compared to this null expectation by calculating a multiple testing-corrected p value, computed as the percentage of permutations for which the clustering metric was greater than the true mean for a given evolution environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Nonmonotonicity analysis</title><p>To assess nonmonotonicity, we linearly interpolated fitness at 500 generations for each population in each assay environment. We achieved the interpolated standard errors in fitness by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the errors associated with the fitnesses used in the interpolation and dividing by two. For evolution plate two populations, which were offset from the others by 40 generations, we took a weighted average for the interpolation (500 generation fitness estimate) and extrapolation (1000 generation fitness estimate) steps. For the 500 generation fitness standard error estimate, we adapted this weighting approach for the standard error propagation as described for the other populations. For the 1000 generation fitness standard error estimate, we used the error assigned to the generation 960 fitness estimate. Then, we calculated the change in fitness (∆<italic>s</italic>) between 0 and 500 generations and between 500 and 1000 generations for each population in each environment, where the standard error of ∆<italic>s</italic> is propagated from the standard error of the two fitnesses used in the calculation as the square root of the sum of the squared errors. Finally, we plotted these ∆<italic>s</italic> values as <italic>x</italic>–<italic>y</italic> coordinates. If a point and its error bars were completely within the top-left or lower-right quadrant – corresponding to an increase followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, over the 1000-generation experiment – these were considered to be ‘clearly nonmonotonic’. We applied a <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> test with 1 degree of freedom to evaluate the significance in the difference in the frequency of nonmonotonicity in home versus away trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Declining adaptability analysis</title><p>To assess the extent of declining adaptability among populations in their home environments, we calculated the difference in fitness for each population between 0 and 400 generations and between 600 and 1000 generations. Standard errors for these differences were calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of the standard errors associated with the fitness estimates from each generation. Across the populations, we then compared the mean fitness change in each interval using a one-sided <italic>t</italic>-test, in which the alternate hypothesis was that the fitness increase in the first 400 generations was greater than the increase in the final 400 generations of the experiment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review and editing, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Strain creation tables.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70918-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Plasmid for landing pad one barcode integration.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70918-supp2-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Plasmid for landing pad two barcode integration.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70918-supp3-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Primers used in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70918-supp4-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70918-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw amplicon sequencing reads have been deposited in the NCBI BioProject database with accession number PRJNA739738.

Using a technically innovative and ambitious experimental design with evolving yeast populations, the authors show that patterns of pleiotropy depend on the evolution environment and these patterns can change over relatively short timescales. They also find a surprising amount of variation among experimental replicates that increases over time, so generalism or specialism is not deterministic.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dynamics and variability in the pleiotropic effects of adaptation in laboratory budding yeast populations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Vaughn Cooper as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: G. Ozan Bozdag (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) All 3 reviewers found the experimental design and data intriguing, but struggled to find a clear take-home message. Most of the major suggestions in the following reviews aim to remedy this weakness. As one example, can you describe in more detail the relatively uncommon dynamics in which local adaptation corresponds to a significant decline in fitness in an away environment, such as the acetic acid populations in high- and low-temperature environments? These exceptions might prove valuable.</p><p>2) Please clarify the population sizes, because it is curious that no-stress and stressful conditions are equivalent. This might help our understanding of chance effects on within-group variation.</p><p>3) Please show how the ancestor's growth is affected by stressful conditions. If they were chosen because they generate distinct environments, what was this evidence and what is the extent of these effects?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The work appears to be elegant and sound, so I have nothing much to recommend in the way of more experiments. Rather I think the results (to some degree) and the discussion can help from more explicative and declarative summaries of the major findings, with an eye towards broader significance or any particular surprises you noted. This may require additional analyses of data subsets that demonstrate these novelties, but it's hard for me to pick one beyond the effects of ploidy that I mentioned.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the manuscript is generally well-written and well-supported, I have one concern.</p><p>1. The authors claim that the observations in Figure 2 are consistent with the trend of declining adaptability observed in many previous studies. While this claim appears to be visually supported in the YPD+Acetic acid populations, this trend is not obvious in the other three evolution treatments (YPD, YPD 37C diploids and YPD 37C haploids). There also does not appear to be any formal statistical analysis supporting this claim. While this claim is not central to the manuscript, I would appreciate some statistical support for this statement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>#1 The scale of the experiment is quite impressive. However, none of the treatment groups evolved a specialist phenotype -i.e., defined with the evolution of a pleiotropic outcome where replicate populations as a whole start to lose against their ancestor in an alternate environment. There is one case where adaptation to acetic acid corresponds to a decline in median fitness in low-temperature, but this is not true for all populations as some gain fitness in the away environment. It would have been fascinating to observe the dynamics of specialization in an experimental setup like this (e.g., is there a monotonic or a fluctuating decline in fitness in the away environment?). Considering the large scale of these experiments, I will not advise testing the temporal dynamics of pleiotropy across other away environments (e.g., low or high pH, galactose) with the hope of discovering an away environment where there is a corresponding cost of adaptation. However, I still would prefer authors to look at some instances where local adaptation corresponds to a significant decline in fitness in an away environment. A large number of the acetic acid populations show a fitness decline in high- and low-temperature environments. Extracting this data and discussing the trends in the evolution of fitness costs would be pretty valuable.</p><p>#2 A numerical summary of the pleiotropic outcomes is worth considering. For instance, how many populations showed higher relative fitness gains in an away environment, how many populations showed a decline in relative fitness in an away environment, and how many populations showed similar relative fitness outcomes between the home and an away environment. Doing this comparatively for generation-200 and generation-1000 would be interesting. The number of replicate populations is a strength of this study, and such a numerical summary would be helpful for a potential future review paper summarizing the results of pleiotropy papers.</p><p>#3 Jerison et al., (2020) lately tested the pleiotropic consequences of local adaptation using the same model organism for 700 experimental evolution. They report that specialization is common in high salt (!) and low and high pH environments. However, here we see a contradictory result for the high salt environment. Instead of a decrease, there is an increase in fitness across all evolution treatments. It would have a general value to discuss this contrasting outcome in the sign of pleiotropic effects despite the growth of the same model organism under quite similar growth conditions. The authors say that they chose these environments to facilitate comparisons with previous studies in yeast, but they do not come back to this point.</p><p>#4 The pleiotropy is tested in three (plus two) different environments. The difference among environments is a crucial part of an article that focuses on pleiotropy. These environments are said to be different as they are supposed to apply distinct types of stress. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the negative effect of stress on an ancestral population, ideally with a small-scale relative fitness assay or a growth curve measurement in the same well-plate setup (e.g., YPD+0.2% acetic acid vs. YPD).</p><p>The authors cite two papers regarding the choice of these stressful environments. However, I could not find a quantitative assay reporting the effect of stress in those papers (e.g., see Methods section in Jerison et al., 2020).</p><p>#5 The study reports a large variability in pleiotropic effects. It would be beneficial to report the population size and bottleneck size for each condition, at least for the early stages of this experiment. The demographic differences would affect the interplay between drift and selection differently across the evolution treatments, potentially providing more insights about the results.</p><p>Following this, the authors report a daily bottleneck of 10,000 cells for each environment (each culture is transferred by the pipetting robot). It means that there is no difference in population size at saturation across environments. If this is true, the stress conditions do not negatively affect the ancestral population. Alternatively, the population size estimates do not represent the reality of each environmental condition (e.g., high temperature is expected to impact the growth). Therefore, I recommend carefully measuring the bottleneck size in five conditions for a few founder clones, and if Ne values are significantly different, please report the outcome in the main text.</p><p>#6 The study presents a large dataset and numerous plots, with varying outcomes for most experiments (# of plots: 20 in Figure 2, 10 in Figure 3, 16 in Figure 4, 24 in Figure 5, 8 in Figure 6). However, it is laborious to connect all those different visual information with a take-home message in the end. Of course, the Discussion section summarizes the results nicely, but the paper would still benefit from a graphical, conceptual summary. For instance, using the plots in Figure 3 as a template (i.e., comparing fitness trajectories in-home vs. away environment) and/or Figure 4A, it would be nice to summarize the most important findings of this work. A conceptual summary that focuses on the characteristic and uncharacteristic findings of the study and how that changes the way we understand pleiotropy.</p><p>#7 Figure 2 shows the temporal dynamics of fitness change. Even though each plot has a bold black line showing the median fitness, it is hard for the reader to compare relative fitness at time-0 and time-1000 quantitatively. Despite that large variability across populations, it would still be valuable to report the median relative fitness at the final time point in the main text. Looking at Figure 2, it is not possible to tell whether populations evolving in high temperatures reach a higher fitness than their ancestor. For instance, see Figure 1 in Jerison et al., 2020 for a nice graphical summary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70918.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All 3 reviewers found the experimental design and data intriguing, but struggled to find a clear take-home message. Most of the major suggestions in the following reviews aim to remedy this weakness. As one example, can you describe in more detail the relatively uncommon dynamics in which local adaptation corresponds to a significant decline in fitness in an away environment, such as the acetic acid populations in high- and low-temperature environments? These exceptions might prove valuable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the overall comment and have addressed all of the reviewers’ major suggestions on this point (e.g. by summarizing the changes in fitness in home and away environments; Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplements 2–5). We have also expanded our discussion of general trends as well as uncommon dynamics and the variability of outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please clarify the population sizes, because it is curious that no-stress and stressful conditions are equivalent. This might help our understanding of chance effects on within-group variation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the population bottleneck sizes in each evolution and assay environment to Figure 1–source data 1. These bottleneck sizes are largely consistent across evolution and assay environments, because populations ultimately reach similar saturation densities between the daily (or in the case of the 21°C environment, 48-hour) 1:1024 dilutions. However, we can see clear differences among the growth curves in the different environments (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please show how the ancestor's growth is affected by stressful conditions. If they were chosen because they generate distinct environments, what was this evidence and what is the extent of these effects?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now measured the growth of the ancestral strains (haploid and diploid) in each of the evolution and assay environments, and provide these data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Diploids and haploids reach saturation most quickly at 37°C and in YPD, followed by NaCl and acetic acid, and finally at 21°C. These environments were chosen because they cause distinct types of physiological stress, as evidenced by previous evolution experiments and fitness measurements (e.g. Nguyen Ba et al., 2019, Jerison et al., 2020, Kinsler et al., 2020) and by phenotypic studies in yeast (e.g., Giannattsio et al., 2013, Taymaz-Nikerel et al., 2016) and other organisms (e.g., Trček et al., 2015, Lamitina et al., 2004, Fasolo and Krebs, 2004). In addition, the distinct fitness trajectories (Figure 2) and trade-offs (Figure 3) in this work provide retrospective evidence for the differences between the biological effects of these environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The work appears to be elegant and sound, so I have nothing much to recommend in the way of more experiments. Rather I think the results (to some degree) and the discussion can help from more explicative and declarative summaries of the major findings, with an eye towards broader significance or any particular surprises you noted. This may require additional analyses of data subsets that demonstrate these novelties, but it's hard for me to pick one beyond the effects of ploidy that I mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, to more clearly show general trends and variation in pleiotropy, we have added figure panels summarizing the changes in fitness across all populations (Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplements 2–5). We have also expanded our discussion of these trends and their variability, and our description of particular examples as suggested here and in other reviewer comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While the manuscript is generally well-written and well-supported, I have one concern.</p><p>1. The authors claim that the observations in Figure 2 are consistent with the trend of declining adaptability observed in many previous studies. While this claim appears to be visually supported in the YPD+Acetic acid populations, this trend is not obvious in the other three evolution treatments (YPD, YPD 37C diploids and YPD 37C haploids). There also does not appear to be any formal statistical analysis supporting this claim. While this claim is not central to the manuscript, I would appreciate some statistical support for this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, this is a good point. We now provide statistical support for this statement (for those cases where it is in fact significant) in Figure 2-figure supplement 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>#1 The scale of the experiment is quite impressive. However, none of the treatment groups evolved a specialist phenotype -i.e., defined with the evolution of a pleiotropic outcome where replicate populations as a whole start to lose against their ancestor in an alternate environment. There is one case where adaptation to acetic acid corresponds to a decline in median fitness in low-temperature, but this is not true for all populations as some gain fitness in the away environment. It would have been fascinating to observe the dynamics of specialization in an experimental setup like this (e.g., is there a monotonic or a fluctuating decline in fitness in the away environment?). Considering the large scale of these experiments, I will not advise testing the temporal dynamics of pleiotropy across other away environments (e.g., low or high pH, galactose) with the hope of discovering an away environment where there is a corresponding cost of adaptation. However, I still would prefer authors to look at some instances where local adaptation corresponds to a significant decline in fitness in an away environment. A large number of the acetic acid populations show a fitness decline in high- and low-temperature environments. Extracting this data and discussing the trends in the evolution of fitness costs would be pretty valuable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these cases of specialization and evolution of fitness costs are particularly interesting. As described above, to more clearly show general trends and variation in pleiotropy, including particularly the cases where fitness declines do occur, we have summarized the changes in fitness across all populations in Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplements 2–5. We have also added a paragraph to the Results discussing specialization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>#2 A numerical summary of the pleiotropic outcomes is worth considering. For instance, how many populations showed higher relative fitness gains in an away environment, how many populations showed a decline in relative fitness in an away environment, and how many populations showed similar relative fitness outcomes between the home and an away environment. Doing this comparatively for generation-200 and generation-1000 would be interesting. The number of replicate populations is a strength of this study, and such a numerical summary would be helpful for a potential future review paper summarizing the results of pleiotropy papers.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we have performed this analysis for each 200-generation interval and present the corresponding data in Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplements 2–5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>#3 Jerison et al., (2020) lately tested the pleiotropic consequences of local adaptation using the same model organism for 700 experimental evolution. They report that specialization is common in high salt (!) and low and high pH environments. However, here we see a contradictory result for the high salt environment. Instead of a decrease, there is an increase in fitness across all evolution treatments. It would have a general value to discuss this contrasting outcome in the sign of pleiotropic effects despite the growth of the same model organism under quite similar growth conditions. The authors say that they chose these environments to facilitate comparisons with previous studies in yeast, but they do not come back to this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the difference between these observations is noteworthy, and we now compare these results in the discussion. In particular, we note that there are several differences between these ancestral strains we use here compared to the Jerison study (e.g. Jerison et al., 2020 uses a W303-derived strain, which is haploid, differs at key fitness-determining loci such as MKT1, and contains killer virus). In addition, there are also some differences in the evolution experiments (e.g. different concentrations of salt). The apparent dependence of the results of these types of experiments on strain background (and other factors) further highlights the extensive variability in the pleiotropic outcomes of adaptation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>#4 The pleiotropy is tested in three (plus two) different environments. The difference among environments is a crucial part of an article that focuses on pleiotropy. These environments are said to be different as they are supposed to apply distinct types of stress. Therefore, it is necessary to quantify the negative effect of stress on an ancestral population, ideally with a small-scale relative fitness assay or a growth curve measurement in the same well-plate setup (e.g., YPD+0.2% acetic acid vs. YPD).</p></disp-quote><p>The authors cite two papers regarding the choice of these stressful environments. However, I could not find a quantitative assay reporting the effect of stress in those papers (e.g., see Methods section in Jerison et al., 2020).</p><p>As noted above, we now provide growth curves for ancestral haploid and diploid clones in each of the evolution and assay environments (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). In addition, we have added additional references discussing the effects of these and other stresses on budding yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors cite two papers regarding the choice of these stressful environments. However, I could not find a quantitative assay reporting the effect of stress in those papers (e.g., see Methods section in Jerison et al., 2020).</p><p>#5 The study reports a large variability in pleiotropic effects. It would be beneficial to report the population size and bottleneck size for each condition, at least for the early stages of this experiment. The demographic differences would affect the interplay between drift and selection differently across the evolution treatments, potentially providing more insights about the results.</p><p>Following this, the authors report a daily bottleneck of 10,000 cells for each environment (each culture is transferred by the pipetting robot). It means that there is no difference in population size at saturation across environments. If this is true, the stress conditions do not negatively affect the ancestral population. Alternatively, the population size estimates do not represent the reality of each environmental condition (e.g., high temperature is expected to impact the growth). Therefore, I recommend carefully measuring the bottleneck size in five conditions for a few founder clones, and if Ne values are significantly different, please report the outcome in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have provided the population bottleneck sizes for ancestral clones in each of the evolution and assay environments in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. These bottleneck sizes are quite similar across environments and thus the interplay between drift and selection should not vary between evolution environments.</p><p>Although the population size does not vary substantially between evolution and assay environments, there are substantial differences in the corresponding patterns of population growth, reflecting the differentially stressful nature of these conditions. These growth curves are now provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>#6 The study presents a large dataset and numerous plots, with varying outcomes for most experiments (# of plots: 20 in Figure 2, 10 in Figure 3, 16 in Figure 4, 24 in Figure 5, 8 in Figure 6). However, it is laborious to connect all those different visual information with a take-home message in the end. Of course, the Discussion section summarizes the results nicely, but the paper would still benefit from a graphical, conceptual summary. For instance, using the plots in Figure 3 as a template (i.e., comparing fitness trajectories in-home vs. away environment) and/or Figure 4A, it would be nice to summarize the most important findings of this work. A conceptual summary that focuses on the characteristic and uncharacteristic findings of the study and how that changes the way we understand pleiotropy.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have summarized changes in fitness across environments in Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplements 2-5, and have expanded our discussion of the trends and exceptions in these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>#7 Figure 2 shows the temporal dynamics of fitness change. Even though each plot has a bold black line showing the median fitness, it is hard for the reader to compare relative fitness at time-0 and time-1000 quantitatively. Despite that large variability across populations, it would still be valuable to report the median relative fitness at the final time point in the main text. Looking at Figure 2, it is not possible to tell whether populations evolving in high temperatures reach a higher fitness than their ancestor. For instance, see Figure 1 in Jerison et al., 2020 for a nice graphical summary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this change in a few different ways to make Figure 2 easier to digest. First, we have added a y = 0 line; second, we note the median fitness at generation 1000 in each plot; third, we have colored the lines so that the median line is more legible. We also provide a summary of fitness changes in Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplements 2-5.</p></body></sub-article></article>
