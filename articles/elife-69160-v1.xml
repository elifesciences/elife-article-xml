reaction (AR) upon encountering an egg surrounded by its vestment. How premature AR is avoided despite rapid surges in signaling cascades during capacitation remains unknown. Using a combination of conditional knockout (cKO) mice and cell-penetrating peptides, we show that GIV (<italic>CCDC88A</italic>), a guanine nucleotide-exchange modulator (GEM) for trimeric GTPases, is highly expressed in spermatocytes and is required for male fertility. GIV is rapidly phosphoregulated on key tyrosine and serine residues in human and murine spermatozoa. These phosphomodifications enable GIV-GEM to orchestrate two distinct compartmentalized signaling programs in the sperm tail and head; in the tail, GIV enhances PI3K→Akt signals, sperm motility and survival, whereas in the head it inhibits cAMP surge and premature AR. Furthermore, GIV transcripts are downregulated in the testis and semen of infertile men. These findings exemplify the spatiotemporally segregated signaling programs that support sperm capacitation and shed light on a hitherto unforeseen cause of infertility in men.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Girdin</kwd><kwd>Sperm</kwd><kwd>male fertility</kwd><kwd>spermatozoa</kwd><kwd>cAMP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

their fertilizing potential after insemination, during the passage through the female reproductive tract. Two key consecutive processes are prerequisites for successful fertilization: (i) sperm must first undergo capacitation, a process that is characterized by progressive acquisition of hypermotility, change in membrane, and phosphorylation status, and (ii) they must later undergo acrosome reaction (AR), a process that is characterized by an exocytotic release of acrosomal enzymes to penetrate the zona pellucida of the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mayorga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hirohashi and Yanagimachi, 2018</xref>). Although capacitation is an important physiological prerequisite before spermatozoa can fertilize the oocyte in every mammalian species studied, the molecular mechanisms and signal transduction pathways involved in this process are poorly understood. AR, on the other hand, is a time-dependent phenomenon that cannot take place prematurely or too late (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cummins et al., 1986</xref>). Premature spontaneous AR that occurs in the absence of proper stimuli (AR insufficiency) has been associated with idiopathic male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tesarik and Mendoza, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Being transcriptionally and translationally silent, mature spermatozoa support capacitation and AR relying exclusively on post-translational events, for example, increase in membrane fluidity, cholesterol efflux, ion fluxes resulting in alteration of sperm membrane potential, and an increased protein phosphorylation; the latter represents a very important aspect of capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Naz and Rajesh, 2004</xref>) (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Despite these mechanistic insights into sperm capacitation, key gaps in knowledge persist. For example, although it is known that phosphotyrosine intermediates in the sperm tail culminate in the activation of the PI3K→Akt signaling axis, and that such activation is vital for sperm hypermotility, how tyrosine phosphorylation leads to the activation of PI3K remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tan and Thomas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breitbart et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, although it is known that Akt-dependent actin polymerization in the sperm tail requires both protein kinase A (PKA) and protein tyrosine phosphorylation, the linker(s) between signaling and actin dynamics remains unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breitbart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Etkovitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roa-Espitia et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, how cAMP surge during capacitation is restricted to the sperm tail, such that its levels remain low in the sperm head, and premature AR is avoided, remains a mystery.</p><p>Here we show that GIV (a.k.a., <italic>GIRDers of actIN filament</italic>, Girdin; gene: <italic>CCDC88A</italic>), a multimodular signal transducer that straddles both tyrosine-based and G protein→cAMP signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Midde et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kalogriopoulos et al., 2020</xref>), is a key player during sperm capacitation. GIV is an ideal candidate to fill some of the knowledge gaps identified above because many of its functional modules that take part in either tyrosine-based or G protein signaling cascades are reversibly modulated by phosphorylation cascades. First, GIV is a substrate of multiple tyrosine kinases (TKs), both receptor (RTKs) and non-receptor TKs (non-RTKs) alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Midde et al., 2018</xref>). Both RTKs and non-RTKs phosphorylate two substrate sites within GIV’s C-terminus that, upon phosphorylation, directly bind and activate class 1 PI3Ks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Midde et al., 2018</xref>). The major consequence of such phosphorylation is that GIV serves as a point of convergence for multi-TK-dependent PI3K signaling. Second, as a bonafide enhancer and a substrate of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>), GIV binds and depolymerizes actin, and in doing so, serves as the only known substrate of Akt that links the PI3K→Akt cascade to cytoskeletal remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Enomoto et al., 2005</xref>). Third, as a guanine nucleotide-exchange modulator (GEM) for trimeric GTPases, GIV serves as a <italic>g</italic>uanine nucleotide <italic>e</italic>xchange <italic>f</italic>actor (GEF) for Gi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>) and a <italic>g</italic>uanine nucleotide <italic>d</italic>issociation <italic>i</italic>nhibitor (GDI) for Gs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gupta et al., 2016</xref>) via the same evolutionarily conserved C-terminal motif. The major consequence of such versatility of modular function is that by activating the inhibitory Gi and inhibiting the stimulatory Gs proteins GIV overall inhibits membrane adenylyl cyclase (mACs) and suppresses cellular cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Getz et al., 2019</xref>). ‘Free’ Gβγ that is released from both classes of Gi/s trimers further enhances the PI3K→Akt signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia-Marcos et al., 2009</xref>). We show here how GIV orchestrates distinct spatiotemporally segregated signaling programs in sperm to support capacitation and concomitantly inhibit premature AR, thereby playing an essential role in male fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GIV is highly expressed in spermatocytes</title><p>At the time of its discovery in 2005, full-length GIV protein was found to be most highly expressed in two organs: testis and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunohistochemical studies curated by the Human Protein Atlas further confirm that GIV is most highly expressed in the testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Single-cell sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>) and immunohistochemistry (IHC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) studies on human testis pinpoint sperm as the major cell type in the testis that expresses GIV mRNA and protein. We confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence on mouse testis that GIV is indeed expressed in the spermatozoa and localizes predominantly to the acrosomal cap, as determined by colocalization with the mouse acrosomal matrix protein, sp56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2001</xref>) (tGIV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As expected, a tyrosine phosphorylated pool of GIV (pYGIV), however, localized mostly to the plasma membrane (PM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Both antibodies detected the endogenous GIV protein in testicular lysates at the expected size of ~220 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We also noted that GIV consistently and predominantly localizes to the acrosome as it matures from a rudimentary vesicle into a vesicular cap during sperm maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). GIV’s localization to the acrosome, which is derived from the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khawar et al., 2019</xref>), is in keeping with GIV’s predominant localization to the Golgi and Golgi-associated transport vesicles in diverse cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Le-Niculescu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lo et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that GIV is highly expressed in sperm and may be important for sperm functions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GIV (<italic>CCDC88A</italic>) is highly expressed in spermatocytes in testis and localizes to the acrosomal cap.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bar graph displays the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) of endogenous full-length GIV protein in immunoblots of organ lysates published previously using three independent anti-GIV antibodies raised against different epitopes of GIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anai et al., 2005</xref>).

We asked if the abundance of GIV transcripts in testis or sperm may be altered in infertile men. To this end, we curated all publicly available transcriptomic datasets from the NCBI GEO portal and analyzed them for differences in the abundance of <italic>CCDC88A</italic> transcripts across the annotated (in)fertility phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>CCDC88A</italic> transcripts were significantly and consistently downregulated in infertile men across all independent datasets analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>), regardless of whether the samples used for transcriptomic studies were testis or sperm.

Finally, in a study that segregated subfertile from fertile men using commonly used clinical parameters for semen quality, we found that sperm motility, but not concentration or morphology, was the key parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>); when reduced sperm motility was used as a metric of infertility, semen from those subfertile men displayed reduced levels of GIV transcript. These results indicate that reduced GIV expression in testis and sperm is associated with clinically determined male infertility.

Using the sperm swim-up assay, we first confirmed that in human ejaculates low-motile sperm have just as much total GIV as their highly motile counterparts, but by contrast, tyrosine phosphorylated GIV was significantly elevated in the latter (compare tGIV and pYGIV, lanes 1–2 in immunoblots; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As a positive control, we simultaneously analyzed the same samples by dual-color immunoblotting with an antibody that detects pan-tyrosine phosphoproteins. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ecroyd et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ficarro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcelay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yunes et al., 2003</xref>), the highly motile sperms have higher tyrosine phosphorylation (pan-pY; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). pYGIV and pan-pY signals co-migrated in the SDS page gel, indicating that GIV is one of the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in high-motile sperms. The pan-pY and pYGIV signals were found to further increase in capacitated sperms, maximally by 4 hr, without any change in total GIV (lanes 3–4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Such phosphorylation was dependent on the activity of PKA because pretreatment of sperm with the PKA inhibitor H89 virtually abolished both pan pY and pYGIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>); these findings are in keeping with the fact that PKA activity is essential for tyrosine phosphorylation cascades during capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Luconi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lamirande and Gagnon, 2004</xref>). Immunofluorescence studies on human sperm confirmed that pan-pY and pYGIV signals colocalized in the mid-piece and tails of high-motile sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) where they were significantly induced upon capacitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Findings in human sperm were mirrored in murine sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), with some notable differences in temporal-spatial dynamics. For example, pY/pYGIV of murine sperms are induced more rapidly and transient. During murine sperm capacitation, pYGIV is induced in 30 min and then reduced in 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and was not as restricted to the sperm tail and mid-piece as in humans (compare sperm head regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). Although full-length GIV (~250 kDa expected size) could be detected in murine sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), we often detected numerous breakdown products, presumably proteolytic in nature, in both murine and human sperm lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B and F</xref>). Regardless of the size of the breakdown products, total tGIV, pYGIV, and pan-pY co-migrated in the gels at the same size, suggesting that GIV may be one of the major phosphotyrosine proteins in capacitating sperm. We conclude that GIV is a major phosphotyrosine substrate in sperm tail during capacitation and that its phosphoactivation requires upstream activation of PKA. Our findings suggest that this PKA→TK→pYGIV axis may enhance PI3K-Akt signals and sperm motility. Because the sperm Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, Catsper, exerts both spatial and temporal control over tyrosine phosphorylation as sperm acquire the capacity to fertilize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2014</xref>, and there is some evidence that H89 may directly inhibit Catsper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), the contributions of a possible alternative Ca<sup>2+</sup>→TK→pYGIV pathway towards sperm motility cannot be ruled out.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>GIV localizes to the head and tail of human and murine sperms and is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated during capacitation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Freshly ejaculated human sperm were segregated into low-motile and high-motile populations using ‘swim-up’ technique (see Materials and methods) and subsequently capacitated in vitro for 1 or 4 hr prior to whole cell lysis.

Thus, mACs and sACs regulate cAMP surges in the sperm head and tail, respectively, in a spatiotemporally segregated and independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Taken together with the temporal nature of the GIV-GEM activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), our findings also suggest that GIV-GEM may inhibit premature cAMP surge and acrosome shedding. Because these premature events may compromise fertilization only in the in vivo setting where sperm is required to remain in capacitated state while maintaining intact acrosomes for prolonged periods of time within the female reproductive tract before encountering the egg, we hypothesized that GIV’s function may be bypassed in the setting of in vitro fertilization (IVF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

Expressed most abundantly in the testis, and primarily in sperm, GIV is required for male fertility, and low GIV transcripts in men were invariably associated with infertility. We show that GIV is rapidly phosphomodulated on key tyrosine and serine residues in a manner segregated in space and time in various segments of the sperm (head, mid-piece, and tail) during capacitation and acrosomal reaction. These specific phosphomodifications, which are known to regulate GIV’s interactions with other key proteins (PI3K, Gαi/s proteins, etc.) and its functions as an effector of multiple TKs, as a cytoskeletal remodeler, and as a signal transducer, regulate key sperm phenotypes in at least two sperm compartments (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). First, in the sperm head, GIV’s GEM activity is induced upon capacitation. Once activated, GIV modulates both Gαi/s via the same GEM motif to suppress premature cAMP surges downstream of ligand-activated Gi/Gs-coupled GPCRs. Consequently, GIV-GEM inhibits premature acrosome shedding. Because both premature AR or failure to do so are important causes of male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2006</xref>), deciphering the signaling events that precisely regulate the timing of acrosome exocytosis has remained one of the most challenging and unresolved questions concerning mammalian reproductive biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buffone et al., 2014</xref>). Despite emerging evidence in the last decade that has challenged the long-held paradigms in the field, and mechanistic insights into sperm-extrinsic factors responsible for premature AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sánchez-Cárdenas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balestrini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harper et al., 2004</xref>), the identity of sperm-intrinsic pathways/processes/proteins that inhibit premature acrosome exocytosis was unknown. Our conclusion that GIV-GEM serves as a ‘brake’ for cAMP surge and prevents AR is consistent with the fact that the PDE-inhibitor sildenafil citrate (Viagra) increases cAMP to cause premature acrosomal reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Glenn et al., 2007</xref>). It is noteworthy that although canonical G protein signaling that is triggered by ligand-activated GPCRs has been implicated in the activation/inhibition of mACs and cAMP signaling in the sperm head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeoya-Osiguwa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schaefer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Flegel et al., 2016</xref>), the role of non-canonical G protein we report here was never recognized previously. Because GIV is most highly expressed in sperm, the cAMP-regulatory role of GIV-GEM we define here implies that it may fulfill a major role in the regulation of cAMP in the sperm head. pYGIV was also detected in the sperm head, but its role in AR was not studied here. Because pYGIV activates class 1 PI3K, it is possible that the pYGIV→PI3K axis at that location could also influence rapid lipid phosphorylations that are also known to regulate AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary and working model: spatiotemporally segregated roles of GIV/Girdin during sperm capacitation.</title><p>Schematic summarizes the key findings in this work and places them in the context of existing literature. GIV is likely to primarily function during capacitation of sperm, during which it fulfills two key roles as a signal transducer in a spatiotemporally segregated manner. The first role (right, top) is in the head of the sperm, where GIV’s GEM motif inhibits the AC→cAMP pathway and prevents acrosomal reaction. The second role (right, bottom) is in the mid-piece and tail region of the sperm, which involves tyrosine phosphorylation of GIV, which happens downstream of PKA activation. Such phosphorylation is rapidly induced during capacitation. In addition, GIV’s GEM motif is activated and is required for the enhancement of PI3K/Akt signals, enhanced motility, and survival of sperms during capacitation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69160-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Second, in the sperm tail, GIV is an effector within the sAC→cAMP→PKA→multi-TK axis that gets robustly phosphorylated on Y1764; this site is known to directly bind and activate class 1 PI3Ks, which ultimately enhance Akt signals. GIV’s GEM activity is also activated in the tails of capacitated sperms and enhances Akt signals, presumably via the previously defined GIV→Gi→‘free’ Gβγ→class 1 PI3K axis. These two mechanisms of Akt signaling have previously been shown to act as an ‘AND’ gate to maximally enhance Akt signaling in diverse cell types to increase cell survival and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lopez-Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>) Furthermore, both GIV transcripts and its phosphoactivation by TKs (pYGIV) were reduced in sperms with lower motility. Because the global trend of progressive reduction in the number of motile and viable sperm in the ejaculate has been associated with a concomitant increase in the rates of infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dcunha et al., 2020</xref>), our findings in the case of GIV add to the growing number of proteins that enrich the signal-ome of healthy sperm. For example, as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) and a multi-modular scaffold that generates crosstalk between diverse signaling pathways, GIV appears to be in a prominent position to orchestrate rapid cooperativity between these pathways and processes in the otherwise transcriptionally and translationally silent sperm cell.</p><p>In conclusion, our results provide evidence that GIV may perform different roles in the distinct spatial compartments of capacitating sperms. This study not only sheds light on defective GIV-signaling as potential ‘marker’ of male infertility, but also reveals that inhibitors of GIV-dependent signaling will inhibit fertility by reducing sperm motility and viability and by promoting premature AR. The latter is a promising strategy for the development of a male contraceptive ‘pill’ specifically targeting sperm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type<break/> (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit polyclonal anti-GIV (Girdin) (T-13)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sc-133371</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit monoclonal diagnostic grade anti-Girdin/GIV antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Custom;

Samples were demultiplexed using bcl2fastq v2.20 Conversion Software (Illumina).</p><p>To determine which genes were differentially expressed in WT and GIV-knockout mice testes, transcript-level abundance of paired-end RNA-seq data was estimated by Salmon (1.1.0) using the mouse transcriptome from Genecode (vM24). Tximport (1.14.2) was used to aggregate transcript-level quantification to the gene level. The resulting gene counts were used as an input to DESeq2 Bioconductor package. Differentially expressed genes below a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH)-adjusted p-value of 0.05 were considered significant. Also, all genes differentially expressed were included in REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis. Statistically significant pathways of upregulated and downregulated DEGs are listed in the table and bar plots of upregulated and downregulated enriched pathways. In Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis, some fertility-related gene sets from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) were tested. Genes from these gene sets were used to rank order the samples and test for GIV-knockout versus WT phenotype classification using the area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and displayed such classification using violin plots.</p></sec><sec id="s3-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance between datasets with three or more experimental groups was determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. Unpaired t-test is used to test the statistical difference between two experimental groups. For all tests, a p-value&gt;0.05 is considered as significant. All experiments were repeated at least three times. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>None</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>none</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human sperm were collected from volunteers via masturbation.

Prior to fertilization, spermatozoa undergo a series of morphological and biochemical changes to become fertilization competent, driven by a rapid and poorly understood signaling cascade, culminating in the acrosome reaction. This latter reaction releases to the outside components from a vesicle, the acrosome, in the spermatozoan head and transforms the head plasma membrane so that sperm can fuse with the egg. The work shows that a G protein modulator GIV/Girdin, influences sperm motility and the acrosome reaction. In so doing it is important for fertilization and is one more strategy to control untimely acrosome reaction. The proposed mechanism is well supported by a variety of different experimental approaches.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;GIV/Girdin, a Non-receptor Modulator for Gαi/s, Regulates Spatiotemporal Signaling during Sperm Capacitation and is Required for Male Fertility&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have now included details in figure legends for how many repeats were performed. For the convenience of the Editor/Reviewer, here are the details, which we have now included in Methods and Figure 6 legend:</p><p>1. 3-4 different batches of protein preps were used for optimization of balanced uptake of TAT-GIV-CT WT and FA peptides. Optimization steps included timing of transduction, wash step, and concentrations of each peptide used.</p><p>2. The recombinant protein that showed the most efficient uptake was subsequently used in <italic>four different mouse sperm samples</italic> to document consistent uptake test by western blotting, by FACS and immunofluorescence, and finally, to confirm that GIV peptides retain functionality (G protein binding) upon uptake.</p><p>3.

The lower than expected % hypermotlity (progressive) that we observe in this assay is consistent with the fact that CASA was not done immediately after sperm isolation. Instead, there was a delay due to TAT-peptide transduction related steps (or control incubation in PBS). As stated in methods, our analyses could only be done at 3h. It is entirely possible that the reduce % hypermotility is due to this delay, as has been shown by others<sup>1</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Line 262.
