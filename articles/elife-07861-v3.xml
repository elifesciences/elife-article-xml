examples where regulation of gene cluster expression has been correlated with ecological and physiological relevance for the producer. Here, signals, mediators, and biological effects of terrein production were studied in the fungus <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> to elucidate the contribution of terrein to ecological competition. Terrein causes fruit surface lesions and inhibits plant seed germination. Additionally, terrein is moderately antifungal and reduces ferric iron, thereby supporting growth of <italic>A. terreus</italic> under iron starvation. In accordance, the lack of nitrogen or iron or elevated methionine levels induced terrein production and was dependent on either the nitrogen response regulators AreA and AtfA or the iron response regulator HapX. Independent signal transduction allows complex sensing of the environment and, combined with its broad spectrum of biological activities, terrein provides a prominent example of adapted secondary metabolite production in response to environmental competition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07861.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07861.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07861.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Organisms produce a wide variety of small molecules called metabolites through the break down of food and other chemical reactions. Some of these molecules—known as primary metabolites—are required for growth, reproduction and other vital processes. Other molecules called secondary metabolites are not strictly required by the organism, but generally have other roles that may improve the individual’s ability to survive and reproduce.</p><p>Fungi and other microbes produce a large variety of secondary metabolites, many of which are used as medicines to treat diseases in humans and other animals. For example, a molecule called lovastatin—which is produced by a fungus known as <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic>—can reduce a human patient's risk of heart disease. However, it is not known what role many secondary metabolites play in the microbe that produced them.</p><p><italic>A. terreus</italic> lives in the soil, but it can also infect plants and animals. In addition to lovastatin, it also makes another secondary metabolite called terrein. A recent study identified the genes responsible for making terrein, and discovered that this molecule is harmful to plant cells and may help the fungus to colonize and thrive in the area immediately around plant roots, which is known as the rhizosphere.</p><p>Here, Gressler et al. studied how terrein may help the fungus to cope with competitors in this environment. The experiments show that terrein increases the availability of iron and inhibits the growth of competing microbes. A shortage of iron or nitrogen-containing nutrients can stimulate the fungus to produce terrein, and elevated levels of a molecule called methionine have the same effect. These conditions are commonly found in the rhizosphere and further experiments identified several proteins in the fungus that are required for sensing them.</p><p>Gressler et al.'s findings suggest that terrein helps to ensure that the fungus has sufficient nitrogen and iron to thrive in the rhizosphere. Also, this study confirms that the production of secondary metabolites in microbes can happen in response to elaborate cues from the environment, which may explain why only a limited number of secondary metabolites are produced by microbes when they are grown in the laboratory. Future studies will analyze other ways to activate the production of secondary metabolites outside of the microbe's normal environment, which may lead to the discovery of new important drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07861.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07861.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic></kwd><kwd>terrein</kwd><kwd>methionine</kwd><kwd>nitrogen starvation</kwd><kwd>iron limitation</kwd><kwd>siderophore</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BR-2216/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gressler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Brock</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hans Knöll Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>internal funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gressler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name><name><surname>Heine</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Hortschansky</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Hertweck</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name><name><surname>Brock</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elevated methionine levels, or a shortage of nitrogen or iron, induce terrein production in the fungus <italic>Aspergillus terreus.</italic></meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fungal secondary metabolites (SMs) are often encoded by gene clusters and have been the subject of intensive analysis in recent years. This has resulted from the large number of completed fungal genomes as well as the intrinsic interest of SMs as environmental/pathogenic agents and their potential for pharmacological use. However, there are few examples where the regulation of the expression of these clusters has been shown to be ecologically/physiologically relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rohlfs and Churchill, 2011</xref>). Except for penicillin and perhaps aflatoxin and gliotoxin, the potential real-life functions of most SMs are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatnagar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vargas et al., 2014</xref>). Most clusters contain a pathway-specific transcription factor, and the common approach is to artificially over-express the cluster genes by constitutive expression of this transcription factor and chemically characterise the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yin and Keller, 2011</xref>). In most cases the relevance of the SM is not known.</p><p>In this study the biological function of terrein from the filamentous ascomycete <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic> was investigated. <italic>A. terreus</italic> is a filamentous ascomycete of biotechnological and medical importance since it produces itaconic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steiger et al., 2013</xref>) and lovastatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bizukojc and Ledakowicz, 2015</xref>), but it is also a causative agent of life-threatening invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baddley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Slesiona et al., 2012b</xref>) and has recently been described as a pathogen of potato leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Louis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While searching for a candidate protein required for pigment synthesis in <italic>A. terreus</italic> conidia, we serendipitously identified the gene cluster responsible for terrein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>), which is the major SM formed by <italic>A. terreus</italic>. Terrein production is highly pronounced on sugar-rich plant-derived media such as potato dextrose broth (PDB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>) and shows phytotoxic activities such as inhibition of seed germination and lesion formation on fruit surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamata et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The terrein biosynthesis gene cluster consists of 11 genes (<italic>terA–J</italic>, <italic>terR</italic>), whereby <italic>terA</italic> encodes the key enzyme, which is a non-reducing polyketide synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>terR</italic> codes for the transcriptional activator TerR containing a GAL4-type Zn<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> binuclear cluster DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gressler et al., 2015a</xref>), as frequently found in transcriptional activators of fungal SM gene clusters. Although activation of cluster genes is strictly TerR-dependent, no signals that lead to TerR activation under in vivo conditions have yet been identified.</p><p>Since terrein is the major SM produced by <italic>A. terreus</italic>—gram scales are easily achieved—we assumed a benefit from its production in the natural habitat. To elucidate this question, a detailed knowledge on the inducing factors stimulating terrein production and analyses of its biological activities were required. Therefore, we aimed to investigate environmental signals that result in <italic>terR</italic> expression and, eventually, the production of terrein. From these analyses, the impact of different global transcription factors on cluster induction was deduced. Two global transcription factors sense the quality and availability of nitrogen sources and specifically respond to the plant and fruit environment. Additionally, the iron responsive regulon plays a vital role in cluster induction, which indicates a specific contribution of terrein in modulating iron homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fruits induce the production of terrein</title><p>In previous studies we showed that terrein is produced on plant-derived media such as PDB, which is in agreement with its phytotoxic biological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>). To address the question of specific conditions that induce the gene cluster, an <italic>A. terreus</italic> reporter strain was generated expressing the β-galactosidase gene <italic>lacZ</italic> from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> under control of the terrein synthase promoter P<italic>terA</italic> (P<italic>terA:lacZ</italic>). Due to the dependence of P<italic>terA</italic> expression on TerR, this strain served as a direct indicator of <italic>terR</italic> expression and terrein production.</p><p>In agreement with a lack of terrein production, β-galactosidase activity was near the detection limit when the <italic>A. terreus</italic> P<italic>terA:lacZ</italic> strain was grown on glucose minimal medium. In contrast, and in agreement with previous observations, a 200–500 fold induction was observed on PDB medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, on Sabouraud and yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium, induction levels reached 10–30% compared with PDB. However, potato broth or casamino acids did not induce the cluster without the addition of glucose, indicating that glucose appears to be required for terrein production rather than repressing gene cluster induction as shown for other SM gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Theilgaard et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brakhage et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gressler et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, when glucose medium was supplemented with 1% casamino acids as the nitrogen source, a 20–30 fold activation was detected. Since terrein can cause lesions on fruit surfaces and inhibits plant seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamata et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>), we assumed that sugar-rich fruit and root juices might have a strong stimulatory capacity. Therefore, we cultivated the reporter strain on banana, carrot, peach, and apple juice. β-Galactosidase activities from these media exceeded the activity of the already strong inducing PDB medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) by a factor of at least five. Additionally, in subsequent LC analyses of culture extracts, a distinct ultraviolet signal for terrein was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). This led us to infect fresh bananas with the <italic>A. terreus</italic> Δ<italic>akuB</italic> strain (the parental strain for gene deletions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gressler et al., 2011</xref>), a Δ<italic>terR</italic> mutant lacking the transcriptional activator, and a Δ<italic>terA</italic> deletion mutant that lacks the key polyketide synthase from the cluster.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07861.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Terrein production and expression of <italic>terA</italic> on plant-derived media.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Promoter activity of strain P<italic>terA</italic>:<italic>lacZ</italic> after 48 hr and 72 hr on minimal media supplemented with glucose (Gluc), casamino acids (CA), or glucose + casamino acids (Gluc CA) or the complex media Sabouraud (Sab), yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD), potato dextrose broth (PDB) or potato extract (PB).

In the presence of the preferred nitrogen source glutamine, the induction by aliphatic amino acids was mainly lost. Also, the activation by cysteine was low and strongly concentration-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, methionine provoked a significant induction even at low concentrations. Therefore, we also analysed the effect of other sulphur-containing compounds in two concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, no induction was observed when homocysteine, cystathionine, glutathione, dimethylsulfoxide, sulfate, or sulfide were tested.

This suggested that additional or alternative inducing signals might exist. Fruit juices are rich in sugars and the C:N ratio in fruits is very high, which could result in severe nitrogen limitation at a later growth state. Therefore, another set of experiments was performed in which the total concentration of amino acids was either high (50 mM) or low (10 mM) and P<italic>terA</italic> induction from the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter strain was determined at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). While high concentrations of amino acids or inorganic nitrogen sources such as nitrate or ammonia did not induce the cluster, low nitrogen contents resulted in a time-dependent 40–400 fold induction. To correlate gene expression with nitrogen exhaustion, the nitrogen consumption from a medium supplemented with 10 mM ammonium chloride was monitored and cluster induction was simultaneously analysed. Indeed, as soon as nitrogen levels reached the detection limit, cluster expression was strongly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Subsequently, a culture shift experiment was performed in which mycelium was pre-grown in the presence of 70 mM ammonium chloride and shifted to medium either with or without a nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). While no reporter activity and terrein formation was observed from cultures of the nitrogen-rich medium, high β-galactosidase activity accompanied by terrein accumulation was observed in the nitrogen starvation medium.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07861.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Terrein biosynthesis gene cluster activation under nitrogen starvation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) β-Galactosidase activity of SBUG844_P<italic>terA</italic>:<italic>lacZ</italic> was cultivated for 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 hr in glucose minimal medium supplemented with different concentrations of various nitrogen sources: 70 mM and 10 mM NaNO<sub>3</sub> or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 1% or 0.1% of casamino acids (CA), and 50 or 10 mM aspartate (Asp), asparagine (Asn), glutamate (Glu), or glutamine (Gln).

In agreement, when ammonium chloride was added to banana juice, β-galactosidase activity was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, the P<italic>terA:lacZ</italic> reporter strain displayed high β-galactosidase activity when bananas were directly infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). When bananas were supplemented with ammonium chloride prior to infection with the wild-type, ethyl acetate extracts of the bananas revealed a 50% reduction in terrein content compared with bananas without nitrogen supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This finding clearly indicates that nitrogen limitation is a major inducer for terrein production under natural conditions. However, it should be mentioned that the presence of sugars was always required, since especially hexoses from mono- and disaccharides provoked strong expression under nitrogen-limited conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which is in direct contrast to the production of dihydroisoflavipucine in <italic>A. terreus</italic> that belongs to the class of fruit and root rot toxins. This metabolite is only produced in the strict absence of sugars and requires preferred nitrogen sources such as glutamine or asparagine for induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gressler et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>AreA is the main global nitrogen regulator in <italic>A. terreus</italic></title><p>Nitrogen starvation and methionine marked important signals for terrein cluster induction.

All mutants were tested for their growth properties in the presence of proteinogenic amino acids or ornithine, citrulline, urea, and casamino acids, all of which were used as the sole nitrogen source. Additionally, several complex media were analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Only minor growth defects were observed with the <italic>cpcA</italic> and <italic>rhbA</italic> mutants, with some general growth reduction on selected amino acids (Asp, His, Ser, Thr) or complex media. However, among all the mutants tested, the <italic>areA</italic> mutant revealed the most severe growth defects. This mutant grew like the wild-type on glutamine and displayed some reduced growth on the nitrogen-rich amino acids asparagine, aspartate, and histidine as well as on urea and ammonium chloride. However, the Δ<italic>areA</italic> strain was unable to use any other proteinogenic amino acid. As described for other <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hunter et al., 2014</xref>), these results confirm an essential role of AreA in nitrogen sensing and utilisation in <italic>A. terreus</italic>. In contrast, the <italic>atfA</italic> mutant was only impaired in growth at high aspartate concentrations (50 mM). However, conidia of this mutant lacked the typical yellow-brown pigmentation. Additionally, the <italic>atfA</italic> mutant completely lacked the typical red colouration of the medium in the presence of methionine, which has previously been demonstrated to be associated with terrein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>). This implied a regulatory role of <italic>atfA</italic> on SM production in <italic>A. terreus</italic>. On the contrary, the <italic>atfA</italic> mutant did not show increased sensitivity against oxidative or osmotic stress as described for other <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balazs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lara-Rojas et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, a double deletion of the <italic>areA</italic> and <italic>atfA</italic> genes was generated (Δ<italic>areA</italic>Δ<italic>atfA</italic>) resembling the growth phenotypes of both single mutants, since it was only able to grow on the media that supported growth of the <italic>areA</italic> mutant where it formed white conidia, as observed for the Δ<italic>atfA</italic> strain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The global transcription factors AreA and AtfA are essential for terrein biosynthesis gene cluster induction during nitrogen starvation</title><p>To test the effect of transcription factor mutations on terrein biosynthesis gene cluster activation, all mutants were pre-grown on non-inducing glucose medium with glutamine and transferred to medium with or without nitrogen. Terrein was quantified after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The wild-type, the Δ<italic>cpcA</italic>, and the Δ<italic>rhbA</italic> mutant revealed low terrein production in the presence of nitrogen, but high terrein titers when nitrogen was omitted. This indicates that <italic>cpcA</italic> and <italic>rhbA</italic> are dispensable for terrein production. In contrast, both the Δ<italic>areA</italic> and the Δ<italic>atfA</italic> mutant only produced marginal amounts of terrein under nitrogen-limited conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and this effect was completely cured in the complemented mutants <italic>areA</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup> and <italic>atfA</italic><sup><italic>c</italic></sup>. No terrein was detected in a Δ<italic>areA</italic>Δ<italic>atfA</italic> double mutant.

While the regulator <italic>terR</italic> was most strongly upregulated after 12 hr, expression of the TerR-controlled terrein biosynthesis genes <italic>terA</italic> and <italic>terB</italic> continued to increase after 12 hr and reached 13.3 and 3.2 times the expression level of the actin control gene at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). On the contrary, while complemented mutants behaved like the wild-type, the <italic>areA</italic> and <italic>atfA</italic> deletions strongly reduced activation of <italic>terR</italic> and, in turn, the expression of <italic>terA</italic> and <italic>terB</italic>. Results from qRT-PCR perfectly coincided with the substantially reduced terrein production rates under nitrogen limitation in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). AreA recognises the DNA-binding motif HGATAR, and two adjacent binding sites are generally required for transcriptional activation due to dimer formation of AreA monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ravagnani et al., 1997</xref>). In this respect, the <italic>terR</italic> promoter contains two putative AreA binding sites that match the HGATAR consensus (BS1and BS2; positions −59 and −72 relative to the translational start point). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses with the <italic>A</italic>spergillus <italic>nidulans</italic> AreA DNA-binding domain, which is 91% identical to the respective <italic>A. terreus</italic> AreA domain, showed that BS1 and BS2 are recognised with high affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This strengthens the model of a direct involvement of AreA in the activation of <italic>terR</italic> expression. However, the reduction of <italic>terR</italic> expression was less pronounced in the Δ<italic>areA</italic> than in the Δ<italic>atfA</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which indicates that AreA is not the only activator acting on the <italic>terR</italic> promoter. Therefore, we additionally searched for putative palindromic AtfA/Sko1 binding sites (5′-TKACGTMA-3′) in the promoter regions of the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Proft et al., 2005</xref>). Only one hit (TGACGTCA) was identified in the promoter of the structural gene <italic>terC</italic>. However, if one mismatch is allowed, there is a putative binding site at position −731 relative to the ATG start codon of <italic>terR</italic> (5´-TGGCGTCA-3´), but it remains speculative whether this binding site is recognised by <italic>A. terreus</italic> AtfA. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that even a single half site of the suggested motif could promote transcription factor binding and promoter induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Proft et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore conclude that, although direct evidence for AtfA binding at the <italic>terR</italic> promoter is lacking, both transcription factors seem to regulate <italic>terR</italic> expression. In agreement, <italic>terR</italic>, <italic>terA</italic>, and <italic>terB</italic> expression and terrein production showed the strongest decrease in the Δ<italic>areA</italic>Δ<italic>atfA</italic> double knock-out mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, a constitutive expression of <italic>atfA</italic> by the <italic>gpdA</italic> promoter led to increased terrein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This supports our hypothesis of direct involvement of AtfA in terrein cluster regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>AreA and AtfA mediate terrein biosynthesis gene cluster induction in the presence of methionine</title><p>Due to the requirement for <italic>atfA</italic> and <italic>areA</italic> in terrein biosynthesis gene cluster induction under nitrogen starvation, we also tested their contribution to methionine-dependent induction in nitrogen-supplemented medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). While the wild-type strain and complemented mutants showed high terrein production rates of up to 55 mg/g mycelium, the terrein levels in the Δ<italic>areA</italic>, Δ<italic>atfA</italic>, or Δ<italic>areA</italic>Δ<italic>atfA</italic> double mutant remained near the detection limit and qRT-PCR was performed to confirm this result on the transcriptional level.</p><p>Although <italic>areA</italic> and <italic>atfA</italic> were expressed in the wild-type only at low levels on glutamine/methionine medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), deletion of <italic>areA</italic> or <italic>atfA</italic> reduced <italic>terR</italic> and, consequentially, <italic>terA</italic> and <italic>terB</italic> expression. In the Δ<italic>atfA</italic> mutant <italic>terR</italic> transcription was completely abolished and, in agreement, transcription of <italic>terA</italic> and <italic>terB</italic> was no longer detected. An <italic>areA</italic> mutant is unable to use methionine as a nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and its uptake may be limited leading to the loss of transcriptional activation. In contrast, the <italic>atfA</italic> mutant still uses methionine as a nitrogen source, but neither produces terrein nor pigmented conidia nor the red colouration of the medium which is associated with terrein production in the presence of methionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This implies that <italic>atfA</italic> may be induced by a methionine-dependent signaling cascade that subsequently leads to <italic>terR</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Iron limitation acts as a third independent signal for terrein cluster induction</title><p>While nitrogen starvation stimulated terrein production, starvation of other macroelements such as carbon, sulphur, or phosphate did not result in terrein production (data not shown). However, this did not exclude limitation of trace elements as inducing signals. Therefore, the β-galactosidase activity from the P<italic>terA</italic>:<italic>lacZ</italic> reporter strain was determined from cultures with reduced amounts of trace elements. Indeed, a decrease in trace elements was accompanied by increased <italic>terA</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To attribute this activation to a specific trace element, media with limited amounts of trace elements were supplemented with each of the single trace elements FeSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, CuSO<sub>4</sub>, MnCl<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>, CoCl<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>. Cluster induction was observed in all cultures except for that supplemented with FeSO<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating cluster activation from iron limitation. Subsequently, a minimal medium was prepared that contained all trace elements but iron which led to strong cluster induction, and the addition of 40 µM FeCl<sub>3</sub> completely repressed the induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, besides methionine and the limitation of nitrogen, a lack of iron—but no other trace element—induces the terrein biosynthesis gene cluster.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07861.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>terA</italic>, production of siderophores under iron limited conditions and iron reducing properties of terrein.</title><p>All analyses were performed in biological triplicates and technical duplicates.

The strong antioxidant ascorbic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elmagirbi et al., 2012</xref>) served as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Although ascorbic acid showed a much higher reducing potential, terrein was also able to convert ferric to ferrous iron in a concentration-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and pH-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) manner with a pH optimum of 3–4. In this respect, we noticed a significant fall in the culture pH under iron limitation from 6.5 to about 3.5, which agrees with the optimum pH for terrein-mediated iron reduction. Thus, since terrein is produced during growth under iron limitation, the combination with a fall in pH could indeed increase iron availability.</p><p>To elucidate the structure of the terrein oxidation product, the terrein-mediated iron reduction assay was scaled up and extractions were subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Here, besides a major proportion of terrein that remained in its original structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), a new peak (<bold>4</bold>) was observed, which was identified by NMR analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4 fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplements 4, 5</xref>) as 2-((<italic>E</italic>)-prop-1-en-1-yl) maleic acid (PMA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The structure of the oxidation product implies that oxidation took place at the two hydroxylated carbon atoms of terrein, leading to a cleavage of the pentenone ring system as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trabolsy et al. (2014</xref>). In contrast, conversion of terrein to PMA was not observed during incubation with Fe<sup>2+</sup>, confirming that iron reduction was the cause of PMA formation. No conversion of terrein was observed with oxidised copper ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup>), indicating a limited reductive potential which is sufficient for iron but not for copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, while terrein cannot chelate iron to support the siderophore-mediated iron uptake, its reductive potential is sufficient to reduce ferric to ferrous iron, which may increase iron solubility and could ease the direct uptake of iron via the ferrous iron transport system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>The iron response regulator HapX regulates siderophore and terrein biosynthesis in <italic>A. terreus</italic></title><p>Due to the co-regulation with siderophore biosynthesis, we assumed that transcriptional regulators involved in iron homeostasis could also regulate terrein biosynthesis.

Besides its pathogenic potential, <italic>A. terreus</italic> can inhibit proliferation of other plant pathogens such as <italic>Fusarium udum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Upadhyay and Rai, 1987</xref>) and acts as a mycoparasite on sclerotia of the plant pathogenic fungus <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Melo et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>SMs are assumed to support competition in the plant and soil environment. The natural biological activities of terrein include the inhibition of plant seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamata et al., 1983</xref>), the induction of fruit surface lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>), and the newly discovered reduction of ferric to ferrous iron accompanied by some antifungal activity. These activities are all appropriate to supporting the competitiveness of <italic>A. terreus</italic> in the environment. However, the production of terrein at the correct timing requires coordinated sensing and transduction of environmental signals.</p><p>The terrein biosynthesis gene cluster is directly controlled by the Zn<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> transcription factor TerR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gressler et al., 2015a</xref>). Therefore, terrein production requires transcriptional activation of <italic>terR</italic>. While sugars are indispensable for high terrein production rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>), three major signals were identified that resulted in <italic>terR</italic> transcription: methionine-dependent induction, nitrogen limitation, and iron starvation. These signals resemble the plant and rhizosphere environment.</p><p>Plant roots are leaky for carbon compounds that derive from C-fixation during photosynthesis. Up to one third of plant-assimilated carbon may end up in the rhizosphere, and especially in the extramatrical mycelium of ectomycorrhiza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Churchland and Grayston, 2014</xref>). Here, at least a fraction of carbohydrates is subsequently exuded by ectomycorrhiza, making it available to other soil microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sun et al., 1999</xref>). Mycorrhizas mobilize nitrogen to feed their symbiotic plant partner, resulting in nitrogen limitation for surrounding microorganisms. These conditions stimulate terrein production in <italic>A. terreus</italic>, which is typically isolated from the rhizosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rajalakshmi and Mahesh, 2014</xref>) and might affect existing plant–microbe interactions by its phytotoxic and antifungal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07861.032</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Scheme of the regulation of terrein biosynthesis gene cluster expression during interactions in the rhizosphere.</title><p>Plants secrete methionine (+Met) with root exudates into the soil. Additionally, competing microorganisms reduce the available pool of nitrogen sources (−N) and iron (−Fe). Signals from nitrogen limitation and methionine are sensed via AreA and AtfA, whereas iron limitation is sensed via HapX. All three transcription factors activate the promoter of the terrein biosynthesis gene cluster-specific transcription factor. TerR leads to transcription of the structural genes required for terrein biosynthesis and terrein is produced from acetyl- and malonyl-CoA units. The two-cluster specific major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters export terrein into the rhizosphere. Here terrein can counteract iron limitation by its ferric iron reducing activity, supports degradation of organic matter by its phytotoxic activities, and reduces growth of competitors by its antifungal activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07861.032">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07861.032</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07861-fig8-v3.tif"/></fig></p><p>Another inducing signal derives from methionine, which may be of particular importance when <italic>A. terreus</italic> acts as a potato plant pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Louis et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, PDB induces high terrein production rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>), which we assume to be methionine-dependent. In plants, methionine is required for ethylene production in environmental stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2002</xref>), fruit ripening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang and Hoffman, 1984</xref>), and polyamine production in plant defence reactions. Furthermore, methionine is a precursor for iron chelating siderophores such as nicotianamine and mugineic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roje, 2006</xref>) and has been identified in plant root exudates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dakora and Phillips, 2002</xref>). Therefore, elevated levels of methionine depict a signal that indicates the presence of a plant environment and stimulates terrein production. However, although further studies are required to elucidate the specific contribution of terrein to plant infection, its ability to induce lesion formation on several fruit surfaces indicates that terrein interacts with plant defence mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaehle et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The third—at first sight unrelated—inducing factor is iron starvation. Although terrein can reduce ferric to ferrous iron, a direct positive growth-promoting effect of terrein during iron limitation in <italic>A. terreus</italic> monocultures was only observed in the absence of a functional siderophore system. However, extracellular siderophores show a high affinity for ferric iron but not for ferrous iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hider and Kong, 2010</xref>). Thus, the reduction of ferric iron could reduce the efficiency of iron chelation by xenosiderophores secreted from competing microorganisms. A similar strategy for iron acquisition has previously been described for the human pathogenic fungus <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Timmerman and Woods, 1999</xref>). <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> secretes glutathione accompanied by the γ-glutamyltransferase Ggt1. This enzyme releases the dipeptide cysteinylglycine from gluthathione, which in turn reduces extracellular ferric iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zarnowski et al., 2008</xref>). While <italic>H. capsulatum</italic> also secretes hydroxamate siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Howard et al., 2000</xref>), silencing of <italic>ggt1</italic> mRNA reduced virulence in macrophages even in the presence of the siderophore system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zarnowski et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, terrein may interfere with competing siderophore systems to increase the competitiveness of <italic>A. terreus</italic> in the environment.</p><p>In this study we showed that transduction of environmental signals to the promoter of the transcriptional activator TerR requires activation by the global transcription factors AreA, AtfA, and HapX. While AreA has previously been described to regulate several SM gene clusters in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tudzynski et al., 1999</xref>), HapX activates iron acquisition systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schrettl et al., 2010</xref>) and AtfA plays a specific role in osmotic and oxidative stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lara-Rojas et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species and maybe all saprophytic ascomycetes, the GATA transcription factor AreA plays a substantial role in regulation of nitrogen. Under nitrogen starvation, AreA is transported into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Todd et al., 2005</xref>) where it binds a 5′-HGATAR-3′ sequence in its target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ravagnani et al., 1997</xref>), as shown for the genes encoding nitrate reductase (NiaD) and nitrite reductase (NiiD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 1996</xref>) that are upregulated in the absence of preferred nitrogen sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnstone et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Punt et al., 1995</xref>). In <italic>A</italic>spergillus <italic>parasiticus</italic> AreA also binds to the promoter regions of the transcriptional regulator genes <italic>aflR</italic> and <italic>aflJ</italic> from the aflatoxin biosynthesis cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast to nitrate utilisation, this binding impedes aflatoxin production probably due to inhibition of transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). We have shown that terrein biosynthesis in <italic>A. terreus</italic> during nitrogen starvation is AreA-dependent, and at least two <italic>areA</italic> binding sites in the <italic>terR</italic> promoter were recognised by the AreA DNA-binding domain. Therefore, AreA directly binds to the <italic>terR</italic> promoter and supports the expression of the terrein biosynthesis genes. Similarly, biosynthesis of various mycotoxins and gibberellins is activated by AreA in phytopathogenic <italic>Fusarium</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mihlan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim and Woloshuk, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giese et al., 2013</xref>). This implies that AreA plays a general role in regulation of SM production of plant pathogens, and the plant-derived environment may be characterised as a habitat with a high C:N ratio.</p><p>In several ascomycetes the nitrogen starvation response is also mediated by the basic leucine zipper transcription factor AtfA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, nitrogen starvation, oxidative or osmotic stresses induce phosphorylation of the MAP kinase SakA that is subsequently transported into the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes by interaction with the constitutively expressed transcription factor AtfA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lara-Rojas et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, in <italic>A. terreus</italic> the interaction between AtfA and SakA has not been solved in detail. While a <italic>sakA</italic> deletion does not affect terrein production levels under nitrogen limitation, it allows terrein production in the presence of some nitrogen sources, indicating that it may possess a repressor function under some conditions. In addition, a Δ<italic>sakA</italic> strain still produces pigmented conidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) and the <italic>sakA</italic> mutant—but not the Δ<italic>atfA</italic> strain—showed some increased osmosensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), which agrees with recent data on Δ<italic>atfA</italic> and Δ<italic>sakA</italic> mutants of <italic>Penicillium marneffei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nimmanee et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that terrein biosynthesis gene cluster activation via AtfA does not require SakA.</p><p>In <italic>A. terreus</italic> AtfA seems to act as a general inducer of SM production since its deletion resulted in non-pigmented conidia and in the loss of terrein production under nitrogen starvation or methionine supplementation. In contrast, deletion of the <italic>atf1</italic> gene in <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> resulted in accumulation rather than depletion of the polyketide botcinin A and the sesquiterpene botrydial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Temme et al., 2012</xref>). This points to AtfA as a transcriptional inhibitor in <italic>B. cinerea</italic> whereas AtfA acts as an inducer in <italic>A. terreus</italic>. Interestingly, AreA and AtfA sense the same environmental signals to induce the terrein biosynthesis gene cluster, although their global role in cellular physiology differs significantly. This adaptation of different transcription factors towards terrein production underlines a special importance of terrein for <italic>A. terreus</italic> during environmental competition.</p><p>Independent from AreA and AtfA, activation of the terrein biosynthesis gene cluster was also triggered by the iron response regulator HapX under iron limitation. To overcome severe iron starvation, microorganisms frequently produce siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pollack and Neilands, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisendle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kreutzer and Nett, 2012</xref>) or utilise siderophores from competing species (xenosiderophores) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boukhalfa and Crumbliss, 2002</xref>). In <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> and <italic>A. nidulans</italic> siderophore biosynthesis and uptake is regulated by the opposing transcription factors HapX and SreA depending on the presence or absence of iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schrettl et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2010</xref>). Similarly, <italic>A. terreus</italic> produces the HapX and SreA regulated siderophores ferrichrysin and coprogen that allow efficient acquisition of iron. However, in competition with other micoorganisms, terrein-mediated iron reduction could reduce binding of iron to high-affinity siderophores from competitors that cannot be used by <italic>A. terreus</italic>, as described for the cysteinylglycine iron reduction system from <italic>H. capsulatum</italic>.</p><p>The control of terrein production by HapX depicts an unprecedented example of the activation of a SM gene cluster outside the siderophore biosynthesis system. Interestingly, terrein production is only under positive HapX control, but not under negative SreA feedback control, which is in agreement with a lack of SreA binding sites in the <italic>terR</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schrettl et al., 2008</xref>), whereas a CCAAT box required for binding of the CCAAT-binding complex (CBC) and its subsequent CBC interaction with HapX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hortschansky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gsaller et al., 2014</xref>) is present. In the HapX target promoter regions of <italic>cycA</italic>, <italic>sreA</italic>, <italic>acoA</italic>, and <italic>lysF</italic> from <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species, a bipartite CBC–HapX-DNA binding motif with consensus 5′-C(C/A)AATCAN<sub>11-12</sub>GAT-3′ is present, of which CCAAT is recognised by the CBC complex while the GAT sequence is bound by HapX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hortschansky et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, these are all types of promoters that are repressed under iron limitation. In contrast, the <italic>cccA</italic> promoter, which encodes for a vacuolar iron transporter, is the only HapX-induced promoter known so far with a confirmed in vitro HapX binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gsaller et al., 2014</xref>). HapX binds to the GAT motif of a 5′-CCAATN<sub>16</sub>GATC-3′ sequence, which is also present in the <italic>cccA</italic> promoter of <italic>A. terreus</italic> and—with one mismatch—in the <italic>terR</italic> promoter (position −215). However, further studies will be required to confirm this motif as a HapX binding site.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the terrein biosynthesis gene cluster is activated by at least three independent environmental signals: methionine, nitrogen limitation, and iron starvation. Additionally, the three global transcription factors AreA, AtfA, and HapX are essential to transfer these signals to the terrein biosynthesis gene cluster. Although one environmental signal is sufficient to induce the gene cluster, a combination of different signals provides an environmental image of higher resolution and allows an adequate adaptation to the ecological niche. The phytotoxic and antifungal potential of terrein combined with its iron reductive properties enables <italic>A. terreus</italic> to acquire nutrients that might otherwise be consumed by competitors. Notably, similar to terrein, the mycotoxin production in <italic>Fusarium</italic> species is generally associated with sensing of nitrogen availability. Although AreA plays an important regulatory function, involvement of AtfA as an additional regulator and methionine as a second inducer in these species needs to be tested. However, from our results on the terrein biosynthesis gene cluster, we propose that manifold regulation of SM gene clusters and the interplay of different global transcriptional activators might depict a general mechanism to regulate the flexibility of gene cluster activation in fungi.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media and cultivation conditions</title><p>All genotypes of strains used in this study are summarised in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). <italic>A. terreus</italic> strain SBUG844 and its derivative SBUG844Δ<italic>akuB</italic> that show increased rates of homologous integration served as parental strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gressler et al., 2011</xref>).

For correlation of coprogen to the fungal biomass, mycelia from the cultures were dried for 48 hr at 37°C and balanced and coprogen concentrations per gram dried mycelium were calculated.

For determination of the pH optimum of the terrein mediated reduction, reagent A was adjusted to pH values of 3.5–6.0. Reductive activity was normalised against the activity determined from ascorbic acid, which was set as 100%. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.

AreA<sub>663–797</sub> was injected in running buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% (vol/vol) surfactant P20, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 1 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) at concentrations from 3.125 to 200 nM. Sample injection and dissociation times were set to 200 and 400 s at a flow rate of 30 µl/min. Regeneration was achieved with 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.005% (wt/vol) SDS for 1 min. Refractive index errors due to bulk solvent effects were corrected with responses from DNA-free flow cell 1 as well as subtracting blank injections. Kinetic raw data were processed and globally fitted with Scrubber 2.0c (BioLogic Software) using a 1:1 interaction model including a mass transport term.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical significance</title><p>All analyses in which statistical analyses were required were performed in biological triplicates with at least two technical replications.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jon Clardy, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Terrein, a well-known fungal secondary metabolite, causes lesions on fruit surfaces, inhibits plant seed germination, and provides iron to its producer. But the ways in which its production is regulated and the ecological relevance of its actions remained obscure. This study employed genetic knockout and complementation studies along with other assays to deconvolute the signaling pathways – nitrogen, iron, and methionine – involved in regulating terrein production through AreA, AtfA, and Hap X transcription factors. The released terrein reduces environmental Fe3<sup>+</sup> (ferric ion) to Fe2<sup>+</sup> (ferrous ion) to both allow it to be imported by the producing fungus and make it unavailable to microbial competitors relying on siderophores. The conclusions illustrate how terrein production and function allow its producer to thrive in rhizosphere.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript needs significant editing as it simply does not do justice to the work in its present form and is unlikely to engage the typical <italic>eLife</italic> reader. The Introduction needs to put the current studies in a more general context, and needs to be completely rewritten. The manuscript is much too long to engage readers through to the end. As noted, the authors did a very thorough set of experiments, but they don't all need to be described in such detail. The authors should describe the significant findings and relegate others to the supplementary information. In particular, much of the material in the iron section could be moved to the supplementary information. Finally there are significant editorial issues with English usage, particularly in the Introduction.</p><p>2) The controls found involve AreA mediated response to nitrogen starvation and AreA binding sites in the 5' of <italic>terA</italic> are characterized. It is shown that the response to methionine is mediated by the <italic>A. terreus</italic> homolog of the AtfA bZip transcription factor (TF). This is a little more mysterious because previous work with this TF in other fungi indicates a role in osmotic / oxidative stress responses via the SakA MAP kinase. The authors state that SakA is not involved in terrein synthesis. It is not obvious how methionine responsiveness might occur and the authors should indicate this more clearly. Furthermore from yeast studies the Atf1/Sko1 binding site is TGACGTCA – does this motif occur in the TerR promoter?</p><p>3) The authors comprehensively show that terrein cluster expression responds to Fe starvation and that this is mediated via HapX, a well-studied TF of Fe acquisition genes. HapX acts together with the CAAT binding complex and sites are found upstream of <italic>terR</italic>. More recently associated HapX binding sites have been found – are these present? They further show that terrein might contribute marginally to iron acquisition in the absence of siderophores and that it is capable of reducing ferric ions, an activity that might be relevant to competition with other organisms in the rhizosphere.</p><p>4) A further signal is demonstrated – a requirement for glycolytic carbon sources – consistent with plant environments. Perhaps it should be made clear that the mechanism for this is not known.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07861.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The manuscript needs significant editing as it simply does not do justice to the work in its present form and is unlikely to engage the typical</italic> eLife <italic>reader.

We focus now in the Introduction on the potential of secondary metabolites as pharmaceutical compounds without knowledge on the ecological and physiological impact of the metabolite for the producing organism. We hope that the English style is now acceptable.</p><p>The Results section of the main manuscript has been shortened by relocating several experimental details and supporting data to the supplemental. This also led to the reduction of total Figure in the main manuscript text that was reduced from 9 to 8 figures. Although comments below required the addition of some information that was not contained in the previous version of the manuscript, the Results section had been shortened by approximately 2 full pages. This included the “iron section”. A complete removal was not possible, because one of the biological functions of terrein is iron reduction and its regulation performs via the iron response regulator HapX. However, most details on the iron acquisition system have been relocated to the supplementary information.</p><p><italic>2) The controls found involve AreA mediated response to nitrogen starvation and AreA binding sites in the 5' of</italic> terA <italic>are characterized. It is shown that the response to methionine is mediated by the</italic> A. terreus <italic>homolog of the AtfA bZip transcription factor (TF). This is a little more mysterious because previous work with this TF in other fungi indicates a role in osmotic / oxidative stress responses</italic> via <italic>the SakA MAP kinase. The authors state that SakA is not involved in terrein synthesis. It is not obvious how methionine responsiveness might occur and the authors should indicate this more clearly. Furthermore from yeast studies the Atf1/Sko1 binding site is TGACGTCA – does this motif occur in the TerR promoter</italic>?</p><p>We also generated a <italic>sakA</italic> deletion mutant in order to assess SakA/AtfA interactions. However, we did not obtain indications for a stimulating effect of SakA on AtfA. While a SakA mutant revealed an increased sensitivity against osmotic stress, this was not observed for an <italic>atfA</italic> mutant. The <italic>sakA</italic> mutant produced pigmented conidia, whereas the <italic>atfA</italic> mutant did not. The <italic>sakA</italic> mutant produced terrein under nitrogen starvation, whereas the <italic>atfA</italic> mutant did not. However, in terms of terrein production, a deletion of <italic>sakA</italic> allowed terrein production in the presence of some nitrogen sources, which prohibit terrein production in the wild type. This indicates that SakA may act as a repressor on terrein production, but whether this is direct or indirect remains to be elucidated in the future. However, we added some information in the Discussion:</p><p>“In several ascomycetes nitrogen starvation response is also mediated by the basic leucine zipper transcription factor AtfA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, nitrogen starvation, oxidative or osmotic stresses induce phosphorylation of the MAP kinase SakA that is subsequently transported into the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes by interaction with the constitutively expressed transcription factor AtfA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lara-Rojas et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, in <italic>A. terreus</italic> the interaction between AtfA and SakA has not been solved in detail. While a <italic>sakA</italic> deletion does not affect terrein production levels under nitrogen limitation, it allows terrein production in the presence of some nitrogen sources, indicating that it may possess a repressor function under some conditions. In addition, a Δ<italic>sakA</italic> strain still produces pigmented conidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) and the <italic>sakA</italic> mutant, but not the Δ<italic>atfA</italic> strain showed some increased osmosensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), which agrees to recent data on Δ<italic>atfA</italic> and Δ<italic>sakA</italic> mutants of <italic>Penicillium marneffei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nimmanee et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is well conceivable that terrein biosynthesis gene cluster activation via AtfA does not require SakA” and provided an additional supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>We also analysed all promoters for putative AtfA binding sites and revised the Results section accordingly:</p><p>“Therefore, we additionally searched for putative palindromic AtfA/Sko1-binding sites (5′-TKACGTMA-3′) in the promoter regions of the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Proft et al., 2005</xref>). Only one hit (TGACGTCA) was identified in the promoter of the structural gene <italic>terC</italic>. However, if one mismatch is allowed, there is a putative binding site at position −731 relative to the ATG start codon of <italic>terR</italic> (5′-TGGCGTCA-3′), but it remains speculative whether this binding site is recognised by <italic>A. terreus</italic> AtfA. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that even a single half site of the suggested motif could promote transcription factor binding and promoter induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Proft et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that, although direct evidence for AtfA binding at the <italic>terR</italic> promoter is lacking, both transcription factors seem to regulate <italic>terR</italic> expression.”</p><p><italic>3) The authors comprehensively show that terrein cluster expression responds to Fe starvation and that this is mediated</italic> via <italic>HapX, a well-studied TF of Fe acquisition genes. HapX acts together with the CAAT binding complex and sites are found upstream of</italic> terR<italic>. More recently associated HapX binding sites have been found – are these present? They further show that terrein might contribute marginally to iron acquisition in the absence of siderophores and that it is capable of reducing ferric ions, an activity that might be relevant to competition with other organisms in the rhizosphere</italic>.</p><p>We re-analysed the <italic>terR</italic> promoter for putative HapX binding sites and added the following text to the Discussion:</p><p>“The control of terrein production by HapX depicts an unprecedented example for the activation of a secondary metabolite gene cluster outside the siderophore biosynthesis system. Interestingly, terrein production is only under positive HapX control, but not under negative SreA feedback-control, which is in agreement with a lack of SreA binding sites in the <italic>terR</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schrettl et al., 2008</xref>), whereas a CCAAT box required for binding of the CCAAT-binding complex (CBC) and its subsequent CBC interaction with HapX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hortschansky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gsaller et al., 2014</xref>) is present. In the HapX target promoter regions of <italic>cycA</italic>, <italic>sreA</italic>, <italic>acoA</italic> and <italic>lysF</italic> from <italic>Aspergilli</italic> a bipartite CBC-HapX-DNA binding motif with consensus 5′-C(C/A)AATCAN<sub>11-12</sub>GAT-3′ is present, of which CCAAT is recognised by the CBC complex, while the GAT sequence is bound by HapX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hortschansky et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly these are all types of promoters that are repressed under iron limitation. In contrast, the <italic>cccA</italic> promoter, which encodes for a vacuolar iron transporter, is the only known HapX induced promoter known so far with a confirmed in vitro HapX binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gsaller et al., 2014</xref>). HapX binds to the GAT motif of a 5′-CCAATN<sub>16</sub>GATC-3′ sequence, which is also present in the <italic>cccA</italic> promoter of <italic>A. terreus</italic> and – with one mismatch – in the <italic>terR</italic> promoter (position −215). However, further studies will be required to confirm this motif as a HapX binding site.”</p><p><italic>4) A further signal is demonstrated – a requirement for glycolytic carbon sources – consistent with plant environments. Perhaps it should be made clear that the mechanism for this is not known</italic>.</p><p>To make this point a bit more clear, we added the following statement to the Results section:</p><p>“However, it should be mentioned that the presence of sugars was always required, since especially hexoses from mono- and disaccharides provoked strong expression under nitrogen limited conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which is in direct contrast to the production of dihydroisoflavipucine in <italic>A. terreus</italic> that belongs to the class of fruit and root rot toxins. This metabolite is only produced in the strict absence of sugars and requires preferred nitrogen sources such as glutamine or asparagine for induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gressler et al., 2011</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
