Sensory components of the vagus innervate the digestive tract and provide afferent projections that target neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). This viscerosensory information is conveyed directly from the NTS to a variety of sites within the central nervous system, including discrete populations of hypothalamic neurons, where they regulate homeostatic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwartz and Zeltser, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saper and Stornetta, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) plays a particularly important role in coordination of neural signals controlling energy balance and receives direct inputs from the NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cunningham and Sawchenko, 1988</xref>). Neurons in the PVH are activated by stimulation of vagal afferents that recruit viscerosensory ascending projections from the brainstem to the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grill and Hayes, 2012</xref>). The PVH serves as a major site of neuroendocrine integration with a significant component of hormonally mediated information being relayed indirectly via neural connections. Notably, the PVH does not appear to be a major direct target for the fat-derived hormone leptin, yet significant numbers of PVH neurons are influenced by systemic changes in leptin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Myers and Olson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scott et al., 2009</xref>). Leptin receptors are abundant, however, in regions that provide strong inputs to the PVH, such as the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH). Leptin also impacts the activity of NTS neurons,Â which appear to express the long form of the leptin receptor (LepRb), and this information may converge onto the PVH with leptin signals conveyed by other afferent populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grill, 2010</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scott et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Vagal inputs to the NTS are established before birth, but viscerosensory afferents to the hypothalamus appear to develop during early postnatal life. PVH neurons receive direct synaptic inputs from the NTS, and development of catecholaminergic projections from the brainstem to the PVH is particularly well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rinaman et al., 2011</xref>). Neurons that contain the peptide glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are located primarily in the NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holt et al., 2018</xref>) and appear to innervate the PVH during the first postnatal week. However, functional maturation of viscerosensory regulation of PVH neurons may emerge later in postnatal life; systemic injection of the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) to newborn rats activates neurons in the NTS but does not appear to activate neurons in the PVH until adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rinaman et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>GLP-1 is derived from its precursor, preproglucagon (PPG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell et al., 1983</xref>) and is not expressed in noradrenergic neurons but represents a distinct subset of glutamatergic neurons in the caudal NTS, and adjacent intermediate reticular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vrang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Llewellyn-Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llewellyn-Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Activation of PPG neurons, either chemogenetically or through vagal stimulation, suppresses food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Williams et al., 2006</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaykema et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and these neurons appear to be directly involved in central regulation of stress-induced hypophagia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maniscalco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Terrill et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, PPG neurons provide direct inputs to the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarkar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vrang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katsurada et al., 2014</xref>) and LepRb are expressed on the majority of PPG neurons in the mouse NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garfield et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that information conveyed byÂ PPG neurons may be modified by circulating leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hisadome et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemmensen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although it is clear that innervation of the PVH by neurons in the ARH is dependent on exposure to leptin during neonatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouyer and Simerly, 2013</xref>), it remains uncertain if leptin is required for normal development of other afferent neural systems. Because innervation of the PVH by GLP-1 axons occurs during a neonatal period of elevated leptin secretionÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahima and Flier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elson and Simerly, 2015</xref>), we used multiple molecular genetic approaches to test the hypothesis that leptin is required to support development of GLP-1 inputs to the PVH.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ontogeny of GLP-1 projections into the PVH</title><p>In neonatal mice, GLP-1 immunoreactive fibers were detected in the PVH as early as P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although GLP-1 fibers are visible at P6, their density is sparse at this age, and the preautonomic compartment of the PVH is nearly devoid of GLP-1 innervation. By P10, the density of GLP-1 immunoreactive fibers increases in neuroendocrine components of the PVH, with the dorsal region of the medial parvicellular part (PVHmpd) more heavily innervated than the ventral parvicellular (PVHmpv) compartment, and at this age, GLP-1 projections begin to extend into the lateral zone of the posterior magnocellular (PVHpml) compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This overall pattern of GLP-1 fiber distribution was maintained through P16, although the density of GLP-1 fibers increased substantially in both the PVHmpd and PVHpml compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By P24, the density of GLP-1 immunolabeled fibers was elevated further, with a higher density observed in the PVHmpd region, compared with that of the PVHpml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). At 2 months of age, the density and distribution of GLP-1 immunoreactive fibers in the PVH achieves levels that are similar to that of adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Throughout development, we observed GLP-1 immunoreactive fibers in the most rostral portions of the PVH (PVHap), or within the caudal preautonomic part of the PVH (PVHlp), but to a lesser degree than the neuroendocrine PVHmpd and PVHpml compartments.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ontogeny of GLP-1 projections into the PVH.</title><p>Maximum intensity projections of confocal images through the PVH of WT (<bold>AâE</bold>) and <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> (<bold>FâJ</bold>) mice illustrate the density of GLP-1 immunoreactive fibers (green) present at postnatal ages P6, P10, P16, P24, and P60.

Following i.p. leptin injection at P16, 82% of SynTom-labeled PPG neurons in the NTS displayed pSTAT3 immunoreactivity, as did the majority of PPG neurons located in the IRT, indicating that PPG neurons are responsive to leptin during postnatal development, which may impact targeting of GLP-1 projections to the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâE</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GLP-1 projections to the PVH are increased in leptin-deficient mice</title><p>To determine if leptin is required for normal development of GLP-1 projections to the hypothalamus, the density of GLP-1 immunoreactive inputs to the PVH was evaluated in leptin-deficient mice. Although immunolabeled GLP-1 fibers were clearly apparent in the PVH by P6 and increased in density over time, no statistically significant differences in their density were detected in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice compared to WT controls, in either the PVHmpd or the PVHpml at either P6 or P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, by P16, the density of GLP-1 immunoreactive fibers in the PVHmpd of <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice was 32% greater than that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,H,M</xref>; p=0.037). At this age, no significant differences were detected in the density of GLP-1 immunoreactive fibers in the PVHpml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,H,M</xref>).

Because expression of GLP-1 immunoreactivity may change in the absence of leptin, we confirmed these findings by using leptin-deficient GCG-Cre::SynTom (GCG-Cre::SynTom::Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> ) mice to visualize axons derived from PPG neurons. In alignment with our immunohistochemical results, at P16 the density of SynTom-labeled inputs was 37.4% higher in the PVHmpd of GCG-Cre::SynTom::Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> mice, and 33.8% higher in the PVHpml, compared with GCG-Cre::SynTom::WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâC</xref>; p=0.0308 and p=0.0408, respectively). Furthermore, the increase in the density of GLP-1 axonal labeling in the PVH was maintained into adulthood: GCG-Cre::SynTom::Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup>mice displayed a 50% increase in the density of GCG-Cre::SynTom inputs to the PVHmpd, and a 40.2% increase in the PVHpml, compared with that of GCG-Cre::SynTom::WT mice at P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DâF</xref>; p=0.0089 and p=0.0045 respectively). Leptin does not affect GLP-1 axonal inputs to the ARH, as no changes were detected in GLP-1 axon density between WT and GCG-Cre::SynTom::Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup>mice, indicating that leptin does not appear to uniformly impact the projection fields of PPG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3GâI</xref>).

Leptin does not alter PPG neuron number in either GCG-Cre::LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup> or LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup> mice, a finding nearly identical to that of the density and distribution of PPG neuron number in leptin-deficient mice (WT: 19.67Â Â±Â 0.8; LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup>: 20.02Â Â±Â 0.2; GCG-Cre::LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup>: 19.78Â Â±Â 0.7 PPG neurons per section).

Injection of CCK in WT mice resulted in a significant increase in the number of Fos immunoreactive nuclei in the PVH compared with WT mice that received saline injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,H</xref>; p=0.0156).

Visceral sensory signals are conveyed from the gut to the brain primarily through vagal signaling. An intact vagus nerve is required for normal regulation of feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwartz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox et al., 2013</xref>) and disrupted NTS to hypothalamus signaling can impair normal patterns of food intake and body weight regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Agostino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). PPG neurons convey viscerosensory information to the hypothalamus and the present study suggests that leptin is required for normal development of GLP-1 projections to the PVH. However, in contrast to its growth-promoting action in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouret et al., 2004a</xref>) our findings indicate that leptin suppresses development of GLP-1 projections to the PVH. This novel finding significantly extends our understanding of how leptin may function to sculpt the organization of neural circuitry underlying regulation of energy balance.</p><p>The development of PVH inputs occurs primarily during the first three weeks of life. Axon tracing studies indicate that ARH fibers first reach the PVH at P10 and achieve an adult distribution by P18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouret et al., 2004a</xref>). Catecholamine inputs into the PVH from the caudal brainstem are also established during postnatal life; dopamine-Î²-hydroxylase (DBH) fibers are present in the PVH at P1, but at a low density, and do not reach adult-like levels until P21. In contrast, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) fibers are observed at a high density in the PVH at P1, and gradually decrease to adult-like levels at P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rinaman, 2001</xref>). We first observed GLP-1 immunoreactive fibers in the PVH at P6, and the density of fibers gradually increased postnatally. This corresponds to a time when pups begin to leave the nest and initiate independent ingestion to enhance growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thiels et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>The density of GLP-1 inputs to neuroendocrine compartments of the PVH are significantly increased in leptin-deficient mice, demonstrating that leptin exposure during postnatal life is required to establish normal densities of GLP-1 inputs to PVH neurons. These findings are surprising, given that leptinâs previously identified role in development was to promote axon outgrowth. Direct application of leptin to ARH explants results in enhanced axon outgrowth, and leptin-deficient mice show decreased AgRP innervation of the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouret et al., 2004b</xref>), suggesting a growth-promoting neurotrophic role for leptin. In contrast to these findings, our results represent the first example of leptin suppressing axon outgrowth in the central nervous system during development. Suppression of axon outgrowth has been demonstrated in other sensory systems. For example, mice with mutations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) display increased sympathetic innervation of hair follicles and enhanced innervation of Merkel cells in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fundin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rice et al., 1998</xref>). Alternatively, malfunction of axon pruning during development may be responsible for the increase in GLP-1 inputs to the PVH in leptin-deficient mice. Early in life, an overabundance of axon targeting is often observed, which is then refined to match neuronal requirements specified by activity or chemical signals. Strong, active inputs to a target region tend to maintain their connections, while weaker inputs are more likely to be pruned. Notably, axons that travel long distances are often pruned, and leptin may play a role in reducing the density of projections from the NTS to the PVH. Regulation of cell number may also be a plausible mechanism for regulating the density of inputs to the PVH from NTS. However, this seems an unlikely explanation for our results, because we did not observe a change in the number of PPG neurons in the NTS of either Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> or Lep<sup>TB/TB</sup> mice. In adult mice, administration of leptin leads to an increase in the activity of PPG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hisadome et al., 2010</xref>), which would appear to be at odds with our results. However, leptin also has divergent actions on AgRP neurons during development and adulthood; during development leptin functions as a neurotrophic factor, promoting axon outgrowth from AgRP neurons, while in adulthood it functions to reflect the levels of body fat stores and inhibits the activity of AgRP neurons. In our study, leptin similarly functions as a neurotrophic factor that is required for the organization of GLP-1 inputs to the PVH early in life, but in contrast to leptinâs growth-promoting role on AgRP neurons, leptin appears to suppress axon outgrowth from PPG neurons.</p><p>Leptin does not appear to suppress GLP-1 inputs uniformly to all PVH neurons. In the absence of leptin, increased innervation of CRH neurons by PPG-derived axons were particularly pronounced, while there was no change in the density of PPG inputs onto Oxytocin neurons. A similar cell-type specificity was observed for the developmental action of leptin on AgRP projections to the PVH. Treatment of neonatal Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> mice with leptin restored AgRP inputs onto PVH preautonomic neurons, yet leptin treatment did not restore AgRP inputs onto neuroendocrine components of the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouyer and Simerly, 2013</xref>). One possible explanation for the target-specific effects of leptin on GLP-1 projections to Oxytocin and CRH neurons is that each cell type may be innervated by different subpopulations of PPG neurons. However, at the current time there is no data suggesting PPG neurons are topographically organized into anatomically or functionally distinct subpopulations, and instead are currently considered to be a homogeneous cell group. Retrograde tracing studies have demonstrated that PPG neurons in the NTS and IRT project to the same terminal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rinaman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vrang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maniscalco and Rinaman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cork et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trapp and Cork, 2015</xref>). Additionally, PPG neurons in both the NTS and IRT express leptin receptors, respond to CCK, and project to the PVH. Nevertheless, our results suggest that GLP-1 innervation of PVH neurons, and the functions they regulate, are not uniformly specified by neonatal exposure to leptin, but that actions mediated by CRH may be particularly impacted by changes in GLP-1 innervation. Consistent with previous reports of altered stress profiles in mice with impaired leptin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deck et al., 2017</xref>), we observed an increase in the amount of time that LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup> mice spent in the closed zone of an elevated plus maze, and a decrease in the number of transitions into a different zone. However, re-expression of LepRb in PPG neurons did not restore normal plus maze performance, suggesting leptin signaling in PPG neurons alone is not sufficient to restore normal behavioral responses.</p><p>Changes in the density of GLP-1 inputs to the PVH in LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup> mice phenocopied those of Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> mice, suggesting LepRb signaling is required to alter the density of GLP-1 inputs to the PVH. Moreover, the developmental action of leptin on projections from PPG neurons to the PVH appears to be cell autonomous. When leptin receptor expression was restored specifically to PPG neurons, the density of GLP-1 inputs in LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup> mice was normalized to wild-type levels, and transmission of viscerosensory activation of PVH neurons in response to i.p. CCK was normalized. Other developmental factors have been shown to act in a cell-autonomous manner. For example, mice with <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutations show severe neurological deficits, and increasing BDNF levels in these mice normalizes physiological and morphological phenotypes observed in the mutants through cell-autonomous signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sampathkumar et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although we found that nearly all PPG neurons respond to leptin during postnatal development, additional postsynaptic factors could play a role in cellular targeting of GLP-1 inputs to PVH neurons. For example, leptin could alter expression of a target-derived factor that specifies GLP-1 density onto particular cell types or onto diverse cell types in functionally distinct domains of the PVH. However, because our data demonstrate that leptin acts directly on PPG neurons to specify GLP-1 fiber density in the PVH, the action of a target-derived factor is probably not responsible for leptinâs suppression of PVH innervation. An alternative mechanism is that synaptic space in the PVH of Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> mice, vacated by the reduction in AgRP afferents, may become occupied by the elevated number of convergent GLP-1 inputs in these mice. A summary schematic of this model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Whether leptin impacts GLP-1 projections to other terminal fields and cell types remains to be determined. However, AgRP and GLP-1 projections converge onto a number of forebrain nuclei where similar rearrangements of synaptic input to distinct subpopulations of neurons may occur.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Leptin is required to specify the normal balance of hormonal and viscerosensory information conveyed by AgRP and GLP-1 inputs that converge onto the PVH.</title><p>During development, the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin is secreted by adipose tissue and binds to leptin receptors (LepRb) located on AgRP neurons in the ARH, and on PPG neurons in the NTS. In animals with normal leptin signaling, the PVH contains a greater density of AgRP inputs compared with that of GLP-1. In the absence of leptin signaling, the density of AgRP inputs to the PVH decreases and those derived from PPG neurons in the NTS increase. Thus, in contrast to the growth-promoting actions of leptin on AgRP neurons, leptin appears to suppress innervation by PPG neurons to the PVH, through a receptor dependent and cell-autonomous mechanism. Leptinâs developmental actions may function to balance excitatory and inhibitory inputs that converge onto multiple populations of PVH neurons and regulate their responsiveness to environmental signals.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59857-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Consistent with the neuroanatomical observation that leptin suppresses the density of projections from PPG neurons to the hypothalamus, we also determined that viscerosensory transmission from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the PVH is dysregulated. It is well-established that systemic administration of CCK activates subdiaphragmatic vagal mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors and that vagal afferents convey this information from the gut to the NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richards et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rinaman, 1999</xref>). In turn, hindbrain neurons that receive this viscerosensory information on GI nutritional status send direct projections to the PVH. Although hindbrain to hypothalamic circuitry is not required for the well-known hypophagic effects of exogenous CCK, the activation of PVH neuroendocrine neurons by CCK requires ascending projections arising from the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maniscalco and Rinaman, 2013</xref>). Thus, changes in levels of Fos labeling in the PVH observed in mice lacking robust leptin signaling are most likely due to alterations in the strength of these viscerosensory afferents.</p><p>Given the marked changes in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological phenotypes observed, it is surprising that re-expression of LepRb to PPG neurons was not sufficient to normalize food intake and anxiety-like behaviors of LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup> mice. Several reports have implicated PPG neurons in the regulation of food intake and body weight by leptin. Knockdown of leptin receptors in the NTS leads to increased food intake and body weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayes et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, deletion of leptin receptors fromPhox2b neurons, which include a subpopulation of PPG neurons in the NTS, resulted in increased food intake, increased body weight, and elevated metabolic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scott et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, chemogenetic activation of PPG neurons led to reduced food intake and metabolic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaykema et al., 2017</xref>), and depletion of PVH GLP-1R resulted in increased food intake and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). It remains unclear why targeted expression of LepRb in PPG neurons did not lead to normalization of behavioral parameters thought to be regulated by PPG neurons, that were found to be altered in LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup> mice. It is possible that the obesity phenotype in LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup> mice is so robust that physiological changes due to restored LepRb signaling in PPG neurons alone may be obscured in these mice. Consistent with this notion, Williams and colleagues found that administration of GLP-1 to obese leptin receptor-deficient Koletsky rats did not impact food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Williams et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, compensatory adaptations may have occurred during development that resulted in no measurable effect on feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>). Leptin may be required for normal GLP-1 innervation to the PVH, but restoration of leptin signaling in PPG neurons alone may not be sufficient to normalize the marked metabolic dysfunction of LepRb<sup>TB/TB</sup> mice. Consistent with this interpretation, recent findings suggest that PPG neurons may not play a central role in the normal regulation of food intake, but rather function to regulate state-dependent consummatory behavior within the context of anxiety and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holt et al., 2018</xref>). PPG neurons appear to be activated under exceptional conditions, so that behavioral actions are aligned with avoidance of immediate danger. During imminent threat or perceived danger, behavioral priorities are reorganized and hypohagia is a secondary consequence. Unless an animal experiences substantial levels of stress or anxiety, PPG neurons may not achieve sufficient activation to produce changes in metabolic state. Therefore, uncovering the physiological impact of leptinâs developmental effects on GLP-1 inputs to the PVH may require a comprehensive evaluation of how anxiety and stress interact to regulate ingestive behavior.</p><p>Although other neural systems regulating energy balance may compensate for perturbations in the density of PPG inputs to the PVH, it is clear that the cellular physiology of PVH GLP-1R expressing neurons is profoundly affected by the developmental actions of leptin. Consistent with the fact that the majority of PPG neurons are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Card et al., 2018</xref>), excitatory neurotransmission is enhanced in GLP-1R expressing neurons in Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> mice, concomitant with elevated GLP-1 innervation. Moreover, the cell-autonomous developmental regulation of GLP-1 inputs to the PVH corresponds with altered neuronal activation in the PVH following stimulation of vagal afferents. Together these findings suggest that during development, leptin signals cell autonomously through its receptor in the NTS to suppress outgrowth of PPG axons, thereby reducing excitatory inputs to PVH GLP-1R, resulting in reduced viscerosensory information being conveyed to PVH neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">tdTomato</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #:007914 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007914">IMSR_JAX:007914</ext-link></td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20023653">20023653</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Gcg-</italic>Cre</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28218622">28218622</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_051056">MMRRC_051056</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Dr. Michael Scott (University of Virginia)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>LepRb-Cre</italic></td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #:032457 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:032457">IMSR_JAX:032457</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Dr. Martin Myers, Jr. (University of Michigan) PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17021368">17021368</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #:000632 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000632">IMSR_JAX:000632</ext-link></td><td valign="top"><italic>Lep<sup>ob/+</sup></italic> heterozygotes were bred to generate homozygous, leptin-deficient mice</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>LepR<sup>TB/TB</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #:018989 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:018989">IMSR_JAX:018989</ext-link></td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22326958">22326958</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Glp1r-Cre</italic></td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #:029283 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:029283">IMSR_JAX:029283</ext-link></td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27238020">27238020</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Synaptophysin-tdTomato</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #:012570 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:012570">IMSR_JAX:012570</ext-link></td><td valign="top">MGI ID: J:170755</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit monoclonal anti-cFos</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 2250S <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2247211">AB_2247211</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-CRF</td><td valign="top">Dr. Paul Sawchenko;

Because the PVH contains functionally discrete subcompartments, we quantified the density of GLP-1 immunolabeled or GCG-Cre::SynTom-labeled fibers in the PVH in anatomically defined ROIs, as well as onto specific cell types. Thus, we quantified GLP-1 input density in the PVHmpd subcompartment, which is involved in the control of hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary, and in the PVHpml, because these cells innervate regions of the brainstem known to regulate autonomic neurons. Moreover, these subcompartments contain the highest density of labeled GLP-1 fibers, as reported previously in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tauchi et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to subnuclear quantification, we also measured the density of GLP-1 inputs onto specific cell types within in the PVH, as leptin has been shown to impact peptidergic innervation of neuroendocrine and sympathetic preautonomic neurons with both cell type and target-neuron specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouyer and Simerly, 2013</xref>). Because it was reported that PPG neurons primarily innervate CRH and Oxytocin neurons in the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tauchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katsurada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanoski et al., 2016</xref>), we measured inputs to CRH and Oxytocin neurons the PVH at higher magnification. Confocal image stacks were collected for each ROI through the entire thickness of the PVH at a frequency of 0.4 Î¼m using the 40x objective and a frequency of 1.19 Î¼m using a 20x objective. Velocity visualization software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was used to prepare 3D reconstructions of each multichannel set of images. To quantify the overall densities of labeled fibers in each ROI of the PVH, a previously validated methodology was utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouyer and Simerly, 2013</xref>). First, images were binarized, skeletonized, and the total fiber length was summed for each ROI throughout the image stack to obtain an estimate of the total density of GLP-1 fibers within that ROI.</p><p>The density of labeled inputs from PPG neurons onto identified CRH and Oxytocin neurons in the PVH was measured in GCG-Cre::SynTom::Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> mice and GCG-Cre::SynTom::WT controls by using Imaris image analysis software (Bitplane V9.2, Salisbury Cove, Maine). Sections containing immunolabeled oxytocin, CRH, and genetically labeled GCG-Cre::SynTom fibers were segmented in each image stack by establishing an intensity threshold. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of image volumes were then rendered for each multi-channel image stack using Imaris. Surface renderings of CRH or Oxytocin neurons were created and GCG-Cre::SynTom-labeled fibers and terminals were defined by using the Spots function. Spots identified as being in close apposition (voxel to voxel apposition) to the neuronal surface renderings were quantified. Voxels containing GCG-Cre::SynTom-labeled neuronal processes that did not make contact with the surface renderings of CRH or oxytocin neurons were excluded from analyses. Numbers of GCG-Cre::SynTom-labeled spots (terminals) were summed and divided by the total number of CRH or oxytocin neurons contained in each image stack to estimate the density of GCG-Cre::SynTom inputs onto each population of PVH neurons. The terms âinputsâ or âterminalsâ used in this study refer to the visualization of synaptophysin-tdTomato (SynTom) labeled axonal structures in close apposition to neuronal cell bodies that were labeled histochemically with CRH, Oxytocin, or the pan-neuronal cell marker HuC/D antibodies. The terms âfibersâ, âaxons,â or âprojectionsâ include, but are not limited to SynTom-labeled axon structures, but also GLP-1 immunohistochemical labeling, which can be detected in axon terminals as well as fibers <italic>en passant</italic>. Quantification of these axonal elements were only considered to be in close apposition onto a target neuron in the PVH if they were touching by voxel-to-voxel contact, with no unlabeled voxels between the presynaptic and postsynaptic elements of the presumptive synapse. Super-resolution optical microscopy, or ultrastructural visualization, will be necessary to directly measure synaptic contacts onto postsynaptic cells, but the density of genetically targeted and immunohistochemically labeled inputs to CRH and Oxytocin neurons appears to correlate with previous estimates of the density of synapses onto identified cell types within the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouyer and Simerly, 2013</xref>).</p><p>To measure the density of Fos labeling in the NTS and PVH that resulted from i.p. injection of CCK, the number of Fos immunoreactive nuclei was counted in maximum projection confocal images through each region aided by Volocity software. Images of sections through the caudal NTS containing labeled GCG-Cre::SynTom neurons were matched using cytoarchitectonic features of the caudal brainstem such as the area postrema, large motor neurons of the DMX, and the central canal and used for quantification. The number of GCG-Cre::SynTom-expressing neurons in each section was counted manually and the number of Fos immunoreactive nuclei was counted using the object counting function in Volocity. The number of Fos immunoreactive nuclei that were colocalized to GCG-Cre::SynTom-expressing neurons in the NTS was expressed as a percentage of the total number of GCG-Cre::SynTom-expressing neurons counted within the caudal NTS. Numbers of Fos immunoreactive nuclei were also counted in the same ROIs through the PVH as described previously for GLP-1 fiber density measurements. Images containing the PVHmpd and PVHpml regions were identified and Volocity software was used to count the total number of Fos positive nuclei in the ROIs in the PVHpml and PVHmpd regions that receive dense GLP-1 inputs. Similarly, the number of pSTAT3 immunoreactive nuclei in LepRb- (LepRb-Cre::tdTom) and in PPG (GCG-Cre::SynTom) neurons was quantified in sections through the NTS by using object counting features of Volocity software and expressed as a percentage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>In order to measure spontaneous synaptic currents, acute brain slices were prepared from GLP-1 R-Cre::tdTom::Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup> and GLP-1 R-Cre::tdTom::WT mice. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5%) and perfused transcardially with ice-cold Choline-Cl slicing solution containing 105 mM Choline-Cl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 mM Glucose, 11 mM Na-ascorbate, 3 mM Na-pyruvate, and 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Mice were decapitated, the brains rapidly removed from the skull and 300 Î¼m-thick coronal sections cut into cold slicing solution on a Leica VT1200S vibratome. Slices were stored in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and maintained at 32Â°C throughout the experiment. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings (at a holding potential of â60 mV) were obtained from the cell bodies of fluorescently identified GLP-1 R-Cre::tdTom neurons. Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were recorded using a Multi-Clamp 700B amplifier. Signals were digitized through a Digidata 1550B, interfaced via pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). All recordings were performed at 32Â°C, maintained with a TC-344B temperature controller connected to an inline heater (64â0102) and heated PH-1 platform (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries with resistances ranging from 3 to 5 Mâ¦ when filled with pipette solution. The bath solution contained 124 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM glucose, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM Na-ascorbate and 1 mM Na-pyruvate. Postsynaptic AMPA-receptor mediated currents in response to spontaneous release of glutamate-containing vesicles from presynaptic terminals were recorded in the presence of the sodium channel blocker TTX (1 ÂµM). The pipette solution contained 120 mM Cesium Methanesulfonate (CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>), 5 mM CsCl, 3 mM Na-ascorbate, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM ethylene glycol-bis-(aminoethyl ethane)-N,N,Nâ,Nâ-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 4 mM Na-ATP, 0.4 mM Na-GTP, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM glucose, 5 mM QX-314 pH 7.25 (CsOH). All signals were digitized at 20 kHz, filtered at 2 kHz, and analyzed offline with Clampfit software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Images of patched cells were captured on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 FS Plus microscope equipped with a Ximea XiQ USB3 Vision camera with a 40x objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral experiments</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Meal pattern testing</title><p>Feeding behavior was measured in 16Ã14Ã13 cm operant chambers (Med Associates). Mice were individually housed and adapted to the chambers one week before meal pattern testing. Mice lived in the operant chambers continuously for two weeks while spontaneous food intake measurements were recorded for 23 hr each day. At the start of each session per day, a fixed ratio (FR) reinforcement schedule was employed and mice needed to successfully press the lever in order to receive a 20 mg food pellet (Bio-Serv; Frenchtown, NJ). The balanced precision pellet diet used in meal pattern testing was comparable to standard chow, with a macronutrient composition of 22% protein, 66% carbohydrate, and 12% fat, with a caloric density of 3.62 kcal/g. Mice started at FR1 on the first day of training and the FR schedule was increased to FR5, FR10, FR20, until the mice reached FR30 and they remained on the FR30 schedule until the end of testing. The FR of 30 was chosen because this schedule was previously determined to minimize pellet waste and loss while reproducing free feeding intake patterns. This meal pattern paradigm was adapted from a previously validated protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richard et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Elevated zero maze</title><p>Mice were adapted to the empty test chamber (27.5 Ã 27.5 cm) for ten minutes before testing.

One pellet of standard chow diet was placed in the center of the arena. Mice were tested individually, and each mouse was placed in the corner of the open field chamber and the total activity and latency to initiate food intake was recorded using animal tracking and recording software (ANYmaze; Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL) for 20 min. The total amount of food consumed was measured.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experimental design and statistical analyses</title><p>Group data are presented as mean valuesÂ Â±Â SEM.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Biddinger and colleagues describe results from a series of studies investigating the effects of leptin on the development of glucagon like peptide 1 neuronal innervation of the hypothalamus. They used multiple genetic models of leptin and leptin receptor deficiency and find that a lack of leptin signal causes increased GLP-1 innervation of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). They also report that neurons expressing GLP-1 receptors have increased activity using patch recordings. Next, the authors also demonstrate that mice lacking leptin or leptin receptor (LepR) signaling have increased neuronal activity following administration of CCK and enhanced excitatory inputs to Glp1R-expressing PVH cells. Based on this evidence the authors suggest that leptin acts to suppress representation of excitatory afferents from PPG neurons and diminish the impact of visceral sensory input to the PVH. Somewhat curiously, reactivation of LepRb signaling in PPG neurons has no effect on the metabolic or behavioral effects accompanying leptin signaling deficiency. Collectively, the studies are well described and provide novel findings that will be of wide interest. The use of complementary mouse models (ob/ob and LepRb TB/TB) and projection tracing techniques strengthens the observations made and make clear that leptin plays a role in the development of PPG inputs to the PVH. The finding that leptin acts to suppress development of PPG inputs to the PVH is novel and will be of interest to developmental neurobiologists.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major issue is that the physiological relevance of these observations is not clear. Though reactivation of LepRb signaling in PPG neurons restores control levels of PVH innervation, there is no change in the energy balance or behavioral abnormalities associated with absence of leptin or leptin signaling. Moreover, given the authors emphasis on demonstrating changes in PPG innervation of CRH neurons in the absence of leptin signaling, the lack of any effect on corticosterone or anxiety-like behaviors is somewhat perplexing. The authors do show that reactivation of LepRb signaling in PPG neurons restores the exaggerated Fos response to CCK injection to wildtype levels, but again the physiologic relevance of this is not explored. At a minimum this needs to be discussed in detail.</p><p>Similarly, the changes observed in the current study appear at the extremes of leptin signaling or expression. That is the authors used leptin deficient and leptin receptor null reactivation mouse models in order to see the altered GLP-1 inputs to the PVH. Are these effects expected to be observed in the context of moderate changes in circulating leptin levels?</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>Regarding the electrophysiology, expanded traces would better illustrate an EPSC that are represented by the fast transients. This could be accomplished by expanding the trace to show the fast rise time and exponential decay of the events.</p><p>Given the demonstrated importance of the timing of leptin action in the development of arcuate hypothalamic to PVH projections, is the impact of leptin on PPG to PVH neural circuitry confined to discrete developmental window? Does leptin administration to ob/ob mice in early life restore normal PPG inputs to the PVH? Placing the &quot;pruning&quot; actions of leptin in the developmental context of leptin's effects on axon outgrowth would benefit our understanding of leptin dependent neural development.</p><p>The suppression of GLP-1 inputs to the PVH does not appear uniform. It might be worth noting whether a quantifiable decrease in GLP-1 terminals in the PVH as a whole is observed versus the need for sub-nuclei quantification.</p><p>Similarly, as noted by the authors, PPG neurons project to multiple brain areas. Unfortunately, none of these other projection areas are examined for leptin-dependent alterations in PPG density. This is important as it would provide insight regarding whether or not the effects of leptin are projection site specific or impact all PPG neurons.</p><p>Beyond the observation that leptin/leptin signaling in PPG neurons suppress PVH inputs, there is limited molecular insight into the underlying mechanisms at play in the &quot;pruning&quot; actions of leptin. The authors mention that PNMT fibers to the PVH decrease from P1 levels to levels seen in adulthood. Are PNMT fibers to the PVH altered by the absence of leptin? Can the absence of leptin alter pruning of neurons that do NOT express leptin receptors?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59857.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major issue is that the physiological relevance of these observations is not clear.

Given the demonstrated importance of GLP-1 input to the PVH it seems unlikely that rescuing the GLP-1 innervation would be of little physiological consequence. Instead, our finding suggests that in the LepRTB/TB model, leptin action on PPG neurons in the NTS is required but not sufficient to produce physiological or behavioral outcomes. Consistent with this interpretation, recent studies on the function of PPG neurons determined that a role for any metabolic effects of PPG neurons is not necessary under ânormalâ conditions, but that PPG neurons are recruited when challenged with stronger physiological stimuli (Holt et al., 2019). Additionally, the leptin-deficient phenotypes are so severe that they may mask a more subtle effect on physiological regulation. We have updated the Discussion to stress this issue and provide more clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the changes observed in the current study appear at the extremes of leptin signaling or expression.

It would be interesting to determine if leptin influences development of GLP-1 projections in a dose-dependent manner. In a separate project currently ongoing in the laboratory, we increased leptin levels during development and also observed effects on GLP-1 innervation, in the opposite direction than those reported here. Although more experiments are necessary, this suggests leptin may âtuneâ GLP-1 inputs to the PVH, and that optimum leptin levels are necessary for proper GLP-1 axon outgrowth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>Regarding the electrophysiology, expanded traces would better illustrate an EPSC that are represented by the fast transients.

Does leptin administration to ob/ob mice in early life restore normal PPG inputs to the PVH? Placing the &quot;pruning&quot; actions of leptin in the developmental context of leptin's effects on axon outgrowth would benefit our understanding of leptin dependent neural development.</p></disp-quote><p>These are interesting questions and suggestions. We agree that these issues should be addressed. One approach would be to give daily injections of leptin during discrete postnatal periods. Such a study may be beyond the scope of the current study and the logistics are quite difficult during the altered work environment imposed by COVID-19. Moreover, a better strategy may be to take a genetic approach. In a collaboration with collaborators at Columbia University, we plan to utilize a conditional, inducible leptin mouse model to examine whether leptin exposure during critical periods of development impacts GLP-1 neuronal projections and metabolic physiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The suppression of GLP-1 inputs to the PVH does not appear uniform. It might be worth noting whether a quantifiable decrease in GLP-1 terminals in the PVH as a whole is observed versus the need for sub-nuclei quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewers, the suppression of PPG inputs to the PVH by leptin is not uniform. The PVH contains functionally discrete compartments that correspond to neuroanatomical features of the nucleus. As demonstrated here, leptin impacts innervation of PVH subcompartments with both cell-type and target-neuron specificity. Since GLP-1 primarily innervates parvicellular neuroendocrine neurons, notably CRH and Oxytocin neurons in the PVH, we chose to focus on these populations. We have added a more detailed rationale for this analysis to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, as noted by the authors, PPG neurons project to multiple brain areas. Unfortunately, none of these other projection areas are examined for leptin-dependent alterations in PPG density. This is important as it would provide insight regarding whether or not the effects of leptin are projection site specific or impact all PPG neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewers, PPG neurons innervate multiple brain regions. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) is implicated in metabolic homeostasis, contains a high density of leptin receptors, and is densely innervated by PPG neurons. Therefore, in the revised manuscript we have included images and quantification of GCG-Cre::SynTom labeling in WT and leptin-deficient mice in the ARH (Figure 3). In contrast to its effects on GLP-1 inputs to the PVH, we did not see a significant change in ARH innervation, suggesting that leptin may influence the distribution of GLP-1 inputs in a target-specific manner. Based on these results, we plan to pursue a separate and more comprehensive study on the effects of leptin on development of GLP-1 inputs to all of its major terminal fields.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Beyond the observation that leptin/leptin signaling in PPG neurons suppress PVH inputs, there is limited molecular insight into the underlying mechanisms at play in the &quot;pruning&quot; actions of leptin. The authors mention that PNMT fibers to the PVH decrease from P1 levels to levels seen in adulthood. Are PNMT fibers to the PVH altered by the absence of leptin? Can the absence of leptin alter pruning of neurons that do NOT express leptin receptors?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. At this time, we do not know if leptin impacts the development of PNMT fibers to the PVH. Several studies have shown that catecholamine neurons in the NTS do not express leptin receptors. However, this does not exclude a role for leptin during development on catecholaminergic projections from the hindbrain to the PVH. The other issue raised about whether leptin can impact circuit architecture through mechanisms that are independent of leptin receptors is currently being investigated in an unrelated study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
