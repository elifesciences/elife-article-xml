Their effect on spontaneously developing autoimmune diseases has been little explored. We report that a short treatment with I-BET151, a small-molecule inhibitor of a family of bromodomain-containing transcriptional regulators, irreversibly suppressed development of type-1 diabetes in NOD mice. The inhibitor could prevent or clear insulitis, but had minimal influence on the transcriptomes of infiltrating and circulating T cells. Rather, it induced pancreatic macrophages to adopt an anti-inflammatory phenotype, impacting the NF-κB pathway in particular. I-BET151 also elicited regeneration of islet β-cells, inducing proliferation and expression of genes encoding transcription factors key to β-cell differentiation/function. The effect on β cells did not require T cell infiltration of the islets. Thus, treatment with I-BET151 achieves a ‘combination therapy’ currently advocated by many diabetes investigators, operating by a novel mechanism that coincidentally dampens islet inflammation and enhances β-cell regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04631.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04631.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04631.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA inside a cell is often tightly wrapped around proteins to form a compact structure called chromatin. Chemical groups added to the chromatin can encourage nearby genes to either be switched on or off; and several enzymes and other proteins help to read, add, or remove these marks from the chromatin. If these chromatin modifications (or the related enzymes and proteins) are disturbed it can lead to diseases like cancer. It has also been suggested that similar changes may influence autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues.</p><p>Drugs that target the proteins that read, add, or remove these chromatin modifications are currently being developed to treat cancer. For example, drugs that inhibit one family of these proteins called BET have helped to treat tumors in mice that have cancers of the blood or lymph nodes. However, because these drugs target pathways involved in the immune system they may also be useful for treating autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Now Fu et al. have tested whether a BET inhibitor might be a useful treatment for type-1 diabetes. In patients with type-1 diabetes, the cells in the pancreas that produce the insulin hormone are killed off by the immune system. Without adequate levels of insulin, individuals with type-1 diabetes may experience dangerous highs and lows in their blood sugar levels and must take insulin and sometimes other medications.</p><p>Using mice that spontaneously develop type-1 diabetes when still relatively young, Fu et al. tested what would happen if the mice received a BET inhibitor for just 2 weeks early on in life. Treated mice were protected from developing type-1 diabetes for the rest of their lives. Specifically, the treatment protected the insulin-producing cells and allowed them to continue producing insulin. The drug reduced inflammation in the pancreas and increased the expression of genes that promote the regeneration of insulin-producing cells.</p><p>Diabetes researchers have been searching for drug combinations that protect the insulin-producing cells and boost their regeneration. As such, Fu et al. suggest that these findings justify further studies to see if BET inhibitors may help to treat or prevent type-1 diabetes in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04631.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04631.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>autoimmune diabetes</kwd><kwd>bromodomain inhibitor</kwd><kwd>NF-KB</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1 AI054904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benoist</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathis</surname><given-names>Diane</given-names></name><name><surname>Weissleder</surname><given-names>Ralph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004330</institution-id><institution>GlaxoSmithKline</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sponsored Research Agreement</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benoist</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathis</surname><given-names>Diane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006691</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Schuyler Pierce Memorial Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Wenxian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A short treatment of the NOD mouse model of type-1 diabetes with I-BET151, a small molecule bromodomain blocker, provides long-term protection from disease by inducing macrophages to adapt an anti-inflammatory tenor whilst promoting islet β cell regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acetylation of lysine residues on histones and non-histone proteins is an important epigenetic modification of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kouzarides, 2000</xref>). Multiple ‘writers’, ‘erasers’, and ‘readers’ of this modification have been identified: histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that introduce acetyl groups, histone deacetylases (HDACs) that remove them, and bromodomain (BRD)-containing proteins that specifically recognize them. Chromatin acetylation impacts multiple fundamental cellular processes, and its dysregulation has been linked to a variety of disease states, notably various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dawson and Kouzarides, 2012</xref>). Not surprisingly, then, drugs that modulate the activities of HATs or HDACs or, most recently, that block acetyl-lysine:BRD interactions are under active development in the oncology field.</p><p>BRDs, conserved from yeast to humans, are domains of approximately 110 amino-acids that recognize acetylation marks on histones (primarily H3 and H4) and certain non-histone proteins (e.g., the transcription factor, NF-κB), and serve as scaffolds for the assembly of multi-protein complexes that regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prinjha et al., 2012</xref>). The BET subfamily of BRD-containing proteins (BRDs 2, 3, 4 and T) is distinguished as having tandem <bold>b</bold>romodomains followed by an ‘<bold>e</bold>xtra-<bold>t</bold>erminal’ domain. One of its members, Brd4, is critical for both ‘bookmarking’ transcribed loci post-mitotically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>) and surmounting RNA polymerase pausing downstream of transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hargreaves et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patel et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recently, small-molecule inhibitors of BET proteins, for example, JQ1 and I-BET, were found to be effective inhibitors of multiple types of mouse tumors, including a NUT midline carcinoma, leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filippakopoulos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>). A major, but not the unique, focus of inhibition was the Myc pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Delmore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mertz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zuber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lockwood et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, BET-protein inhibitors could prevent or reverse endotoxic shock induced by systemic injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belkina et al., 2013</xref>). The primary cellular focus of action was macrophages, and genes induced by the transcription factor NF-κB were key molecular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nicodeme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belkina et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Given several recent successes at transposing drugs developed for cancer therapy to the context of autoimmunity, it was logical to explore the effect of BET-protein inhibitors on autoimmune disease. We wondered how they might impact type-1 diabetes (T1D), hallmarked by specific destruction of the insulin-producing β cells of the pancreatic islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bluestone et al., 2010</xref>). NOD mice, the ‘gold standard’ T1D model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Bluestone, 2005</xref>), spontaneously and universally develop insulitis at 4–6 weeks of age, while overt diabetes manifests in a subset of individuals beginning from 12–15 weeks, depending on the particular colony. NOD diabetes is primarily a T-cell-mediated disease, but other immune cells—such as B cells, natural killer cells, macrophages (MFs) and dendritic cells (DCs)—also play significant roles. We demonstrate that a punctual, 2-week, treatment of early- or late-stage prediabetic NOD mice with I-BET151 affords long-term protection from diabetes. Mechanistic dissection of this effect revealed important drug influences on both MFs and β cells, in particular on the NF-κB pathway. On the basis of these findings, we argue that epigenetic modifiers are an exciting, emerging option for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>I-BET151 protects NOD mice from development of diabetes</title><p>T1D progresses through identifiable phases, which are differentially sensitive to therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bluestone et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we treated NOD mice with the BET-protein inhibitor, I-BET151 (GSK1210151A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seal et al., 2012</xref>]) according to three different protocols: from 3–5 weeks of age (incipient insulitis), from 12–14 weeks of age (established insulitis), or for 2 weeks beginning within a day after diagnosis of hyperglycemia (diabetes). Blood-glucose levels of insulitic mice were monitored until 30 weeks of age, after which animals in our colony generally do not progress to diabetes.</p><p>I-BET151 prevented diabetes development, no matter whether the treated cohort had incipient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) insulitis. However, the long-term protection afforded by a 2-week treatment of pre-diabetic mice was only rarely observed with recent-onset diabetic animals. Just after diagnosis, individuals were given a subcutaneous insulin implant, which lowers blood-glucose levels to the normal range within 2 days, where they remain for only about 7 days in the absence of further insulin supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper and right panels). Normoglycemia was significantly prolonged in mice treated for 2 weeks with I-BET151; but, upon drug removal, hyperglycemia rapidly ensued in most animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lower and right panels). The lack of disease reversal under these conditions suggests that β-cell destruction had proceeded to the point that dampening the autoinflammatory attack was not enough to stem hyperglycemia. However, there was prolonged protection from diabetes in a few cases, suggesting that it might prove worthwhile to explore additional treatment designs in future studies.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04631.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>I-BET151 inhibits diabetes and insulitis in NOD mice.</title><p>Female NOD mice were treated with I-BET151 in DMSO (10 mg/kg daily) or just DMSO from 3–5 weeks (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) or 12–14 weeks (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>E</bold>) of age.

Analogous to the protocols employed above, NOD mice were treated with I-BET151 from 3–5 or 12–14 weeks of age, and their pancreas was excised for histology at 10 weeks (5 weeks being too early for quantification) or 14 weeks, respectively. Drug treatment prevented effective installation of insulitis in the young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and reversed established insulitis in the older animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed flow cytometric analysis of the pancreatic infiltrate. In this and subsequent mechanistic studies, we focused mainly on the 12–14-week treatment protocol because, of the successful regimens, it better models what might eventually be applied to humans. Consistent with the histological results, fewer total leukocytes (CD45<sup>+</sup> cells) were found in the pancreas, but not the spleen, of mice administered I-BET151 from 12–14 weeks of age, <italic>vis a vis</italic> vehicle-only controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The drop in pancreas-infiltrating cells in animals treated with the inhibitor was equally true of all populations examined (encompassing the major lymphoid and myeloid subsets) as their fractional representation within the bulk CD45<sup>+</sup> compartment appeared to be unaltered in drug- vs vehicle-treated individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BET protein inhibition has a minimal effect on T cells in NOD mice</title><p>Given that NOD diabetes is heavily dependent on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Bluestone, 2005</xref>), and that a few recent reports have highlighted an influence of BET-protein inhibitors on the differentiation of T helper (Th) subsets in induced models of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandukwala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mele et al., 2013</xref>), we explored the effect of I-BET151 treatment on the transcriptome of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from relevant sites; that is, the infiltrated pancreas, draining pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs), and control inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs). Microarray analysis of gene expression revealed surprisingly little impact of the 2-week treatment protocol on any of these populations, similar to what was observed when comparing randomly shuffled datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It is possible that the above protocol missed important effects on T cells because those remaining after prolonged drug treatment were skewed for ‘survivors’. Therefore, we also examined the transcriptomes of pancreas-infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at just 12, 24 or 48 hr after a single administration of I-BET151. Again, minimal, background-level, differences were observed in the gene-expression profiles of drug- and vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04631.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Little impact of BET-protein inhibition on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in NOD mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Microarray-based transcriptional profiling of TCR<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells sorted from pancreata, pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) and inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs).

Bandukwala et al. found that I-BET762 (a small-molecule inhibitor similar to I-BET151) altered the differentiation of Th subsets in vitro, perturbing the typical profiles of cytokine production, and reducing the neuropathology provoked by transfer of in-vitro-differentiated Th1, but not Th17, cells reactive to a peptide of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandukwala et al., 2012</xref>). Unfortunately, with such transfer models, it is difficult to know how well the in vitro processes reflect in vivo events, and to distinguish subsidiary effects on cell survival and homing. Mele et al. reported that JQ1 primarily inhibited the differentiation of and cytokine production by Th17 cells, and strongly repressed collagen-induced arthritis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mele et al., 2013</xref>). However, with adjuvant-induced disease models such as these, it is difficult to discriminate influences of the drug on the unfolding of autoimmune pathology vs on whatever the adjuvant is doing. Thus, the very different dual mechanism we propose for I-BET151's impact on spontaneously developing T1D in NOD mice may reflect several factors, including (but not limited to): pathogenetic differences in induced vs spontaneous autoimmune disease models; our broader analyses of immune target cell populations; and true mechanistic differences between T1D and the other diseases. As concerns the latter, it has been argued that T1D is primarily a Th1-driven disease, with little, or even a negative regulatory, influence by Th17 cells (discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kriegel et al., 2011</xref>]).</p><p>Second, how does I-BET151's effect, focused on MFs and β cells, lead to life-long protection from T1D? MFs seem to play a schizophrenic role in the NOD disease. They were shown long ago to be an early participant in islet infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jansen et al., 1994</xref>), and to play a critical effector role in diabetes pathogenesis, attributed primarily to the production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators, such as iNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hutchings et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jun et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calderon et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, there has been a growing appreciation of their regulatory role in keeping diabetes in check. For example, the frequency of a small subset of pancreatic MFs expressing the complement receptor for immunoglobulin (a.k.a. CRIg) at 6–10 weeks of age determined whether or not NOD diabetes would develop months later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fu et al., 2012b</xref>), and transfer of in-vitro-differentiated M2, but not M1, MFs protected NOD mice from disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parsa et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>One normally thinks of immunological tolerance as being the purview of T and B cells, but MFs seem to be playing the driving role in I-BET151's long-term immunologic impact on T1D. Chronic inflammation (as is the insulitis associated with T1D) typically entails three classes of participant: myeloid cells, in particular, tissue-resident MFs; lymphoid cells, including effector and regulatory T and B cells; and tissue-target cells, that is, islet β cells in the T1D context. The ‘flavor’ and severity of inflammation is determined by three-way interactions amongst these cellular players. One implication of this cross-talk is that a perturbation that targets primarily one of the three compartments has the potential to rebalance the dynamic process of inflammation, resetting homeostasis to a new level either beneficial or detrimental to the individual. BET-protein inhibition skewed the phenotype of pancreatic MFs towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype, whether this be at the population level through differential influx, efflux or death, or at the level of individual cells owing to changes in transcriptional programs. The ‘re-educated’ macrophages appeared to be more potent at inhibiting T cell proliferation. In addition, it is possible that MFs play some role in the I-BET151 influences on β-cell regeneration. The findings on Rag1-deficient mice ruled out the need for adaptive immune cells in the islet infiltrate for I-BET151's induction of β-cell proliferation, but MFs are not thought to be compromised in this strain. Relatedly, the lack of a consistent I-BET151 effect on cultured mouse and human islets might result from a dearth of MFs under our isolation and incubation conditions (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2009</xref>]). Several recent publications have highlighted a role for MFs, particularly M2 cells, in promoting regeneration of β cells in diverse experimental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brissova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>), a function foretold by the reduced β-cell mass in MF-deficient <italic>Csf1</italic><sup><italic>op/op</italic></sup> mice reported a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banaei-Bouchareb et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Whether reflecting a cell-intrinsic or -extrinsic impact of the drug, several pro-regenerative pathways appear to be enhanced in β-cells from I-BET151-treated mice. Increased β-cell proliferation could result from up-regulation of the genes encoding Neurod1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kojima et al., 2003</xref>), GLP-1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Leon et al., 2003</xref>), or various of the Reg family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Unno et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), the latter perhaps a consequence of higher IL-22R expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hill et al., 2013</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Protection of β-cells from apoptosis is likely to be an important outcome of inhibiting the NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takahashi et al., 2010</xref>), but could also issue from enhanced expression of other known pro-survival factors, such as Cntfr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rezende et al., 2007</xref>) and Tox3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dittmer et al., 2011</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4 and 6B</xref>). Lastly, β-cell differentiation and function should be fostered by up-regulation of genes encoding transcription factors such as Neurod1, Pdx1, Pax6, Nkx6-1 and Nkx2-2. The significant delay in re-onset of diabetes in I-BET151-treated diabetic mice suggests functionally relevant improvement in β-cell function. In brief, the striking effect of I-BET151 on T1D development in NOD mice seems to reflect the fortunate concurrence of a complex, though inter-related, set of diabetes-protective processes.</p><p>Lastly, why does a drug that inhibits BET proteins, which include general transcription factors such as Brd4, have such circumscribed effects? A 2-week I-BET151 treatment might be expected to provoke numerous side-effects, but this regimen seemed in general to be well tolerated in our studies. This conundrum has been raised in several contexts of BET-inhibitor treatment, and was recently discussed at length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shi and Vakoc, 2014</xref>). The explanation probably relates to two features of BET-protein, in particular Brd4, biology. First: Brd4 is an important element of so-called ‘super-enhancers’, defined as unusually long transcriptional enhancers that host an exceptionally high density of TFs—both cell-type-specific and general factors, including RNA polymerase-II, Mediator, p300 and Brd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>). They are thought to serve as chromatin depots, collecting TFs and coordinating their delivery to transcriptional start-sites via intra-chromosome looping or inter-chromosome interactions. Super-enhancers are preferentially associated with loci that define and control the biology of particular cell-types, notably developmentally regulated and inducible genes; intriguingly, disease-associated, including T1D-associated, nucleotide polymorphisms are especially enriched in the super-enhancers of disease-relevant cell-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parker et al., 2013</xref>). Genes associated with super-enhancers show unusually high sensitivity to BET-protein inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chapuy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loven et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). Second: although the bromodomain of Brd4 binds to acetyl-lysine residues on histone-4, and I-BET151 was modeled to inhibit this interaction, it is now known to bind to a few non-histone chromosomal proteins as well, notably NF-κB, a liaison also blocked by BET-protein inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zou et al., 2014</xref>). Abrogating specific interactions such as these, differing according to the cellular context, might be the dominant impact of BET inhibitors, a scenario that would be consistent with the similar effects we observed with I-BET151 and BAY 11–7082 treatment. Either or both of these explanations could account for the circumscribed effect of I-BET151 on NOD diabetes. Additionally, specificity might be imparted by different BET-family members or isoforms—notably both Brd2 and Brd4 are players in MF inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belkina et al., 2013</xref>). According to either of these explanations, higher doses might unleash a broader array of effects.</p><p>Viewed in the context of recent reports, our data point to NF-κB as a direct target of I-BET151. Traditionally, Brd4's impact on transcription has been thought to reflect its binding to histone acetyl-lysine residues, as a so-called ‘histone reader’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prinjha et al., 2012</xref>). Analogously, the influence of I-BET151 (and like drugs) on Brd4 function has generally been attributed to Brd4 interactions with acetylated histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prinjha et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is now clear that I-BET 151 directly targets Brd4's association with non-histone proteins as well. The best-studied example is NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nowak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zou et al., 2014</xref>). The two bromodomains of Brd4 cooperatively recognize RelA acetylated at the K310 position, and this interaction is blocked by drugs like I-BET151 and JQ1.</p><p>Of late, there has been substantial interest in treating individuals with, or at risk of, T1D with combination therapies. It would seem logical to design a combinatorial approach that targets two or more of the major players in disease—perhaps optimally, addressing elements of the innate immune system, adaptive immune system and islet target tissue. We have demonstrated that a single drug, the BRD blocker I-BET151, has a potent effect on T1D in pre-diabetic NOD mice by coincidentally influencing MFs and β cells. Recently, another drug from the cancer world, the HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat, was reported to inhibit T1D, by a seemingly different mechanism impacting a multiplicity of cell-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, epigenetic modulators would seem to be exciting candidates to explore in human T1D patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and disease evaluation</title><p>NOD/Lt mice were bred under specific-pathogen–free conditions in our animal facility at the New Research Building of Harvard Medical School, cared for in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
