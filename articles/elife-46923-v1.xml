But the measurements they provide differ from the truth, often dramatically, because these experiments are biased toward detecting some taxa over others. This experimental bias makes the taxon or gene abundances measured by different protocols quantitatively incomparable and can lead to spurious biological conclusions. We propose a mathematical model for how bias distorts community measurements based on the properties of real experiments. We validate this model with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from defined bacterial communities. Our model better fits the experimental data despite being simpler than previous models. We illustrate how our model can be used to evaluate protocols, to understand the effect of bias on downstream statistical analyses, and to measure and correct bias given suitable calibration controls. These results illuminate new avenues toward truly quantitative and reproducible metagenomics measurements.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metagenomics</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>16S rRNA gene</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>bias</kwd><kwd>calibration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mathematical model of bias in marker-gene and metagenomic sequencing measurements explains systematic errors in defined mixtures of microbial species, and enables quantitative and reproducible investigation of biological communities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Marker-gene and metagenomic sequencing (jointly, MGS) have transformed the study of biological communities. Extracting and sequencing total DNA from a community can identify thousands of taxa along with their genes and potential functions, while sequencing a phylogenetic marker gene (e.g. 16S rRNA) can quantify taxon abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quince et al., 2017</xref>). MGS measurements of microbial communities are yielding fundamental new insights into the structure and dynamics of microbial ecosystems and the roles of microbes as drivers of host and ecosystem health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zeevi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knight et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callahan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lehman et al., 2015</xref>). Applications of MGS, often under the alternative terms eDNA sequencing or metabarcoding, increasingly extend beyond microbes to the measurement and monitoring of plants, insects, and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krehenwinkel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>). MGS methods are now being adopted in fields ranging from food safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cocolin et al., 2018</xref>) to wastewater remediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosso et al., 2018</xref>) to forensics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metcalf et al., 2017</xref>) along with biology and medicine. Unfortunately, however, the community compositions measured by MGS are wrong.</p><p>MGS measurements are <italic>biased</italic>: The measured relative abundances of the taxa and genes in the sample are systematically distorted from their true values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). Bias arises because each step in an experimental MGS workflow preferentially measures (i.e. preserves, extracts, amplifies, sequences, or bioinformatically identifies) some taxa over others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hugerth and Andersson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollock et al., 2018</xref>). For example, bacterial species differ in how easily they are lysed and therefore how much DNA they yield during DNA extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al., 2017</xref>), and they differ in their number of 16S rRNA gene copies and thus how much PCR product we expect to obtain per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kembel et al., 2012</xref>). Most sources of bias are protocol-dependent: Different PCR primers preferentially amplify different sets of taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sipos et al., 2007</xref>), different extraction protocols can produce 10-fold or greater differences in the measured proportion of a taxon from the same sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al., 2017</xref>), and almost every choice in an MGS experiment has been implicated as contributing to bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Amore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hugerth and Andersson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollock et al., 2018</xref>). Every MGS experiment is biased to some degree, and measurements from different protocols are quantitatively incomparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nayfach and Pollard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hiergeist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mallick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibbons et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The biases of MGS protocols and the error those biases introduce remain unknown. Thus we do not know whether the measured taxonomic or gene compositions derived from MGS are accurate, or to what extent the biological conclusions derived from them are valid. It is common to assume that conclusions drawn from measurements using the same protocol are robust to MGS bias. But simulated examples have shown that bias can lead to qualitatively incorrect conclusions about which taxa dominate different samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kembel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgar, 2017</xref>), which ecosystems are more similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kembel et al., 2012</xref>), and which taxa are associated with a given disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, variation in bias limits our ability to make the direct comparisons between results from different experiments that are central to the scientific process. It has been suggested that these issues would be circumvented if bias were the same in every experiment, leading to a number of efforts to define and promulgate standardized MGS protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al., 2017</xref>). However, methodological standardization has several limitations. For example, it can be overly restrictive given the variety of ecosystems and biological questions where MGS methods are applied as well as the continual advance in technology, and unmeasured technical variability can introduce experiment-specific biases into nominally standardized methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>). More important, standardized protocols remain biased and thus still do not provide accurate measurements of the underlying communities.</p><p>Current attempts to counter bias are limited and of unknown efficacy because of our poor understanding of how bias across the full experimental workflow distorts MGS measurements. Hundreds of published studies compare MGS measurements of defined samples to their expected composition in an effort to characterize the bias of the given protocol (many cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hugerth and Andersson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollock et al., 2018</xref>). But this approach has limited value so long as we do not know how the error observed in one sample translates to differently composed samples. If we understood how bias acts across samples we might be able to estimate the effect of bias from measurements of samples of defined composition and use those estimates to calibrate measurements of samples of interest to their true values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hardwick et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, natural communities measured by multiple experiments could be used to calibrate measurements between experiments using different protocols. A quantitative understanding of how bias distorts MGS measurements would also elucidate how statistical analyses and diagnostics are affected by bias and suggest more robust alternatives.</p><p>Here we propose and test a mathematical model of how bias distorts taxonomic compositions measured by MGS from their true values. In our model, bias manifests as a multiplication of the true relative abundances by taxon- and protocol-specific factors that are constant across samples of varying compositions. We validate key components of this model, including that bias acts independently on each taxon in a sample, in 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing data from bacterial communities of defined composition. We use our proposed model to quantify bias, to partition bias into steps such as DNA extraction and PCR amplification, and to reason about the effects of bias on downstream statistical analyses. Finally, we demonstrate how this model can be used to correct biased MGS measurements when suitable controls are available.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A mathematical model of MGS bias</title><p>Consider a marker-gene or metagenomic sequencing (MGS) experiment as a multi-step transformation that takes as input biological material and provides as output the taxonomic profile corresponding to each sample—the set of measured taxa and their associated relative abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each step introduces systematic and random errors that cumulatively lead to error in the measured taxonomic profiles. <italic>Bias</italic> is a particular, ubiquitous form of systematic error that arises from the different efficiencies with which various taxa are measured (i.e. preserved, extracted, amplified, sequenced, or bioinformatically identified and quantified) at each step.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46923.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bias arises throughout an MGS workflow, creating systematic error between the observed and actual compositions.</title><p>Panel <bold>A</bold> illustrates a hypothetical marker-gene measurement of an even mixture of three taxa.

For instance, the DNA concentration of a taxon after DNA extraction equals its initial cell concentration multiplied by its DNA yield per cell. This per-cell yield indicates the efficiency of extraction for the taxon, which is is expected to depend on factors such as genome size and the structure of the taxon’s cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we expect extraction efficiencies to vary among taxa, but be approximately constant for any specific taxon across samples treated with the same protocol. Other multiplicative sources of bias include variation in PCR binding and amplification efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wagner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki and Giovannoni, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Polz and Cavanaugh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgar, 2017</xref>) and in marker-gene copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kembel et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Inspired by these observations, we propose that at every step in an MGS experiment, the output abundances of individual taxa differ from the input abundances by taxon-specific multiplicative factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which we refer to as the <italic>measurement efficiencies</italic> in that step. The measurement efficiencies are determined by the interaction between the experimental protocol and the biological/chemical/physical/informatic state of each taxon in that step, and are therefore independent of the composition of the sample. Typical MGS experiments only measure relative rather than absolute abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gloor et al., 2017</xref>), and the change in the <italic>relative abundances</italic> during a step depend only on the <italic>relative efficiencies</italic>. This yields the following mathematical model of bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): The relative abundances measured in an MGS experiment are equal to the input relative abundances multiplied by taxon-specific but composition-independent factors (the relative efficiencies) at every step.</p><p>The mathematical accounting of bias is simplified by the use of <italic>compositional vectors</italic>: vectors for which only the ratios among elements carry meaning.

Intuitively, bias leads to over-estimation of taxa that are more easily measured than the community average in the given sample. As a result, the same taxon can be over-estimated in samples dominated by low-efficiency taxa and under-estimated in samples dominated by high-efficiency taxa.</p><p>To illustrate, we consider the hypothetical measurement of a second community sample (Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) alongside that of the even sample from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The dominance of the low-efficiency Taxon 1 in Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf47"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> substantially lowers its sample mean efficiency compared to the even-mixture Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, changing the fold-error in all taxon proportions. In particular, Taxon 3 changes from having a lower-than-average efficiency in Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> to a higher-than-average efficiency in Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Unfortunately, simulating measurement under our model easily provides examples where common analyses give qualitatively incorrect results. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, for example, bias causes the uneven Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf53"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> to appear to have a more even distribution of taxa than the perfectly even Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf54"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. As a result, any analysis of alpha diversity that incorporates evenness (e.g. the Shannon or Inverse Simpson indices) will incorrectly conclude that Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf55"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is more diverse. The previous section provides a general explanation as to why, for many analyses, bias does not simply cancel: The underlying statistics are functions of the individual taxon proportions, the error of which varies inconsistently across samples. Consequently, proportion-based analyses can lead to qualitatively incorrect conclusions. As a further example, the actual proportion of Taxon 3 decreases from Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf56"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> to Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf57"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, but the measured proportion increases!</p><p>In contrast, the fold-error in taxon ratios is independent of sample composition, and fold-changes in taxon ratios across samples are insensitive to bias.

The compositions measured from DNA mixtures were affected by large systematic errors that were well explained by our model, while the systematic error in compositions measured from the PCR mixtures was small compared to the random errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, the bias in DNA mixtures substantially differed from the bias in the cell mixtures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This observation suggests that PCR (performed in both experiments) and DNA extraction (performed only in the cell-mixture experiment) are both large, independent sources of bias that each act in accordance with our model.</p><p>Our model better explains the data from the cell and DNA mixtures than proposed alternatives while employing a small number of parameters (6, equal to the number of taxa minus 1). Two recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krehenwinkel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2019</xref>) used simple linear regression of the observed proportion of a taxon against its actual proportion, which uses 7 or 14 parameters for all taxa depending on whether intercept terms are included. Such models do not constrain the observed proportions to the [0, 1] interval. More critically, they cannot explain that the observed proportion of a given taxon can be higher than or lower than its actual proportion in samples of different composition (e.g. <italic>L. crispatus</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), while such behavior is a straightforward consequence of our model. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> attempted to overcome this limitation by adding second and third-order interaction terms between taxa to the linear model. This model obtains a close fit at the cost of vastly increased model complexity—441 parameters for all taxa instead of just 6. As a result, the interactions model is likely to overfit and poorly predict the measured compositions with different compositions from which it is trained on. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> compares the fit of our model to the simple linear model and the linear interactions model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples with a spike-in mock community</title><p>The Phase III experiment of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al.

The mock spike-in contained 10 bacterial taxa with known abundance spanning 2.5 orders of magnitude and (unintentionally) an <italic>Escherichia/Shigella</italic> contaminant with unknown true abundance. It was added to fecal specimens from eight individuals as well as a blank ‘mock-only’ sample. DNA was then extracted from each specimen using three distinct DNA extraction protocols (Protocols H, Q, and W) and measured via a common shotgun sequencing protocol. Here we test whether bias among the spike-in taxa is consistent across the varying backgrounds of the nine specimens.</p><p>Taxonomic profiles measured by MetaPhlAn2 (Materials and methods) showed substantial variation in the native bacterial composition across fecal specimens and in the proportion formed by the spike-in, both of which were protocol-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, the observed relative abundances of the spike-in taxa were consistent across specimens for a given protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This observation is what we expect given that the true spike-in composition is fixed, since our model predicts that the error in the ratios among the spike-in taxa is independent of the presence and abundance of other taxa. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows abundances relative to the geometric mean of the 10 mock taxa. The average difference between the observed and actual abundance for each taxon estimates the bias of the protocol in terms of the taxon’s efficiency relative to the average taxon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The bias shows qualitative differences between protocols, with certain mock taxa being enriched by one protocol and diminished by another. Also, the consistent difference in the observed relative abundance of the contaminant indicates a consistent differential bias between Protocol W and the other two protocols of the contaminant relative to the 10 mock taxa. These results indicate a consistent and unique bias associated with each protocol when bias is measured in accordance to our model.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46923.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Bias of the mock spike-in in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al.

Because noise was much weaker than bias, standard errors were less than the bias even for a single control measurement, suggesting substantial benefits from calibration even with a limited number of control observations. The results further suggest that three or four control measurements for a taxon substantially reduces the risk of inaccurate bias estimates due to occasional large random errors.</p><p>Differential bias between experiments (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 8</xref>) can be estimated from samples common to each experiment, even if the actual composition of the common samples is unknown. Differential bias can then be used to calibrate measurements from various experiments to those of a chosen reference protocol, thereby making measured compositions from different experiments quantitatively comparable even if their fidelity to the true compositions remains unclear. We illustrate calibration to a reference protocol using the multi-protocol design of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al.

We provide two such statistics for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> experiment in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al.

The maximum pairwise bias, equal to the geometric range of the relative efficiencies, indicates the maximum error due to bias in the ratio of any two taxa. The average pairwise bias indicates the magnitude of the multiplicative error averaged over all pairs of taxa. For the three shotgun protocols in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, these statistics indicate that Protocol H has a much larger bias than the other two protocols, though one should keep in mind that the large values for Protocol H are heavily influenced by its extremely low efficiency for <italic>L. plantarum</italic> and high efficiency for <italic>F. nucleatum</italic>. Summarizing the residual error in the control samples leads to an analogous average pairwise measure of the noise, or random error, associated with each protocol, which we also include in the tables. The noise measure for the three shotgun protocols indicates that, in this case, the least biased protocol (Protocol Q) also yielded the noisiest measurements of the mock taxa. However, the average noise of the protocols decreases with the propensity of the protocol to sequence the mock over the native gut taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that the greater noise of Protocol Q may be at least partially an artifact of limited sequencing depth.</p><p>Given suitable experimental designs, the estimated vectors of relative efficiencies can be used to quantify the bias attributable to specific parts of the workflow (Materials and methods and Appendix 1). In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> study, the same MGS workflow was run from different starting points: cells, extracted DNA, and PCR product. Comparing the bias resulting from different starting points leads to estimates of the bias attributable to DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing plus (bio)informatics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). For instance, dividing the relative efficiencies measured in the cell mixtures by those in the PCR mixtures provides an estimate of the bias that arises during DNA extraction. These estimates indicate that for these taxa and workflow, DNA extraction is the largest single source of bias, although PCR bias was also substantial. We can alternately understand these estimates through their predicted effect on the composition of an even mixture of taxa as it moves through the experimental workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which clearly shows how extraction and PCR can oppose each other or work together. PCR and extraction bias acted in opposite directions for some taxa, such as <italic>L. crispatus</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic>, and in the same direction for others, such as <italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and for <italic>L. iners</italic>, leading to more moderate or extreme total relative efficiencies, respectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46923.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> experiment, bias is primarily driven by DNA extraction and is not substantially reduced by 16S copy-number (CN) correction.</title><p>Panel <bold>A</bold> shows the bias estimate for each step in the experimental workflow (DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing + (bio)informatics), as well as the bias imposed by performing 16S CN correction (i.e. dividing by the estimated number of 16S copies per genome).

Accordingly, CN correction reduced the mean squared error in the taxon proportions by about half in the DNA mixtures but only slightly in the cell mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The limited effect of CN correction can also be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. These results indicate that CN variation is just one component of PCR bias, which itself is just one component of total bias, and thus even perfect correction of CN bias may not substantially ameliorate total bias in marker-gene sequencing experiments.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46923.016</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Estimated genome size and 16S copy number for the seven mock taxa in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> experiment (Materials and methods).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Taxon</th><th>Genome size (Mbp)</th><th>Copy number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>Atopobium vaginae</italic></td><td>1.44</td><td>2*</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic></td><td>1.64</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic></td><td>2.04</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic></td><td>1.28</td><td>5*</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Prevotella bivia</italic></td><td>2.52</td><td>4*</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Sneathia amnii</italic></td><td>1.33</td><td>3*</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic></td><td>2.16</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Denotes copy numbers that were instead estimated to be 1 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The lack of a rigorous understanding of how bias distorts marker-gene and metagenomic sequencing (jointly, MGS) measurements stands in the way of accurate and reproducible community-composition measurements. Previous analyses of bias in MGS experiments have largely relied on descriptive statistical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krehenwinkel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2019</xref>) whose parameters cannot be identified with biophysical quantities that one might expect to apply to differently composed samples. Failure to develop more mechanistic models may have stemmed from the seeming hopelessness of accounting for the many verified sources of bias. Here we proposed a mathematical model of bias in MGS experiments as a set of taxon-specific factors (the relative efficiencies) that multiply the true relative abundances to produce the measured relative abundances. Our model was inspired by the observation that many sources of bias, such as differences in DNA extraction efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>), PCR primer binding and amplification efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wagner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki and Giovannoni, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Polz and Cavanaugh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edgar, 2017</xref>), and marker-gene copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kembel et al., 2012</xref>), are thought to act multiplicatively, and hence so could their cumulative effect. The parameters in our model (the relative efficiencies) have biophysical interpretations as the relative yield per unit of input for each taxon, for individual steps or for the workflow overall. Our hypothesis that the relative efficiencies are consistent across samples is grounded in existing understanding of individual bias mechanisms and was supported by marker-gene and shotgun-metagenomic sequencing measurements of mock bacterial communities with varying composition. We further showed how our model could be used to measure, understand, and correct bias.</p><p>We found bias to be independent of sample composition only after accounting for the compositional nature of MGS measurements. Bias appeared inconsistent when viewed in terms of taxon proportions—for example the measured proportion of <italic>L. crispatus</italic> was both higher and lower than its true value in different samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, these apparent inconsistencies did not reflect inconsistency in the action of bias, but instead were a consequence of the compositional nature of MGS data. A limited number of sequencing reads are generated from each sample, so if one taxon is enriched by bias then other taxa must be correspondingly diminished. Therefore, a taxon's proportional over- or under-representation depends not on its absolute measurement efficiency but on its efficiency relative to the average individual (e.g. microbial cell) in the sample—<italic>L. crispatus</italic> increased in proportion when its efficiency was greater than the sample average, and decreased otherwise. Models that do not account for this effect (such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krehenwinkel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kevorkian et al., 2018</xref>) will yield parameter estimates that do not extrapolate to differently-composed samples. Once we accounted for compositionality it became clear that relative efficiencies were consistent across differently composed samples. Bias had the same effect in each sample when we divided out the effect of compositionality by considering ratios of taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and when we fully modeled the normalization involved in constructing proportions we found that a single set of relative efficiencies explained the observed proportions in every sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>A quantitative model allows the sensitivity of downstream analyses to bias to be rigorously evaluated. Consider the often unstated assumption that analyses of the differences between samples measured in the same experiment should be robust to bias, because each sample is biased in the same way. We can formally evaluate this assumption in the simple numerical example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf97"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> has higher Shannon diversity than Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf98"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> but the measured diversity of Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf99"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is lower than Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf100"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, and Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf101"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> has a higher proportion of Taxon 3 than Sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf102"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>S</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> but is observed to have a lower proportion of Taxon 3, despite the same bias distorting each sample. Whether such qualitative errors are likely can be investigated by simulating our model with empirical distributions of bias and community compositions. For example, consider the <italic>Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes</italic> ratio, a repeatedly-proposed diagnostic of gut health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finucane et al., 2014</xref>). The range of relative efficiencies within the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> indicates that the <italic>Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes</italic> ratio measured by the metagenomic sequencing protocols evaluated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al. (2017)</xref> can differ from the true ratio by very little, or by as much as 100-fold, depending on which Firmicutes species is dominant in the sample!</p><p>If bias acts (as we propose) as a consistent multiplication of the relative abundances, then analyses of MGS data based on taxon ratios could reduce the possibility for spurious results and make results from different experiments more comparable. The key insight is that the fold changes between samples in the ratios between taxa is invariant to consistent multiplicative bias, because the relative efficiencies divide out (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 7</xref>). In contrast, such canceling does not occur for the fold-changes in taxon proportions, as exemplified by the spurious observed increase of Taxon 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. To be clear, this bias-invariance property for ratio-based analyses only holds for samples biased in the same way, so these analyses still must be conducted within experiments sharing a common MGS protocol. But by controlling for study-specific bias, these analyses may give results that are more concordant across studies than other analyses. One ready source of such methods is the field of Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitchison, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gloor et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, our model of bias is equivalent to what is referred to as a compositional perturbation in the CoDA field; many CoDA methods are invariant to compositional perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aitchison, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van den Boogaart and Tolosana-Delgado, 2013</xref>) and thus would be invariant to bias. CoDA methods are being increasingly used to analyze MGS data, but to date this has been motivated by the need to account for the compositionality of MGS data. The possibility that such methods could also reduce or remove the effect of bias has not been widely appreciated.</p><p>Studies investigating bias and/or optimizing protocols should evaluate the systematic errors introduced by bias in a way that accounts for the compositional nature of MGS data. Most previous studies of bias quantified bias with taxon proportions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krehenwinkel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2019</xref>) or proportion-based summary statistics such as Bray-Curtis dissimilarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>) or differences in Shannon diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song et al., 2016</xref>). Proportion-based measurements do not consistently measure bias in differently composed samples, and thus are difficult to interpret and can mislead researchers attempting to reduce the effect of bias on their experiments. The adoption of compositionally aware analytical methods to study bias may lead to insights that generalize beyond the specific sample compositions considered in these studies. In particular, quantification of bias in the form of the ‘bias vector’ of relative efficiencies we proposed here has a natural biological interpretation as the relative yields of each taxon and can be naturally decomposed into an element-wise product of bias vectors for each step in a workflow, allowing for granular investigation of MGS protocol choices.</p><p>Our results suggest that calibration could become a practical approach to improving the accuracy of MGS analyses and diagnostics. If bias is composition independent, then it can be estimated from one or more control samples and those estimates used to correct the relative abundances in target samples. Our results overcomes major limitations in recent attempts at MGS calibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krehenwinkel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2019</xref>) by indicating how to obtain a compositionally independent estimate of bias for many taxa from a small number of control samples. Intriguingly, we show that the differential bias between protocols behaves in the same manner as the bias of an individual protocol. This property opens the possibility of calibration based on a reference protocol's measurements of control samples even if their true composition is not known. Reference calibration does not give the abundances in terms of biologically tangible units like cell concentration, but can make measurements from differently biased experiments quantitatively comparable, allowing diagnostic criteria to be applied outside of the lab in which they were defined. Reference calibration may sidestep the practical challenges of creating defined cellular mixtures of many taxa by using natural samples (or aggregations of natural samples) as calibration controls that would then contain the full range of taxa naturally present.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations and next steps</title><p>We found bias to act multiplicatively in accordance with our model in two mock-community experiments; however, many sources of bias may deviate from multiplicativity under non-ideal conditions. For example, it has been observed that the efficiency of a target sequence is altered by saturation during PCR amplification when the target is either rare or highly abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki and Giovannoni, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>). In a non-microbial marker-gene experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomas et al. (2016)</xref> found a strong and consistent saturation effect that may have been caused by such a mechanism. The opposite of saturation, where taxa have lower efficiencies when rarer in the sample, may occur if low-abundance taxa are culled by the minimum-abundance thresholds used by taxonomic profilers such as MetaPhlAn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Truong et al., 2015</xref>). Such deviations from multiplicativity may be eliminated through protocol design (e.g. to avoid PCR saturation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Polz and Cavanaugh, 1998</xref>) or accounted for with extensions allowing for deterministic and random variation in efficiencies.</p><p>Even when bias does act multiplicatively on individual microbial taxa, that multiplicativity will not hold for aggregates of taxa that vary in their efficiencies (Appendix 1). Consider again the <italic>Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes</italic> ratio diagnostic. We know that within the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum there is tremendous phenotypic variation, and that variation manifested itself in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al. (2017)</xref> study as order-of-magnitude differences between the relative efficiencies of various <italic>Firmicutes</italic> species. As a result, consistent multiplicative bias could dramatically enrich or diminish the relative abundance of the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum depending on which <italic>Firmicutes</italic> species were present. Unfortunately, the potential for bias to act inconsistently on aggregates of taxa cannot be entirely circumvented by eschewing aggregation in our analyses because even the fundamental units we derive from MGS data effectively aggregate variation at some level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McLaren and Callahan, 2018</xref>). In the bacterial context, the traditional 97% ribosomal OTU groups variation at roughly the genus level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yarza et al., 2014</xref>), exact short-read ribosomal sequence variants and common shotgun profilers group variation at roughly the species level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edgar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hillmann et al., 2018</xref>), and metagenome assembly combines strains too similar to be separated by the assembler or by the subsequent binning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dick, 2018</xref>, p. 79). This does not make bias an intractable problem, but it does mean that additional work is needed to understand the phylogenetic scales over which bias significantly varies. Methods to control bias will need to operate on taxonomic objects with commensurate or finer resolution than that of variation in the bias phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McLaren and Callahan, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Cellular phenotype and matrix chemistry can vary substantially between samples of different types, which may cause bias to vary among samples. For example, different cellular growth states may change the cellular membrane and thus the efficiency of DNA extraction for a given taxon, and inhibitors in soil samples are known to influence the efficiency of PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schrader et al., 2012</xref>). In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al. (2017)</xref> experiment, protocols differentially extracted the mock and native gut taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which may have been due to physiological differences between the lab-grown cells and the preserved fecal cells. Potential phenotype and matrix effects are particularly relevant for calibration applications, as accurate calibration will require that bias measured in the controls is representative of the bias in the target samples.</p><p>The development of effective calibration methodologies will be limited by our ability to develop control samples that cover the range of taxa present in target communities. The bias estimation procedure we developed here is limited to those taxa present in the controls, and thus only allows for partial calibration of the subcomposition of the target samples consisting of those taxa. However, even partial calibration is useful when controls with key taxa in the target community are available. For example, vaginal microbiome samples from a patient over several clinical visits analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> were mostly comprised of the seven taxa in their mock mixtures. It may be possible to effectively augment the range of taxa with credible bias estimates beyond those included in control samples by using phylogenetic inference methods to predict the bias of related taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goberna and Verdú, 2016</xref>). It will be easier to broadly cover the taxa in a given environment when calibrating to a reference protocol, because any sample measured by the reference protocol can be used as a reference calibration control, including samples from the environment of interest.</p><p>Our discussion has so far ignored another ubiquitous source of error in MGS experiments—contamination, either from the lab, reagents, or other samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eisenhofer et al., 2019</xref>). Contamination may be more important than bias in certain scenarios, such as the study of low biomass samples or analyses that are sensitive to very low frequency taxa, and bias correction may be insufficient for accurate measurement and inference in such settings. Accurate bias inference also requires accurate removal of contaminant reads prior to estimation through manual filtering or automated removal methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larsson et al., 2018</xref>). Incorporation of our bias model with models of contamination may allow for simultaneous and improved estimation and correction of both error processes.</p><p>The model of bias we explored in this paper treats bias and measurement error more generally as deterministic. In practice, however, there is variability in the error of taxon ratios around the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We developed a point-estimation method with a bootstrapping procedure to estimate the bias with associated uncertainty from random observations (Materials and methods). However, robust estimation and calibration may require a statistical model of bias that explicitly accounts for sources of random error such as variation in relative efficiencies across samples and limited sequencing depth. A statistical model would facilitate the construction of confidence intervals for the calibrated taxon proportions in a sample. Challenges associated with building such a model include modeling the presence of taxa thought to be absent from the community (but observed due to contamination or index switching; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eisenhofer et al., 2019</xref>), the absence of taxa known to be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>), and accounting for the noise associated with the count nature of sequencing data. Our finding that multiplicative error in taxon ratios provides a parsimonious model for bias paves the way for the development of a such a statistical model, which we leave for future work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggest a simple yet profound change in how researchers view MGS measurements. Currently, researchers tend to either 1) take MGS measurements as telling us only about presence and absence of detectable taxa, 2) hope that bias in the measurements of individual samples will somehow cancel out when analyzing differences between samples within a given experiment, or 3) pretend bias doesn’t exist. We propose a new view in which the measured relative abundances within an experiment are biased by unknown—but constant—multiplicative factors. When bias acts consistently in this manner it can be accounted for through the use of bias-insensitive analyses or corrected by a calibration procedure. Our results lay a foundation for the rigorous understanding of bias in marker-gene and metagenomic sequencing measurements that is required for accurate and reproducible research using MGS methods and for the development of reliable MGS diagnostics and interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bias estimation</title><p>We describe a procedure for averaging multiple control observations to obtain a single estimate of the protocol’s bias; additional details and motivation are given in Appendix 2.

Specifically, we used the sample information and read assignments in Additional Files 2, 10, and 11 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> to build a table of amplicon sequences assigned to each of the seven mock taxa in each sample. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> used a classification method and 16S reference database designed for species-level classification of vaginally associated taxa from V1-V3 region amplicons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fettweis et al., 2012</xref>). Reads were assigned to species in the database according to a 97% sequence identity threshold, resulting in 93.5% of reads assigned and for which the vast majority (99.98%) were assigned to species corresponding to the seven mock taxa. We discarded the small fraction (0.0002%) of reads assigned to other species. Most samples were assigned a small fraction of their reads from species not expected to be in the sample. These out-of-sample species generally had much lower frequency than the expected species, suggesting they were the result of cross-sample contamination rather than mislabeling or misconstruction of the samples. We therefore removed these reads before evaluating and estimating bias.</p><p>We took the actual composition of each sample to be an even mixture of the taxa added to that sample, in units of cell concentration, DNA concentration, or PCR-product concentration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> constructed the cell mixtures to be even mixtures based on CFUs (a proxy for cell concentration); the DNA mixtures based on DNA concentration; and the PCR mixtures based on volume from amplification of a fixed weight of DNA. Extraction and PCR protocols differed somewhat when using pure cultures to create the DNA and PCR-product mixtures than when applied to communities in the cell experiment. Thus, the DNA and PCR product in the second and third experiments may differ qualitatively from that in the cell mixture experiments, which could in principle affect the bias of downstream steps.</p><p>We estimated genome size and 16S copy number for the seven mock taxa from available genome databases and experimental measurements. We estimated genome size by the average genome size for the given species in NCBI RefSeq release 86 as collated by the GTDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parks et al., 2018</xref>). We estimated 16S copy number (CN) through a combination of RefSeq annotations for the given species; CN estimates in the rrnDB for the given species or their nearby relatives identified in the GTDB phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parks et al., 2018</xref>); and measurement by pulse-field gel electrophoresis reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yuan et al. (2012)</xref> for <italic>A. vaginae</italic> and <italic>L. iners</italic>. A full account is given in the manuscript GitHub repository. The resulting genome size estimates approximately agree with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref>, but the 16S CN estimates differ substantially for several taxa (compare our <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> to their Table 5). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> estimated four taxa to have CNs of 1 based on NCBI annotations then available, but we suspect these numbers to be artifacts of poor assembly and annotation.</p><p>We estimated the bias predicted due to CN variation for each mixture type as follows. Cell mixtures: CN bias is simply the compositional vector of CNs (16S copies per genome). DNA mixtures: CN bias is the compositional vector of CN divided by genome size (16S copies per bp). PCR-product mixtures: CN bias is the compositional identity vector (1,..., 1) (i.e. no bias).

These options were chosen to increase sensitivity and accuracy for the rarest spike-in taxa and resulted in the detection of all spike-in taxa in every sample. Taxonomic profiles generated by MetaPhlAn2 provide estimated proportions of taxa at various taxonomic levels. We restricted our analysis to species-level abundances and the kingdom Bacteria, which constituted over 99% of non-viral abundance in each sample.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al. (2017)</xref> reported <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a likely spike-in contaminant due to its presence in sequence data from the mock-only samples. Consistent with this report, the MetaPhlAn2 profiles showed a substantial presence of <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> in the mock-only samples and we identified this species as the ‘Contaminant’ in our subsequent analyses and in all figures and tables.</p><p>We estimated the true mock-community composition using the flow cytometry (FACS) measurements reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al.

The FACS measurements provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al.

Analysis of our MetaPhlAn2 profiles indicates that these taxa are most likely mislabeled in the figure and not in the FACS measurements. A mislabeling in the FACS measurements would change the specific bias values we estimate for these taxa but not our main results or conclusions.</p><p>We estimated the bias of each protocol and the differential bias between protocols as described in ‘Bias estimation’. We estimated standard errors using the Dirichlet-weighted bootstrap method described in Appendix 2. To determine how precision in the bias estimate for Protocol H varies with the number of control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), we computed standard errors using the multinomial-weighted bootstrap method with the number of trials in the multinomial distribution equal to the specified number of control samples (Appendix 2).</p><p>To demonstrate calibration, we randomly chose three fecal specimens to use as the ‘estimation set’ to estimate bias, and then calibrated all samples using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ9">Equation 9</xref>. We excluded the mock-only specimen from the estimation set since its atypical values for a few taxa resulted in an unrepresentative picture of the success of calibration; however, we included it when

most general formulation of our model first presented in the Results, we allow for the possibility that the protocol choice at a step influences the qualitative, as well as the quantitative,

For instance, DNA extraction protocols yield differently fragmented DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al., 2017</xref>), which may affect the bias of downstream steps such as PCR and sequencing. Therefore, the bias at a step in general will depend on the protocol for that step as well as for all previous steps.

All properties and implications of bias or differential bias of the total protocols described in the main text are valid under this condition in the presence of such qualitative or downstream effects.</p><p>Downstream effects are important to consider, however, when attempting to estimate the bias of an individual step or protocol choice. Consider using differential bias to estimate the effect of DNA extraction protocol in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costea et al.

Here we cannot distinguish the two, as estimating the size of indirect effects requires experiments where protocols at different steps are varied in a combinatorial fashion.</p><p>A different but related issue arises in our estimation of bias from different steps in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al. (2015)</xref> experiment. There, DNA extraction from pure cultures to create the DNA mixtures differed from extraction in the community samples (the cell mixtures). In order to estimate the bias during extraction, we must assume that there is no qualitative difference in the DNA, and so the bias of PCR, sequencing, etc. will be the same whether starting from the cell or the DNA mixtures. In other words, we must assume that the bias at a step <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf157"><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is only a property of the individual step.</p></sec><sec id="s8-2"><title>Aggregates of taxa</title><p>Aggregating groups of taxa through the standard method of summing their abundances can cause bias to appear to vary among samples with different compositions.

A simple way to overcome this problem is to instead use Dirichlet resampling, as in the Bayesian bootstrap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rubin, 1981</xref>). Procedurally, the Bayesian bootstrap proceeds like the weight-based formulation of the standard bootstrap given above, except that the weights <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf244"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐰</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> are sampled from a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf245"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Dirichlet</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>…</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> distribution rather than the multinomial distribution.

We can then proceed to compute compositional standard errors as before. The Dirichlet and multinomial weights of the two methods have the same expected value and approximately the same variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rubin, 1981</xref>).

Here, McLaren, Willis, and Callahan focus on multiplicative biases in microbiome experiments and quantify their effect on distorting the resulting abundance distributions. The authors formulate a rigorous framework in treating multiplicative biases based on individual protocol steps and derive a correction of that bias. Application of their correction methods to two mock community data sets validates their findings and provides improved estimates of microbial abundances. Together, this work provides an important framework to begin to more robustly compare data across experiments and research groups. This work is incredibly timely and provides a significant advance in our understanding of biases in microbiome data and a framework that will be built on to address them in the future.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The github repository is great but might not be enough of a tutorial for inexperienced users. I'd recommend writing a step by step tutorial (a la http://qiime.org/tutorials/).</p><p>Also, are there any plans in place to update this code as new approaches become available? It may also help to name the package/tool.</p><p>2) More discussion is needed regarding the propagation of noise or errors across multiplicative factors as opposed to bias. For instance, is noise in the extraction protocol more important than PCR because it occurs earlier? Or are the errors simply multiplicative too so that there is no purpose in trying to reduce noise in the earlier steps? In any case noise is perhaps more important than bias as it cannot be corrected so in their Tables 1 and 2 it would be good to have an estimate of the average error associated with each protocol. In some cases, a more biased but reproducible protocol could be preferable.</p><p>3) Both data sets used by the authors are derived from mock communities with known ground truth. The authors argue that their methods can be used even in the absence of a ground truth by using relative efficiencies. I feel that this is an important use case for real-world data sets. Standard communities, including all/most of the detected taxa across a set of real-world samples, are usually not available for any given microbiome study. Here, one could still estimate relative efficiencies by using technical replicates (samples co-processed across batches – how many samples need to be co-processed across batches for this approach to be useful?). However, that particular use case is discussed only briefly and there is no quantitative study with any data set that is not a mock data set. I feel that inclusion of a non-mock data set with technical replicates may be more informative here since that is closer to most published microbiome data sets. Based on that the authors could formulate a protocol that can be proposed for future microbiome experiments and that would allow systematic elimination of multiplicative biases. One challenge I foresee is that relative efficiencies will be very difficult to estimate for low-abundance taxa that are often unique to a small number of samples, unless every sample is processed across all batches.</p><p>4) The authors start by arguing that major biases should be multiplicative. Even though they provide a wide array of references describing the existence of bias in microbiome assays, there is no reference that supports the assumption that the strongest bias has to be multiplicative. This is addressed later in the manuscript by showing that multiplicative bias captures the error in mock communities well and by stating this multiplicative limitation in the Discussion. I would have liked a more systematic study of the potential magnitudes of multiplicative vs. additive/other biases.</p><p>a) For instance, what is the amount of variance explained by multiplicative bias vs. potentially additive biases (e.g. saturating effects, contamination from external sources, or well-to-well contamination)? I would expect that additive biases, like well-to-well contamination, to be more important in low-biomass samples. Further discussion of this point would be useful.</p><p>b) In the two data sets analyzed in this study the authors removed contamination manually. However, this approach likely won't be possible for non-mock data.</p><p>c) All bias estimates reported in the text are usually reported without dispersion measures, even though the formulated point estimate should induce an appropriate dispersion measure as well. It would be interesting to see how much uncertainty there is regarding the bias as a function of samples used for correction. This could aid in determining how many samples should be used to estimate the bias.</p><p>5) It would be worthwhile to discuss the observed bias structure with other data transformations (not only the ones from compositional data analysis). For instance, Equation 7 essentially makes fold changes of the same taxon across samples invariant to the bias. This would mean that the established transformation from RNA-seq analysis would also be applicable here (log-transformation and comparison by log-fold change rather than absolute difference).</p><p>6) I feel that some further investigation into correlations of the identified biases with taxonomy may be helpful to gain mechanistic insight into the sources of bias. For instance, does the bias correlate with the abundance of the taxon, or do phylogenetically similar taxa show similar biases? This could help to formulate strategies for estimating bias for taxa that are undetected in the batch replicates. The authors also argue that summarization of taxa into higher phylogenetic ranks may introduce additional errors, but they do not state which rank is permissible here (species, genus, family?).</p><p>The reviewers were all enthusiastic about publication and realize that all of these points may be difficult to accomplish within the next couple months. We would encourage the authors to use their best judgement in deciding what can be addressed in a substantive way and which points would be best addressed with additional discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46923.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The github repository is great but might not be enough of a tutorial for inexperienced users.

This package should be considered “alpha” but contains functions that can be used to measure bias in quality-control experiments that include samples of known composition. The GitHub Issues tracker will host discussions about the needs of potential users.

The tutorial is viewable online at https://mikemc.github.io/metacal/articles/tutorial.html. We plan to expand upon this tutorial as we further our methods.</p><p>We have also taken several steps during the revision that make the package a more robust and useful tool for analyses beyond the present manuscript.

(2017) experiment in the second paragraph of the subsection “Bias measurement as a means of evaluating and improving protocols”. To allow direct comparison, we now use the analogous measure of bias instead of the previously used geometric standard deviation, although the new measure has a similar interpretation. In the Brooks et al. (2015) experiments (Table 1), we see the highest noise in the PCR mixtures, which is likely due to random error during sample construction resulting in imprecise estimates of the actual compositions, rather than noise during the MGS measurement. In the Costea et al. experiment (Table 2), the noise is smaller for protocols that preferentially measured the spike-in, suggesting that limited sequencing depth or other discrete-sampling effects may be having an effect.</p><p>Our quantification of noise assumes a multiplicative model of noise, and found that it gave reasonable results consistent with our expectations (e.g. noise &lt;&lt; bias in most cases). However, we have not proven that all sources of noise in MGS measurements are multiplicative. Some noise mechanisms are likely to be well-modeled as multiplicative. For example, PCR amplification efficiencies may vary based on location of the PCR tube in the PCR machine, introducing random variation in a multiplicative factor (the efficiencies) that is independent of the sample’s composition. However, at least one source of noise is known to not be well-modeled as multiplicative: the random variation around the relative abundances introduced by the sequencing sampling process is larger and more asymmetric for rare taxa.</p><p>In general, we expect that noise will be reasonably modeled as multiplicative for reasonably abundant taxa. This means that, as the reviewers noted, the effect of multiplicative noise will be the same whether it arises in an early step or a late step. However, further investigation is warranted, and we expect at a minimum that a proper accounting for the non-multiplicative noise introduced by the generation of discrete sequencing reads will be necessary for robust bias estimation in low abundance taxa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Both data sets used by the authors are derived from mock communities with known ground truth.

We are actively working towards demonstrating the utility of our methods on natural samples from other experiments, with the ultimate goal of formulating protocols for both mock and non-mock calibration in future microbiome experiments. However, we determined that a thorough investigation of differential bias in natural samples would require follow-up article(s) for reasons we outline below.</p><p>First, as the reviewers noted, most species are not present in most samples in real-world datasets, and many of the taxa that are present are at very low abundances. These complications make robust estimation of the relative efficiencies more difficult in natural samples than in controls. Second, consistent matching between the taxa identified by different protocols is challenging in natural samples in which many similar taxa may be present. Consider a set of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> strains that are present in the real-world dataset. The way that a 16S rRNA protocol and a shotgun metagenomics protocol will divide these strains into taxonomic units will be different, and matching between the taxonomic units derived from different MGS protocols can be surprisingly challenging. This issue is avoided in control samples that contain collections of strains that are taxonomically well-separated. Third, most currently available datasets that could be used for investigating differential bias (i.e. that contain multiple samples measured by different MGS protocols) do not include technical replicate measurements, which are necessary to be able to distinguish inconsistent bias from contamination, random error, or sample mislabeling. For example, such technical replicate measurements of the same samples are not present in the Costea et al. (2017) dataset we analyzed, which otherwise would be a useful dataset for investigating differential bias in the natural fecal portion of the measured communities. We believe that the problems posed by noise, contamination, and taxonomic matching in real-world datasets can be overcome by more careful modeling and data curation, but require further substantial work and dataset development that would overly complicate the present manuscript.</p><p>Despite these challenges, we believe that differential bias is a non-obvious concept that is critical for understanding and developing methods to reduce technical disagreement between studies, and that it is therefore worth introducing in this manuscript. In order to better support its practical utility given the reviewers’ concerns, we expanded the illustration of differential bias in the revised manuscript: 1) We added the spike-in contaminant in the Costea et al. (2017) experiment to Figure 4B to illustrate how a consistent differential bias can be observed even when the true abundance of the taxon is unknown (subsection “Metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples with a spike-in mock community”, last paragraph). 2) We added estimates of differential bias between the Costea et al. (2017) protocols including the contaminant taxon to Table 2. While not equivalent to demonstration on a completely natural community, we believe this at least shows the utility of differential bias in the case where true abundances are not known.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors start by arguing that major biases should be multiplicative.

Further discussion of this point would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>Note: To be consistent with the manuscript, we use the term “bias” exclusively for the systematic error caused by differences in the measurement efficiency among taxa.</p><p>Our aim has been to determine how the error due to bias behaves and can be addressed. In particular, we do not consider error due to contamination and taxonomic misassignment, which can lead to measurements of taxa not actually in the sample and cannot be expressed in our simple multiplicative framework. These other sources of error may be more important than bias in some contexts and efforts to obtain accurate and reproducible metagenomics measurements must ultimately grapple with all three types of error. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion (subsection “Limitations and Next Steps”) to clarify the potential for contamination to limit effective application of the present work. In this response, we discuss further the role of contamination in obtaining quantitative measurements of community differences. We discuss practical solutions for dealing with contamination in our response to 4 b).</p><p><bold>Contamination:</bold> Like bias, contamination (either from the lab environment or reagents or cross-contamination between samples) is a ubiquitous source of systematic error in metagenomics experiments. Whether bias or contamination is more important will depend on the experimental platform and system and the specific goals of the experiment. For example, contamination will increase in importance for sequencing platforms with high rates of index/barcode switching, for low biomass samples, and for downstream analyses that are sensitive to taxa found in very small proportions. The measures we propose for quantifying bias are challenged by the presence of contamination, as evidenced by the fact that an arbitrary amount of contamination from a taxon not in the sample yields an infinite multiplicative error. Future work that incorporates our bias model with models of contamination can lead to improved measurement of each error type and improved understanding of the joint error process in applications. We have summarized these points in the Discussion subsection “Limitations and Next Steps”.</p><p><bold>Saturation and other systematic variation in taxon efficiencies:</bold> Saturation – where a taxon’s efficiency decreases with its relative or absolute abundance in the sample – is a special case of the relative efficiencies systematically depending on sample composition. The residual compositional errors, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf253"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, include systematic and random variation in the efficiencies and so place an upper bound on the strength of such effects. With the exception of the Brooks et al. (2015) PCR-product mixtures, the residuals are much smaller than the bias (Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Figure 4—figure supplement 1), and the large residuals in the PCR-product mixtures can plausibly be explained by random sample construction error. These observations indicate that saturation or other systematic variation in the bias is not significant in the experiments we analyzed. It is possible that saturation would become apparent in samples with more extreme variation in taxon abundances, we note one potential example of this (Thomas et al., 2016) in the Discussion and further testing is warranted. Our model can serve as a null model for future researchers to look for such effects in their own protocols; since it properly accounts for compositionality, deviations from our model can correctly be interpreted as efficiencies varying with sample composition. Protocol design should strive for consistent efficiencies, which is likely to be much more attainable than eliminating bias.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In the two data sets analyzed in this study the authors removed contamination manually. However, this approach likely won't be possible for non-mock data.</p></disp-quote><p>Removal of contamination is indeed more difficult in natural control samples where the true taxa present in the sample are not known a priori. However, removal of contamination using current practices – such as filtering out taxa below a minimum frequency above which out-of-sample contribution is assumed negligible or applying a specialized contamination-removal procedure (Davis et al., 2018; Larsson et al., 2018) – can be used instead of manual removal. Because our model and method for estimating bias consider only the ratios among taxa, they apply equally well to arbitrary subcompositions of taxa from each sample. Therefore, one can restrict to the taxa in each sample one is confident are not contaminants and proceed to estimate bias from these subcompositions with the methods we describe. Future Bayesian or maximum-likelihood methods that jointly model contamination and bias may make it possible to avoid the loss of information associated with current contaminant filtering approaches. We have summarized these points in the Discussion subsection “Limitations and Next Steps”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) All bias estimates reported in the text are usually reported without dispersion measures, even though the formulated point estimate should induce an appropriate dispersion measure as well. It would be interesting to see how much uncertainty there is regarding the bias as a function of samples used for correction. This could aid in determining how many samples should be used to estimate the bias.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that applications of bias estimation should account for uncertainty in the estimated bias, and understanding of the structure of this uncertainty for different control-sample designs should inform experimental planning. Towards these ends, we have taken several steps in this revision.</p><p>We now implement a bootstrap procedure for estimating the uncertainty in the estimate of bias. This procedure is described in Appendix 2 section “Bootstrap method for estimating uncertainty in the bias”, implemented in the R package, and demonstrated in the tutorial. We are developing more sophisticated maximum-likelihood and Bayesian estimation procedures that we plan to add R package and tutorials in the future and that overcome some limitations of our bootstrap method (namely, not accounting for sequencing depth and potentially suboptimal performance when different control samples contain different taxa).</p><p>In the online R Markdown documents, we use the bootstrap procedure to estimate standard errors for all bias estimates reported in the manuscript. Due to the large sample size of these experiments, the standard errors are small relative to the estimated bias parameters and we exclude them from the tables for clarity. Standard errors for the estimated bias for the Costea et al. (2017) experiment are plotted in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and for the estimated bias of individual workflow steps for the Brooks et al. (2015) experiment in Figure 6.</p><p>We also examined how the precision of the bias estimate varies with number of control samples for the protocol with an intermediate degree of noise (Protocol H) in the Costea et al. (2017) experiment. To estimate the (geometric) standard errors for N control samples (from N=1 to N=9), we performed multinomial bootstrap resampling of N samples and computed the geometric standard deviation of the resulting efficiency estimates. Figure 5—figure supplement 1 shows the resulting geometric standard errors as a function of N, alongside the observed compositions for help in interpretation. This figure and analysis is discussed in the subsection “Calibration”. When noise in the controls is much lower than bias, as it is here, measuring just 1 control sample gives a sufficiently accurate estimate to be useful in calibration. However, multiple samples are needed to allow estimating uncertainty and may be essential if “heavy-tail” random errors are common (such as those seen in two samples in the figure).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be worthwhile to discuss the observed bias structure with other data transformations (not only the ones from compositional data analysis). For instance, Equation 7 essentially makes fold changes of the same taxon across samples invariant to the bias. This would mean that the established transformation from RNA-seq analysis would also be applicable here (log-transformation and comparison by log-fold change rather than absolute difference).</p></disp-quote><p>Equation 6 and Equation 7 demonstrate that bias cancels out in analyses based on fold changes (FCs) in the ratios of taxa. However, bias does not cancel out in non-ratio based analyses due to the reasons stated in the section “Systematic error in taxon ratios, but not in taxon proportions, is independent of sample composition”. Here we present the general result for the error in the estimated proportional FC of a taxon between two samples, which provides a direct point of comparison to Equation 6 and Equation 7. From Equation 4, we have that the proportional FC of taxon <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf254"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> from sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf255"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> to sample <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf256"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is<disp-formula id="equ24"><mml:math id="m24"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">Pr</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">Pr</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">Pr</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">Pr</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">Pr</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">Pr</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">Pr</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">Pr</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">Pr</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">Pr</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The bias partially cancels, but not fully, due to the dependence of the observed proportions on the sample mean efficiency (SME); the result is an error in the estimated proportional FC equal to the reciprocal of the FC in the SME. This can even results in a sign if the true proportional FC of a taxon is smaller than and opposing the FC in the SME. We give a numerical example of such a sign error for Taxon 3 in Figure 2 (subsection “Analyses based on fold-changes in taxon ratios are insensitive to bias, while analyses based on taxon proportions can give spurious results”, first paragraph) where the taxon is observed to have a proportional FC greater than 1 but in fact has a proportional FC that is less than 1. In a recent paper, Kevorkian et al. (2018) suggested that bias cancels when computing the proportional FC between samples. However, their derivation did not properly account for the compositional nature of MGS measurements, which causes the appearance of the sample mean efficiency in our Equation 4 but that is missing in their Equation 3.</p><p>Whether spurious associations (or missed true associations) are a serious worry in applications appears to us an open question. It is easy to come up with examples of spurious associations in a given taxon due to another taxon changing from high to low frequency between samples (such as Taxon 1 in Figure 2; see also Brooks, 2016, p. 338). Such large single-species changes might be uncommon in some ecosystems; but large phylum-level changes could similarly cause spurious results if species’ efficiencies are similar within the phylum. On the other hand, it is possible that the SME is fairly stable across samples. In this case, the partial canceling may be sufficient for accurate estimates of differential abundance. Because the observed FCs of all taxa are multiplied by the same error term, the observed log-FCs remain correlated with the actual log-FCs. A plot of observed vs. actual log-FCs will appear systematically shifted from the y = x line by the log-FC in the SME; but such a shift might often be obscured in real data by noise. This result could explain the high correlation and apparent lack of a systematic shift seen in D'Amore et al. (2016) Figure 7, which considers this relationship for the FCs in proportions between two DNA mock communities. Thus determining the conditions in which bias causes spurious taxonomic associations remains an important line of future work.</p><p>Other non-ratio-based transformations currently employed in RNA-seq and microbiome differential-abundance analysis, such as rank transformation and quantile normalization, face a similar problem. However, the practical implications of bias for such analyses again remain unclear and requires further consideration via theory and/or simulation, for which our model can provide a conceptual foundation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I feel that some further investigation into correlations of the identified biases with taxonomy may be helpful to gain mechanistic insight into the sources of bias. For instance, does the bias correlate with the abundance of the taxon, or do phylogenetically similar taxa show similar biases? This could help to formulate strategies for estimating bias for taxa that are undetected in the batch replicates. The authors also argue that summarization of taxa into higher phylogenetic ranks may introduce additional errors, but they do not state which rank is permissible here (species, genus, family?).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding the extent to which bias is conserved among phylogenetically similar species is critical for understanding the causes and consequences of bias and for developing practical estimation and correction methods. The patterns we observe provide some anecdotal evidence about the nature of phylogenetic conservation of bias. For example, the variation in efficiencies seen among the five Firmicute species in the Costea et al. (2017) experiment shows that bias is not universally conserved at the phylum level and may pose a problem for analyses based on Phylum-level aggregation (as noted in the third paragraph of the Discussion). As further evidence, we visualized differential bias against phylogeny for the spike-in taxa in the Costea et al. (2017) experiment including the contaminant <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows that the three most closely related species – <italic>S. flexneri, S. enterica</italic>, and <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis –</italic> have very similar relative efficiencies. These three taxa are all within the family <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. On the other hand, the next two most closely related species, <italic>B. hansenii</italic> and <italic>C. saccharolyticum</italic> in the family <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, do not have similar relative efficiencies. Thus these results are ambiguous regarding how conserved bias is at the family level.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46923.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46923-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>Our ability to draw firm conclusions about the phylogenetic conservation of bias is limited by the small number of taxa in these datasets. For instance, only two taxa in the Brooks et al. (2015) dataset, <italic>L. iners</italic> and <italic>L. crispatus</italic>, share a genus, while none of the spike-in taxa in the Costea et al. (2017) experiment do. Our future plans include using additional mock and non-mock datasets to estimate the phylogenetic conservation of bias more broadly, so as to give more concrete guidance on when bias is (or is not) likely to remain consistent when aggregating at a given taxonomic level.</p><p>Certain phenotypes are known to interact mechanistically with the MGS measurement process to introduce bias. In this revision, we improved our analysis of the relationship between bias and one such phenotype – 16S copy number (CN) – by performing a more rigorous estimation of CN (described in Materials and methods subsection “Data and analysis code availability” and shown in an R-markdown document online) and improving the figure showing the relationship between bias and CN (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Previously we followed Brooks et al. (2015) in basing our estimates of 16S CN on RefSeq annotations for the given species. We have now revised our CN estimates for <italic>A. vaginae</italic> from 1 to 2 and for <italic>L. iners</italic> from 1 to 5 (Table 3). Previously 16S CN did not predict total bias or PCR bias, and that 16S CN correction actually made the estimated proportions worse than no correction in both cell and DNA mixtures. With these new numbers, we find that 16S CN variation explains a substantial amount of estimated PCR bias and that CN correction substantially improves the estimated proportions for the DNA mixtures. We thus substantially revised our previous conclusion that CN does not explain PCR bias in this experiment; however, it remains that CN explains at best a small fraction of total bias. These new results are reflected in the last paragraph of the Results subsection “Bias measurement as a means of evaluating and improving protocols” and reflected in the improved fit in the middle column of Figure 3—figure supplement 2. Investigation of other potential phenotypic predictors of bias is of interest, but we are again limited in our ability to systematically survey potentially relevant phenotypes by the limited number of taxa in our datasets.</p></body></sub-article></article>
