Although their early development has received much attention, how spinal MNs become and remain terminally differentiated is poorly understood. Here, we determined the transcriptome of mouse MNs located at the brachial domain of the spinal cord at embryonic and postnatal stages. We identified novel transcription factors (TFs) and terminal differentiation genes (e.g. ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, adhesion molecules) with continuous expression in MNs. Interestingly, genes encoding homeodomain TFs (e.g. HOX, LIM), previously implicated in early MN development, continue to be expressed postnatally, suggesting later functions. To test this idea, we inactivated <italic>Hoxc8</italic> at successive stages of mouse MN development and observed motor deficits. Our in vivo findings suggest that <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is not only required to establish, but also maintain expression of several MN terminal differentiation markers. Data from in vitro generated MNs indicate <italic>Hoxc8</italic> acts directly and is sufficient to induce expression of terminal differentiation genes.

They control both voluntary and involuntary movement and are cellular substrates for several degenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arora and Khan, 2021</xref>). Due to their stereotypic cell body position, easily identifiable axons and highly precise synaptic connections with well-defined muscles, MNs are exceptionally well characterized in all major model systems. Extensive research over the past decades in worms, flies, and mice has focused on the early steps of MN development, thereby advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling specification of progenitor cells and young postmitotic MNs, as well as motor circuit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Osseward and Pfaff, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Philippidou and Dasen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sagner and Briscoe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thor and Thomas, 2002</xref>). In the vertebrate spinal cord, progenitor cell specification critically depends on morphogenetic signals, whereas initial fate determination of postmitotic MNs relies on combinatorial activity of different classes of transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">di Sanguinetto et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jessell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee and Pfaff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stifani, 2014</xref>). The focus in early development, however, has left poorly explored the molecular mechanisms that control the final steps of MN differentiation. Once MNs are born and specified, how do they acquire their terminal differentiation features, such as neurotransmitter (NT) phenotype, electrical, and signaling properties? And perhaps most important, what are the mechanisms that ensure maintenance of such features throughout life?</p><p>The terminal differentiation features of every neuron type are determined by the expression of specific sets of proteins, such as NT biosynthesis components, NT receptors, ion channels, neuropeptides, signaling molecules, transmembrane receptors, and adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hobert, 2008</xref>). The genes coding for these proteins (‘terminal differentiation genes’) are continuously expressed from development through adulthood, thereby determining the functional and phenotypic properties of individual neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hobert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hobert, 2011</xref>). Therefore, the challenge of understanding how MNs acquire and maintain their functional features lies in understanding how the expression of MN terminal differentiation genes is regulated over time. Importantly, defects in expression of such genes constitute one of the earliest molecular signs of MN disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nutini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shibuya et al., 2011</xref>). However, the regulatory mechanisms that induce and maintain expression of terminal differentiation genes in spinal MNs are poorly defined. In part, this is due to: (a) a scarcity of temporally controlled gene inactivation studies that remove the activity of MN-expressed regulatory factors (e.g. TF, chromatin factor) at different life stages, and (b) a paucity of terminal differentiation markers for spinal MNs. Although recent RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have begun to address the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blum et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delile et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkaslasi et al., 2021</xref>), most genetic and molecular profiling studies on spinal MNs are not conducted in a longitudinal fashion, i.e., at embryonic and postnatal stages. Hence, how these cells become and remain terminally differentiated remains unclear.</p><p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that enable spinal MNs to acquire and maintain their terminal differentiation features, we took advantage of the orderly anatomical relationship between MN cell body location and muscle innervation, referred to as ‘topography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dasen and Jessell, 2009</xref>). In the spinal cord, this topographic relationship is mostly evident along the rostrocaudal axis, where MN populations located in different spinal cord domains (e.g. brachial, thoracic, lumbar, sacral) innervate different muscles. In this study, we focused on the brachial domain, where postmitotic MNs are organized into two columns: (a) the lateral motor column (LMC) contains limb-innervating MNs necessary for reaching, grasping, and locomotion, and (b) the medial motor column (MMC) contains axial muscle-innervating MNs required for postural control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Philippidou and Dasen, 2013</xref>). Through a longitudinal RNA-Seq approach, we identified multiple terminal differentiation markers and novel TFs with continuous expression in embryonic and postnatal brachial MNs. Interestingly, we also found that several homeodomain TFs (HOX, LIM) that were previously implicated in the early steps of brachial MN development (e.g. initial specification, circuit assembly) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Philippidou and Dasen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stifani, 2014</xref>) continue to be expressed in postnatal MNs. We therefore hypothesized that some of these TFs play additional roles in later steps of brachial MN development.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we focused on Hox proteins because recent findings in the ventral nerve cord (equivalent to mouse spinal cord) of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> identified Hox proteins as critical regulators of cholinergic MN terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kratsios et al., 2017</xref>). Among the seven Hox genes retrieved from our RNA-Seq, <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is highly expressed both in embryonic and postnatal brachial MNs. A previous study showed that <italic>Hoxc8</italic> acts early to establish brachial MN connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catela et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we report a new role for <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in later stages of mouse MN development. By inactivating <italic>Hoxc8</italic> at successive developmental stages, we found that it is necessary for the establishment and maintenance of select terminal differentiation features of brachial MNs. Mechanistically, Hoxc8 acts directly to induce expression of terminal differentiation genes. Similar to our observations in brachial MNs, we identified additional Hox genes with continuous expression in thoracic and lumbar MNs, suggesting maintained Hox expression in MNs is a broadly applicable theme to other rostrocaudal domains of the spinal cord. Because Hox genes are also expressed in the mouse and human brain during embryonic and postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lizen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hutlet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krumlauf, 2016</xref>), similar Hox-based mechanisms to the one described here may be widely used in the nervous system for the control of neuronal terminal differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular profiling of mouse brachial MNs at embryonic and postnatal stages</title><p>We first sought to define the molecular profile of brachial MNs at embryonic and postnatal stages with the goal of identifying putative terminal differentiation markers for these cells. This longitudinal approach focused on postmitotic MNs at embryonic day 12 (e12) and postnatal day 8 (p8). We chose e12 because: (i) spinal e12 MNs begin to acquire their terminal differentiation features, such as NT phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martinez et al., 2012</xref>), and (ii) MN axons at e12 have exited the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catela et al., 2016</xref>). We chose p8 because: (i) these are several days after neuromuscular synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gautam et al., 1996</xref>), and (ii) pups at p8 become more active, indicating spinal MN functionality. To genetically label e12 MNs, we used the <italic>Mnx1-GFP (green fluorescent protein)</italic> reporter mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>) as it primarily labels embryonic MNs at e12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hanley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sawai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Due to low expression of <italic>Mnx1-GFP</italic> at postnatal stages, we turned to an alternative labeling strategy and crossed <italic>Chat<sup>IRESCre</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rossi et al., 2011</xref>) with the <italic>Ai9</italic> Cre-responder line (Rosa26-CAG<sup>promoter</sup>-loxP-STOP-loxP-tdTomato) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). At p8, we observed fluorescent labeling of spinal MNs with tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taking advantage of the topographic MN organization along the rostrocaudal axis, we followed a region-specific approach focused on the brachial region (segments C4-T1) that contains MNs of the MMC and LMC. Upon precise microdissection of this region (see Materials and methods), we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate GFP-labeled brachial MNs from e12 <italic>Mnx1-GFP</italic> mice and tdTomato-labeled brachial MNs from p8 <italic>Chat<sup>IRESCre</sup>::Ai9</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Through RNA-Seq, we obtained and compared the molecular profile of these cells (see Materials and methods). We identified differentially expressed transcripts (&gt;fourfold, p&lt;0.05) in the e12 (3715 transcripts) and p8 (3209 transcripts) dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting gene expression profiles of embryonic and postnatal brachial MNs differ. Two factors that could contribute to these transcriptional differences between the e12 and p8 datasets are: (1) different levels of gene expression (see next section), and (2) a small fraction of the FACS-sorted cells are not MNs. Indeed, <italic>Mnx1</italic> and <italic>Chat</italic>, in addition to MNs, are also expressed in small, nonoverlapping neuronal populations in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zagoraiou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular profiling of mouse brachial motor neurons (MNs) at embryonic and postnatal stages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the workflow used in the comparison of embryonic and postnatal transcriptomes.

Notably, the most enriched class of proteins in the e12 dataset is TFs, many of which are known to control MN development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, see next section). On the other hand, GO analysis on proteins from postnatally enriched (p8) transcripts uncovered an overrepresentation of molecules associated with cell metabolism, such as ATP synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and energy-coupled proton transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), perhaps indicative of the higher metabolic demands of p8 MNs compared to their embryonic (e12) counterparts.</p><p>To identify terminal differentiation markers with continuous expression in brachial MNs, we leveraged our e12 RNA-Seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Their embryonic initiation and maintenance could be controlled by separate mechanisms involving distinct combinations of TFs solely dedicated to either initiation or maintenance. Alternatively, initiation and maintenance can be achieved through the activity of the same, continuously expressed TF (or combinations thereof). Recent invertebrate and vertebrate studies on various neuron types support the latter mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deneris and Hobert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hobert and Kratsios, 2019</xref>). We therefore sought to identify TFs with continuous expression, from embryonic to postnatal stages, in mouse brachial MNs.</p><p>First, we examined whether TFs from our embryonic (e12) RNA-Seq dataset continue to be expressed at postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We initially focused on 14 TFs from various families (e.g. LIM, Hox) with previously known embryonic expression and function in brachial MNs (<italic>Ebf2, Islet1, Islet2, Hb9, Foxp1, Lhx3, Runx1, Hoxc4, Hoxa5, Hoxc5, Hoxa6, Hoxc6, Hoxa7, Hoxc8</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arber et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Catela et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dasen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ericson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Philippidou and Dasen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharma et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stifani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thaler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thaler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thaler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tsuchida et al., 1994</xref>). Through RNA ISH or antibody staining, we detected robust expression in brachial MNs at e12 for all 14 factors. Notably, 13 of these TFs continue to be expressed albeit at lower levels - in brachial MNs at p8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), suggesting these proteins - in addition to their known roles during early MN development - may exert other functions at later developmental and/or postnatal stages. Seven of these 13 proteins are TFs of the Hox family (<italic>Hoxc4, Hoxa5, Hoxc5, Hoxa6, Hoxc6, Hoxa7, Hoxc8</italic>) known to be expressed in brachial MNs at embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Philippidou and Dasen, 2013</xref>), confirming the regional specificity of our RNA-Seq approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, our strategy is sensitive as it captured TFs with known expression in small populations of brachial MNs (e.g. MMC neurons), such as <italic>Ebf2</italic> and <italic>Lhx3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Catela et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharma et al., 1998</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Known and novel transcription factors (TFs) are continuously expressed in brachial motor neurons (MNs) during embryonic and postnatal stages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The expression of TFs with previously published roles in MN development was assessed in embryonic (e12.5) and postnatal (p8) spinal cords (N = 4) with RNA ISH (<italic>Ebf2, Runx1, Hoxc4, Hoxa5, Hoxc5, Hoxa6, Hoxc6, Hoxa7, Hoxc8</italic>) and immunohistochemistry (Islet1/2, Mnx1 [Hb9], Lhx3, Foxp1).

Similar to <italic>C. elegans</italic> Hox genes, mouse <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is continuously expressed in brachial MNs from embryonic to early postnatal stages, and sustained <italic>Hoxc8</italic> gene activity is required to establish and maintain at later developmental stages the expression of several terminal differentiation genes. This noncanonical, late function of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> may be shared by other Hox genes in the mouse nervous system. In the spinal cord, we found several other Hox genes (<italic>Hoxc4, Hoxa5, Hoxc5, Hoxa6, Hoxc6, Hoxa7</italic>) to be continuously expressed in brachial MNs, potentially acting as Hoxc8 collaborators. We made similar observations in thoracic (<italic>Hoxd9</italic>) and lumbar (<italic>Hoxc10, Hoxa11</italic>) MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, expression of multiple Hox genes has been observed in the adult mouse and human brain, leading to the hypothesis that maintained Hox gene expression is necessary for activity-dependent synaptic pruning and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hutlet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>). To date, the functional significance of maintained Hox gene expression in the CNS remains largely unknown, and temporally controlled genetic approaches are required to fully elucidate the late functions of this remarkable class of highly conserved TFs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The quest for terminal selectors of spinal motor neuron identity</title><p>Numerous genetic studies in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> support the idea that continuously expressed TFs (termed ‘terminal selectors’) establish during development and maintain throughout postembryonic life the identity and function of individual neuron types by activating the expression of terminal differentiation genes (e.g. NT biosynthesis components, ion channels, adhesion, and signaling molecules) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deneris and Hobert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hobert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hobert, 2016</xref>). Multiple cases of terminal selectors for various neuron types have already been described in flies, cnidarians, marine chordates, and mice, suggesting deep conservation for this type of regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allan and Thor, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deneris and Hobert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hobert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hobert, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hobert and Kratsios, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tournière et al., 2020</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether spinal MNs in vertebrates employ a terminal selector type of mechanism to acquire and maintain their terminal differentiation features. Addressing this knowledge gap could aid the development of in vitro protocols for the generation of mature and terminally differentiated spinal MNs, a much anticipated goal in the field of MN disease modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sances et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Three lines of evidence implicate <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in the control of MN terminal differentiation. First, <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is expressed continuously, from embryonic to early postnatal stages, in brachial MNs. Second, our in vivo data and in vitro analysis suggest Hoxc8 is both necessary and sufficient for the expression of several of its target genes in MNs - such mode of action is reminiscent of terminal selectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Flames and Hobert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kratsios et al., 2011</xref>). Third, both early and late removal of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in brachial MNs affected the expression of several terminal differentiation genes, suggesting a continuous requirement. However, <italic>Hoxc8</italic> does not act alone - loss of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> did not completely eliminate the expression of its target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F–G</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>). This residual expression indicates that additional TFs are necessary to control brachial MN terminal differentiation. As mentioned in Results, one such factor is <italic>Hoxc6</italic>, which is coexpressed with <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in brachial MNs during embryonic and postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 bind directly on the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions of the same terminal differentiation genes in the context of mouse ESC-derived MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Another putative Hoxc8 collaborator is the LIM homeodomain protein <italic>Islet1</italic> (<italic>Isl1</italic>), which is required for early induction of genes necessary for ACh biosynthesis in mouse spinal MNs and the in vitro generation of MNs from human pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rhee et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Isl1</italic> is expressed continuously in brachial MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and amplifies its own expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Erb et al., 2017</xref>) - both defining features of a terminal selector gene. In addition to Hoxc6 and Isl1<italic>,</italic> our expression analysis revealed multiple TFs from different families (e.g. Hox, Irx, LIM) with continuous expression in brachial MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In the future, temporally controlled gene inactivation studies are needed to determine whether these TFs participate in the control of spinal MN terminal differentiation. Intriguingly, the majority of the TFs with continuous expression in brachial MNs belong to the homeodomain family. Homeodomain TFs are overrepresented in the current list of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mouse terminal selectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deneris and Hobert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reilly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting an ancient role for this family of regulatory factors in the

For the treadmill experiment, we used Fisher’s exact test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Aaron D Gitler (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers are in agreement that this is a very interesting study, addressing a fundamental topic in developmental genetics, with important implications for the field. Nonetheless, the reviewers have coalesced around several items that need to be addressed before we can consider this paper for publication.</p><p>1. The behavioral data is potentially important to this study, but not robustly performed. The N numbers need to be increased and additional behavioral tests should be added. Moreover, deleting Hoxc8 expression earlier in these studies, as was done for other experiments, would be useful.</p><p>2. The quality of many of the RNA in situ experiments was not good, making it hard for reviewers to easily assess the data. The authors should repeat the in situs where necessary or even consider newer, more quantitative RNA in situ approaches.</p><p>3. Authors should clarify their conclusions about the role of Hoxc8 in brachial motor neuron differentiation because at least from the data presented it does not seem to have a very significant role, and the authors should consider the potential involvement of other collaborating factors.</p><p>4. Authors should clarify the potential caveats by using two different methods for labeling MNs at the two time points and possibly coming up with a better method or way to normalize the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. My major concern with this paper is the lack of specificity for the findings and ease in building a cohesive story. The paper is largely centered around RNAseq and RNA in situ (that is sometimes hard to interpret, see comment below). I appreciate the large amount of effort put into this study, but it would be nice to know how many of these gene regulatory networks are direct (ie. TF binding to consensus motifs in promoter regions). I was unable to follow a clear logic as to why certain genes were chosen for follow up, or to focus large parts of the story on.</p><p>2. In regards to Figure 1, how specific are HB9::GFP and Chat::Ai9 to motor neurons, or neurons in general. Authors should co-stain for other neuronal and glial markers. Also, why not use a reporter from one of the identified terminal differentiation factors which is on early and late, so that a single reporter is used?</p><p>3. The RNA in situs in Figures3A, 4E, 5B and some of the supplemental images are not of the highest quality and one has to read the manuscript to know what to conclude. Perhaps newer approaches like RNAscope, or similar probes, would be more quantitative and easier to interpret. Also some images have white dotted circles around them cells of interest and other images do not – please be consistent.</p><p>4. Although sympathetic to the need to use the Hoxc8 late mice for behavioral experiments due to perinatal lethality with the Hoxc8 early mice, these experiments demonstrate there is no phenotype and the author's assertion that mutant mice &quot;tend&quot; to perform worse is an unfair stretch. Moreover, with an N number of 3 and 5 mice on some of the experiments, its hard to make conclusions. The authors should consider consulting with or collaborating with a more behavior focused lab to do these experiments in a more robust manner, adding more tests and mice, or consider leaving the behavior experiments out of this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>We have the following comments and suggestions for the authors to consider:</p><p>1) Hox factors are known to control motor neuron subtype/pool specification (e.g. Dasen et al., 2005). It would be helpful to know if Hoxc8 early or late deletions change motor neuron subtype/pool identity rather than their maturation, which could be the reason for the differential gene expression This could be confirmed with co-labeling of reporter and subtype/pool markers, as in the Irx experiments.</p><p>2) Based on Figure 4F, the authors seem to distinguish terminal differentiation genes (e.g. neurotransmitters, synapse molecules) from axon guidance molecules and transcription factors. However, there are times when these seem to be treated interchangeably (e.g. discussion of Sema5a and Ret on page 12). The authors should more clearly and consistently state what they consider terminal differentiation markers in the text.</p><p>3) It would be worthwhile to have co-labeling with reporter (Hb9-GFP vs ChAT-tdTom) for at least some of the selected genes (e.g. in Figure 3G) to see if there is specific reduction in the cells of interest rather than just through correlation based on spatial pattern.</p><p>4) The Irx2 knockout experiments suggest that this downstream target of Hoxc8 may be involved in specification of limb-generating motor neurons, but not in the expression of terminal differentiation markers regulated by Hoxc8. This result seems tangential to the paper as 1) the knockouts are performed very early (prior to cell specification) and therefore does not provide any additional information about how Hoxc8 regulates motor neuron development past specification stage and 2) do not a clear functional link between Hoxc8 and terminal differentiation regulation.</p><p>5) It is unclear what the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Irx2 (fosmid) experiments add to this paper. The loss of MNs entirely seems to detract from the overall point of this paper, which is that Hoxc8 helps to establish/maintain brachial motor neuron identity/maturation.</p><p>6) It is unclear what the behavioral experiments add to the paper since would be very difficult to attribute any phenotype to a specific cause. Also, unclear why the experiments were performed only in late Hoxc8 deletion and not the early deletion as well.</p><p>7) The quality of some of the in situs should be improved (e.g. Glra2 in Figure 4E)</p><p>8) It might be of interest to overexpress Hoxc8 in other regions of the spinal cord (e.g. cervical or thoracic) using chick electroporation for example to see if it can lead to overexpression of some of these terminal differentiation genes. This gain-of-function experiment may lend additional support to the proposal that Hoxc8 is required to maintain expression of these genes, although I am not sure that this is a requirement for distinguishing terminal selectors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors used two different genetic systems to label brachial MNs at embryonic day 12 (e12) and postnatal day 8 (p8) as it was not possible for them to label MNs with just a single genetic system. Using these reagents they conclude that Hoxc8 regulates some of the same and some different targets. But can they rule out that some of these results is a consequence of using two different labeling systems? Are they certain that the cells labeled at both time points are the same cells? Perhaps using a lineage tracing tool and/or normalizing with some of the genes they discover in their RNA-seq experiments may be a way add confidence in the similarities and differences that they find in the RNAseq datasets are accurate.</p><p>2. Along the same lines, the RNA ISH of Hoxc8 at e12 looks dense, suggesting that all MNs in LMC and MMC regions express Hoxc8. On the other hand, expression of Hoxc8 seems sparse at p8, suggesting few Hoxc8+ MNs at p8 compared to e12 stage. Performing dual RNA ISH with Hoxc8 and endogenous genes of interest would provide greater confidence that the same number of Hoxc8+ MNs are present at two different time points.</p><p>3. The authors state that Hoxc8 MN late mutants perform worse in rotarod performance test and forelimb grip strength in 3-month old mice. However, the statistical analysis suggests there is no significant change. It was unclear why the authors chose such a late time point for these assays, when the mice potentially have time to compensate for a compromised motor system. Redoing this experiment at earlier time points, such as with 1 month old mice (there is precedence for this in the literature), might reveal significant differences.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70766.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers are in agreement that this is a very interesting study, addressing a fundamental topic in developmental genetics, with important implications for the field.

In the revised manuscript, we have included new data on three behavioral tests (forelimb grip strength, treadmill, rotarod). We increased the number of animals (N) and also included in the analysis two sets of mice with conditional Hoxc8 manipulations: 1) <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup></italic> mice in which <italic>Olig2-Cre</italic> is active in motor neuron (MN) progenitors, and 2) <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup></italic> mice in which ChAT-IRES-Cre is active in post-mitotic MNs.</p><p>We have added the following paragraph in Results that summarizes our findings:</p><p>“Hoxc8 gene activity is necessary for brachial motor neuron function</p><p>We next sought to assess any potential behavioral defects in adult Hoxc8 MNΔ <sup>early</sup> and Hoxc8 MNΔ <sup>late</sup> animals by evaluating their motor coordination (Deacon, 2013), forelimb grip strength (Takeshita et al., 2017) and treadmill performance(Wozniak et al., 2019). No defects were observed in Hoxc8 MNΔ <sup>early</sup> and Hoxc8 MNΔ <sup>late</sup> mice during the rotarod performance test (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1), suggesting balance and motor coordination are normal in these animals. Next, we evaluated forelimb grip strength because brachial MNs innervate forelimb muscles. We found a statistically significant defect in Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup> mice, but not in Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup> mice (Figure 6A-B). Lastly, we tested these animals for their ability to run on a treadmill for a period of 30 seconds (sec). At a low speed (15 cm/sec), we observed statistically significant defects in Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup> mice. That is, 64.28% of Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup> mice fell off the treadmill in the first 5 sec of the trial compared to 28.57% of control mice (p = 0.0108) (Figure 6C, Figure 6 – videos 1-2). Moreover, 0% of Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup> mice were able to stay longer than 20 sec on the treadmill compared to 42.85% of control mice (Figure 6C). On the other hand, statistically significant defects were observed in Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup> mice only when the treadmill speed was increased to 25 cm/sec (Figure 6C-D). That is, 43.33% of Hoxc8 MNΔ <sup>late</sup> mice fell off the treadmill in the first 5 sec of the trial compared to 17.39% of control mice (p = 0.0461) (Figure 6D, Figure 6 – videos 3-4). Together, these data show that Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup> mice display a milder behavioral phenotype compared to Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup> mice. This is likely due to the fact that Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup> mice display a composite phenotype i.e., defects in early MN specification and axon guidance (Catela et al., 2016) combined with terminal differentiation defects [this study], whereas the Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup> mice only display terminal differentiation defects (this study). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the terminal differentiation defects of MNΔ<sup>early</sup> mice are a consequence of their early MN specification defects, this is unlikely as Hoxc8 binds directly to the cis-regulatory region of terminal differentiation genes (Mcam, Pappa, Glra2) (Figure 5B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The quality of many of the RNA in situ experiments was not good, making it hard for reviewers to easily assess the data. The authors should repeat the in situs where necessary or even consider newer, more quantitative RNA in situ approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted new RNA fluorescent ISH (FISH) experiments coupled with a MN-specific marker (Foxp1). These new data corroborate our original conclusion: Hoxc8 controls the expression of several target genes in brachial MNs (new Figure 3G, new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). To complement these in vivo findings, we now provide evidence in in vitro generated MNs that Hoxc8 is sufficient to induce the expression of the same target genes (e.g., <italic>Pappa, Glra2, Sema5a</italic>) we identified in vivo (new Figure 5A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Authors should clarify their conclusions about the role of Hoxc8 in brachial motor neuron differentiation because at least from the data presented it does not seem to have a very significant role, and the authors should consider the potential involvement of other collaborating factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree. Our new molecular analysis and behavioral data suggest Hoxc8 does not act alone in the context of brachial motor neuron terminal differentiation. We have clarified our conclusions and further highlighted the involvement of other collaborating factors in multiple places in Results and Discussion. The most significant changes to address this important point are summarized below.</p><p>In Results:</p><p>“We found that expression of Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1), a molecule required for neuromuscular synapse maintenance and neurotransmission(Mei and Xiong, 2008, Wolpowitz et al., 2000), is reduced (but not eliminated) in e12 brachial MNs of Hoxc8 MNΔ <sup>early</sup> mice (Figure 3F), likely due to the existence of additional factors that partially compensate for loss of Hoxc8 gene activity.”</p><p>“Importantly, not all Hoxc8 target genes (e.g., Nrg1, Mcam) we identified in vivo are upregulated in iHoxc8 ESC-derived MNs (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). This is likely due to the lack of Hoxc8 collaborating factors in these in vitro generated MNs. A putative collaborator is Hoxc6 because (a) Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 are co-expressed in embryonic brachial MNs (Catela et al., 2016), (b) animals lacking either Hoxc6 or Hoxc8 in brachial MNs display similar axon guidance defects (Catela et al., 2016), and (c) Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 control the expression of the same axon guidance molecule (Ret) in brachial MNs (Catela et al., 2016). Supporting the notion of collaboration, our analysis of available ChIP-seq data for Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 from iHoxc6 and iHoxc8 ESC-derived MNs(Bulajic et al., 2020), respectively, showed that these Hox proteins bind directly on the cis-regulatory region of previously known (Ret, Gfra3) and new (Mcam, Pappa, Nrg1, Sema5a) Hoxc8 target genes (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1).”</p><p>In Discussion:</p><p>“In the spinal cord, we found several other Hox genes (Hoxc4, Hoxa5, Hoxc5, Hoxa6, Hoxc6, Hoxa7) to be continuously expressed in brachial MNs, potentially acting as Hoxc8 collaborators.”</p><p>“This residual expression indicates that additional TFs are necessary to control brachial MN terminal differentiation. As mentioned in Results, one such factor is Hoxc6, which is co-expressed with Hoxc8 in brachial MNs during embryonic and postnatal stages (Catela et al., 2016) (Figure 2A). Importantly, Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 bind directly on the cis-regulatory regions of the same terminal differentiation genes in the context of mouse ESC-derived MNs (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). Another putative Hoxc8 collaborator is the LIM homeodomain protein Islet1 (Isl1), which is required for early induction of genes necessary for ACh biosynthesis in mouse spinal MNs and the in vitro generation of MNs from human pluripotent stem cells(Cho et al., 2014, Qu et al., 2014, Rhee et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Authors should clarify the potential caveats by using two different methods for labeling MNs at the two time points and possibly coming up with a better method or way to normalize the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree. The potential caveat is that our FACS-sorted cells also include a minority of cells that are not motor neurons. We acknowledge this possibility in Results:</p><p>“Two factors that could contribute to these transcriptional differences between the e12 and p8 datasets are: (1) different levels of gene expression (see next Section), and (2) a small fraction of the FACS-sorted cells are not MNs. Indeed, Hb9 (Mnx1) and ChAT, in addition to MNs, are also expressed in small, non-overlapping neuronal populations in the spinal cord (Wilson et al., 2005, Zagoraiou et al., 2009, Wichterle et al., 2002) (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1).”</p><p>However, we believe this caveat is not of a major concern for the following reasons:</p><p>(a) The end goal of using these two different methods for labeling brachial MNs was to identify genes (transcription factors, terminal differentiation markers) that are expressed continuously in these cells.

My major concern with this paper is the lack of specificity for the findings and ease in building a cohesive story. The paper is largely centered around RNAseq and RNA in situ (that is sometimes hard to interpret, see comment below). I appreciate the large amount of effort put into this study, but it would be nice to know how many of these gene regulatory networks are direct (ie. TF binding to consensus motifs in promoter regions). I was unable to follow a clear logic as to why certain genes were chosen for follow up, or to focus large parts of the story on.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that in some parts the original version of the manuscript lacked cohesion. To address this, we have now made significant changes in Results and also removed all data on Irx transcription factors, as suggested by Reviewers 1 and 2. We hope the revised manuscript is now more focused and communicates effectively its main conclusion, i.e., sustained Hoxc8 activity is necessary for brachial motor neuron terminal differentiation.</p><p>To address the comment on lack of specificity, we have now performed RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) coupled with a motor neuron-specific marker (FoxP1). These new findings (presented in Figure 3G and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1) corroborate the initial results reported in this paper.</p><p>Motivated by the reviewer’s comment to identify direct Hoxc8 target genes, we analyzed recently published RNA-Seq and ChIP-seq datasets from motor neurons derived from ES cells (ESC-MNs) in which Hoxc8 expression can be induced upon doxycycline treatment (Bulajic et al., 2020). Our analysis showed that the same Hoxc8 target genes (e.g., <italic>Pappa, Glra2</italic>) we found downregulated in brachial motor neurons of <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ <sup>early</sup></italic> and <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ <sup>late</sup></italic> mice are upregulated in motor neurons derived from ES cells (ESC-MNs), in which Hoxc8 expression is induced (Bulajic et al., 2020) (Figure 5A). Lastly, we found that Hoxc8 binds directly at the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of the terminal differentiation genes (e.g., <italic>Mcam, Pappa, Glra2</italic>) we identified in vivo, and is sufficient to induce their expression in the context of ESC-MNs (Figure 5B, Figure 5 —figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In regards to Figure 1, how specific are HB9::GFP and Chat::Ai9 to motor neurons, or neurons in general. Authors should co-stain for other neuronal and glial markers.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, the <italic>HB9::GFP</italic> mouse line is the best available tool to genetically label mouse embryonic motor neurons. This mouse line has been used by several recent studies for the same purpose and at the same time point with us: to isolate mouse spinal MNs at e12.5 with FACS and then conduct RNA-Sequencing (Sawai et al., <italic>eLife,</italic> 2022, PMID: 34994686; Hanley et al., <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2016, PMID: 27568519; Amin et al., <italic>Science</italic>, 2015, PMID: 26680198). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a very small population of the HB9::GFP+ cells we isolated at e12.5 are spinal interneurons. The original paper (Wichterle et al., Cell, 2002, PMID: 12176325) describing the generation of <italic>HB9::GFP</italic> mice notes: “GFP expression was found in motor neuron cell bodies, dendrites, and axons in HB9::GFP embryos. In this line a very low level of expression (10- to 20-fold lower than in motor neurons) was detected in DRG neurons and a subset of ventral interneurons at e10.5, but not later”.</p><p>It is also unlikely that we isolated any glia at e12.5 with the <italic>HB9::GFP</italic> line – mature oligodendrocytes are not present at e12.5 in the spinal cord, as the peak of myelination in mice occurs at postnatal day 21 (p21). Moreover, the aforementioned studies (PMID: 34994686, PMID: 27568519, PMID: 26680198) have not reported any <italic>HB9::GFP</italic> expression in glia.</p><p>Prompted by the reviewer’s suggestion, we conducted additional experiments to evaluate the specificity of labeling spinal motor neurons at p8 with the <italic>ChAT::IRES::Cre</italic>; Ai9 [Rosa26-CAG<sup>promoter</sup>-loxP-STOP-loxP-tdTomato] mouse line. Double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against ChAT (cholinergic motor neuron marker) and tdTomato (expressed in cells in which Cre is/was active) revealed robust co-localization of ChAT with tdTomato in most (if not all) spinal motor neurons (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>We also observed sparse tdTomato expression, but not ChAT, in a few cells (5-10 cells per section) located more dorsally and medially in the spinal cord, which are not motor neurons (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). A recent study that used the same <italic>ChAT::IRES::Cre</italic> line reported similar observations and suggested that this is likely due to earlier Cre expression in the lineage of these tdTomato positive cells (PMID: 33931636).</p><p>At p8, there are many astrocytes present in the spinal cord but few mature oligodendrocytes (myelination peaks at p21). We therefore stained against the astrocyte marker GFAP (Millipore, AB5541, 1:200) and found no colocalization with tdTomato-expressing cells in <italic>ChAT::IRES::Cre; Ai9</italic> spinal cords at p8 (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). We also attempted to stain for a microglia marker CD11b (Bio-Rad, MCA711, 1:50), but we did not detect any staining likely due to technical reasons. Altogether, these new data suggest that the tdTomato-expressing cells we isolated at p8 by FACS are mostly spinal motor neurons. Please, see also ER- Response 4 (page 3 of this document).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, why not use a reporter from one of the identified terminal differentiation factors which is on early and late, so that a single reporter is used?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion but it would require the generation and characterization of new mouse lines, as well as redoing the RNA-Seq experiments at e12 and p8. Such endeavor will take 4-5 years to complete judging from the amount of time it took to complete the current study. However, we are planning on generating in the future new reporter/Cre lines based on the terminal differentiation markers identified from this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The RNA in situs in Figures3A, 4E, 5B and some of the supplemental images are not of the highest quality and one has to read the manuscript to know what to conclude.

These new data corroborate our original conclusion: Hoxc8 controls the expression of several target genes in brachial MNs (new Figure 3G, new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). To complement these in vivo findings, we now provide evidence in in vitro generated MNs that Hoxc8 is sufficient to induce the expression of the same target genes (e.g., <italic>Pappa, Glra2, Sema5a</italic>) we identified in vivo (new Figure 5A). Lastly, we are now consistent with the white dotted circles. We only use them when we show Hoxc8 antibody staining or Hoxc8 RNA ISH data because Hoxc8 is also expressed in other cells of the spinal cord. We decided against using white dotted circles in all figures in order to be minimally invasive and avoid excessive drawing on top of our microscopy images. There is, however, a spinal cord schematic next to each image to orient the reader on what part of the spinal cord is actually shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Although sympathetic to the need to use the Hoxc8 late mice for behavioral experiments due to perinatal lethality with the Hoxc8 early mice, these experiments demonstrate there is no phenotype and the author's assertion that mutant mice &quot;tend&quot; to perform worse is an unfair stretch. Moreover, with an N number of 3 and 5 mice on some of the experiments, its hard to make conclusions. The authors should consider consulting with or collaborating with a more behavior focused lab to do these experiments in a more robust manner, adding more tests and mice, or consider leaving the behavior experiments out of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. By expanding our mouse colony, we have now conducted behavioral experiments both on <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup></italic> and <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup></italic> mice and increased N (new Figure 6, new Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Prompted by Reviewers 1 and 3, we have added a new test (treadmill analysis) on both <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup></italic> and <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup></italic> mice.

It would be helpful to know if Hoxc8 early or late deletions change motor neuron subtype/pool identity rather than their maturation, which could be the reason for the differential gene expression This could be confirmed with co-labeling of reporter and subtype/pool markers, as in the Irx experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point that we now clarified by text changes and new experiments.</p><p>A previous study (Catela et al., Cell Reports, 2016, PMID: 26904955) found that the overall organization of brachial MNs into columns is normal in <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup></italic> mice. However, the same study found that the expression of two motor neuron pool markers (Scip, Pea3) at e12.5 is partially affected, suggesting defects in motor neuron pool specification when <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is deleted early. In the current manuscript, we report that brachial motor neurons are generated in normal numbers in <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup></italic> mice (Figure 3C), but the expression of terminal differentiation genes (e.g., <italic>Nrg1, Mcam, Pappa</italic>) is affected in these mice (Figure 3F-G). Moreover, Hoxc8 binds directly on the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region of these genes (new Figure 5B, new Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>For the <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup></italic> mice, we attempted to stain brachial motor neurons with the motor neuron pool markers (Scip, Pea3) at e14.5 because at 14.5 we detect robust Hoxc8 depletion in these mice (new Figure 4B). However, these markers are transiently expressed and become downregulated in wildtype samples after e12.5. This prevented us from evaluating their expression at e14.5 in <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup></italic> spinal cords. Taken together, our analyses show that the expression of several terminal differentiation markers (e.g., <italic>Nrg1, Mcam, Pappa, Glra2</italic>) is affected in brachial MNs of <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup></italic> mice, which could explain their milder behavioral phenotype when compared to the <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup></italic> mice (new Figure 6, Figure 6 – videos 1 – 4).</p><p>In Results, we mention: “Together, these data show that Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup> mice display a milder behavioral phenotype compared to Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup> mice. This is likely due to the fact that Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup> mice display a composite phenotype (i.e., defects in early MN specification and axon guidance (Catela et al., 2016) combined with terminal differentiation defects [this study], whereas the Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>late</sup> mice only display terminal differentiation defects (this study). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the terminal differentiation defects of MNΔ<sup>early</sup> mice are a consequence of their early MN specification defects, this is unlikely as Hoxc8 binds directly to the cis-regulatory region of terminal differentiation genes (Mcam, Pappa, Glra2) (Figure 5B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Based on Figure 4F, the authors seem to distinguish terminal differentiation genes (e.g. neurotransmitters, synapse molecules) from axon guidance molecules and transcription factors. However, there are times when these seem to be treated interchangeably (e.g. discussion of Sema5a and Ret on page 12). The authors should more clearly and consistently state what they consider terminal differentiation markers in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we recognize the confusion and have modified the text accordingly in several occasions:</p><p>“Two simple, but not mutually exclusive mechanisms can be envisioned for the continuous expression of terminal differentiation genes (e.g., Slc10a4, Nrg1, Nyap2, Sncg, Ngfr, Glra2) in brachial MNs.”</p><p>“Lastly, Hoxc8 can only activate expression of Sema5a (member of Semaphorin family) at embryonic stages (Figure 3F-G, Table 1).”</p><p>“In this study, we uncovered several Hoxc8 target genes encoding different classes of proteins (Sema5a – axon guidance molecule; Glra2, Nrg1, Mcam, Pappa – terminal differentiation genes) (Figure 3E, Figure 4F), suggesting Hoxc8 controls different aspects of brachial MN development through the regulation of these genes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be worthwhile to have co-labeling with reporter (Hb9-GFP vs ChAT-tdTom) for at least some of the selected genes (e.g. in Figure 3G) to see if there is specific reduction in the cells of interest rather than just through correlation based on spatial pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important point, we coupled RNA fluorescence in situ (FISH) with antibody staining for FoxP1 (marker of LMC column in brachial region) on spinal cords of <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup></italic> mice. Consistent with what we originally reported, these experiments showed that the expression of several Hoxc8 target genes (<italic>Sema5a, Mcam, Pappa</italic>) is affected in brachial motor neurons (new Figure 3G; new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). Moreover, most of the target genes (e.g., <italic>Pappa, Sema5a, Glra2</italic>) that are downregulated – in vivo – in motor neurons of <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ<sup>early</sup></italic> and <italic>Hoxc8 MNΔ</italic> <sup>late</sup> mice are upregulated upon inducible Hoxc8 expression in vitro generated motor neurons (new data in Figure 5A). Hence, Hoxc8 appears to be both necessary and sufficient for the expression of its target genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Irx2 knockout experiments suggest that this downstream target of Hoxc8 may be involved in specification of limb-generating motor neurons, but not in the expression of terminal differentiation markers regulated by Hoxc8. This result seems tangential to the paper as 1) the knockouts are performed very early (prior to cell specification) and therefore does not provide any additional information about how Hoxc8 regulates motor neuron development past specification stage and 2) do not a clear functional link between Hoxc8 and terminal differentiation regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree and have decided to remove the mouse Irx data from this manuscript.

In the absence of an established chick electroporation system in our lab, we analyzed recently published RNA-Seq and ChIP-seq datasets from motor neurons derived from mouse ES cells (ESC-MNs), in which Hoxc8 expression is induced with doxycycline (Dox) treatment (Bulajic et al., 2020, PMID: 33028607). We included this analysis in Results as shown below:</p><p>“Hoxc8 is sufficient to induce its target genes and acts directly</p><p>To gain mechanistic insights, we analyzed recently published RNA-Seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets on MNs derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC), in which Hoxc8 expression was induced with doxycycline (Bulajic et al., 2020). Our RNA-Seq analysis showed that induction of Hoxc8 (iHox8) resulted in upregulation of previously known (Ret, Scip/Pouef1) and new (Pappa, Glra2, Sema5a) Hoxc8 target genes (Figure 5A). Moreover, ChIP-seq for Hoxc8 in the context of these iHoxc8 ESC-derived MNs revealed binding in the cis-regulatory region of all these genes (Figure 5B), suggesting Hoxc8 acts directly to activate their expression. This in vitro data together with the in vivo findings in Hoxc8 MNΔ <sup>early</sup> and Hoxc8 MNΔ <sup>late</sup> mice (Figure 3F-G, Figure 3 —figure supplement 1, Figure 4C) suggest that Hoxc8 is necessary and sufficient for the expression of several of its target genes in spinal MNs.</p><p>Importantly, not all Hoxc8 target genes (e.g., Nrg1, Mcam) we identified in vivo are upregulated in iHoxc8 ESC-derived MNs (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). This is likely due to the lack of Hoxc8 collaborating factors in these in vitro generated MNs. A putative collaborator is Hoxc6 because (a) Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 are co-expressed in embryonic brachial MNs (Catela et al., 2016), (b) animals lacking either Hoxc6 or Hoxc8 in brachial MNs display similar axon guidance defects (Catela et al., 2016), and (c) Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 control the expression of the same axon guidance molecule (Ret) in brachial MNs (Catela et al., 2016). Supporting the notion of collaboration, our analysis of available ChIP-seq data for Hoxc6 and Hoxc8 from iHoxc6 and iHoxc8 ESC-derived MNs(Bulajic et al., 2020), respectively, showed that these Hox proteins bind directly on the cis-regulatory region of previously known (Ret, Gfra3) and new (Mcam, Pappa, Nrg1, Sema5a) Hoxc8 target genes (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Altogether, our in vivo data and in vitro analysis suggest that Hoxc8 is necessary and sufficient for the expression of at least some its target genes. Indeed, most terminal selector-type TFs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are both necessary and sufficient.

The authors used two different genetic systems to label brachial MNs at embryonic day 12 (e12) and postnatal day 8 (p8) as it was not possible for them to label MNs with just a single genetic system. Using these reagents they conclude that Hoxc8 regulates some of the same and some different targets. But can they rule out that some of these results is a consequence of using two different labeling systems? Are they certain that the cells labeled at both time points are the same cells? Perhaps using a lineage tracing tool and/or normalizing with some of the genes they discover in their RNA-seq experiments may be a way add confidence in the similarities and differences that they find in the RNAseq datasets are accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is a very important point which we now address with text changes and new experiments. Please see our detailed responses in ER – Response 4 (page 3 of this document) and R1 – Response 2 (page 6). In brief, Hb9-GFP expression is faint at post-natal stages, which necessitated the use of an additional reporter strategy (ChAT-Cre; Ai9 tdTomato line) for the discovery of genes expressed in brachial MNs via RNA-Sequencing.

Along the same lines, the RNA ISH of Hoxc8 at e12 looks dense, suggesting that all MNs in LMC and MMC regions express Hoxc8. On the other hand, expression of Hoxc8 seems sparse at p8, suggesting few Hoxc8+ MNs at p8 compared to e12 stage. Performing dual RNA ISH with Hoxc8 and endogenous genes of interest would provide greater confidence that the same number of Hoxc8+ MNs are present at two different time points.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reviewer is correct. Consistent with our findings (Figure 3B), a previous study showed that, at e12, Hoxc8 is expressed both in MMC and LMC motor neurons (Catela et al., 2016, PMID: 26904955). Like most Hox genes, <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is also expressed in other neurons (not motor neurons) of the spinal cord (Figure 3B, 4B), which necessitated the need of Cre lines (Olig2::Cre, ChAT-IRES-Cre) to specifically inactivate it in motor neurons at early and late stages of development.</p><p>In wild type animals, spinal motor neurons are normally generated in excess and a large fraction of them (~50%) undergoes physiological/developmental cell death after e12, resulting in fewer motor neurons at later developmental stages (PMID: 10928282).
