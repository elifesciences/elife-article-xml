important for innate immunity, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. Here we report that, under flow, von Willebrand factor/glycoprotein Ibα-dependent platelet ‘priming’ induces integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> activation that, in turn, mediates neutrophil and T-cell binding. Binding of platelet α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> to SLC44A2 on neutrophils leads to mechanosensitive-dependent production of highly prothrombotic neutrophil extracellular traps. A polymorphism in <italic>SLC44A2</italic> (rs2288904-A) present in 22% of the population causes an R154Q substitution in an extracellular loop of SLC44A2 that is protective against venous thrombosis results in severely impaired binding to both activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and VWF-primed platelets. This was confirmed using neutrophils homozygous for the <italic>SLC44A2</italic> R154Q polymorphism. Taken together, these data reveal a previously unreported mode of platelet-neutrophil crosstalk, mechanosensitive NET production, and provide mechanistic insight into the protective effect of the <italic>SLC44A2</italic> rs2288904-A polymorphism in venous thrombosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Platelets in our blood form clots over sites of injury to stop us from bleeding. Blood clots can also occur in places where they are not needed, such as deep veins in our legs or other regions of the body. Developing such clots – also known as deep vein thrombosis (or DVT for short) – is one of the most common cardiovascular diseases and a major cause of death. Although certain inherited factors have been linked to DVT, the underlying mechanisms of the disease remain poorly understood.</p><p>In addition to platelets, the pathological (or dangerous) clots that cause DVT also contain immune cells called neutrophils which fight off bacterial infections. Platelets are recruited to the wall of the vein by a protein called “von Willebrand Factor” (or VWF for short). However, it remained unclear how these recruited platelets interact with neutrophils and whether this promotes the onset of DVT.</p><p>To answer this question, Constantinescu-Bercu et al. used a device that mimics the flow of blood to study how human platelets change when they are exposed to VWF. This revealed that VWF ‘primes’ the platelets to interact with neutrophils via a protein called integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. Further experiments showed that integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> binds to a protein on the surface of neutrophils called SLC44A2. Once the neutrophils interacted with the ‘primed’ platelets, they started making traps which increased the size of the blood clot by capturing other blood cells and proteins.</p><p>Finally, Constantinescu-Bercu et al. studied a genetic variant of the SLC44A2 protein which is found in 22% of people and is associated with a lower risk of developing DVT. This genetic mutation caused SLC44A2 to interact with ‘primed’ platelets more weakly, which may explain why people with this genetic variant are protected from getting DVT.</p><p>These findings suggest that blocking the interaction between ‘primed’ platelets and neutrophils could reduce the risk of DVT. Although current treatments for DVT can prevent patients from forming dangerous blood clots, they can also cause severe bleeding. Since neutrophils are not crucial for normal blood clots to form at the site of injury, drugs targeting SLC44A2 could inhibit inappropriate clotting without causing excess bleeding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>VWF</kwd><kwd>αiibβ3</kwd><kwd>platelet</kwd><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>SLC44A2</kwd><kwd>NETosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/15/65/32036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salles-Crawley</surname><given-names>Isabelle I</given-names></name><name><surname>Woollard</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name><name><surname>Crawley</surname><given-names>James TB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/17/22/32868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salles-Crawley</surname><given-names>Isabelle I</given-names></name><name><surname>Woollard</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name><name><surname>Crawley</surname><given-names>James TB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/18/53/33863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frontini</surname><given-names>Mattia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The interaction between activated αIIbβ3 on platelets and SLC44A2 on circulating neutrophils facilitates neutrophil capture and drives flow-dependent NETosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To fulfil their hemostatic function, platelets must be recruited to sites of vessel damage. This process is highly dependent upon von Willebrand factor (VWF). Upon vessel injury, exposed subendothelial collagen binds plasma VWF via its A3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruz et al., 1995</xref>). Elevated shear, or turbulent/disturbed flow, then unravels tethered VWF and exposes its A1 domain, facilitating specific capture of platelets via glycoprotein (GP)Ibα.</p><p>As well as capturing platelets under flow, the A1-GPIbα interaction also induces shear-dependent signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryckaert et al., 2015</xref>). For this, GPIbα first binds the A1 domain of immobilized VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Rheological forces then cause unfolding of the GPIbα mechanosensitive domain that translates the mechanical stimulus into a signal within the platelet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). This leads to release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and activation of the platelet integrin, α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gardiner et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>VWF-mediated signaling transduces a mild signal. Consequently, these signaling events are often considered redundant within hemostasis as platelets respond more dramatically to other agonists present at sites of vessel injury (e.g. collagen, thrombin, ADP, thromboxane A2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Senis et al., 2014</xref>). Full platelet activation involves release of α- and δ-granules, presentation of new cell surface proteins, activation of cell surface integrins and alterations in the membrane phospholipid composition. The extent of platelet activation is dependent upon both the concentration, and identity, of the agonist(s) to which the platelets are exposed, which is dictated by the location of the platelets relative to the damaged vessel. For example, platelets in the core of a hemostatic plug/thrombus are exposed to higher concentrations of agonists and are more highly activated (i.e. P-selectin-positive procoagulant platelets) than those in the surrounding shell (P-selectin-negative) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Witt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stalker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Welsh et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, platelets exhibit a ‘tunable’ activation response determined by agonist availability.</p><p>Aside from hemostasis, platelets also have important roles as immune cells by aiding in targeting of bacteria by leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaertner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolaczkowska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sreeramkumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). Platelet-leukocyte interactions also influence the development of inflammatory cardiovascular conditions. In deep vein thrombosis (DVT), VWF-dependent platelet recruitment, platelet-neutrophil interactions and the production of highly thrombotic neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) all contribute to the development of a pathological thrombus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuchs et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schulz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">von Brühl et al., 2012</xref>). Although the precise sequence of events still remains unclear, it appears that during the early stages of DVT, VWF-bound platelets acquire the ability to interact with leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">von Brühl et al., 2012</xref>). Exactly how this is mediated given the lack of vessel damage is unclear. It also remains to be determined precisely how platelet-tethered neutrophils undergo NETosis in DVT in the absence of an infectious agent.</p><p>Known direct platelet-leukocyte interactions involve either P-selectin or CD40L on the surface of platelets binding to P-selectin glycoligand-1 (PSGL-1) and CD40, respectively, on leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lievens et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mayadas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palabrica et al., 1992</xref>). As platelets must be potently activated to facilitate P-selectin/CD40L exposure, such interactions unlikely mediate the early platelet-leukocyte interactions that occur in the murine DVT model. Consistent with this, lack of platelet P-selectin has no effect upon either leukocyte recruitment or thrombus formation in murine DVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">von Brühl et al., 2012</xref>). Leukocytes can also indirectly interact with platelets through Mac-1 (integrin α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub>), which can associate with activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> via fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weber and Springer, 1997</xref>), or directly via GPIbα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simon et al., 2000</xref>). Interactions are also possible through lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1/integrin α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub>) that can bind intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM-2) on platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damle et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diacovo et al., 1994</xref>). In both instances though, leukocyte activation is necessary to activate Mac-1 or LFA-1 integrins before interactions can occur.</p><p>Although it is often assumed that only activated platelets bind leukocytes, recent studies have revealed that platelets captured under flow by VWF released from activated endothelial cells can recruit leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doddapattar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). If VWF-GPIbα-dependent signaling is capable of promoting leukocyte binding, this may be highly relevant to the non-hemostatic platelet functions (particularly when other agonists are not available/abundant), but may also provide major mechanistic insights into the early recruitment of leukocytes during the initiation of DVT.</p><p>Genome wide association studies (GWAS) on venous thromboembolism (VTE) have identified a panel of genes (<italic>ABO</italic>, <italic>F2</italic>, <italic>F5</italic>, <italic>F11</italic>, <italic>FGG</italic>, <italic>PROCR</italic>) with well-described influences upon coagulation and thrombotic risk, as well as those with well-established causative links (e.g. <italic>PROS</italic>, <italic>PROC</italic>, <italic>SERPINC1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Germain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Germain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosendaal and Reitsma, 2009</xref>). This is consistent with the efficacy of therapeutic targeting of coagulation to protect against DVT with anticoagulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2016</xref>). However, although the use of anticoagulants is effective, dosing and efficacy are limited by the increase in the risk of bleeding in treated individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schulman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schulman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schulman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wolberg et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, alternative targets that inhibit DVT disease processes, but that do not modify bleeding risk may provide new adjunctive therapies to further protect against the development or recurrence of DVT. GWAS studies have also identified additional risk <italic>loci</italic> for VTE, but with no known role in coagulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apipongrat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Germain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinds et al., 2016</xref>). This provides encouragement that alternative therapeutic targets may exist with the potential to modify the disease process without affecting bleeding risk. These <italic>loci</italic> include <italic>SLC44A2</italic> and <italic>TSPAN15</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apipongrat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Germain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinds et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the identification of these <italic>loci</italic>, the function of these cell surface proteins with respect to their involvement in the pathogenesis of venous thrombosis remains unclear.</p><p>Using microfluidic flow channels to enable analysis of the phenotypic effects of VWF-GPIbα signaling under flow, we confirm the rapid activation of the platelet integrin, α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. Activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> is capable of binding directly to neutrophils via a direct interaction with SLC44A2. Under flow, this interaction transduces a signal into neutrophils capable of driving NETosis. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2288904-A) in <italic>SLC44A2</italic> (minor allele frequency 0.22) that is protective against VTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Germain et al., 2015</xref>) encodes a R154Q substitution in the first extracellular loop of the receptor that markedly reduces neutrophil-platelet binding via activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. These results provide a functional explanation for the protective effects of the rs2288904-A SNP and highlight the potential of SLC44A2 as an adjunctive therapeutic target in DVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Constantinescu-Bercu et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To explore the influence of platelet binding to VWF under flow upon platelet function, full length (FL-) human VWF was adsorbed directly onto microfluidic microchannel surfaces, or the isolated recombinant VWF A1 domain, or an A1 domain variant (Y1271C/C1272R, termed A1*) that exhibits a 10-fold higher affinity for GPIbα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blenner et al., 2014</xref>), were captured via their 6xHis tag.

However, the physiological agonists or mechanisms that drive NETosis are not fully resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nauseef and Kubes, 2016</xref>). We therefore examined whether the binding of neutrophils to α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> might induce NETosis. Isolated PMNs were perfused over either activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> or anti-CD16 (negative control) at 50 s<sup>−1</sup> for 10 min and NETosis was subsequently analyzed under static conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). Nuclear decondensation was evident after ~60 min, and Sytox Green fluorescence, indicative of cell permeability that precedes NETosis, was detected from ~85 min. Nuclear decondensation, increased cell permeability and positive staining with a cell impermeable DNA fluorophore do not specifically identify NETosis. Therefore, an anti-citrullinated histone H3 antibody was perfused through the channels after 90 min to more specifically identify NETs. The introduction of flow at this point caused the DNA to form extended mesh-like NETs that were stained positively by Hoechst and the anti-citrullinated histone H3 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Very similar results were obtained with PMN bound to either α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> (captured by the activating anti-β<sub>3</sub> antibody), or to platelets ‘primed’ by A1* or FL-VWF, which all exhibited a similar proportion of neutrophils undergoing NETosis within the 2 hr timeframe, suggesting that interaction with α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> alone can promote NETosis and that any platelet releasate present does not appreciably augment this process under these conditions. On activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, 69% ± 14% of neutrophils through the entire channel formed NETs after 2 hr, compared to minimal NETosis events (8 ± 8%) when neutrophils were captured by anti-CD16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).

We further limited the candidate search by selecting those genes that code for transmembrane proteins. Using this approach, we identified 93 candidate genes. Of these, 33 genes were excluded as they are primarily associated with intracellular membranes. An additional 16 genes were also excluded due to the presence of short extracellular regions/domains (&lt;30 a.a.) that would unlikely be capable of facilitating interactions with an extracellular binding partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We then analyzed proteomic data to verify the preferential expression of the remaining candidates in neutrophils as opposed to monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rieckmann et al., 2017</xref>). These data suggested that the protein product of 14 of the remaining genes appeared to be detected in higher abundance in monocytes, which we used as a further exclusion criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>). From the remaining 30 candidate genes, the <italic>SLC44A2</italic> gene was selected for validation due to its recent identification as a risk locus for both DVT and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Germain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinds et al., 2016</xref>), both of which are pathologies associated with described contributions of platelet-leukocyte interactions. SLC44A2 is a cell surface receptor with 10 membrane-spanning domains and five extracellular loops of 178a.a., 38a.a., 72a.a., 38a.a. and 18a.a. in length, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nair et al., 2016</xref>). We sourced antibodies against SLC44A2 that specifically recognize amino acid sequences within the first and second extracellular loops.

Perfusing human neutrophils over immobilized activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> in the presence of the first anti-SLC44A2 antibody (anti-SLC44A2 #1) that recognizes the second extracellular loop revealed a dose-dependent blockade of neutrophil binding when compared to no antibody or control rabbit IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a–b</xref>). A second anti-SLC44A2 antibody (anti-SLC44A2 #2) that recognizes the first extracellular loop region of SLC44A2 confirmed these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). The anti-SLC44A2 #2 almost completely blocked neutrophil binding to activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> suggesting that this antibody more effectively blocks the neutrophil binding to the integrin than anti-SLC44A2 #1.

Despite this, when compared to other platelet agonists, degranulation and P-selectin exposure induced by VWF binding are both very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Witt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>That platelet binding to VWF under flow ‘primes’, rather than activates, platelets is consistent with in vivo observations. At sites of vessel damage, VWF is important for platelet accumulation through all layers of the hemostatic plug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joglekar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verhenne et al., 2015</xref>). All platelets within a thrombus/hemostatic plug likely form interactions with VWF. Despite this, it is only the platelets in the ‘core’ of the thrombus that become P-selectin-positive, procoagulant platelets, whereas the more loosely bound platelets that form the surrounding ‘shell’ remain essentially P-selectin-negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Welsh et al., 2014</xref>). If VWF-binding alone were sufficient to fully activate platelets, the differential platelet characteristics of the ‘core’ and ‘shell’ would not be observed.</p><p>Although it is frequently implied that VWF is only important for platelet capture under high shear conditions, murine models of venous thrombosis with no collagen exposure have repeatedly revealed an important role for VWF-mediated platelet accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmeier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chauhan et al., 2007</xref>). Platelet binding to VWF occurs most efficiently at arterial shear rates, but still occurs under lower linear venous shear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miyata and Ruggeri, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yago et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). However, linear channels do not mimic the distorted and branched paths of the vascular system that cause more disturbed flow patterns, particularly around valves. Using channels with changing geometry under lower shear conditions, we and others have noted that VWF captures platelets appreciably more efficiently in areas of disturbed flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, at venous flow rates through bifurcated channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>), we detected platelet capture on FL-VWF with concomitant ‘priming’ and leukocyte binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>). This was appreciably augmented at bifurcation points where disturbed flow exists. Consistent with our earlier findings, leukocyte binding was almost completely inhibited when α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>). This implies that VWF can function in platelet recruitment within the venous system, particularly in areas of turbulence (e.g. branch sites, valves), which are frequently the nidus for thrombus formation in DVT.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Analysis of platelet binding to FL-VWF under low/disturbed flow and subsequent leukocyte binding.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of blood flow through bifurcated channels. Blood is drawn through inlets #1, #2 and #3, and out through outlet #4. For much of the channels, the flow is linear, with particular exception to the bifurcation site on the right where disturbed flow exists due to convergence of flows. (<bold>b</bold>) Channels were coated with FL-VWF and whole blood labeled with DiOC6 was perfused through channels as in a), and as denoted by arrows, at an exit shear rate of 50 s<sup>−1</sup>. At this low shear rate, platelets can bind to the channel surface to which leukocytes (larger cells also stained in green) also bind. Although this is evident in the linear part of the channel (inset), at the site of most turbulent flow increased platelet and leukocyte binding was observed. (<bold>c</bold>) As in b) except GR144053 was added to block α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. Blocking α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> inhibited the majority of leukocyte binding to platelets (the majority of those observed are in transit). However, in the absence of leukocyte binding the binding of platelets to the VWF surface under low flow can be more clearly observed in both the linear and turbulent flow areas.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53353-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In venous thrombosis, the thrombus generally forms over the intact endothelium, in the absence of vessel damage. This poses the question of how VWF might contribute to DVT if subendothelial collagen is not exposed. It is likely that this reflects the function of newly secreted ultra-large VWF released from endothelial cells. Under low disturbed flow, released ultra-large VWF may tangle to form strings/cables over the surface of the endothelium. Tangled VWF strings/cables are appreciably more resistant to ADAMTS13 proteolysis than VWF that is simply unraveled. In the murine stenosis model of DVT, complete VWF-deficiency prevents platelet binding over the endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmeier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chauhan et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, blocking GPIbα binding to VWF also completely blocks platelet accumulation and thrombus formation in the stenosis model of DVT. Thus, when platelets bind to VWF under flow in such settings, platelets may become ‘primed’ facilitating both aggregation and neutrophil binding through activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, but without activating them into procoagulant platelets.</p><p>Our study reveals, that T-cells and neutrophils can bind directly to activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> on platelets or that has been coupled to microchannel surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–d</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>). In both cases, the interaction can be inhibited by eptifibatide and GR144053 suggesting that both cell types may share the same receptor, in a manner that is dependent upon the RGD binding groove of activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Previous studies have identified roles for β<sub>2</sub> integrins, Mac-1 (α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub>) and LFA-1 (α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub>), on leukocytes in mediating interactions with platelets. It should be recognized that the interactions of these molecules are dependent upon the integrins first being activated (and therefore also the cell), which is not the case in our system and is in contrast to previous studies implicating Mac-1 and LFA-1. However, we provide evidence that Mac-1 (α<sub>M</sub>β<sub>2</sub>) and LFA-1 (α<sub>L</sub>β<sub>2</sub>) are not involved by: 1) Leukocytes do not bind to ‘unprimed’ platelets captured by anti-PECAM-1. As Mac-1 and LFA-1 bind to GPIbα and ICAM-2, respectively, both of which are constitutively presented on the platelet surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuijper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simon et al., 2000</xref>), if Mac-1 and LFA-1 were the receptors involved binding would have been observed in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>). 2) Mac-1 on leukocytes can bind indirectly to activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> via a fibrinogen bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weber and Springer, 1997</xref>). However, we demonstrate that fibrinogen competes for leukocyte binding to bind to activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). If fibrinogen were required, removal of fibrinogen from our perfusion system would have diminished the number of leukocyte interactions with primed platelets/α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> if Mac-1 were involved. 3) Antibody-mediated blocking of β<sub>2</sub> integrins did not reduce VWF-‘primed’ platelet-leukocyte interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). 4) Only neutrophils and T cells interact with the ‘primed’ platelets, whereas Mac-1 and LFA-1 are also highly expressed in monocytes which do not bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–f</xref>).</p><p>We also excluded a role for P-selectin-PSGL-1 for the platelet-leukocyte interaction that we observe as; 1) we detected little/no P-selectin on VWF-‘primed’ platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggestive of minimal degranulation occurring; this also provides indirect evidence for the lack of CD40L on the platelet surface. 2) P-selectin blockade had no effect upon the number of leukocytes binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), and 3) only T-cells and neutrophils bind VWF-‘primed’ platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) - given that all leukocytes express PSGL-1,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laszik et al., 1996</xref>) and CD40, if the capture of leukocytes were entirely P-selectin or CD40L-mediated, such cell-type selectivity would not be observed. We did, however, measure an influence of P-selectin upon the rolling speed of leukocytes over VWF-primed platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> a<bold>nd</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). This suggests that although low levels of P-selectin present on the platelet surface is insufficient to facilitate leukocyte capture, it may synergize to slow rolling of leukocytes that are first captured by α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>There are several studies that provide support for P-selectin-independent interactions of neutrophils and T-cells with platelets. Guidotti et al demonstrated the interaction of T-cells with small intrasinusoidal platelet aggregates in the liver during hepatotropic viral infections was independent of both P-selectin and CD40L in platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guidotti et al., 2015</xref>). Using a murine model of peritonitis, Petri et al demonstrated that neutrophil recruitment and extravasation was highly dependent upon VWF, GPIbα, and platelets, but largely independent of P-selectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petri et al., 2010</xref>). Two further studies also corroborate the contention that VWF/GPIbα-bound platelets are capable of promoting neutrophil recruitment/extravasation in murine models of ischemia/reperfusion via P-selectin-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gandhi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khan et al., 2012</xref>). These studies support the idea that both VWF and platelets can function beyond hemostasis to fulfil a role in leukocyte recruitment at sites of inflammation.</p><p>As T-cells and neutrophils (and not B-cells or monocytes) can bind platelets via activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, this suggests that a specific receptor exists on these cells that is absent on B-cells or monocytes. Using transcriptomic and proteomic data, we identified 30 transmembrane candidates that were preferentially expressed in neutrophils (or T-cells) over monocytes. From this list, <italic>SLC44A2</italic> stood out due to its recent identification as a risk locus for both VTE and stroke, but with as yet unknown functional association with these pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apipongrat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Germain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinds et al., 2016</xref>). As platelet-leukocyte interactions are involved in both of these thrombotic disorders, we hypothesized that SLC44A2 functions as the neutrophil counter receptor for activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. The cellular function of SLC44A2 is not well-defined. It contains 10 transmembrane domains with five extracellular loops. The intracellular N-terminal tail contains several putative phosphorylation sites of unknown functional significance. As well as neutrophils, SLC44A2 expression has also been reported in endothelial cells and platelets. However, proteomic data suggest that levels in neutrophils are &gt;300 fold greater in neutrophils that platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rieckmann et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We provide several lines of evidence to support the direct interaction between SLC44A2 and activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. 1) Two different anti-SLC44A2 antibodies that recognize extracellular loops of the receptor blocked the binding of neutrophils to both VWF-‘primed’ platelets and to activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. 2) Recombinant expression of SLC44A2 in HEK293T cells imparted the ability of these cells to bind both VWF-primed platelets and activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> under flow in a manner that can be blocked by either GR144053 or by anti-SLC44A2 antibodies. 3) Introduction of the rs2288904-A SNP in <italic>SLC44A2</italic> that is protective against VTE resulted in markedly reduced binding of transfected HEK293T cells to both VWF-‘primed’ platelets and activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. 4) Neutrophils homozygous for the rs2288904-A/A SNP exhibit significantly reduced binding to VWF-‘primed’ platelets.</p><p>Although NET production is an established mechanism through which neutrophils control pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>), many questions remain as to how NETosis is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nauseef and Kubes, 2016</xref>). Binding of platelets to Kupffer cells in the liver of mice following infection with <italic>B. cereus</italic> or <italic>S. aureus</italic> is mediated by VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). This binding augments the recruitment of neutrophils, NET production and the control of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kolaczkowska et al., 2015</xref>). Mice lacking VWF or GPIbα do not form these aggregates and so have diminished neutrophil recruitment and, therefore, decreased survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). How NETosis is initiated following platelet binding remains uncertain. Alone, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is not a potent activator of NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2007</xref>). However, LPS-stimulated platelets, which bind of fibrinogen (i.e. α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> is activated) and also robustly activate NETosis independent of P-selectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Looney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lopes Pires et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We detected rapid release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (within minutes) in bound neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> a<bold>nd</bold> <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>) that preceded the release of NETs after 80–90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This process was dependent upon neutrophils being captured under flow, suggesting that signal transduction through binding of α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> to SLC44A2 may be mechanosensitive, which is consistent with the recent report suggesting a major influence of shear upon NETosis in the presence of platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). As NETosis can be induced following binding to purified α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> under flow alone, this suggests that this process does not require a component of the platelet releasate (e.g. high mobility group box 1, platelet factor 4, RANTES and thromboxane A2) which have been reported to be capable of driving NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carestia et al., 2016</xref>). Naturally, if platelet degranulation occurs (in response to other agonists), these components may have the potential to further augment this process.</p><p>We propose a model in which platelets have a tunable response that can distinguish their roles in hemostasis and immune cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The ‘priming’ of platelets by binding to VWF under flow (in the absence of other platelet agonists) may assist in the targeting of leukocytes to resolve pathogens or mediate vascular inflammatory response. The activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin can then mediate neutrophil recruitment through binding to SLC44A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We do not exclude a supporting role for P-selectin in maintaining T-cell/neutrophil recruitment, but this is not essential for initiating recruitment. Under flow SLC44A2 transduces a mechanical stimulus capable of promoting NETosis via a pathway involving synergy between NADPH oxidase and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Homeostatically, this may be beneficial for immune responses. However, during chronic infection or vascular inflammation NET production may promote intravascular thrombosis. It remains to be determined whether the rs2288904-A SNP in <italic>SLC44A2</italic> that is protective against VTE might also (negatively) influence the host response to infection, or certain routes of infection that are more reliant upon platelet immune cell function. This should determine the net selective pressure upon the SNP. However, as VTE is a comparatively recent selective pathology (in evolutionary terms) and rates of VTE are typically low during the most common child-bearing years, this positive selective pressure on rs2288904-A SNP may not strong. Indeed, the prevalence of this SNP in different global populations suggests that the SNP has not originated recently. Moreover, if the host response to infection is, at least in certain settings, also impaired in individuals carrying the rs2288904-A SNP, this would be predicted to slow the rate of positive selection. More work is needed to understand role of rs2288904-A SNP in VTE and infection risk and penetrance of SNP within large genomic datasets.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model of platelet priming, neutrophil binding and NETosis.</title><p>(1) Under normal conditions, VWF circulates in plasma in a globular conformation that does not interact with platelets.

For this, neutrophils and monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood. PBMCs were separated by gradient centrifugation (Percoll 1.078 g/ml) whilst neutrophils were isolated by CD16 positive selection (Miltenyi) from the pellet, after red blood cell lysis. PBMCs were further separated to obtain a monocyte-rich layer using a second gradient (Percoll 1.066 g/ml) and monocytes further purified by CD14-positive selection (Miltenyi) after CD16 depletion. For neutrophils and monocytes, gene expression was tested also on Illumina HT12v4 arrays (accession E-MTAB-1573 at arrayexpress). The purification of naive B lymphocytes, naive CD4 lymphocytes, naive CD8 lymphocytes used in this study has been extensively described. Regulatory CD4 lymphocytes (T regs) were isolated by flow activated cytometry using the following surface markers combinations: CD3+ CD4+ CD25+ CD127low. Cell type purity was assessed by flow cytometry and morphological analysis. RNA was extracted using TRIzol according to manufacturer’s instructions, quantified using a Qubit RNA HS kit (Thermofisher) and quality controlled using a Bioanalyzer RNA pico kit (Agilent).

MMSEQ (v1.0.10) was used with default parameters to quantify and normalize gene expression. Differential gene expression analyses were performed: mature neutrophils (n = 7) vs monocytes (n = 5) and CD4-positive/αβ T cells (n = 8) vs monocytes (n = 5). Regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>, n = 1) and native B cells (n = 1), are included in the heatmap, for comparison but were not used in differential gene expression analysis due to the low number of biological replicates. We selected genes that were expressed significantly higher in neutrophils than in monocytes, and also those that were significantly higher in CD4-positive/αβ T cells than in monocytes. Their intersection identified 750 genes (598 of which protein coding). From these 598 genes, we selected the 93 genes that contained the Uniprot annotation of ‘INTRAMEMBRANE DOMAIN’ or ‘TRANSMEM DOMAIN’. The effective log2(FPKM+1) data were presented in the heatmap. Further selection involved discarding those transmembrane proteins that are not present on the extracellular membrane, or primarily associated with intracellular membranes as determined by Uniprot annotation. Proteins that (where known) had extracellular regions of &lt;30 amino acids, as determined in Uniprot, that might be less likely capable of mediating specific ligand binding were also excluded.

This was limited by the pool of healthy consented donors available to us, as well as the practicality of timing of call backs to fit in with the nature of the experimentation performed on each sample – each sample needs to be prepared fresh for immediate experimentation limiting experiments to 2 donor samples prepared and analysed in parallel per day through channels with accompanying controls. Despite the numbers, however, the data/differences between genotype were very clear and we firmly believe that they complement the accompanying data using HEK293T cells transfected with SLC44A2(R154) or SLC44A2(Q154) shown in Figure 8C-E that further support the involvement of the polymorphism in mediating platelet binding. We have now also added these data with those from the R154/Q154 heterozygous individuals presented in new Figure 8F and added this finding to the text in the Results section which further support our findings.</p><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewers that SLC44A2 R154Q knock-in mice would prove a valuable tool to explore this, and this is certainly on our radar. The global SLC44A2 knockout mice have recently been shown to be protected against experimental DVT supporting the role of SLC44A2 – these data are accepted/in press so a full reference will be available presently. The contribution of the polymorphism to DVT remains untested in the murine system (which have an Arg at position 154 of SLC44A2). Of note the, VLRDGDCPAVLI sequence in SLC44A2 containing R154 is very highly conserved between species, consistent with a conserved functional role for this part of the extracellular loop. Naturally, the generation of the knock-in mice will take some time, and this is beyond the scope of the current study or revision, but something that we would like to explore in future experiments.</p><p>The deletion/ablation of SLC44A2 expression from HL60 using CRISPR-Cas9 technology followed by the specific selection of cells in which SLC44A2 deletion has been successful is potentially an interesting idea. However, this represents a significant amount of work within the time frame of a revision, for potentially only marginal gain with the potential for further complication (see below), as we have already shown the involvement of SLC44A2 in transfected non-myeloid cell lines (Figure 8C-E). We specifically used HEK293 cells because they do not normally express SLC44A2 on their surface, which provides a clean system to probe the contribution of the SLC44A2 receptor and the two different genotypes to the interaction with α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. We were highly encouraged by the clear nature of the data presented in Figure 8C-E, which, in conjunction with the genotyped volunteer experiments, justifies the conclusions that we draw, in our opinion.</p><p>The use of CRISPR-Cas9 approaches to knock out SLC44A2 requires appreciable work to both identify and select the cell populations that have SLC44A2 deleted prior to rescue. Simple knock down with siRNA would be inadequate due to the potential lifespan of SLC44A2 on the surface of the cells and the lack of knockdown in daughter cells as the cells divide. An additional potential issue with this approach is maintaining the selected HL60 cell line in a phenotype akin to circulating PMNs. The potential for the cells to become stimulated/activated during processing to the point where they may present other adhesion molecules, or activate cell surface integrins, which may further complicate the data obtained from these approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How is SLC44A2 regulated?

Note: GFP expression would not be sufficient unless authors also show that all GFP is associated with SLC44A2 e.g. by Western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>SLC44A2 gene regulation has not been explored. It is clear that SLC44A2 expression is robust in resting neutrophils as is presented in Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. SLC44A2 is reportedly primarily and preferentially present on the plasma membrane, but has also been detected in certain neutrophil granule membranes (Rørvig S, et al. J Leukoc Biol. 2013;94(4):711-21). It is currently not known whether there are any affinity changes or different conformations that selectively interact with different ligands. Whether SLC44A2 expression levels change appreciably in response to different agonists, and the timeframe over which this occurs has not to our knowledge been reported.</p><p>With respect to the surface expression/tagging of SLC44A2 with GFP, the SLC44A2(R154)-GFP and SLC44A2(Q154)-GFP fusion proteins, GFP is tagged to the intracellular C-terminus. We purchased verified SLC44A2 cDNA fused to turbo GFP. Please note that the delay in resubmission of this manuscript was due to our oversight that the GFP fusion was turbo GFP, rather than EGFP – consequently, the anti-EGFP Abs that we purchased did not recognise turbo GFP fusion proteins. We have amended reference to EGFP through the manuscript to replace with tGFP. Only upon recognising this oversight were we able to source an anti-tGFP mAb that we now use. We provide Western blot data to show the comparable detection of tGFP using an anti-tGFP mAb associated with SLC44A2. This also confirms that the tGFP signal is only associated with the SLC44A2 fusion protein in both R154 and Q154 genotypes, and there is no evidence of proteolytic removal of tGFP as revealed by the lack of a band at ~26kDa (MW of turbo GFP). We provide this blot as an inset in Figure 8C and have referenced this blot in the Results section of the manuscript and also into the Material and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) LPS has been shown to induce platelet-neutrophil interactions without P-selectin release or aggregation of platelets (Clark et al., 2007). Does LPS affect SLC44A2 binding to αIIbβ3?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting idea, and something that we too hypothesised (i.e. that LPS might exert a similar priming effect upon platelets that enabled them to interact with leukocytes rather than transforming them into procoagulant platelets). There are conflicting data on the influence of LPS upon platelets, with some data suggesting a priming effect, akin to VWF binding under flow such as reported by Clark and colleagues, 2007, and other purporting more robust activation e.g. Lopes Pires et al., 2017, which we reference along with others. Although we have not formally explored this ourselves, a priming-type effect seems more likely. A major issue with such experiments though, is that physiologically, the interaction between LPS on intact bacteria and TLR4 on platelets is, by itself, insufficient to withstand the forces of flow present within the vasculature. This means that platelets will not encounter LPS in isolation (i.e. without another agonist being present – such as collagen, thrombin, fibrin and/or VWF). This makes extrapolation of such experiments in which platelets are incubated with LPS alone under static conditions redundant in the in vivo setting.</p><p>We have not formally explored or quantitatively assessed the influence of LPS upon the binding of SLC44A2 to α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. We did perform a few preliminary experiments in which platelets were captured on flow channels coated with VWF and thereafter neutrophils and LPS were flowed over these surfaces for 10 mins. Channels were washed in buffer further supplemented with LPS and then visualised under static conditions for 2 hours. In these experiments, we saw no difference in neutrophil capture/binding to the platelet covered surface in the presence or absence of LPS. We also did not detect any difference in NETosis over the time frame of analysis. Based on these preliminary findings, we did not explore this further.</p><p>Of note, we also performed flow experiments over whole bacteria coated on microchannel surfaces. In these experiments, we observed VWF-dependent platelet recruitment to the bacterial surfaces (that was further augmented if we inhibited ADAMTS13), and also platelet-dependent neutrophil recruitment. Under these conditions, we observed very rapid NETosis. We provide an example of these data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><p>These data, although related, are part of a separate study and suggest that the exposure of neutrophils to both “primed” platelets and bacteria leads to a more profound and rapid generation of NETs. At this time, we have not formally determined the contribution of LPS to the process, but we have observed similar effects on both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting that LPS is not necessarily an essential driver of this synergy. This will be submitted in a follow up study.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><italic>E. coli</italic> labelled with BacLight (red) were adsorbed to the surface of microchannels (left panels).</title><p>Thereafter, whole blood supplemented with DiOC<sub>6</sub> to label platelets and leukocytes was perfused at 1000s<sup>-1</sup> for 3 mins and then at 50s<sup>-1</sup> for 3 mins.

Inhibiting ADAMTS13 (which cleaves VWF) with a pAb significantly increased platelet binding was observed, demonstrating the VWF-dependence of the platelet capture.

When the flow was reduced to 50s<sup>-1</sup>, leukocytes bound to bound platelets, but not when VWF had been blocked (not shown).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53353-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim there is no role for releasate from platelets to get NET production, as NETosis can be induced with purified αIIbβ3.

It’s hard to dismiss releasate based on the αIIbβ3 data.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewers that platelet releasates may potentially further contribute to NETosis, our contention is that the platelet releasate is not necessary for NETosis to occur in neutrophils captured via SLC44A2 binding to α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. This is a subtle, but important distinction when considering this process, particularly when thinking about the early events in DVT. Previous studies have alluded to the potential contribution of platelet releasate components to NETosis (Stark et al., Blood 2016, Gollomp et al., JCI Insight 2018). However, the binding of platelets to VWF alone (i.e. during the early stages of DVT) does not by itself cause appreciable degranulation as we show in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 – this is of course different when other agonists become available, but these are invariably not present during the early stages of DVT. Moreover, the effects of flow have the potential to rapidly remove/dilute any released granule contents. This is diminished if a thrombus forms which greatly reduces solute transport out of the thrombus. Therefore, we do not dispute the potential for other agonists, including those derived from platelet granules (such as HMGB1, PF4, RANTES) to promote NETosis, but rather we contend that they are not the sole mechanism by which NETosis can be induced. We would also like to highlight that the timeframe for NETosis by neutrophils bound either to VWF-primed platelets or to purified activated α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> is very similar, and we have now highlighted this in the text. In these experiments, platelets were capture/primed on VWF for 3 mins, prior to perfusion of neutrophils for 10 mins. Thereafter neutrophils were analysed for 2 hours. Under these conditions, if any degranulation were to synergistically augment NETosis, we would have expected either an increased number of neutrophils NETosing, or an increased rate at which NETosis was detected on primed platelets. To clarify this point further, we have modified the text in both the Results and the Discussion sections.</p><p>In summary, it is our opinion that the VWF priming represents part of the tunable response of platelets. In the setting of targeting of bacteria we propose that the priming is sufficient to promote neutrophil recruitment, but by itself is not sufficient to transform platelets into procoagulant platelets leading to thrombus formation in the absence of overt vessel damage.</p></body></sub-article></article>
