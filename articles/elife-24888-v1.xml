These fibrils enhance HIV infection by promoting viral fusion to cellular targets, but their natural function remained unknown. The similarities shared between HIV fusion to host cell and sperm fusion to oocyte led us to examine whether these fibrils promote fertilization. Surprisingly, the fibrils inhibited fertilization by immobilizing sperm. Interestingly, however, this immobilization facilitated uptake and clearance of sperm by macrophages, which are known to infiltrate the female reproductive tract (FRT) following semen exposure. In the presence of semen fibrils, damaged and apoptotic sperm were more rapidly phagocytosed than healthy ones, suggesting that deposition of semen fibrils in the lower FRT facilitates clearance of poor-quality sperm. Our findings suggest that amyloid fibrils in semen may play a role in reproduction by participating in sperm selection and facilitating the rapid removal of sperm antigens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24888.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24888.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24888.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Seminal plasma, the fluid portion of semen, helps to transport sperm cells to the egg during sexual reproduction. Seminal plasma contains numerous proteins that help the sperm to survive and, in recent years, researchers discovered that it also harbours protein deposits known as amyloid fibrils.</p><p>Such protein deposits are generally associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s disease, where a build-up of fibrils can damage the nervous system. Semen amyloids, however, are present in the absence of disease, but can boost infection by HIV and other sexually transmitted viruses, by shuttling virus particles to their target cells. Despite these damaging effects, some researchers had suggested that amyloids in semen could be beneficial for humans, though it was unclear what these benefits might be.</p><p>Roan et al. now set out to assess how semen amyloids affect human sperm activity. The results show that semen amyloids bind to damaged sperm cells and immobilize them, which are then quickly cleared away by immune cells. This could ensure that only the fittest sperm cells reach the egg.</p><p>These findings suggest that amyloids can potentially serve beneficial roles for reproduction. A next step will be to investigate how semen amyloids trap unwanted sperm and how immune cells know when to remove it. More research is needed to investigate if problems in these processes could lead to infertility in men.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

harboring unusually high concentrations of proteases and protease inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laflamme and Wolfner, 2013</xref>), immunomodulatory cytokines such as TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robertson et al., 2002</xref>), and metals such as zinc, all of which serve important functions in promoting reproductive success. Thus far, SP is also the only human biological fluid known to contain endogenous amyloid fibrils in a non-disease state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Usmani et al., 2014</xref>). Two classes of semen amyloids have been identified: those derived from proteolytic fragments of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) which polymerize to form amyloids named semen-derived enhancer of viral infection (SEVI), and those derived from PSA-generated fragments of semenogelins which polymerize to form amyloids named SEM fibrils. Both sets of amyloids markedly enhance HIV infection by electrostatically binding HIV virions and increasing their propensity to bind to and infect cellular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Münch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roan et al., 2014</xref>). Because the ability of semen and SP to enhance HIV infection directly correlates with endogenous levels of these fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roan et al., 2014</xref>), inhibiting the activity of semen amyloids may decrease HIV transmission rates. Indeed, semen fibrils are currently being pursued as targets for HIV microbicide development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartjen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lump et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While the effects of SP amyloids on HIV infection have been extensively studied, the normal physiological function of these fibrils is unclear. SEM proteins have undergone extensive positive selection over evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting an important role for these proteins in evolutionary fitness. Studies analyzing orthologs of the human amyloidogenic SEM peptide from 12 non-human primate species revealed that the amyloidogenic potential of these orthologous peptides and their virus-enhancing properties are conserved amongst great apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roan et al., 2014</xref>). Whether this selective pressure occurs at the level of the fibrils or the parent protein is not known, but the existence of amyloidogenic semen peptides from multiple primate species suggest that these structures may serve a physiological function. Furthermore, the observation that SP amyloids promote infection by multiple sexually transmitted viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torres et al., 2015</xref>) suggests that they should be selected against during primate evolution unless they serve a significant physiological purpose. Here, we examined the effects of semen amyloid fibrils on sperm function, and show that they participate in sperm selection and disposal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Semen fibrils inhibit fusion of spermatozoa to oocytes</title><p>Because parallels exist between the fusion of HIV to cells and the fusion of sperm to oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doncel, 2006</xref>), we first examined whether semen fibrils promote fertilization. Because endogenous semen fibrils behave similarly to synthetic versions of the fibrils and are difficult to isolate as purified materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Usmani et al., 2014</xref>), we used fibrils derived from synthetic peptides for the majority of our studies. Synthetic SEVI and SEM peptides were confirmed to form fibrils by thioflavin T (ThT) staining and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These synthetic fibrils, like their endogenous counterparts, include both fibrils and fibrillar oligomers as well as prefibrillar oligomers, as determined by their reactivity with amyloid conformer-specific antibodies OC and A11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the remainder of this manuscript, we use the term ‘fibrils’ to refer to the synthetic form of the amyloids, and ‘endogenous amyloids’ when fibrils were purified from semen.</p><p>For ethical reasons, we conducted in vitro fertilization (IVF) using mouse instead of human gametes. Given that the infection-promoting effects of the fibrils are driven by electrostatic forces and is not receptor-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2011</xref>), if fertilization is enhanced by the fibrils, then the effect should be species-independent. Contrary to our hypothesis, both SEVI and SEM fibrils decreased IVF rates in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Significant inhibition of IVF was observed at fibril concentrations of 50 µg/ml, and near complete inhibition was achieved with 250 µg/ml. Because concentrations of amyloidogenic peptides in semen range from 28 to 267 µg/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Münch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2014</xref>), these results suggest that physiologically relevant concentrations of semen fibrils suppress IVF. This inhibition was not due to fibril-induced cytotoxicity to the spermatozoa, oocytes, or embryos, as evidenced by propidium iodide (PI) staining experiments (data not shown).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24888.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SEVI and SEM fibrils inhibit IVF in a dose-dependent manner.</title><p>The indicated concentrations of SEVI and SEM fibrils were added to mouse spermatozoa and oocytes, and monitored for IVF rates as detailed in the Materials and methods section. *p&lt;0.05 (two-tailed Student’s t test). n.s. = non-significant.

Under HEPES-buffered conditions, spermatozoa attached by their heads to coverslips exhibited continuous beating motions of the tail (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2A</xref>). Remarkably, within 10 min after perfusion of the SEM fibrils, some spermatozoa became completely immotile, while others exhibited twitching movements (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the presence of the fibrils, 89.8 ± 9.3% of spermatozoa (average data from three donors) were fully or partly immobilized as defined by at least 50% of the tail being surface-immobilized. Of note, this immobilization is distinct from the previously described ability of the SEM1 holoprotein to limit sperm motility by binding to the sperm-associated EPPIN complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitra et al., 2010</xref>), since that activity, mapped to cysteine 239 of SEM1, is not part of the amyloidogenic SEM1 fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roan et al., 2014</xref>).

Spermatozoa were fluorescently labeled with eFluor 670 and then co-cultured with macrophages. Cell surface expression of CD14 and CD33 was used to differentiate the macrophages from the sperm cells. Macrophages that had taken up spermatozoa were identified by eFluor 670 fluorescence. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, a distinct population of macrophages that had phagocytosed spermatozoa was readily apparent after 0.5 hr of co-culture. This population was abrogated when the assay was conducted in the presence of the phagocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin D or when the assay was conducted at 4°C instead of 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, detection of sperm-harboring macrophages was not due to leakage of dye from spermatozoa, or from cell-surface binding of the spermatozoa to the macrophages. Furthermore, &gt;99% of the macrophages at the time of harvest were viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), excluding non-specific effects due to autofluorescence of dying cells. To assess whether semen fibrils promote phagocytosis of spermatozoa, we conducted the FACS-based phagocytosis assay in the absence and presence of semen fibrils. Consistent with the Western blot data, addition of fibrils increased phagocytosis of spermatozoa, from 4.61% to 22.6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Because removal of damaged or defective sperm cells from the reproductive tract may be important to rapidly clear the lower FRT of potentially immunogenic male antigens, we also assessed phagocytosis of damaged spermatozoa. Sperm cells damaged by multiple freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen or electromagnetic radiation were taken up at higher rates than healthy sperm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Because liquid nitrogen exerted a more potent effect (up to 3.4-fold increased uptake, as opposed to up to 2.3-fold increased uptake for radiation-damaged spermatozoa), we selected this method of damage induction for subsequent experiments. In the absence of the fibrils, the rate of phagocytosis of liquid nitrogen-damaged spermatozoa was higher than that of fresh spermatozoa (31.3% versus 4.61%, respectively); this was also observed in the presence of the fibrils but at higher percentages (49.9% versus 22.6%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, the absolute numbers of spermatozoa added to each co-culture condition were the same to allow direct comparisons between conditions. Interestingly, with longer incubation times high levels of phagocytosis of both healthy and damaged sperm cells were achieved in the presence of fibrils, suggesting that the fibrils promote the kinetics of sperm phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Confocal microscopy revealed that fibrils also increased the number of spermatozoa engulfed by individual macrophages, frequently resulting in a single macrophage endocytosing more than a dozen sperm heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Videos 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">9</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media8" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-24888-media8.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24888.025</object-id><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>High number of spermatozoa internalized by a single macrophage in the presence of semen fibrils (rotational view).</title><p>Monocyte-derived macrophages labeled with a membrane dye (green) were incubated with sperm cells (red) for 3 hr in the presence of 100 µg/ml SEM fibrils and then imaged by confocal microscopy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24888.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24888.025</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media9" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-24888-media9.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24888.026</object-id><label>Video 9.</label><caption><title>High number of spermatozoa internalized by a single macrophage in the presence of semen fibrils (z-stacks view).</title><p>Monocyte-derived macrophages labeled with a membrane dye (green) were incubated with sperm cells (red) for 3 hr in the presence of 100 µg/ml SEM fibrils and then imaged by confocal microscopy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24888.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24888.026</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>We consistently observed in multiple donors that in the presence of the fibrils damaged spermatozoa are preferentially phagocytosed over healthy ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To confirm this phenomenon, healthy and damaged spermatozoa were co-cultured with macrophages in the absence or presence of SEM fibrils, both at 37°C as well as 4°C to block phagocytic activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the highest level of phagocytosis was observed with damaged spermatozoa in the presence of the fibrils, in line with our prior experiments. However, macrophage/sperm samples incubated at 4°C with SEM fibrils also exhibited positive events within the phagocytosis gate, suggesting that SEM caused some level of sperm sticking to the macrophage surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To normalize for the contribution of cell-surface sticking, we subtracted out the contribution of the positive events at 4°C for each sample. Levels of phagocytosis of damaged spermatozoa in the presence of fibrils remained significantly higher than that of healthy spermatozoa under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). All together, these results suggest that: (1) macrophages preferentially phagocytose damaged spermatozoa both in the absence and presence of semen fibrils, consistent with prior reports that increased levels of macrophages are associated with decreased levels of abnormal spermatozoa in semen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tomlinson et al., 1992</xref>), and (2) within the first hour, the highest levels of damaged sperm phagocytosis are observed in the presence of semen fibrils.</p><p>To directly assess the preference for phagocytosis of damaged spermatozoa, we established a competition assay enabling visualization of normal and damaged spermatozoa within the same well by labeling the two populations with different fluorescent dyes. Notably, macrophages that had taken up only damaged spermatozoa or healthy spermatozoa as well as combinations of both could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). We found that although damaged spermatozoa were preferentially phagocytosed both in the absence and presence of the fibrils, the highest rate of damaged sperm phagocytosis occurred in the presence of fibrils, when 36.8% of macrophages contained damaged spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Of these, 26.3% had only damaged spermatozoa, while 10.5% had both healthy and damaged spermatozoa. These results confirm that damaged sperm cells are efficiently phagocytosed in the presence of semen fibrils.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Semen fibrils efficiently enhance phagocytosis of apoptotic spermatozoa</title><p>Spermatozoa are highly prone to undergo apoptosis, and this process is accelerated by reactive oxygen species produced by surrounding leukocytes as well as the sperm cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitken et al., 2012</xref>). One of the hallmarks of apoptotic sperm cells is externalization of phosphatidylserine, a negatively charged phospholipid membrane component. Because all known semen fibrils are highly cationic and bind to anionic membrane components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2011</xref>), we reasoned they may also entrap and promote phagocytosis of apoptotic sperm cells.

Because swim-up sperm cells are no longer in the antioxidant environment of seminal plasma, they are prone to undergo their default cascade of apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitken et al., 2012</xref>). Annexin V staining confirmed that compared to fresh sperm cells, a higher proportion of the 24 hour-treated sperm cells were apoptotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

Because the highest rates of damaged sperm phagocytosis occurred in the presence of semen fibrils, the fibrils may participate in quality control by promoting the efficiency of sperm selection by macrophages. Moreover, by also promoting phagocytosis of non-damaged sperm, the fibrils appear to additionally participate in rapidly clearing the lower reproductive tract of remaining sperm cells (whether damaged or not), which may help avoid the development of an inappropriate cell-mediated immune response against sperm antigens. The rapid removal of sperm cells is consistent with the observation that the lower reproductive tract largely returns to its pre-mating state by 24 hr post-coitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pandya and Cohen, 1985</xref>), and may help explain why only a minute fraction of deposited spermatozoa actually reach the oviduct isthmus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eisenbach and Giojalas, 2006</xref>). This in turn may be important for fertilization and blastocyst development since high concentrations of spermatozoa can result in increased polyploidy rates and be detrimental for human embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahadevan and Trounson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diamond et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Englert et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dumoulin et al., 1992</xref>). Future studies should assess the molecular basis by which semen fibrils entrap sperm and promote their elimination, including the nature of the interaction between the fibrils and the sperm membrane. In addition, because semen amyloids are structurally diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Usmani et al., 2014</xref>) and include both fibrillar and pre-fibrillar oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), further studies to determine whether specific conformers are responsible for sperm binding and entrapment are warranted.</p><p>Of note, semen fibrils may not be the only structures in semen that can participate in sperm disposal; neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) – chromatin- and protein-containing extracellular fibers extruded by neutrophils to trap and kill bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>) – have been shown to entrap spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alghamdi and Foster, 2005</xref>), which could conceivably promote their subsequent phagocytic uptake. Importantly, however, NETs are different from the semen fibrils because they inhibit rather than enhance HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saitoh et al., 2012</xref>). As such, while semen fibrils have been proposed as targets for HIV microbicide development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartjen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roan and Münch, 2015</xref>), this would not apply to NETs. Should semen fibril antagonists advance to clinical stages, one should be cautious as to potential effects on sperm cells and fertilization, given the data presented herein.</p><p>Amyloid fibrils have long been considered a result of aberrant protein folding that is almost exclusively associated with systemic or localized amyloidosis, or various chronic degenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiti and Dobson, 2006</xref>).

Two prominent examples of functional amyloid in humans are HD6 (human α-defensin 6) forming amyloid nets to protect host cells from invasion by enteric bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2012</xref>), and Pmel17 fibrils facilitating the formation of melanosomes with covalently linked melanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fowler et al., 2006</xref>). Prior studies have also suggested that amyloids generated by the male reproductive tract may play beneficial roles in bacterial clearance and sperm maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Easterhoff et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Roan et al. explore the potential function of semen amyloids in clearance of mammalian sperm from the female reproductive tracts. There is a strong biological rationale that a clearance system of some sort must exist. We have known for several decades that this system includes a female leukocyte response, but the mechanisms that account for clearance are poorly understood. The identification of a role of amyloid fibrils from seminal peptides in sperm trapping and clearance is a novel advance. These data also add to an emerging literature on a functional (that is, non-pathological) role of amyloid fibrils (eg, PMID: 19622831) and so may be of wider interest.</p><p>In general, the experiments are well done and carefully analyzed. These, and the proposed mechanism of seminal amyloid, are sufficiently novel and interesting to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript proposes the interesting idea that amyloid fibrils in semen participate in sperm selection and clearance. The studies follow previous work by these investigators in which amyloid fibrils in semen were suggested to promote HIV infection. Functional amyloids have been identified in a broad range of cells and tissues including the male reproductive tract and several studies indicate a role for amyloids in innate immunity and thus a role in sperm quality control is certainly a possibility. However, the data do not provide clear evidence that amyloid fibrils in semen have these functions.</p><p>The primary concern I have with these studies is that all experiments were performed with amyloid fibrils that were generated in vitro from chemically synthesized peptides and thus may not be representative of what is present in vivo. Because of this, the use of &quot;semen fibrils&quot; throughout the manuscript is misleading since unless the methods are carefully read, the reader gets the incorrect impression that biological samples were used when in fact they were not. It is unlikely that such &quot;pure&quot; amyloids (never exposed to other proteins, lipids etc) exist in semen and indeed the thought that semen amyloids likely represent fibrils formed from multiple peptides was previously suggested by the authors. The studies would have been strengthened considerably by examining amyloids isolated from semen as described by the authors in previous studies (Nature Communications 2014). The addition of conformation-dependent antibodies (A11/OC) during IVF or sperm incubation experiments to determine if outcomes were blocked(sperm immobilization or phagocytosis) would lend further support that amyloids mediate these processes and might also shed light on the form of amyloid that is involved. A second concern is the authors' assumption they are looking solely at the effects of amyloid fibrils rather than also the oligomeric forms (or only the oligomeric forms) of the SEV1/SEM peptide amyloids. In their methods they state that amyloid formation was confirmed by EM and ThT analyses. However, these data are not shown; moreover these approaches do not allow for a quantitative assessment if, in addition to fibrils, other forms of amyloid such as oligomers are present. This could be done by dot blot using conformation-dependent antibodies A11/OC which recognize oligomeric and fibrillar forms, respectively. Similarly, the authors conclusion that because Abeta amyloid did not immobilize sperm suggested that the semen fibrils were distinct in their ability for this function could also be due to there being less oligomeric amyloid forms in the Abeta preparation compared to the semen fibrils.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Semen amyloids participate in human spermatozoa selection and clearance&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

With regards to semen fibrils, however, we’d like to clarify that endogenous SEVI and SEM fibrils are present in semen, and that synthetic and endogenous semen fibrils are similar in structure, charge, and HIV-enhancing activity (Usmani et al., 2014; Roan et al., 2014). These observations suggest that endogenous amyloids are unlikely to be markedly complexed with other proteins and lipids, or at least do not need to be so to exert physical properties similar to that of the synthetic versions of these fibrils.</p><p><italic>The studies would have been strengthened considerably by examining amyloids isolated from semen as described by the authors in previous studies (Nature Communications 2014). The addition of conformation-dependent antibodies (A11/OC) during IVF or sperm incubation experiments to determine if outcomes were blocked(sperm immobilization or phagocytosis) would lend further support that amyloids mediate these processes and might also shed light on the form of amyloid that is involved.</italic> </p><p>Notably, in our previous characterization of endogenous semen amyloids (Usmani et al., 2014), we did not isolate endogenous amyloids from semen, but characterized endogenous amyloids in unfractionated liquefied semen using microscopic approaches. Since the purification of endogenous amyloids from semen is very technically challenging and requires large volumes of semen, in this study we had performed experiments with synthetic fibrils to have sufficient amounts of material for a comprehensive and detailed examination. However, we agree with the reviewer’s comment that the novel function of semen fibrils described in our manuscript should be confirmed with endogenous material. Therefore, we collected 26 ml of semen pooled from 20 donors, and by fractionation purified endogenous amyloids as confirmed by staining with various amyloid-binding dyes (thioflavin T, Proteostat, pFTAA, please see the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). Despite the limiting quantities of these endogenous amyloids and use of much of the material for the microscopic studies to prove successful isolation of amyloids, we were able to perform a small set of experiments examining the interplay of these amyloids with sperm.</p><p>First, using microscopy, we show that purified endogenous amyloids bind to sperm (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This result confirms and extends our finding that endogenous amyloids also interacted with sperm in unfractionated semen (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Second, using the sperm entrapment assay, we show that purified endogenous amyloids, like their synthetic counterparts, trap and immobilize sperm (new panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, endogenous and synthetic amyloids display similar activity in these various assays. We have made clear throughout the manuscript which experiments were performed with synthetic fibrils and which involved endogenous amyloids.</p><p>We believe these new data with endogenous semen fibrils strengthens our paper. Also, when these results are taken together with previously published data that endogenous semen fibrils share the same biophysical properties as synthetic semen fibrils (Usmani et al., 2014; Roan et al., 2014), we believe they sharply counter the argument that the observed effects are an artifact of in vitro fibril production. Unfortunately, we could not test the effects of A11/OC in this system due to a lack of sufficient endogenous material. Whether both fibrils and oligomers exert the reported biological effects remains an interesting question that we propose to evaluate in the future.</p><p><italic>A second concern is the authors' assumption they are looking solely at the effects of amyloid fibrils rather than also the oligomeric forms (or only the oligomeric forms) of the SEV1/SEM peptide amyloids. In their methods they state that amyloid formation was confirmed by EM and ThT analyses. However, these data are not shown;</italic> </p><p><italic>Moreover these approaches do not allow for a quantitative assessment if, in addition to fibrils, other forms of amyloid such as oligomers are present. This could be done by dot blot using conformation-dependent antibodies A11/OC which recognize oligomeric and fibrillar forms, respectively.</italic> </p><p>We have conducted the requested experiment (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which demonstrated that A11 and OC bind to structures in seminal plasma, synthetic SEVI fibrils, and synthetic SEM fibrils, but not the corresponding monomeric peptides nor serum plasma (used as a negative control). These data suggest that seminal plasma and synthetic fibrils harbor fibrils and fibrillar oligomers (recognized by OC) as well as prefibrillar oligomers (recognized by A11).</p><p><italic>Similarly, the authors conclusion that because Abeta amyloid did not immobilize sperm suggested that the semen fibrils were distinct in their ability for this function could also be due to there being less oligomeric amyloid forms in the Abeta preparation compared to the semen fibrils.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, it is possible that Abeta did not efficiently immobilize due to different amounts of oligomers in these preparations. We have now added a statement in the Results section acknowledging this possibility.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] Except for one minor clarification that is needed, the manuscript is acceptable for publication:</italic> </p><p><italic>For this reader it is still not clear what the distinction is between the SEV1 and SEM peptide fibrils as they are not defined in the Introduction.

The editor/reviewer asked whether SEVI fibrils are derived from PAP and SEM fibrils from the semenogelins. This is indeed the case and to clarify this point, we have added statements in the sentence in the Introduction that describes these amyloids.</p></body></sub-article></article>
