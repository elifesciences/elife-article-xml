suppressor protein with multiple isoforms with shared or specific functions. However, two of its isoforms, Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α, with large N-terminal deletions, can cause cancer. These isoforms exert a dominant-negative effect on full-length p53 (FLp53), although the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of action of Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α isoforms using chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase expression, subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence assays, and apoptotic caspase activity assay. Our study elucidates that these DNA-binding deficient p53 isoforms form hetero-tetrameric complexes with FLp53 and disrupt FLp53’s DNA binding and transcriptional activities when present in a higher proportion than FLp53 in the tetramer. However, these structurally unstable isoforms promote vigorous protein aggregation involving FLp53, disrupting its structure and sequestering it in the cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates, thereby limiting its availability to function as a transcription activator protein. Thus, co-aggregation of Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α with FLp53, rather than hetero-tetramerization, is likely the primary factor contributing to their dominant-negative effect. Modulating the stability and aggregation of p53 isoforms could be a novel strategy for cancer therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is a deadly disease that continues to pose a major challenge to global healthcare systems. It arises when some cells acquire mutations that allow them to grow and divide uncontrollably. A key player for preventing this uncontrolled cell growth is the protein p53, which binds to DNA and regulates the activities of genes that determine whether a cell should grow, divide, or die.</p><p>Mutations in the DNA-binding domain of p53 can hinder its ability to regulate gene activity, thereby contributing to cancer. Additionally, shorter versions of p53 – known as p53 isoforms – can accumulate in the cell and coexist with the normal full-length protein. These isoforms sometimes lack critical components of the protein, whilst retaining other properties. For example, two p53 isoforms – called ∆133p53α and ∆160p53α – are missing parts of the DNA-binding domain but can still bind to full-length p53 protein. Here, Zhao, Punga and Sanyal used biochemical and cell biology approaches to investigate how the ∆133p53α and ∆160p53α isoforms affect the activity of full-length p53.</p><p>The team found that both isoforms can bind to full-length p53 protein and form tetramers, large molecules made up of four p53 sub-units. In addition, they found that the ∆133p53α and ∆160p53α isoforms can form aggregates with full-length p53. As a result, full-length p53 protein gets sequestered within these aggregates, which prevents them from binding to DNA and carrying out their role in gene expression and cell-death regulation.</p><p>These findings open up new avenues for cancer research, particularly in cancer patients who have truncated isoforms of the p53 protein. Developing new therapies that prevent shorter and normal full-length p53 protein from forming irregular aggregates may have the potential to prevent, or slow, cancer progression in these patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>p53 isoform</kwd><kwd>dominant-negative effect</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023-05237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanyal</surname><given-names>Suparna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-05946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanyal</surname><given-names>Suparna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-05498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanyal</surname><given-names>Suparna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014437</institution-id><institution>Wenner-Gren Stiftelserna</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UPD2023-0185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanyal</surname><given-names>Suparna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAW 2017.0055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanyal</surname><given-names>Suparna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The N-terminally truncated Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α isoforms exert dominant-negative effects through co-aggregation with p53, disrupting its transcriptional activity and cellular distribution, thereby contributing to cancer development.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tumor suppressor protein p53 is an essential transcription activator protein modulating the expression of multiple target genes. By regulating various cellular processes such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, and angiogenesis, p53 prevents cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levine and Oren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>). The intricate p53 pathway is stimulated by various stress stimuli, including DNA damage and oncogene activation, which lead to the stabilization and activation of the p53 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pflaum et al., 2014</xref>). Stabilized p53 acts as a transcription activator protein as it can directly bind to its response elements (REs) and recruit different transcription co-activator proteins at various gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>). One of the best-known p53 targets is the p21 (also known as CIP1, WAF1) gene promoter, which contains two p53REs and is efficiently activated by the p53 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">el-Deiry et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Macleod et al., 1995</xref>). The encoded p21 protein blocks cell cycle progression and thereby executes tumor suppressor activity of the p53 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Indeglia and Murphy, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shamloo and Usluer, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The TP53 gene produces at least 12 distinct p53 isoforms: p53 (α, β, γ), Δ40p53 (α, β, γ), Δ133p53 (α, β, γ), and Δ160p53 (α, β, γ). It has been shown that the p53 isoforms contribute to the regulation of the p53 pathway by regulating the expression of p53 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Joruiz and Bourdon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khoury and Bourdon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao and Sanyal, 2022</xref>). Notably, p53 isoforms exhibit both overlapping and distinct functions compared to canonical p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mehta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pal et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao and Sanyal, 2022</xref>) and have been reported to promote tumor progression in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vieler and Sanyal, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao and Sanyal, 2022</xref>). The p53 isoforms are generated through alternative promoter usage, alternative splicing, and alternative transcription starting site usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Joruiz and Bourdon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sharathchandra et al., 2014</xref>). These isoforms differ from the full-length (FL) p53 (canonical p53, p53α) by lacking variable segments of the N-terminus (N-terminal isoforms: Δ40, Δ133, and Δ160) and possessing alternative C-terminus (C-terminal isoforms: α, β, and γ). The FLp53 protein consists of four primary functional domains: transactivation domains (TAD-1 and TAD-2), DNA-binding core domain (DBD), nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and the oligomerization domain (OD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khoury and Bourdon, 2010</xref>). Native FLp53 typically functions as a tetrameric protein, where the individual monomers bind cooperatively to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jeffrey et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weinberg et al., 2004</xref>). The C-terminal truncated isoforms (β/γ isoforms) lacking the OD have lower transactivation activity because of reduced tetramerization efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jänicke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast, the N-terminal truncated isoforms (α isoforms), which retain the entire C-terminal OD, can form various complexes with FLp53 and exert dominant-negative effects on p53’s transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourdon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horikawa et al., 2017</xref>). This study focuses on two large N-terminal deleted p53 isoforms: Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α, the latter has been largely unexplored. For convenience and simplicity, we have written Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 to represent the α isoforms (Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α) throughout this manuscript. The Δ133p53 protein lacks both TADs and a part of the first conserved cysteine box of the DBD, whereas the Δ160p53 protein lacks both TADs and the entire first conserved cysteine box of the DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Joruiz and Bourdon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pavletich et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>The Δ133p53 isoform exhibits complex biological functions, with both oncogenic and non-oncogenic potentials. Recent studies demonstrate the non-oncogenic yet context-dependent role of the Δ133p53 isoform in cancer development. Δ133p53 expression has been reported to correlate with improved survival in patients with TP53 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischof et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hofstetter et al., 2011</xref>), where it promotes cell survival in a non-oncogenic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gong et al., 2016b</xref>), especially under low oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gong et al., 2016c</xref>). Alternatively, other recent evidence emphasizes the notable oncogenic functions of Δ133p53 as it can inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis by directly interacting with the FLp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoubala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourdon et al., 2005</xref>). The oncogenic function of the newly identified Δ160p53 isoform is less known, although it is associated with p53 mutation-driven tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Candeias et al., 2016</xref>) and in melanoma cells’ aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tadijan et al., 2021</xref>). Whether or not the Δ160p53 isoform also impedes FLp53 function in a similar way as Δ133p53 is an open question. However, these p53 isoforms can certainly compromise p53-mediated tumor suppression by interfering with FLp53 binding to target genes such as p21 and miR-34a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horikawa et al., 2017</xref>) by dominant-negative effect, and the exact mechanism is not known.</p><p>Protein aggregation has become a central focus of modern biology research and has documented implications in various diseases, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farmer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forget et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petronilho et al., 2024</xref>). Protein aggregates can be of different types, ranging from amorphous aggregates to highly structured amyloid or fibrillar aggregates, each with different physiological implications. In the case of p53, whether protein aggregation, and, in particular, co-aggregation with large N-terminal deletion isoforms, plays a mechanistic role in its inactivation is yet underexplored. Interestingly, the Δ133p53β isoform has been shown to aggregate in several human cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arsic et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, the Δ40p53α isoform exhibits a high aggregation tendency in endometrial cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Melo Dos Santos et al., 2019</xref>). Although no direct evidence exists for Δ160p53 yet, these findings imply that p53 isoform aggregation may play a major role in their mechanisms of actions.</p><p>The precise molecular mechanisms involved in the biological function of the Δ133p53 and the Δ160p53 proteins, especially how they exert dominant-negative effects on FLp53, remain poorly understood. In this study, we have analyzed the DNA-binding, transcriptional activity, and oligomerization capacity of the human FLp53, Δ133p53, and Δ160p53 proteins. Our data show that the Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 proteins are deficient in binding to p53-regulated promoters and inducing expression of the p53 target genes. Moreover, the Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms can form hetero-oligomers with FLp53 and inhibit FLp53 function in a concentration-dependent manner. Two potential mechanisms for their dominant-negative effects have been suggested: (i) the formation of hetero-tetramers with FLp53, inhibiting its DNA-binding and transcriptional activity, and (ii) the aggregation property of the isoforms leading to co-aggregation of the FLp53 protein. Interestingly, while hetero-tetramerization partially attenuates p53 activity, the co-aggregation of FLp53 with Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 emerges as the predominant factor contributing to the dominant-negative effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 proteins exhibit structural destabilization, exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, and high propensity to aggregation</title><p>The DBD, also known as the core domain of the FLp53 protein (human p53, residues 94–292), has a structure with an aggregation-prone sequence (residues 251–257) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The core domain contains a hydrophobic core of β-sandwich, which consists of two antiparallel β-sheets with four strands (S1, S3, S8, and S5) and five strands (S6, S7, S4, S9, and S10), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The DNA-binding surface is constituted by two large loops (L2 and L3) and a loop-sheet-helix (LSH) motif, which comprises loop L1, a β-sheet formed by the β-hairpin S2–S2′, the C-terminal residues of strand S10, and the α-helix H2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Joerger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Compared to FLp53, the N-terminal deletion isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 lack the entire TADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which are crucial for recruiting transcription co-activator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raj and Attardi, 2017</xref>). In addition, the Δ133p53 protein is missing the β-strand S1 in the β-sandwich and a part of the LSH motif (L1, S2, and the N-terminal residue 132 of the strand S2′) in the DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The Δ160p53 protein, on the other hand, lacks a part of the β-sandwich (β-strands S1, S3, and N-terminal residues 156–159 of S4) and a part of the LSH motif (L1 and β-hairpin S2–S2′) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

However, a strong reduction in BAX promoter activation was evident under the same experimental condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that the isoforms can disrupt FLp53 function on the BAX promoter.

To mimic conditions where isoforms are upregulated relative to FLp53, we increased the ratios to 1:5 and 1:10.

Interestingly, Δ133p53 at a 1:5 ratio had almost no impact on PUMA promoter activity, whereas Δ160p53 reduced it compared to FLp53 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results indicate that higher expression ratios of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 relative to FLp53 might be required to exert dominant-negative effects.

As expected, the activity of all four promoters decreased significantly at this ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>).

However, at the 1:10 ratio, Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 had similar effects on all transactivation except for the MDM2 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>). This differential impact underscores the variability in how p53 isoforms influence FLp53 function across different promoters and expression ratios.

Caspase activation is a key biochemical event in apoptosis, with the activation of effector caspases (caspase-3 and -7) ultimately leading to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghorbani et al., 2024</xref>). The caspase-3 and -7 activities induced by FLp53 expression were approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the control vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

The mechanisms of the oncogenic potential of p53 isoforms have attracted attention from researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arsic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gong and Chen, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Melo Dos Santos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mondal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vieler and Sanyal, 2018</xref>). A theory of the dominant-negative effect has been introduced, but its exact details have remained unknown.</p><p>The ChIP and luciferase activity assays show that the isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 are defective in their ability to bind DNA and activate transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A–D</xref>). A possible reason for the diminished DNA-binding function of these isoforms is that their core domains are defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms lack approximately 20% and 33% of the DBD, which hinders their ability to bind to p53REs. We find that co-expression of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 with FLp53 exerts an inhibitory effect on FLp53’s DNA-binding ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the degree to which Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 impair FLp53 function is influenced by both the expression levels of these isoforms and the specific promoters of the target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For the p21 and MDM2 promoters, equal expression of FLp53 and the two isoforms didn’t show much effect. However, higher expression levels of the isoforms gradually inhibited FLp53’s activity to induce transcription from those promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Notably, the PUMA promoter behaved differently, whereby 1:1 co-expression of FLp53 with Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 significantly increased its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We speculate that this isoform expression level may activate p21 induction pathways independent of FLp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karimian et al., 2016</xref>), potentially facilitating the interaction between FLp53 and p21, which is required for optimal activation of PUMA promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). These results underscore a complex regulatory network where FLp53 and the isoform expression levels, target gene specificity, and transcriptional activities modulate p53-mediated cellular responses.</p><p>Our co-expression data clearly indicate that the isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 exert a dominant-negative effect on FLp53 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Since both of these p53 isoforms are defective in DNA binding and they possess an intact C-terminal OD, it is not unexpected that they form different species of homo- and hetero-tetramers with FLp53. In accordance with that, the immunoprecipitation assays using FLAG-tagged FLp53 and V5-tagged/untagged Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 demonstrate a potential direct interaction between these isoforms and FLp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 7 and 8 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). However, in what ratio the p53 isoforms impose inhibition to FLp53 function is worth investigating. We employed a theoretical model of p53 hetero-tetramer activity in transcriptional activation from p21, MDM2, BAX, and PUMA promoters by varying relative expression levels of the isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We assumed that the transfection level was a good proxy for the expression level. Interestingly, the experimental inhibition curves with Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 derived from the luciferase reporter assay were all above the theoretical inhibition curves for two isoform molecules per tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), suggesting that at least three isoform molecules per tetramer are required to abolish the transcriptional activity of FLp53. This is similar to an earlier report with Δ40p53 isoform, which was shown to exert a dominant-negative effect at a 3:1 ratio with FLp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hafsi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, similar to Δ40p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Melo Dos Santos et al., 2019</xref>), the Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 proteins can aggregate in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref>). Due to cytoplasmic aggregation and a stronger tendency for cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), only a limited amount of these isoforms can successfully be imported into the nucleus. Additionally, the isoforms tend to aggregate within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and E</xref>). Consequently, the ratio of these isoforms to FLp53 diminishes in the nucleus in contrast to their expression levels. This decrease reduces the likelihood of forming hetero-tetramers, in which the isoforms will be in higher proportion than FLp53. Thus, it seems unlikely that hetero-tetramerization of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms with FLp53 would be the main reason for their dominant-negative effect.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether aggregation of the Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms contributes to their functional loss and dominant-negative effect on FLp53. Our immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analyses of H1299 cells expressing these isoforms show a higher aggregation propensity of the two isoforms than FLp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The aggregation likely results from the exposure of hydrophobic sequences in the isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, the absence of N-terminal TADs in Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms may prevent their MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kussie et al., 1996</xref>). This may, in turn, lead to higher accumulation of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms in the cell, which, combined with an unstable core domain, promotes their aggregation. Moreover, the observed cytoplasmic isoform aggregates may reflect autophagy-related degradation, as suggested by the co-localization of Δ133p53 with autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1 and autophagosome component LC3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horikawa et al., 2014</xref>). Overexpression of these aggregation-prone proteins could induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and activate autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed nuclear aggregation of these isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that distinct mechanisms, such as intrinsic properties of the isoforms, may govern their localization and behavior within the nucleus. This dual localization underscores the complexity of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 behavior in cellular systems.</p><p>More interestingly, our immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate large co-aggregation of FLp53 with Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus when expressed together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). The predominant cytoplasmic aggregation would sequester FLp53 in the cytoplasm. Moreover, it may destabilize FLp53’s conformation, potentially masking the NLS and preventing its nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marine, 2010</xref>). Additionally, it may disrupt the interaction of FLp53 with MDM2, thereby inhibiting its MDM2-induced degradation and enhancing its accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moll and Petrenko, 2003</xref>), which would drive it more to the aggregation pathway. All these processes involving FLp53 aggregation would result in a reduction of the functional FLp53 in the cell and, more importantly, in the nucleus. Cytoplasmic aggregation would also limit the isoforms from nuclear import, reducing the possibility of hetero-tetramerization. Therefore, we propose that the co-aggregation of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 with FLp53 is the primary factor for their dominant-negative effect. This mechanism is consistent with the model where structural mutations, such as R175H and R282W in FLp53, induce co-aggregation and exert a dominant-negative effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we primarily utilized an overexpression strategy involving FLAG/V5-tagged proteins to investigate the effects of p53 isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 on the function of FLp53. To address concerns regarding potential overexpression artifacts, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and caspase-3 and -7 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) experiments with untagged Δ133p53 and Δ160p53. In both experimental systems, the untagged proteins behaved very similarly to the FLAG/V5 antibody epitope-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, the C-terminal tagging of FLp53 or its isoforms does not alter the biochemical and physiological functions of these proteins.</p><p>We propose a model to explain how the p53 isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 inhibit FLp53 activity and exert a dominant-negative effect on it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Two mechanisms are involved: a subsidiary mechanism in which Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms form hetero-tetramers with FLp53, impairing its DNA-binding and transcriptional activities, and a predominant mechanism in which these isoforms promote co-aggregation with FLp53 and abolish its transcriptional activities by disrupting its structure, regulation, and degradation pathways. Since elevated levels of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 relative to FLp53 attenuate its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, left), and overexpression of FLp53 relative to the isoforms allows regaining it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, right), the tumor-suppressive efficacy of p53 must depend on the balanced expression of FLp53 and its isoforms, highlighting the importance of their relative abundance in cancer cells. Based on our results and recent related publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arsic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Melo Dos Santos et al., 2019</xref>), we propose that co-aggregation, rather than hetero-tetramerization, is the primary mechanism for the dominant-negative effect exerted by the p53 isoforms with large N-terminal truncations.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the underlying mechanisms by which Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 exert a dominant-negative effect on full-length p53 (FLp53).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) When expressed alone, FLp53 demonstrates strong transcriptional activity, but when expressed together with the Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 isoforms, FLp53 activity gets impaired due to the dominant-negative effect exerted by the isoforms. The Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 isoforms either attenuate FLp53’s transcription activity by hetero-tetramerization at a ratio higher than 1:1 or abolish it completely by aggregation. Since Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 exhibit much higher propensity for aggregation than FLp53, they sequester FLp53 in the cytoplasmic aggregates, leading to a reduction in the amount of functional FLp53 in the nucleus. Aggregation also limits the availability of these isoforms in the nucleus. Thus, co-aggregation is the primary reason for the dominant-negative effect of the Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 isoforms on FLp53. It is important to note that the numbers of tetramers and aggregates depicted do not represent the actual quantities present in the cytoplasm and nucleus. (<bold>B</bold>) The balance between the expression level of the FLp53 and its isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 regulates FLp53 activity. Increased levels of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 relative to FLp53 lead to a stronger dominant-negative effect due to co-aggregation and hetero-tetramerization, resulting in the inhibition of apoptosis. Increased levels of FLp53 compared to the isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 in cancer cells restore the function of FLp53, leading to the induction of apoptosis.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106469-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, plasmids, and plasmid transfections</title><p>Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells, NCI-H1299 cells, were from ATCC (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_0060">CVCL_0060</ext-link>) and were also authenticated using STR profiling (Eurofins Genomics).

Authors proposed this happens by sequestration of full length P53 by truncated P53.</p><p>In the study, performed experiments are well described.</p><p>My area of expertise is molecular biology/gene expression, and I have tried to provide suggestions on my area of expertise. The study has been done mainly with overexpression system and I have included few comments which I can think can be helpful to understand effect of truncated P53 on endogenous wild type full length protein. Performing experiments on these lines will add value to the observation according to this reviewer.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) What happens to endogenous wild type full length P53 in the context of mutant/truncated isoforms, that is not clear. Using a P53 antibody which can detect endogenous wild type P53, can authors check if endogenous full length P53 protein is also aggregated as well? It is hard to differentiate if aggregation of full length P53 happens only in overexpression scenario, where lot more both of such proteins are expressed. In normal physiological condition P53 expression is usually low, tightly controlled and its expression get induced in altered cellular condition such as during DNA damage. So, it is important to understand the physiological relevance of such aggregation, which could be possible if authors could investigate effect on endogenous full length P53 following overexpression of mutant isoforms.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your insightful comments.</p><p>(1) To address “what happens to endogenous wild-type full-length P53 in the context of mutant/truncated isoforms,&quot; we employed a human A549 cell line expressing endogenous wild-type p53 under DNA damage conditions such as an etoposide treatment(1). We choose the A549 cell line since similar to H1299, it is a lung cancer cell line (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.atcc.org/">https://www.atcc.org/</ext-link>). For comparison, we also transfected the cells with 2 μg of V5-tagged plasmids encoding FLp53 and its isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53. As shown in Author response image 1A, lanes 1 and 2, endogenous p53 expression, remained undetectable in A549 cells despite etoposide treatment, which limits our ability to assess the effects of the isoforms on the endogenous wild-type FLp53. We could, however, detect the V5-tagged FLp53 expressed from the plasmid using anti-V5 (rabbit) as well as with antiDO-1 (mouse) antibody (Author response image 1). The latter detects both endogenous wildtype p53 and the V5-tagged FLp53 since the antibody epitope is within the Nterminus (aa 20-25). This result supports the reviewer’s comment regarding the low level of expression of endogenous p53 that is insufficient for detection in our experiments.</p><p>In summary, in line with the reviewer’s comment that ‘under normal physiological conditions p53 expression is usually low,’ we could not detect p53 with an anti-DO-1 antibody. Thus, we proceeded with V5/FLAG-tagged p53 for detection of the effects of the isoforms on p53 stability and function. We also found that protein expression in H1299 cells was more easily detectable than in A549 cells (Compare Author response image 1A and B). Thus, we decided to continue with the H1299 cells (p53-null), which would serve as a more suitable model system for this study.</p><p>(2) We agree with the reviewer that ‘It is hard to differentiate if aggregation of full-length p53 happens only in overexpression scenario’. However, it is not impossible to imagine that such aggregation of FLp53 happens under conditions when p53 and its isoforms are over-expressed in the cell. Although the exact physiological context is not known and beyond the scope of the current work, our results indicate that at higher expression, p53 isoforms drive aggregation of FLp53. Given the challenges of detecting endogenous FLp53, we had to rely on the results obtained with plasmid mediated expression of p53 and its isoforms in p53-null cells.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparative analysis of protein expression in A549 and H1299 cells.</title><p>(A) A549 cells (p53 wild-type) were treated with etoposide to induce endogenous wild-type p53 expression.

That could be tested as well using similar ChIP assay authors has performed, but instead of antibody against the Tagged protein if the authors could check endogenous P53 enrichment in the gene promoter such as P21 following overexpression of mutant isoforms. May be introducing a condition such as DNA damage in such experiment might help where endogenous P53 is induced and more prone to bind to P53 target such as P21.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your valuable comments and suggestions. To investigate the potential functional impairment of endogenous wild-type p53 by p53 isoforms, we initially utilized A549 cells (p53 wild-type), aiming to monitor endogenous wild-type p53 expression following DNA damage. However, as mentioned and demonstrated in Author response image 1, endogenous p53 expression was too low to be detected under these conditions, making the ChIP assay for analyzing endogenous p53 activity unfeasible. Thus, we decided to utilize plasmid-based expression of FLp53 and focus on the potential functional impairment induced by the isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) On similar lines, authors described:</p><p>&quot;To test this hypothesis, we escalated the ratio of FLp53 to isoforms to 1:10. As expected, the activity of all four promoters decreased significantly at this ratio (Figure 4A-D). Notably, Δ160p53 showed a more potent inhibitory effect than Δ133p53 at the 1:5 ratio on all promoters except for the p21 promoter, where their impacts were similar (Figure 4E-H). However, at the 1:10 ratio, Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 had similar effects on all transactivation except for the MDM2 promoter (Figure 4E-H).&quot;</p><p>Again, in such assay authors used ratio 1:5 to 1:10 full length vs mutant. How authors justify this result in context (which is more relevant context) where one allele is Wild type (functional P53) and another allele is mutated (truncated, can induce aggregation). In this case one would except 1:1 ratio of full-length vs mutant protein, unless other regulation is going which induces expression of mutant isoforms more than wild type full length protein. Probably discussing on these lines might provide more physiological relevance to the observed data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point regarding the physiological relevance of the ratios used in our study.</p><p>(1) In the revised manuscript (lines 193-195), we added in this direction that “The elevated Δ133p53 protein modulates p53 target genes such as miR‑34a and p21, facilitating cancer development(2, 3). To mimic conditions where isoforms are upregulated relative to FLp53, we increased the ratios to 1:5 and 1:10.” This approach aims to simulate scenarios where isoforms accumulate at higher levels than FLp53, which may be relevant in specific contexts, as also elaborated above.</p><p>(2) Regarding the issue of protein expression, where one allele is wild-type and the other is isoform, this assumption is not valid in most contexts. First, human cells have two copies of TPp53 gene (one from each parent). Second, the TP53 gene has two distinct promoters: the proximal promoter (P1) primarily regulates FLp53 and ∆40p53, whereas the second promoter (P2) regulates ∆133p53 and ∆160p53(4, 5). Additionally, ∆133TP53 is a p53 target gene(6, 7) and the expression of Δ133p53 and FLp53 is dynamic in response to various stimuli. Third, the expression of p53 isoforms is regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational processing(8). Moreover, different degradation mechanisms modify the protein level of p53 isoforms and FLp53(8). These differential regulation mechanisms are regulated by various stimuli, and therefore, the 1:1 ratio of FLp53 to ∆133p53 or ∆160p53 may be valid only under certain physiological conditions. In line with this, varied expression levels of FLp53 and its isoforms, including ∆133p53 and ∆160p53, have been reported in several studies(3, 4, 9, 10).</p><p>(3) In our study, using the pcDNA 3.1 vector under the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, we observed moderately higher expression levels of ∆133p53 and ∆160p53 relative to FLp53 (Author response image 1B). This overexpression scenario provides a model for studying conditions where isoform accumulation might surpass physiological levels, impacting FLp53 function. By employing elevated ratios of these isoforms to FLp53, we aim to investigate the potential effects of isoform accumulation on FLp53.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Finally does this altered function of full length P53 (preferably endogenous one) in presence of truncated P53 has any phenotypic consequence on the cells (if authors choose a cell type which is having wild type functional P53). Doing assay such as apoptosis/cell cycle could help us to get this visualization.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comments. In the experiment with A549 cells (p53 wild-type), endogenous p53 levels were too low to be detected, even after DNA damage induction. The evaluation of the function of endogenous p53 in the presence of isoforms is hindered, as mentioned above. In the revised manuscript, we utilized H1299 cells with overexpressed proteins for apoptosis studies using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Figure 7). This has been shown in the Results section (lines 254-269). “The Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 proteins block pro-apoptotic function of FLp53.</p><p>One of the physiological read-outs of FLp53 is its ability to induce apoptotic cell death(11). To investigate the effects of p53 isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 on FLp53-induced apoptosis, we measured caspase-3 and -7 activities in H1299 cells expressing different p53 isoforms (Figure 7). Caspase activation is a key biochemical event in apoptosis, with the activation of effector caspases (caspase-3 and -7) ultimately leading to apoptosis(12). The caspase-3 and -7 activities induced by FLp53 expression was approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the control vector (Figure 7). Co-expression of FLp53 and the isoforms Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 at a ratio of 1: 5 significantly diminished the apoptotic activity of FLp53 (Figure 7). This result aligns well with our reporter gene assay, which demonstrated that elevated expression of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 impaired the expression of apoptosis-inducing genes BAX and PUMA (Figure 4G and H). Moreover, a reduction in the apoptotic activity of FLp53 was observed irrespective of whether Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 protein was expressed with or without a FLAG tag (Figure 7). This result, therefore, also suggests that the FLAG tag does not affect the apoptotic activity or other physiological functions of FLp53 and its isoforms. Overall, the overexpression of p53 isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 significantly attenuates FLp53-induced apoptosis, independent of the protein tagging with the FLAG antibody epitope.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>I think the comments from the other reviewers are very much reasonable and logical.</p><p>Especially all 3 reviewers have indicated, a better way to visualize the aggregation of full-length wild type P53 by truncated P53 (such as looking at endogenous P53# by reviewer 1, having fluorescent tag #by reviewer 2 and reviewer 3 raised concern on the FLAG tag) would add more value to the observation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. The endogenous p53 protein was undetectable in A549 cells induced by etoposide (Figure R1A). Therefore, we conducted experiments using FLAG/V5-tagged FLp53. To avoid any potential side effects of the FLAG tag on p53 aggregation, we introduced untagged p53 isoforms in the H1299 cells and performed subcellular fractionation. Our revised results, consistent with previous FLAG-tagged p53 isoforms findings, demonstrate that co-expression of untagged isoforms with FLAG-tagged FLp53 significantly induced the aggregation of FLAG-FLp53, while no aggregation was observed when FLAG-tagged FLp53 was expressed alone (Supplementary Figure 6).

We have added the following paragraph in the revised manuscript (lines 74-82): “Protein aggregation has become a central focus of modern biology research and has documented implications in various diseases, including cancer(13, 14, 15). Protein aggregates can be of different types ranging from amorphous aggregates to highly structured amyloid or fibrillar aggregates, each with different physiological implications. In the case of p53, whether protein aggregation, and in particular, co-aggregation with large N-terminal deletion isoforms, plays a mechanistic role in its inactivation is yet underexplored. Interestingly, the Δ133p53β isoform has been shown to aggregate in several human cancer cell lines(16). Additionally, the Δ40p53α isoform exhibits a high aggregation tendency in endometrial cancer cells(17). Although no direct evidence exists for Δ160p53 yet, these findings imply that p53 isoform aggregation may play a major role in their mechanisms of actions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Antibody Use for Aggregation: To strengthen the evidence for aggregation, the authors should consider using antibodies that specifically bind to aggregates.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestion. We addressed protein aggregation using the A11 antibody which specifically recognizes amyloid-like protein aggregates. We analyzed insoluble nuclear pellet samples prepared under identical conditions as described in Figure 6B. To confirm the presence of p53 proteins, we employed the anti-p53 M19 antibody (Santa Cruz, Cat No. sc-1312) to detect bands corresponding to FLp53 and its isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53. The monomer FLp53 was not detected (Figure 8, lower panel, Jean-Christophe Bourdon et al. Genes Dev. 2005;19:2122-2137), which may be attributed to the lower binding affinity of the anti-p53 M19 antibody to it. These samples were also immunoprecipitated using the A11 antibody (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Cat No. AHB0052) to detect aggregated proteins. Interestingly, FLp53 and its isoforms, Δ133p53 and Δ160p53, were clearly visible with Anti-A11 antibody when co-expressed at a 1:5 ratio suggesting that they underwent co-aggregation. However, no FLp53 aggregates were observed when it was expressed alone (Author response image 2).

Exploring the oncogenic potential of the isoforms is beyond the scope of the current study and we have not claimed anywhere that we are reporting that.

Recent studies demonstrate the non-oncogenic yet context-dependent role of the Δ133p53 isoform in cancer development. Δ133p53 expression has been reported to correlate with improved survival in patients with TP53 mutations(23, 24), where it promotes cell survival in a nononcogenic manner(25, 26), especially under low oxidative stress(27). Alternatively, other recent evidences emphasize the notable oncogenic functions of Δ133p53 as it can inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis by directly interacting with the FLp53 (4, 6). The oncogenic function of the newly identified Δ160p53 isoform is less known, although it is associated with p53 mutation-driven tumorigenesis(28) and in melanoma cells’ aggressiveness(10). Whether or not the Δ160p53 isoform also impedes FLp53 function in a similar way as Δ133p53 is an open question. However, these p53 isoforms can certainly compromise p53-mediated tumor suppression by interfering with FLp53 binding to target genes such as p21 and miR-34a(2, 29) by dominant-negative effect, the exact mechanism is not known.” On the figures presented in this manuscript, I have three major concerns:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Most results in the manuscript rely on the overexpression of the FLAGtagged or V5-tagged isoforms. The validation of these construct entirely depends on Supplementary figure 3 which the authors claim &quot;rules out the possibility that the FLAG epitope might contribute to this aggregation. However, I am not entirely convinced by that conclusion. Indeed, the ratio between the &quot;regular&quot; isoform and the aggregates is much higher in the FLAG-tagged constructs than in the V5-tagged constructs. We can visualize the aggregates easily in the FLAG-tagged experiment, but the imaging clearly had to be overexposed (given the white coloring demonstrating saturation of the main bands) to visualize them in the V5-tagged experiments. Therefore, I am not convinced that an effect of the FLAG-tag can be ruled out and more convincing data should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important concern. We have carefully considered your comments and have made several revisions to clarify and strengthen our conclusions.</p><p>First, to address the potential influence of the FLAG and V5 tags on p53 isoform aggregation, we have revised Figure 2 and removed the previous Supplementary Figure 3, where non-specific antibody bindings and higher molecular weight aggregates were not clearly interpretable. In the revised Figure 2, we have removed these potential aggregates, improving the clarity and accuracy of the data.</p><p>To further rule out any tag-related artifacts, we conducted a coimmunoprecipitation assay with FLAG-tagged FLp53 and untagged Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms. The results (now shown in the new Supplementary Figure 3) completely agree with our previous result with FLAG-tagged and V5tagged Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms and show interaction between the partners. This indicates that the FLAG / V5-tags do not influence / interfere with the interaction between FLp53 and the isoforms. We have still used FLAGtagged FLp53 as the endogenous p53 was undetectable and the FLAG-tagged FLp53 did not aggregate alone.</p><p>In the revised paper, we added the following sentences (Lines 146-152): “To rule out the possibility that the observed interactions between FLp53 and its isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 were artifacts caused by the FLAG and V5 antibody epitope tags, we co-expressed FLAG-tagged FLp53 with untagged Δ133p53 and Δ160p53. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that FLAGtagged FLp53 could indeed interact with the untagged Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms (Supplementary Figure 3, lanes 3 and 4), confirming formation of hetero-oligomers between FLp53 and its isoforms. These findings demonstrate that Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 can oligomerize with FLp53 and with each other.”</p><p>Additionally, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments to compare the aggregation and localization of FLAG-tagged FLp53 when co-expressed either with V5-tagged or untagged Δ133p53/Δ160p53. In these experiments, the untagged isoforms also induced FLp53 aggregation, mirroring our previous results with the tagged isoforms (Supplementary Figure 5). We’ve added this result in the revised manuscript (lines 236-245): “To exclude the possibility that FLAG or V5 tags contribute to protein aggregation, we also conducted subcellular fractionation of H1299 cells expressing FLAG-tagged FLp53 along with untagged Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 at a 1:5 ratio. The results showed (Supplementary Figure 6) a similar distribution of FLp53 across cytoplasmic, nuclear, and insoluble nuclear fractions as in the case of tagged Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 (Figure 6A to D). Notably, the aggregation of untagged Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 markedly promoted the aggregation of FLAG-tagged FLp53 (Supplementary Figure 6B and D), demonstrating that the antibody epitope tags themselves do not contribute to protein aggregation.”</p><p>We’ve also discussed this in the Discussion section (lines 349-356): “In our study, we primarily utilized an overexpression strategy involving FLAG/V5tagged proteins to investigate the effects of p53 isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 on the function of FLp53. To address concerns regarding potential overexpression artifacts, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation (Supplementary Figure 6) and caspase-3 and -7 activity (Figure 7) experiments with untagged Δ133p53 and Δ160p53. In both experimental systems, the untagged proteins behaved very similarly to the FLAG/V5 antibody epitopecontaining proteins (Figures 6 and 7 and Supplementary Figure 6). Hence, the C-terminal tagging of FLp53 or its isoforms does not alter the biochemical and physiological functions of these proteins.”</p><p>In summary, the revised data set and newly added experiments provide strong evidence that neither the FLAG nor the V5 tag contributes to the observed p53 isoform aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors demonstrate that to visualize the dominant-negative effect, Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α must be &quot;present in a higher proportion than FLp53 in the tetramer&quot; and the need at least a transfection ratio 1:5 since the 1:1 ration shows no effect. However, in almost every single cell type, FLp53 is far more expressed than the isoforms which make it very unlikely to reach such stoichiometry in physiological conditions and make me wonder if this mechanism naturally occurs at endogenous level. This limitation should be at least discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comment. However, evidence suggests that the expression levels of these isoforms such as Δ133p53, can be significantly elevated relative to FLp53 in certain physiological conditions(3, 4, 9). For example, in some breast tumors, with Δ133p53 mRNA is expressed at a much levels than FLp53, suggesting a distinct expression profile of p53 isoforms compared to normal breast tissue(4). Similarly, in non-small cell lung cancer and the A549 lung cancer cell line, the expression level of Δ133p53 transcript is significantly elevated compared to non-cancerous cells(3). Moreover, in specific cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, the Δ133p53 /TAp53 expression ratio has been reported to increase to as high as 3:1(9). These observations indicate that the dominant-negative effect of isoform Δ133p53 on FLp53 can occur under certain pathological conditions where the relative amounts of the FLp53 and the isoforms would largely vary. Since data on the Δ160p53 isoform are scarce, we infer that the long N-terminal truncated isoforms may share a similar mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 5C: I am concerned by the subcellular location of the Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α as they are commonly considered nuclear and not cytoplasmic as shown here, particularly since they retain the 3 nuclear localization sequences like the FLp53 (Bourdon JC et al. 2005; Mondal A et al. 2018; Horikawa I et al, 2017; Joruiz S. et al, 2024). However, Δ133p53α can form cytoplasmic speckles (Horikawa I et al, 2017) when it colocalizes with autophagy markers for its degradation.</p><p>The authors should discuss this issue. Could this discrepancy be due to the high overexpression level of these isoforms? A co-staining with autophagy markers (p62, LC3B) would rule out (or confirm) activation of autophagy due to the overwhelming expression of the isoform.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comments. We have thoroughly reviewed all the papers you recommended (Bourdon JC et al., 2005; Mondal A et al., 2018; Horikawa I et al., 2017; Joruiz S. et al., 2024)(4, 29, 30, 31). Among these, only the study by Bourdon JC et al. (2005) provided data regarding the localization of Δ133p53(4). Interestingly, their findings align with our observations, indicating that the protein does not exhibit predominantly nuclear localization in the Figure 8 from Jean-Christophe Bourdon et al. Genes Dev. 2005;19:2122-2137. The discrepancy may be caused by a potentially confusing statement in that paper(4).</p><p>The localization of p53 is governed by multiple factors, including its nuclear import and export(32). The isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 contain three nuclear localization sequences (NLS)(4). However, the isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 were potentially trapped in the cytoplasm by aggregation and masking the NLS. This mechanism would prevent nuclear import.</p><p>Further, we acknowledge that Δ133p53 co-aggregates with autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1 and autophagosome component LC3B in cytoplasm by autophagic degradation during replicative senescence(33). We agree that high overexpression of these aggregation-prone proteins may induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates autophagy(34). This could explain the cytoplasmic localization in our experiments. However, it is also critical to consider that we observed aggregates in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Figures 6B and E and Supplementary Figure 6B). While cytoplasmic localization may involve autophagy-related mechanisms, the nuclear aggregates likely arise from intrinsic isoform properties, such as altered protein folding, independent of autophagy. These dual localizations reflect the complex behavior of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms under our experimental conditions.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we discussed this in Discussion (lines 328-335): “Moreover, the observed cytoplasmic isoform aggregates may reflect autophagy-related degradation, as suggested by the co-localization of Δ133p53 with autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1 and autophagosome component LC3B(33). High overexpression of these aggregation-prone proteins could induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and activate autophagy(34). Interestingly, we also observed nuclear aggregation of these isoforms (Figure 6B and E and Supplementary Figure 6B), suggesting that distinct mechanisms, such as intrinsic properties of the isoforms, may govern their localization and behavior within the nucleus. This dual localization underscores the complexity of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 behavior in cellular systems.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>- Figure 1A: the initiation of the &quot;Δ140p53&quot; is shown instead of &quot;Δ40p53&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you!

Furthermore, since these two references and the others from Gong et al. show that Δ133p53α increases DNA repair genes, it would be interesting to look at RAD51, RAD52 or Lig4, and maybe also induce stress.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comments and suggestions. In Figure 3C, the presence of Δ133p53 or Δ160p53 only significantly reduced the binding of FLp53 to the p21 promoter. However, isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 demonstrated a significant loss of DNA-binding activity at all four promoters: p21, MDM2, and apoptosis target genes BAX and PUMA (Figure 3B). This result suggests that Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 have the potential to influence FLp53 function due to their ability to form hetero-oligomers with FLp53 or their intrinsic tendency to aggregate. To further investigate this, we increased the isoform to FLp53 ratio in Figure 4, which demonstrate that the isoforms Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 exert dominant-negative effects on the function of FLp53.</p><p>These results demonstrate that the isoforms can compromise p53-mediated pathways, consistent with Horikawa et al. (2017), which showed that Δ133p53α overexpression is &quot;non- or less oncogenic and mutagenic&quot; compared to complete p53 inhibition, but still affects specific tumor-suppressing pathways. Furthermore, as noted by Gong et al. (2016), Δ133p53’s anti-apoptotic function under certain conditions is independent of FLp53 and unrelated to its dominantnegative effects.</p><p>We appreciate your suggestion to investigate DNA repair genes such as RAD51, RAD52, or Lig4, especially under stress conditions. While these targets are intriguing and relevant, we believe that our current investigation of p53 targets in this manuscript sufficiently supports our conclusions regarding the dominant-negative effect. Further exploration of additional p53 target genes, including those involved in DNA repair, will be an important focus of our future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 5A and B: directly comparing the level of FLp53 expressed in cytoplasm or nucleus to the level of Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α expressed in cytoplasm or nucleus does not mean much since these are overexpressed proteins and therefore depend on the level of expression. The authors should rather compare the ratio of cytoplasmic/nuclear FLp53 to the ratio of cytoplasmic/nuclear Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this valuable suggestion. In the revised paper, Figure 5B has been recreated. Changes have been made in lines 214215: “The cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio of Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 was approximately 1.5-fold higher than that of FLp53 (Figure 5B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>I agree that the system needs to be improved to be more physiological.</p><p>Just to precise, the D133 and D160 isoforms are not truncated mutants, they are naturally occurring isoforms expressed in almost every normal human cell type from an internal promoter within the TP53 gene.</p><p>Using overexpression always raises concerns, but in this case, I am even more careful because the isoforms are almost always less expressed than the FLp53, and here they have to push it 5 to 10 times more expressed than the FLp53 to see the effect which make me fear an artifact effect due to the overwhelming overexpression (which even seems to change the normal localization of the protein).</p><p>To visualize the endogenous proteins, they will have to change cell line as the H1299 they used are p53 null.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. We’ve addressed the motivation of overexpression in the above responses. We needed to use the plasmid constructs in the p53-null cells to detect the proteins but the expression level was certainly not ‘overwhelmingly high’.</p><p>First, we tried the A549 cells (p53 wild-type) under DNA damage conditions, but the endogenous p53 protein was undetectable. Second, several studies reported increased Δ133p53 level compared to wild-type p53 and that it has implications in tumor development(2, 3, 4, 9). Third, the apoptosis activity of H1299 cells overexpressing p53 proteins was analyzed in the revised manuscript (Figure 7). The apoptotic activity induced by FLp53 expression was approximately 2.5 times higher than that of the control vector under identical plasmid DNA transfection conditions (Figure 7). These results rule out the possibility that the plasmid-based expression of p53 and its isoforms introduced artifacts in the results.
