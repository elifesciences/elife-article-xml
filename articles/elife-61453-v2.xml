Although more than 140 disease mutations of SOD1 are available, their stability or aggregation behaviors in membrane environment are not correlated with disease pathophysiology. Here, we use multiple mutational variants of SOD1 to show that the absence of Zn, and not Cu, significantly impacts membrane attachment of SOD1 through two loop regions facilitating aggregation driven by lipid-induced conformational changes. These loop regions influence both the primary (through Cu intake) and the gain of function (through aggregation) of SOD1 presumably through a shared conformational landscape. Combining experimental and theoretical frameworks using representative ALS disease mutants, we develop a ‘co-factor derived membrane association model’ wherein mutational stress closer to the Zn (but not to the Cu) pocket is responsible for membrane association-mediated toxic aggregation and survival time scale after ALS diagnosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is an incurable neurodegenerative disease in which a person slowly loses specialized nerve cells that control voluntary movement. It is not fully understood what causes this fatal disease. However, it is suspected that clumps, or aggregates, of a protein called SOD1 in nerve cells may play a crucial role.</p><p>More than 140 mutations in the gene for SOD1 have been linked to ALS, with varying degrees of severity. But it is still unclear how these mutations cause SOD1 aggregation or how different mutations influence the survival rate of the disease. The protein SOD1 contains a copper ion and a zinc ion, and it is possible that mutations that affect how these two ions bind to SOD1 influences the severity of the disease.</p><p>To investigate this, Sannigrahi, Chowdhury, Das et al. genetically engineered mutants of the SOD1 protein which each contain only one metal ion. Experiments on these mutated proteins showed that the copper ion is responsible for the protein’s role in neutralizing harmful reactive molecules, while the zinc ion stabilizes the protein against aggregation. Sannigrahi et al. found that when the zinc ion was removed, the SOD1 protein attached to a structure inside the cell called the mitochondria and formed toxic aggregates.</p><p>Sannigrahi et al. then used these observations to build a computational model that incorporated different mutations that have been previously associated with ALS. The model suggests that mutations close to the site where zinc binds to the SOD1 protein increase disease severity and shorten survival time after diagnosis. This model was then experimentally validated using two disease variants of ALS that have mutations close to the sites where zinc or copper binds.</p><p>These findings still need to be tested in animals and humans to see if these mechanisms hold true in a multicellular organism. This discovery could help design new ALS treatments that target the zinc binding site on SOD1 or disrupt the protein’s interactions with the mitochondria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ALS</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd><kwd>neuro-degeneration</kwd><kwd>membrane</kwd><kwd>cofactor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001501</institution-id><institution>University Grants Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sannigrahi</surname><given-names>Achinta</given-names></name><name><surname>Chowdhury</surname><given-names>Sourav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR8475/BRB/10/1248/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karmakar</surname><given-names>Sanat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMR/2016/000310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chattopadhyay</surname><given-names>Krishnananda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001332</institution-id><institution>CSIR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSIR internal funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chattopadhyay</surname><given-names>Krishnananda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>How do the metal cofactors present in the protein SOD1 collaborate with the interacting membrane to define the role of this protein in the disease ALS?</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The aggregation of SOD1 is believed to be one of the chief causative factors behind the lethal motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shaw and Valentine, 2007</xref>). Although more than 140 SOD1 mutations have been reportedly associated with ALS, there is no correlation between the stability (and aggregation) of these mutations and their disease manifestations. SOD1 aggregation has been investigated extensively in vitro by altering the solution conditions, such as temperature, pH, the presence of metal chelators, and the reduction of disulfide linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bush, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niwa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodriguez et al., 2005</xref>). The results of these studies clearly suggest that the aggregation of SOD1 is heterogeneous containing multiple steps, which is presumably the reason behind the lack of a structural understanding of aggregation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pasinelli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tomik et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>WT SOD1 contains Cu<sup>2+</sup> (Cu) and Zn<sup>2+</sup> (Zn) as cofactors. It has been established that Cu is responsible for the primary function of SOD1 (the dismutase activity), and cell membrane acts as a scaffold in the process of Cu transfer to apo-SOD1 (metal free non-functional protein) through a Cu delivery chaperone (CCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Culotta et al., 1997</xref>). Previous studies have found noticeable presence of SOD1 in human serum lipoproteins, mainly in LDL and HDL, hinting at a possible protective role of SOD1 against the lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondola et al., 2016</xref>). It has also been noted that SOD1 has a physiological propensity to accumulate near the membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ilieva et al., 2009</xref>) of different cellular compartments, including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manfredi and Kawamata, 2016</xref>). In addition, computational studies have shown that the electrostatic loop (loop VII, residues 121–142) and Zn-binding loop (loop IV, residues 58–83) promote membrane interaction of apo-SOD1 initiating the aggregation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chng and Strange, 2014</xref>). Membrane binding induced aggregation of SOD1 has also been shown experimentally both in vitro and inside cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hervias et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2011</xref>). Inclusions of SOD1 have been detected in the inter-membrane space of mitochondria originating from the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondola et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The above results can be reconciled by suggesting that cell membrane can play crucial roles not only in shaping up the primary function of the protein, but also in defining its aggregation process of generating fibrillar and non-fibrillar aggregates (the gain of function), with the loops IV and VII contributing critically to both processes. We hypothesize that (1) the induction of metal cofactors for the stabilization of loop IV and VII, membrane interaction, and SOD1 aggregation would be some of the crucial elements in defining the overlapping folding-aggregation landscape of SOD1; (2) metal pocket perturbation by mutational stresses (as in disease variants) would modulate membrane association and facilitate aggregation, and (3) the difference in aggregate morphology as a result of differential membrane interaction may contribute to the variation in cellular toxicity observed in ALS.</p><p>In this paper, we investigated the above hypothesis by studying how different structural elements (i.e. co-ordination of individual metals, membrane association, and the location of mutations) attenuate the toxic gain of function of SOD1. An effective understanding of the role of individual metals (Cu and Zn) would require studying SOD1 variants containing only one metal (Cu or Zn) in addition to a variant that contains none. We have therefore prepared an apo (metal free) protein, which serves the latter purpose. For the former, we have generated two single metal containing mutants of SOD1, viz. H121F (only Zn, no Cu) and H72F (only Cu, no Zn), which are situated near the key loop VII (H121F) and loop IV (H72F) at the protein structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Statistical mechanical modeling of SOD1 folding mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon representation of SOD1 monomer highlighting the various structural elements.

We demonstrate that differential metal binding and membrane assisted conformational changes can work in concert to attenuate the rate and propensity of aggregation. While apo (no metal) protein and H72F mutant (no Zn) experience strong membrane interaction, the WT (both metals) protein and H121F (no Cu) mutant do not show significant binding. We further find that membrane-induced aggregates of H72F and apo protein showed significantly higher toxicity in terms of cell death and model membrane deformation when compared to WT and H121F mutant. We finally check the validity of this model to ALS using computational and experimental studies. For the computational validation, we show, using 15 ALS disease mutants, that the distance between the mutation site and Zn correlates well with the membrane binding energy and patient survival time after disease diagnosis, while Cu site does not seem to have any prominent role. For the experimental study, we use two well-studied disease mutants (G37R where mutational site is close to the Cu pocket and I113T where mutational site is near Zn pocket) to show that the model accounts well for their membrane binding/aggregation, correlating well with their disease onset phenotypes. This model puts forward a mechanism that Zn pocket destabilization (either by metal content variation or by mutational stress near Zn center) is the driving force behind the toxic gain of function of SOD1 mediated by the process of membrane association.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Statistical mechanical modeling of SOD1 folding mechanism hints at aggregation origins</title><p>The large size of SOD1 (151 residues) precludes a detailed characterization of the conformational landscape, the role of ions in determining the stability-folding mechanism, and the effect of numerous mutations via all-atom simulation methods. To overcome this challenge and to obtain a simple physical picture of how the energetics of folding is governed by metal ions, we resort to constructing the folding landscape of reduced SOD1 variants through the statistical mechanical Wako–Saitô–Muñoz–Eaton (WSME) model (see Materials and methods for model description and parametrization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wako and Saitô, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muñoz and Eaton, 1999</xref>). Here, we employ the bWSME model where stretches of three consecutive residues are considered as a block (b) that reduces the total number of microstates from 42.7 million to just ~450,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gopi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The model, however, incorporates contributions from van der Waals interactions, simplified solvation, Debye–Hückel electrostatics, excess conformational entropy for disordered residues, and restricted conformational freedom for proline residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Naganathan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rajasekaran et al., 2016</xref>). The predicted average folding path of SOD1 WT (with both Cu and Zn bound) highlights that the folding is initiated around the metal binding regions with early folding of the loop IV (nucleated by Zn) in the unfolded well and aided by flickering structure in the electrostatic loop (loop VII, nucleated by Cu). The rest of the structure coalesces around this initial folding site leading to the native state. This folding mechanism is very similar to that proposed earlier <italic>via</italic> detailed kinetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leinartaite et al., 2010</xref>). In the absence of metal ions, the apo variant folds through an alternate pathway wherein the folding is nucleated through the first three strands (residues 1–40) following which the rest of the structure folds, recapitulating the results of single-molecule experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sen Mojumdar et al., 2017</xref>). It is important to note that the first three strands exhibit higher aggregation propensity as predicted from different computational servers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–</xref>). Interestingly, the folding mechanism of the Zn-bound SOD1 (with no Cu bound) is similar to that of the WT hinting that Zn coordination promotes proper folding. On the other hand, the folding mechanism of the Cu-bound SOD1 (in the absence of Zn) is similar to that of apo-SOD1 with additional folding probability in the region around the electrostatic loop. Taken together, the statistical modeling highlights how the absence of metals and particularly the absence of Zn (or mutations that affect Zn binding and not Cu binding) alters the folding mechanism by populating partially structured states involving beta strands in the unfolded well thus possibly increasing the chances of aggregation. Importantly, the model provides multiple testable predictions on the differential roles of Zn and Cu, which we address below <italic>via</italic> experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cu-deficient H121F behaves like WT SOD1, whereas zn-deficient H72F behaves like apo</title><p>We have recently shown that the mutants H121F and H72F contain negligible Cu and Zn, respectively, while the apo protein is completely devoid of metal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chowdhury et al., 2019</xref>). We validated this further using atomic absorption spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and activity measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Guanidinium-induced equilibrium unfolding transitions of H121F and H72F were found to be similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We used steady-state tryptophan fluorescence, far UV CD, and FTIR spectroscopy to characterize these different proteins.

We found that the formation of apo form resulted in a large shift in Trp32 emission maximum (332 nm for WT protein and 350 nm for apo protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In contrast, other two mono-metallated variants (H121F and H72F) exhibited fluorescence emission maxima at wavelengths, which were intermediate between the WT and apo proteins (342 nm for H121F and 345 nm for H72F) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Next, we performed acrylamide-quenching experiments to measure the solvent surface exposure of Trp32 for all variants.

In agreement with steady-state fluorescence data, the far UV-CD spectrum of the Zn-deficient H72F protein was found to be similar to the apo variant, while the WT- and Cu-deficient H121F variant displayed similar spectra. We then used FT-IR spectroscopy to complement far-UV CD results and to obtain a preliminary estimate of the secondary structure contents of the protein variants, using amide-I FTIR spectral region. The carbonyl (C = 0) stretching vibrations at amide-I region provides information related to the secondary structure (beta sheet 1633–1638, alpha helix 1649–1656, disorder and turns and loops 1644 and 1665–1672 cm<sup>−1</sup>).

The peak positions were selected from the minima of the secondary derivatives of the FT-IR absorbance data. In the second step, selected peak positions thus determined were used for the fitting of the FT-IR raw data using Gaussian distributions analyses. Analysis of the secondary structure of WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) showed the presence of 10% alpha helix, 38% beta sheet, and 52% turns and loops including disordered stretches. The percentage of the secondary structure determined from the FT-IR analysis was found to be consistent with the data obtained from the crystal structure (PDB 4BCY with 11% alpha helix, 40% beta sheet, and 49% turns and loops), thus validating our method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danielsson et al., 2013</xref>).

In contrast, the same calculation predicted higher binding affinity of apo protein with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). When we used ITASSER-modeled structures, the computed values of ΔG<sub>transfer</sub> (free energy change of protein transfer from bulk to the membrane) was found to be substantially higher for the apo (−2.6 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>) when compared to the WT protein (−1.2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>). When we used the crystal structure of the WT protein, ΔG<sub>transfer</sub> calculation modeling yielded similar results for the WT protein (−0.9 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>). To probe protein-lipid binding constants experimentally (K<sub>a</sub>, M<sup>−1</sup>), we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). FCS monitors diffusional and conformational dynamics of fluorescently labeled biomolecules at single-molecule resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chattopadhyay et al., 2002</xref>). For FCS experiments, we labeled the cysteine residues of all the SOD1 variants using Alexa-488-maleimide. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> shows a schematic diagram of how the labeled proteins and protein-lipids complex would behave inside the confocal volume. Using FCS we determined the correlation functions using 50 nM Alexa488Maleimide protein in the presence of increasing concentration of DPPC small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref> showed the typical correlation functions of alexa labeled apo SOD1 in absence and presence of 100 nM and 500 nM DPPC SUVs). We fit the correlation functions using a two component diffusion model and the goodness of the fit was established using the randomness of the residual distribution. In this model, the fast and slow diffusing components corresponded to the free (with r<sub>H1</sub>13.5 Å) and lipid bound protein (r<sub>H2</sub>170 Å) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). With increasing DPPC SUV concentration, the percentage of slow component increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), which occurred at the expense of the fast component, and a sigmoidal fit of either of these components yield the values of K<sub>a</sub>, which showed that the binding affinities followed the trend: apo ≥H72F&gt;H121F&gt;WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Since FCS experiments required the use of labeled proteins in which the presence of bulky fluorescence dye can potentially influence the results, we complemented FCS binding data by measuring the tryptophan fluorescence of the SOD1 variants with increasing concentrations of DPPC SUVs. From the gradual enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence due to lipid binding, we calculated the binding affinities of all the protein variants towards membrane which showed comparable binding constants as obtained from our FCS experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7b,c</xref>).

To understand the effect of curvature on membrane binding and aggregation, we performed the binding experiments with H72F mutant using liposomes of different curvatures. We used DPPC SUVs (diameter ~78 nm), LUVs (diameter ~140 nm) and GUVs (~20 μm) for this study. Our results showed that with increasing curvature of the DPPC lipid vesicles, binding, and aggregation of H72F increased that is fibril formation rate and extents were found to be highest in the presence of SUVs and moderate for LUVs and lowest for GUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>). To investigate the effect of H72F mutant toward curvature induction in GUVs, we studied the aggregation of H72F in the presence of GUVs and the final point aggregates were imaged through a transmission electron microscope. We found that as a result of the incubation with H72F, the size of the GUVs reduced many folds starting from an average size of 5–10 μm to about 1–2 μm. Numerous smaller vesicles are observed in the background that suggest a possible vesiculation of the GUV induced by H72F during the long incubation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c,d</xref>).

These results suggested possible membrane remodeling induced by Zn-deficient H72F mutant, an aspect we would like to study in further detail. To determine the effect of membrane composition, we studied DPPG, which is a widely used negatively charged membrane with chain length identical to DPPC.

(1) phase-contrast microscopy using a membrane model of giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) to probe how the presence of aggregates change their size and shapes, (2) a calcein release assay to probe aggregate-induced pore formation, and (3) FTIR to determine the molecular mechanism of the influence of different aggregates on the structure of lipids.</p><p>For the imaging assay, we used time based optical microscopic investigation to unveil how the addition of P<sub>agg</sub>, and P<sub>aggm</sub> affects the size and shape of GUVs. GUV is widely used as a model membrane system, providing free-standing bilayers unaffected by support-induced artifacts yet with sufficiently low curvature to well mimic cellular membranes and mitochondrial membrane as well. An advantage of this assay comes from the use of phase contrast without requiring any external fluorophore label. We made the GUVs composed of DOPC:DOPE:PI:DOPS:CL in the ratio 4.5:2.5:1:0.5:1.5, which mimics mitochondrial membrane composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gohil and Greenberg, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> is a representative example of how apo-aggregates formed in the absence of membrane (apo<sub>agg</sub>) behaved with the GUVs. In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> shows the influence of the apo-aggregates formed in the presence of membrane (apo<sub>aggm</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> shows an example of a control, in which WT samples (WT<sub>agg</sub>, which should contain minimum aggregates population) were added to the GUVs. GUV images of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref> clearly demonstrate that the aggregates attach on the surface of GUVs (shown by arrows) leading to membrane deformation and change in lamellarity. These two images also show the pore formation, which was further established by the contrast loss. A comparison between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref> shows visually that membrane deformation is more prominent (more damage) and faster (occurs at earlier time points) in the presence of P<sub>aggm</sub>. All these changes in GUVs were found absent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, in which WT<sub>agg</sub>, was used. For the quantification of the image data, we determined the difference in refractive indices between the exterior and interior of GUVs (represented by I<sub>ptp</sub>, peak-to-peak intensity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sannigrahi et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of intact vesicles, the values of I<sub>ptp</sub> would be high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, left) due to the difference in sugar asymmetry between outside and inside of GUVs, which would disappear in the case of membrane deformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, right). We plotted the time dependence of I<sub>ptp</sub> to determine quantitatively the membrane deformation kinetics by measuring the deformation rate constants, λ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, inset). The GUV deformation was insignificant and no detectable kinetics were found for WT<sub>agg</sub>,, WT <sub>aggm</sub>, H121F<sub>agg</sub>, and H121F<sub>aggm</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). On the other hand, apo<sub>agg</sub>, and H72F<sub>agg</sub>, exhibited significantly high deformation rate (λapo<sub>agg</sub> ~ 1.8×10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1 </sup>and λH72F<sub>agg</sub> ~ 2.1×10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and both kinetics appeared cooperative (sigmoidal behavior, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). It is interesting to note that in the presence of apo<sub>aggm</sub> and H72F<sub>aggm</sub>, the deformation rate increased significantly (λapo<sub>aggm</sub> ~ 3.5×10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1 </sup>and λH72F<sub>aggm</sub> ~ 3.9×10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). More interestingly, both apo<sub>agg</sub> and apo<sub>aggm</sub> showed a tendency to create attachments between vesicles to generate vesicular assembly and co-operative deformations (high-contrast images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, which is also shown by a schematic drawing). The image analysis and visualization of the GUVs in presence of apo<sub>aggm</sub> suggested that the co-operative vesicular clustering and deformation presumably occurred through allosteric communications mechanism by the aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that apo<sub>aggm</sub> and H72F<sub>aggm</sub> are more efficient towards inducing vesicular assembly and deformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). To rule out the effect of only SUVs (which are present along with the protein), we performed a control experiment by treating the GUVs with similar concentration of DPPC SUVs as employed for the formation of P<sub>aggm</sub>. Our results showed insignificant changes in I<sub>ptp</sub> values in the presence of DPPC SUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), further highlighting that P<sub>agg</sub> and P<sub>aggm</sub> are responsible for the GUV perturbations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Membrane deformation by protein aggregates.</title><p>Time variations of phase-contrast micrographs of a single GUV when GUVs were treated with (<bold>a</bold>) apo<sub>agg</sub>, (<bold>b</bold>) apo<sub>aggm</sub>, and (<bold>c</bold>) WT<sub>agg</sub>.

Similar observation was found previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2009</xref>. Using <italic>C. elegans</italic> as model system, they showed that the neuronal toxicity in ALS appears due to synaptic dysfunction that occurs because of misfolded and aggregated disease mutant driven lowering in the number of organelles including synaptic vesicles and mitochondria. The pore formation and vesicle rupture by aggregates may be a possible reason for the reduced synaptic vesicle population in case of ALS disease mutants. To investigate this issue, we prepared calcein entrapped SUVs composed of DOPE, DOPS, and DOPC at the molar ratio 5:3:2 to mimic the synaptic vesicle composition and curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fusco et al., 2016</xref>). In this assay, we measured the percentage of calcein leakage from the dye entrapped inside lipid vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). The extent of calcein leakage after the treatment of different protein aggregates followed the trend similar to what was observed by GUV micrographic observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), which suggested that the membrane rupture is facilitated in significantly higher rate and extent by apo<sub>aggm</sub> and H72F<sub>aggm</sub>, while compared with apo<sub>agg</sub> and H72F<sub>agg</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6a</xref>).</p><p>In order to induce membrane deformation as observed by previous two assays, the aggregates need to inflict substantial changes in lipid structure. To determine the extent of conformational change the lipid molecules experience by protein variants, we used ATR-FTIR to measure quantitatively the populations of different rotamers in a general planar trans-oriented phospholipid bilayer of DPPC. CH<sub>2</sub> wagging band frequency (1280–1460 cm<sup>−1</sup>) of the hydrocarbon tail region of the bilayer was carefully monitored for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis and McElhaney, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maroncelli et al., 1982</xref>). The results show a significant increase in the populations of nonplanar kink+gtg<sup>/</sup> rotamers (this band appears at 1367 cm<sup>−1</sup>) when planar lipid bilayer was treated with apo<sub>agg</sub>/apo<sub>aggm</sub> and H72F<sub>agg</sub>/H72F<sub>aggm</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6b,c</xref>). We also found that apo<sub>aggm</sub>/H72F<sub>aggm</sub> exerted greater effect on lipids than apo<sub>agg</sub>,/H72F<sub>agg</sub>. Interestingly, differences in the populations of non-planar conformers are found to be similar to the variation in the extent of calcein release induced by protein variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). This observation provides preliminary evidence that both events occur by similar trigger (presumably the membrane attachment by the aggregates).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Aggregation kinetics and aggregate-induced toxicity studies of ALS disease mutants</title><p>In the previous few sections using WT, apo, H121F, and H72F, we established that the WT (containing both Zn and Cu) and the Zn bound H121F protein did not aggregate or induced toxicity through membrane deformation. In contrast, the removal of either Zn (H72F mutant) or both metals (the apo protein) resulted in strong membrane association, aggregation and induction of cellular toxicity. The data clearly suggest that Cu plays secondary roles in aggregation induced toxicity, while Zn pocket destabilization acts in concert with membrane-induced conformational change resulting in aggregation and toxic gain of function. Since these experiments validate successfully the predictions from the statistical mechanical model, we subsequently wanted to understand this behavior could be generalized in ALS disease mutants.</p><p>For this purpose, we used both in silico and experimental approaches. For the in silico method, we selected fifteen disease mutants of ALS, whose structures are available in the protein data bank (PDB) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). From the crystal structures, we determined the distance between the mutation site and Zn (and Cu) for all these disease mutants. In addition, we calculated the transfer free energies, that is the theoretical membrane association energies (ΔG<sub>Tr</sub>), of these mutants using the OPM server. We found that the negative values of ΔG<sub>Tr</sub> decreased linearly with the increased distance of Zn site for these mutants, while it remained non-variant with the distance of Cu site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We also found that the severity of ALS mutants (defined here as the survival time in year of ALS patients after diagnosis) correlates nicely with the distance of the Zn sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). For the experimental validation, we used two representative ALS disease mutants of varying distance between the mutation site and Zn. The mutations, namely G37R (mutation site-Zn distance 24 Å, less severe) and I113T (mutation site-Zn distance 16 Å, more severe) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) are well studied in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milardi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banci et al., 2009</xref>). Using FCS we also measured the K<sub>a</sub> values of these two disease mutants which showed greater binding affinity for I113T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Structural characterization using FTIR showed greater extent of alpha helical content in I113T compared to G37R. On the other hand, further increase in the alpha helical structure in I113T was observed on interaction with model membrane. In contrast, we did not observe any membrane induced structural change for G37R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To understand the internal structural changes due to the disease mutations, we performed some in silico study using DynaMut webserver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/dynamut/">http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/dynamut/</ext-link>) to predict the effects of mutational stress on the conformational dynamics, stability and flexibility of protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodrigues et al., 2018</xref>). The results suggested that G37R mutation increased the rigidity of different regions (6–16, 30–42, 80–86 aa) of the protein, whereas significant increase in flexibility of the loop IV and VII region (48–52, 130–150) was observed in case of I113T mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The predicted changes in folding free energy (<italic>ΔΔG</italic>, kcal/mol) for I113T was found to be much more negative than G37R (<italic>ΔΔG(ΔGWT – ΔGmutant)) </italic>suggesting that mutation at 113th position destabilized the protein more in comparison to 37<sup>th</sup> position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The vibrational entropy change (<italic>ΔΔS</italic>) in I113T was found to be +0.188 kcal mol<sup>−1 </sup>K<sup>−1</sup> while −0.404 kcal mol<sup>−1 </sup>K<sup>−1</sup> was found for G37R indicating the increase in flexibility for I113T and decrease in flexibility for G37R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus the increase in alpha helical content in I113T mutant arises due to the increase in flexibility in the membrane interacting loop regions as suggested by the DynaMut server. Subsequently, we used ThT fluorescence to probe the aggregation kinetics of G37R and I113T in the absence and presence of DPPC SUVs. Results in the absence of membrane showed significantly higher aggregation for I113T when compared to G37R. A notable increase in the rate and extent of aggregation was observed for I113T under membrane environment, whereas for G37R, the change was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). AFM imaging showed linear fibrillar aggregate for I113T in the absence of membrane (average length is ~1.5 μm and height is 26 nm), whereas fibrilar network was observed when aggregation occurred in the presence of DPPC SUVs (average height is 3.2 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e,f</xref>). In contrast, small nonfibrilar aggregates were found for G37R mutant both in the absence and in the presence of membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, we studied the toxic effects of the aggregates of G37R and I113T, which formed in the absence and presence of membrane. Using MTT, we showed that I113T aggregates in the absence of membrane were less toxic than I113T aggregates in the presence of membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). G37R exhibited minimal toxicity both in the absence or presence of membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Our computational and experimental binding study using FCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>) showed that the binding affinity of G85R (−2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>) is intermediate between that of G37R (−1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>) and I113T (−3.2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>). In addition, AFM imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>) suggests that G85R aggregation behavior in membrane environment remains between mild G37R and severe I113T mutants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The cofactor-derived membrane association model</title><p>In this work, we effectively bring a large number of studies together in a coherent framework to address the different roles of two metal cofactors (Cu and Zn) and membrane binding on the aggregation and induced toxicity of SOD1. Based on steady-state fluorescence, acrylamide quenching, and FT-IR data, the investigated proteins could be classified as (1) WT and WT-like mutant, H121F and (2) apo and apo like mutant, H72F. The battery of experimental approaches clearly validates the prediction from the bWSME model that Zn is largely responsible for the conformational stability of SOD1. The insertion of Zn at the loop IV region stabilizes the loop while reducing the aggregation propensity of the apo protein. We believe that the stabilization of this long loop may play an important role in SOD1 aggregation biology and its relevance in ALS. It may be noted that shortening of the loop has been shown to increase the stability of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). This is also important to point out that SOD1 variants from thermophiles (like SOD5 from <italic>C. albicans</italic> SOD5) have shorter electrostatic loops compared to human SOD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gleason et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the absence of Cu does not seem to have any significant effect on the stability of the protein, and the Zn containing Cu-deficient protein behaves like WT. We derive a possible maturation/aggregation landscape of SOD1 in the presence of membrane employing data from the current work and available literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Since all experiments presented here were carried out using the reduced protein, this scheme does not take dimerization into consideration. SOD1 in its metal free state (apo protein) has been shown to be flexible and inherently dynamic. The sequence sites (48–80 and 120–140) of low folding probability predicted by bWSME calculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) have significant overlap with the sequence sites (45–70 and 125–142) of high membrane binding as calculated by OPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). It has been found that truncation at Leu126 of C-terminus resulted in a protein with several transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2015</xref>). We found that the apo protein has high membrane binding possibility which is directly supported by membrane binding data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplment 7b,c</xref>). Membrane bound apoSOD1 with an optimized orientation is a requisite for the Cu insertion to take place. Since biological systems have very-low-free Cu salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rae et al., 1999</xref>), Cu coordination to SOD1 occurs through Cu chaperone protein (CCS) which transfers Cu to apo SOD1 using membrane as a scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pope et al., 2013</xref>). Membrane scaffolding decreases the directionality of metal transport compared to a three-dimensional search of the metal ions. The domain I of CCS binds Cu through two cysteine residues. Since Cu binding affinity of CCS is less than that of SOD1 (which recruits three or four cysteine residues), Cu transport occurs from CCS to SOD1, and not the other way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banci et al., 2010</xref>). Zn binding, which occurs in the next step, stabilizes the loop regions. This event has a few important consequences. First, it has been shown that both CCS and SOD1 exhibit binding to Zn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Proescher, 2008</xref>). While the absence of Zn favors heterodimer formation with SOD1 (CCS-SOD1), the presence of Zn facilitates the homodimer (CCS-CCS) configuration. Second, as shown in this paper, Zn coordinated protein has little or minimum membrane binding and hence Zn bound SOD1 is removed from bi-layer. The third consequence comes from the reduced Zn affinity (which may come from a Zn compromised mutation or other reason for the sporadic forms of the disease), which would result in a misfolded membrane bound protein that is aggregation prone and potentially toxic.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The cofactor-derived membrane association model of SOD1 primary and gain of function.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61453-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As evident, the proposed scheme is somewhat Zn centric in which Cu coordination plays minimum role in the aggregation centric disease process. Partial support of this comes directly from the presented data of the distance dependence between ALS mutations sites and Cu. Also, the mutant proteins without Cu (but with Zn site coordinated, e.g. H121F or G37R) do not show aggregation, neither they induce toxicity as studied by our assay systems. Earlier works have also shown that Cu binding has no effect on SOD1 folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruns and Kopito, 2007</xref>). More importantly, it has been shown that CCS knock-out does not affect the onset of the disease or the life span in SOD1 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Subramaniam et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>It may be important to consider that, although more than 140 SOD1 mutants are known in ALS, the disease is predominantly sporadic. Nevertheless, the disease initiation may still be done by a metal free apo (or Zn free) configuration, which can be generated from the WT protein as a result of a different trigger (and not by a genetic factor). The results obtained from two ALS mutants (I113T and G37R) can be discussed in this context. The present data show that I113T is similar to a zinc deficient protein, with high affinity toward membrane and higher aggregation propensity. In contrast, G37R behaves more like a WT protein. A comparison between the disease phenotype show that I113T is the second most common ALS mutant with average survival of 4.3 years, while for G37R, the average survival increases to 17 years. These results are in excellent correlation with the presented scheme.</p><p>Another interesting correlation of the presented scheme comes from a result that Zn supplement with a moderate dose of 60 mg kg<sup>−1 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> can increase the days of survival in a transgenic mouse experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ermilova et al., 2005</xref>). Another approach could be using small molecules which would compete with the metal free protein towards membrane binding, an approach used recently in a Parkinson’s disease model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fonseca-Ornelas et al., 2014</xref>). While any drug development initiative targeting ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases suffer from the complications of diseases heterogeneity, poorly understood molecular mechanism and complex delivery avenues, a collaborative and integrative effort involving science and clinic, may be needed to find a successful solution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The membrane connection</title><p>The molecular mechanism associated with ALS induced toxicity has been extensively studied and widely debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broom, 2012</xref>). SOD1 aggregates have been found in ALS patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guareschi et al., 2012</xref>). Mutant SOD1 aggregates have been shown to transfer from cell to cell using a prion like propagation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Münch et al., 2011</xref>). It has also been shown that the aggregation induced toxicity of SOD1 variants can occur through its attachment on mitochondrial membrane surface in transgenic ALS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhai et al., 2009</xref>). In parallel, pore formation at the membrane and abnormal ion mobility have been found with SOD1 aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ray et al., 2004</xref>). Although the above reports directly link a membrane connection with SOD1 aggregation (and presumably with ALS)-unlike other neurodegenerative diseases like AD and PD, membrane-induced aggregation studies with SOD1 have been limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Shahmoradian and colleagues reported that the structure of Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s disease consists of α-synuclein and lipid vesicle clusters instead of the long-assumed amyloid fibril core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shahmoradian et al., 2019</xref>). Using correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), they show that the vast majority of Lewy bodies actually consist of clusters of various membranous compartments, instead of amyloid fibrils as previously assumed. Assembly of synaptic vesicles has been shown recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fusco et al., 2016</xref> in which two different regions of a protein molecule can be used as a ‘double anchor’ to induce the assembly. We think three particular finding can be discussed in this connection. First, the presented membrane deformation assay using GUV clearly shows the formation of vesicles assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) induced by apo<sub>aggm</sub> and H72F<sub>aggm</sub>. Second, for both protein variants, relatively small aggregates of the proteins (formed in the presence of the membrane) and not the large fibrilar network (formed in the absence of membrane), favored vesicles assemblies. Third, the smaller sized aggregates formed in the presence of membrane seemed to induce more toxicity than the fibrils (formed in the absence). From the above three considerations, it is easy to envision that the anchoring ability of the aggregates toward vesicles assembly would be more efficient for a small-sized aggregates when compared to a fibril. There is an increased interest in the role of the number and nature of membrane lipids in shaping the aggregation landscape of different proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. Given the prion-like propagation in these diseases, our work underscores how characterization of protein–lipid interactions could enhance our molecular understanding of cellular toxicity and enable the identification of therapeutic molecules to mitigate the damage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>SH-SY5Y</td><td>National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nccs.res.in/index.php/Nationalrepos/Repocellines">https://www.nccs.res.in/index.php/Nationalrepos/Repocellines</ext-link></td><td>Neuroblastoma cell line</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>H72F (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Clone used to generate H72F mutant (page 21)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>H121F (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Clone used to generate H72F mutant (page 21)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>I113T (plasmid)</td><td>Genscript</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>G37R (plasmid)</td><td>Genscript</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>G85R (plasmid)</td><td>Genscript</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>H72F_F</td><td>Biotech Desk</td><td>PCR primer</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">cctcactttaatcctctatccagaaaattcggtgggccaaagg</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>H72F_R</td><td>Biotech Desk</td><td>PCR primer</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">cctttggcccaccgaattttctggatagaggattaaagtgagg</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>H121F_F</td><td>Biotech Desk</td><td>PCR primer</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">ggccgcacactggtggtctttgaaaaagcagatgactt</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>H121F_R</td><td>Biotech Desk</td><td>PCR primer</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">aagtcatctgctttttcaaagaccaccagtgtgcggcc</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>QuickChange XL site directed mutagenesis kit</td><td>Agilent</td><td>Cat# 200516</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Vybrant MTT cell proliferation assay kit</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat# V-13154</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)</td><td>Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.</td><td>Cat# 850355</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE)</td><td>Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.</td><td>Cat# 850725</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS)</td><td>Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.</td><td>Cat# 840035</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Cardiolipin</td><td>Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.</td><td>Cat# 710335</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>1,1'-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiIC-18(3))</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat# D3911</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Isopropyl ß-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)</td><td>Sigma Aldrich</td><td>Cat# I6758</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Thioflavin T</td><td>Merck</td><td>Cat# T3516</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Calcein AM</td><td>Merck</td><td>Cat# 17783</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>OPM server</td><td>Orientations of Proteins in Membranes</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opm.phar.umich.edu/ppm_server">https://opm.phar.umich.edu/ppm_server</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>AGGRESCAN</td><td>AGGRESCAN</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinf.uab.es/aggrescan/">http://bioinf.uab.es/aggrescan/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Image J</td><td>National Institutes of Health</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat# A10254</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine(DOPE), phosphoinositol (PI),1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-<sc>l</sc>-serine (DOPS), and cardiolipin (CL) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc (Alabaster, AL). 1,1′-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiIC-18(3)) was purchased from Invitrogen (Eugene, OR).

After removing the excess liquid, the aggregates were rinsed with MilliQ water and then dried with a stream of nitrogen. Images were acquired at ambient temperature using a Bioscope Catalyst AFM (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA) with silicon probes. The standard tapping mode was used to image the morphology of aggregates. The nominal spring constant of the cantilever was kept at 20–80 N/m. The spring constant was calibrated by a thermal tuning method. A standard scan rate of 0.5 Hz with 512 samples per line was used for imaging the samples.

For the measurement of membrane-induced protein aggregation, WT and other protein variants were incubated in lipid/protein ratio 2:1 under the treatment of TCEP. Aliquots were thereafter subjected to ThT addition and fluorescence measurements were taken using an integration time of 0.3 s.

Calcein-loaded liposomes were separated from non-encapsulated (free) calcein by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column (Sigma) using an elution buffer of 10 mM MOPS, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), and lipid concentrations were estimated by complexation with ammonium ferro-thiocyanate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stewart, 1980</xref>). Fluorescence was measured at room temperature (25°C) in a PTI spectro-fluorometer using a 1 cm path length cuvette. The excitation wavelength was 490 nm and emission was set at 520 nm. Excitation and emission slits with a nominal bandpass of 3 and 5 nm were used, respectively. The high concentration (10 mM) of the entrapped calcein led to self-quenching of its fluorescence resulting in low fluorescence intensity of the vesicles (I<sub>B</sub>). Release of calcein caused by addition of proteins aggregates led to the dilution of the dye into the medium, which could therefore be monitored by an enhancement of fluorescence intensity (I<sub>F</sub>). This enhancement of fluorescence is a measure of the extent of vesicle permeabilization. The experiments were normalized relative to the total fluorescence intensity (I<sub>T</sub>) corresponding to the total release of calcein after complete disruption of all the vesicles by addition of Triton X-100 (2% v/v). The percentage of calcein release in the presence of different aggregates of SOD1 protein species was calculated using the equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benachir et al., 1997</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>I<sub>B</sub></italic> is the background (self-quenched) intensity of calcein encapsulated in vesicles, <italic>I<sub>F</sub></italic> represents the enhanced fluorescence intensity resulting from the dilution of dye in the medium caused by protein-aggregate-induced release of entrapped calcein<italic>.

Briefly, 20 μL of a 1 mM lipid (DOPC:DOPE:PI:DOPS:CL in the ratio 4.5:2.5:1:0.5:1.5) solution in chloroform was spread onto the surfaces of two conductive glasses (coated with Fluor Tin Oxide), which were then placed with their conductive sides facing each other. These droplets were allowed to dry overnight in a closed chamber containing saturated solution of NaCl. This is to avoid complete drying of the droplets. The hydration of these droplets facilitates electroformation process. Electroformation chamber was made using Teflon spacer of thickness ∼2 mm. This electro swelling chamber was filled with 0.1 M sucrose solution and branched to an alternating power generator at 1.5 V and 15 Hz frequency during 2 hr at room temperature (22–25°C). The vesicles solution was then carefully transferred to an eppendorf vial and kept at rest at 4°C before use. The average diameter of the GUV obtained was 10–100 μm. For single GUV imaging, we selected the GUV of size ~30 μm for eliminating the effect of curvature. GUVs were diluted in 0.1 M glucose and prepared in 1 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), for observation. A typical observation experiment, using an inverted microscope, was made in an observation chamber by mixing 30 μL of the GUV solution with 100 μL of a 0.1 M glucose solution. The slight density difference between the inner and outer solutions drives the vesicles to settle at the bottom of the slide and provides better contrast while observing under phase contrast.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-14"><title>Phase contrast optical microscopy</title><p>For the microscopy experiment, 5 μM concentrations of protein aggregates of different variants were dissolved in the glucose solution prepared in 1 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) were added to the vesicle solution.

The chamber was then closed immediately for observation under phase-contrast microscope after placing the samples. Response of individual GUV when exposed to the protein aggregates solution was continuously recorded with time using a CCD camera. Images were analyzed using the image analysis software, Image J. A straight line was drawn across the GUV to obtain an intensity profile. Peak to peak intensity (I<sub>ptp</sub>) across the halo region was calculated. Average I<sub>ptp</sub> was obtained from several line profiles across the GUV. The time in second versus I<sub>ptp</sub> was plotted in order to observe any significant change in the intensity profile of the GUV. We have calculated the I<sub>ptp</sub> values for at least three different GUVs treated with different aggregate species and averaged the values to calculate the deformation rate constant (λ, sec<sup>−1</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-15"><title>Cell culture and cytotoxicity assay</title><p>Neuroblastoma cell lines SHSY5Y were acquired from the national cell repository (National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India).

Briefly, the model assigns binary variables of <italic>1</italic> or <italic>0</italic> for folded or unfolded status of residues, respectively. We employ a version of the model that accounts of single-stretches of folded blocks (single-sequence approximation), two stretches of folded blocks (double-sequence approximation [DSA]) and DSA allowing for interactions across the folded islands if they are interacting in the folded structure. The 151-residue protein SOD1 is therefore reduced to a collection of 49 sequential blocks on assuming a block length of 3 thus reducing the number of microstates from &gt;42,700,000 (in the residue-level version of the model) to 461,826. The energetics of the model involves van der Waals interactions identified with a 6 Å heavy-atom cut-off, all-to-all Debye–Hückel electrostatics, and simplified solvation (defined by the heat capacity change per native contact of) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Naganathan, 2012</xref>). Residues identified to be fully folded are assigned an entropic penalty of −13.6 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup> per residue (ΔS<sub>conf</sub>). The apo form of SOD1 is simulated by assigning an excess conformational entropy of −19.7 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1 </sup>per residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rajasekaran et al., 2016</xref>) for the stretches of residues 49–82 (loop IV, Zn binding loop) and 121–142 (loop VII, Cu binding loop), as reported from NMR order parameter measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sekhar et al., 2015</xref>). To simulate order in either one or both the loops, the conformational entropy of residues in the loop is modified to −13.6 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup> per residue (i.e. a lower penalty for folding), thus mimicking the variants of SOD1 (Zn bound, Cu bound, and Holo forms). The van der Waals interaction energies are fixed to −35.9, –38.2, −42.2, and −48.9 J mol<sup>−1</sup> for the Holo, Zn bound, Cu bound, and apo variants, respectively, to simulate iso-stability conditions at 298 K. The heat capacity change per native contact is fixed to −0.36 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup> per native contact. All prolines are assigned an entropic penalty of zero to account for their rigidity. Residue probabilities and folding mechanism as a function of the number of structured blocks are predicted at iso-stability conditions (i.e. a stability 25 kJ mol<sup>−1 </sup>at 298 K) following established protocols by accumulating partial partition functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Orientations of proteins in membranes</title><p>To gain an insight as to how the WT and metal starved variants of SOD1 interact with membrane, we resorted to computational approaches.

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Mutation of the superoxide dismutase is implicated in motor neuron disease. The enzyme contains both zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) as cofactors. The role that either Zn or Cu play in membrane association and disease-causing aggregation of superoxide dismutase is currently unclear. The authors apply site-directed mutagenesis to generate Zn-only and Cu-only binding mutants of the enzyme and untangle the effect that the binding of each cofactor has on membrane association and aggregation. Through application of a large set of complementary techniques, involving statistical mechanical modelling, fluorescence and infra-red spectroscopy, and optical and atomic force microscopy, the authors show that deficiency of Zn uptake, induced by mutation, is a major driving force for toxic aggregation of superoxide dismutase.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Metal cofactor zinc and interacting membranes modulate SOD1 conformation-aggregation landscape in an in vitro ALS Model&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Erdinc Sezgin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another. They acknowledge the integrated approach taken by you and your co-authors and the amount of data presented and discussed. However, the reviewers raise major concerns regarding both experiments and computer simulations. Not all conclusions are justified by the data presented and additional data are required. We ask you to revise your manuscript in light of the reviewers' concerns.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.

The authors combine mutagenesis experiments with a variety of techniques, involving tryptophan fluorescence, FTIR, AFM, Tht fluorescence, FCS, optical microscopy and computer simulation. They arrive at that conclusion that conformational change and site-specific metal binding modulate membrane insertion and aggregation of SOD1.</p><p>Identifying the origins of SOD1 dysfunction and aggregation can have important implications in the development of therapeutic strategies for motor neuron disease. The underlying molecular biology is not well understood. The study by Sannigrahi et al. is an integrated approach involving an impressive number of complementary methods. However, the conclusions put forward are not sufficiently supported by the data presented. The applied methodologies yield data of insufficient resolution to draw the detailed molecular picture presented. Additional experimental work would be required to substantiate or provide evidence for the findings.</p><p>1. The statistical mechanical model (WSME) is coarse-grained. It e.g. considers three consecutive amino acid residues as a block. It is therefore of limited suitability to study the effects of single-point mutations and metal-binding or conformation and aggregation.</p><p>2. The effect of mutation and Zn/Cu-binding on Trp fluorescence spectral properties of SOD1 is marginal (Figure 2a). Likewise, the far-UV CD spectra shown in supporting information show marginal changes. The broad spectral characteristics of far-UV CD defies an accurate, quantitative deconvolution of secondary structure content. No solid conclusions concerning a conformational change can thus be inferred. FTIR spectra are broad and smooth (i.e. lack significant sub-structure) (Figure 2b, c). Their deconvolution in seven discrete sub-states appears ambitious and error-prone.</p><p>3. The authors propose to determine membrane affinities of SOD1 and mutants thereof by applying extrinsic fluorescence modification and by measuring binding to artificial micelles using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (analysis of diffusion time constants). Extrinsic fluorescence labels are hydrophobic compounds and supposedly tend to strongly interact with membrane lipids. This will provides an artificial bias of conjugates to micelle membranes. Control experiments are required to rule out effects of the labels.</p><p>4. The influence of mutation on stability and conformation of SOD1 is unclear. Mutations H72F and H121F, introduced to alter metal binding, may as well have effects on stability and conformation (folding) of the entire domain, irrespective of the metal-bound/unbound state. Mutation itself may lead to unfolding and aggregation. Mutation of a histidine to a phenylalanine, as applied by the authors, may have disruptive effects on protein structure because a small side chain is replaced by a larger one. Thermal and/or chemical denaturation experiments, carried out on isolated protein material and mutants thereof, and their analysis are required to assess the effect of mutations on folding and stability.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Sannigrahi et al. studied the role of metal binding sites of SOD1 on its aggregation and toxicity. They created a Zn only, Cu only binding mutants as well as Zn/Cu binding-deficient mutant. Zn bearing mutant behaved similarly as wild type protein in terms of membrane binding, aggregate formation and toxicity, while Zn/Cu deficient mutant behaved similarly to Cu bearing (no Zn) mutant. They conclude that Zn binding pocket is crucial to keep the protein in healthy state and in the absence of Zn binding, protein aggregates especially in the presence of membranes. Lastly, they investigated real disease mutations and samples two mutations with different degree of Zn binding, and confirmed the same trend; if the Zn binding pocket is influenced, mutation is more severe.</p><p>I am not an expert of this particular biological question (ALS and role of SOD1), but I evaluated the technical aspects of the manuscript.</p><p>In general, the manuscript is well written, the messages are clear and the conclusions are supported by data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper looks at the effect of metal cofactor binding on the aggregation and toxicity of SOD1, which natively binds a Cu2+ and a Zn2+ ion. The authors investigate the WT SOD1, the apo SOD1 and two mutants which do not bind Cu2+ (H121F) or Zn2+ (H72F) in order to look at the effects of the metal binding on SOD aggregation and toxicity. They find by a number of assays and a computational study that Zn2+ rather than Cu2+ is the dominant factor in determining susceptibility to aggregation, membrane binding, etc. Based on this they propose that deficient Zn2+ uptake by SOD1 is responsible for the pathogenic behaviour of some mutants.</p><p>There is a lot of interesting data in this paper supporting this hypothesis (some more so than others), however there are some points the authors should consider:</p><p>1. A potential weakness of the computational estimation of membrane binding affinity is that the WT crystal structure was used for WT, while structure predictions from the I-TASSER server were used for apo and Cu/Zn-deficient mutants. Since one might expect the predicted structure to be of lower quality, it might then have an enhanced propensity for membrane binding via exposed hydrophobic groups? What would be obtained if the I-TASSER server was also used to generate the structure used for WT in this calculation? This point also applies to the computational validation where predicted membrane binding free energies are compared with distance to the Zn2+ or Cu2+ site of the mutants. This again involves a 2-stage prediction – firstly of the mutant structure, then of its binding energy. Maybe the authors can give some intuition as to how this can be sufficiently accurate to be useful?</p><p>2. Correlation functions for A488-SOD1 are shown are at the extremes of no SUVs versus a high concentration of SUVs. What happens at intermediate concentrations where there would be more of a mix of bound and unbound populations – can the two components be clearly resolved in the log-linear plots of G(tau)?</p><p>3. I may have missed something, but why does the population of membrane-bound protein saturate at much less than 100%? Is there a baseline parameter for the population at high [DPPC SUV] in addition to Ka? One thing that occurred to me is that membrane binding may quench the fluorescence somewhat, so the amplitude of the membrane-bound population may be lower than it should be, hence this effect; and the differences in folding/misfolding of the SOD mutants may lead to different binding to the SUVs which would in turn affect the relative amplitudes of the two components. This wouldn't affect the fit of the sigmoidal curves, but maybe the relative fraction of slowly diffusing component should not be literally interpreted in terms of a bound population. Rather than &quot;population membrane bound&quot; Figure 2f could say &quot;Fraction bound fluorescence&quot; or similar? This interpretation would support the authors' contention that H72F is more apo-like and H121F more holo-like.</p><p>4. The differences in the ratio Ksvm/Ksv are basically reflecting differences in Ksv, because the values of Ksvm are all very similar. Thus it may reflect more the differences in non membrane-bound protein than differences in membrane binding, as seems to be the inference in the paper?</p><p>5. The finding of change in secondary structure on membrane binding based on IR data, in particular increase in alpha-helical population, for the apo form and the H72F, is very interesting and strongly supports differences in membrane interaction between WT/H121F and apo/H72F – maybe this data should be included in the main text rather than the SI in fact? To me this seems a more noteworthy change than the modest differences in membrane association constants obtained from FCS.</p><p>6. Aggregation was studied for the reduced form of the disulfides. The authors should motivate why the aggregation is studies using the reduced form of the protein while the prior work in the paper used the oxidized form (I believe?). My knowledge in this area is limited so I'm not sure which is the form more relevant to observed pathologies.</p><p>7. A complicating factor in the perturbation of GUV membranes by the aggregates formed with/without SUVs present is the SUVs themselves. Presumably there is a significant SUV concentration in the aliquots taken from the aggregation reaction – could the SUVs rather than differences in the aggregates be responsible for the difference in the effect on GUVs? A control could be to add just SUVs to the GUV samples.</p><p>8. For the validation, a statistical test should be used to demonstrate the significance of the observed correlations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61453.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Sannigrahi et al. report the investigation of structural determinants of membrane insertion and aggregation of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), an enzyme that is implicated in motor neuron disease.

We appreciate the careful and detailed comments by the reviewer, and we have included additional details (including new data and characterization), which we believe significantly improves the clarity and robustness of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The WSME model in its current version is not suitable to study the role of single-point mutations. We could use the conventional version with every residue as a folding unit but that increases the number of conformations to 42.7 million, compared to ~450,000 in the 3-residue block representation. In order to not over interpret we have used the WSME model as a starting point to explore the folding landscape of SOD1 and the differences in folding mechanism, if any, from the model by simulating the presence of different ions and in their absence – note that this simulation derives directly from NMR order parameters and hence constrained by experiment on the regions of the protein that rigidify on ion-binding. These predictions are then tested directly via experiments in the rest of the manuscript. We therefore do not use the model to study aggregation or the effect of single point mutations on aggregation, but only to obtain initial insights into the folding conformational landscape, which can be verified by experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We agree with the reviewer that the change is small between mutant proteins, when a particular method is considered, like fluorescence or CD. This is exactly why we used a combination of multiple techniques to support our inference. For example, we agree with the reviewer that the change in tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the mutants is small (Figure 2a). However, several repeat experiments (three different experiments using freshly prepared samples with three repeats for each experiment) confirmed that while the change is small, it is reproducible. We substantiated the change in steady state fluorescence experiments with acrylamide quenching measurements, which showed reproducible and significant change in the solvent surface exposure of the single tryptophan residue of the mutants (Table 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><p>To avoid over-interpretation, where we discussed the steady state fluorescence measurements, we only mentioned the cases of WT and apo, where the changes are significantly more. The two mutants were mentioned for their change in Ksv values. Please refer to the following sentences at the Result section of the manuscript:</p><p>“Steady state fluorescence maxima in combination with acrylamide quenching data suggested an appreciable conformational alteration in going from the WT to the apo form. Interestingly, Zn-starved H72F mutant showed higher <italic>K<sub>sv</sub></italic> compared to Cu-starved H121F mutant (Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Table 2).”</p><p>Similarly, while the change in far UV CD in our measurements is small, it follows the trends observed by other techniques. It may be noted that we did not use the CD data for the estimation of the secondary structure contents. For a complimentary measurement of the CD, and to provide an estimation of the secondary structure contents, we used FT-IR data. We apologize as we have not provided in the previous version sufficient information about the analyses of the FT-IR data, which is now supplied. We have analyzed FT-IR data using two steps. First, we have determined the second derivatives of the FT-IR data (Figure 2—figure supplement 5). The peak regions were chosen from the second derivatives. In the second step, we used these peak positions to fit the original FT-IR data to calculate the percentage of the secondary structures. It may be noted that this method of fitting FT-IR data is already published (DOI:10.1111/j.17457270.2007.00320.x;DOI:10.1111/j.174570.2007.00320.x,DOI:10.1038/nprot.2015.0 24). Also, the percentage of the secondary structure determined for WT SOD1 using this method matches well with data published by others with the same protein (DOI: 10.1111/j.17457270.2007.00320.x, DOI: 10.1039/d0cb00203h).</p><p>We reemphasize that while the change in a particular spectroscopic property is small but reproducible for protein variants between these two groups (apo, Zn deficient mutant vs WT, Cu deficient mutant), the trend has been found identical when we used different techniques (like steady state fluorescence emission, fluorescence quenching, far UV CD and FT-IR). In addition, the trend continues to remain valid when we proceed through the rest of the paper (for example, membrane binding, aggregation propensity etc).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In the previous version, we have provided data of FCS experiments to determine the binding constants of the alexa-488 maleimide labeled protein variants with DPPC vesicles. This is a standard method of estimation of binding constants between protein and lipid vesicles as reported earlier</p><p>(doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bpj.2010.07.056">10.1016/j.bpj.2010.07.056)</ext-link>. We assumed that since the label is identical for all protein variants, the change induced by the label will be similar for all variants. However, we do agree with the concerns raised by the reviewer. To address the reviewer’s concern and to provide complementary data, we have now measured the tryptophan fluorescence of SOD1 variants with increasing concentrations of DPPC SUVs. From the gradual enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence due to lipid binding, we calculated the binding affinities of all protein variants towards membrane which showed comparable binding constants as obtained from our FCS experiments. We have added additional figures as Figure 2—figure supplement 7b,c.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The influence of mutation on stability and conformation of SOD1 is unclear.

We have modified the binding affinity in the revised version of the manuscript.

My knowledge in this area is limited so I'm not sure which is the form more relevant to observed pathologies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In its mature form, SOD1 is a highly stable, homodimeric protein, with each subunit binding one catalytic copper ion and one structural zinc ion, and containing one intramolecular disulfide bond as well as two non-conserved free cysteines. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that various immature, destabilized forms of SOD1 are prone to aggregate, and this is often enhanced by disease-associated mutations (Stathopulos PB, et al. 2003. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7021–7026; Karch CM, Prudencio M, Winkler DD, Hart PJ, Borchelt DR 2009Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106:7774– 7779). Recently, much attentions has been focused on aggregation of the most immature form of SOD1, in which the disulfide bonds are reduced (DOI:10.1021/acschemneuro.7b00162). Studies of various mutant-SOD1 ALS mice models have shown that small, soluble, misfolded forms of reduced apo SOD1 are enriched in the spinal cord and may be the common cytotoxic species that cause ALS (Wang J, et al. (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106:1392–1397; Zetterstrom P, et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:14157–14162). In addition, cell culture studies suggest that ALS associated mutations can promote disulfide bond reduction and metal loss (Tiwari A, Hayward LJ (2003) Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutants of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase are susceptible to disulfide reduction. J Biol Chem 278:5984–5992.). Relatively little is known, though, about the properties of reduced apo SOD1, and how mutations affect these properties. Therefore, in this work we investigated in details the aggregation and toxicity of SOD1 protein variants in their disulfide reduced form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
