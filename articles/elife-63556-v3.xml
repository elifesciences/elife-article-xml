Spermiogenesis represents a late stage during spermatogenesis, in which post-meiotic round spermatids differentiate into mature spermatozoa by condensation of the spermatid DNA and formation of the sperm head and tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Donnell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Donnell et al., 2011</xref>). Spermatozoa are then released into the lumen of seminiferous tubules, in a process called spermiation, which involves the remodeling and reduction of cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">França et al., 2016</xref>). Even though these processes are crucial for male reproduction, they are poorly understood due to lack of knowledge on spermiation molecular mechanisms.</p><p>The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays important roles in male reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richburg et al., 2014</xref>) with a testis-specific version of the proteasome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kniepert and Groettrup, 2014</xref>). Indeed, the ubiquitination of proteins in cells of the testis is required for functional spermatogenesis including spermiogenesis, and multiple steps during the progression of spermatogonial stem cells to mature spermatozoa critically depend on the UPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richburg et al., 2014</xref>). The UPS pathway is critically dependent upon E3 ubiquitin ligases, which provide substrate specificity by selecting target proteins for ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Metzger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pickart, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The X-linked gene <italic>Rlim</italic> (also known as <italic>Rnf12</italic>) encodes a RING H2 type E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Metzger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joazeiro and Weissman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 1999</xref>). While <italic>Rlim</italic> mRNA is widely expressed in many organs and cell types, RLIM protein is more selectively detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ostendorff et al., 2006</xref>). In cells RLIM shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Nuclear translocation is regulated by phosphorylation, and in many cell types RLIM is primarily detected in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiao et al., 2013</xref>), where it controls not only levels and dynamics of various proteins and protein complexes involved in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ostendorff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krämer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Güngör et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gontan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Her and Chung, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), but also its own expression via autoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ostendorff et al., 2002</xref>). In female mice, <italic>Rlim</italic> functions as a major epigenetic regulator of nurturing tissues. RLIM promotes the survival of milk-producing alveolar cells in mammary glands of pregnant and lactating females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiao et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, RLIM is crucial for imprinted X chromosome inactivation (iXCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gontan et al., 2018</xref>), the epigenetic silencing of one X chromosome in placental trophoblast cells early during female embryogenesis to achieve X dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Payer, 2016</xref>). Indeed, due to inhibited placental trophoblast development, the deletion of a maternally inherited <italic>Rlim</italic> allele results in peri-implantation lethality specifically of females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, males systemically lacking <italic>Rlim</italic> appear to develop normally, are born at Mendelian ratios and are fertile as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report high and dynamic <italic>Rlim</italic> mRNA and protein expression in the testis of male mice, where expression of RLIM protein is highly detected in round spermatids during spermiogenesis as well as in Sertoli cells. Indeed, we show that <italic>Rlim</italic> is required for the generation of normal sperm numbers with normal sperm cytoplasmic volume. Even though Sertoli cells are known to regulate cytoplasmic reduction in spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Donnell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Donnell et al., 2011</xref>), our genetic analyses reveal that this activity is mediated by <italic>Rlim</italic> expressed in the spermatogenic cell lineage. These results assign important functions of <italic>Rlim</italic> during spermiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rlim expression in testis is highly regulated</title><p>To investigate potential functions of <italic>Rlim</italic> in mice in addition to XCI, we examined mRNA expression in various tissues isolated from adult mice via Northern blots. <italic>Rlim</italic> mRNA was detected in many tissues with highest levels in testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ostendorff et al., 2000</xref>). However, while the <italic>Rlim</italic>-encoding mRNA in most tissues migrated around 7.5 kb, a variant band at 2.4 kb was detected in testis. Based on published RNA-seq data sets on mouse testes isolated at various post-partum stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Margolin et al., 2014</xref>), mapping of reads to the <italic>Rlim</italic> locus revealed relatively homogenously distribution over all exons in 6–20 days post-partum (dpp) animals. However, most of the reads in sexually mature (38 dpp) animals mapped in exonic regions upstream of the TGA Stop codon, encompassing the 5’ non-coding region and the entire open-reading frame (ORF), while most of the 3’ noncoding region was underrepresented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Indeed, consistent with the length of the observed variant <italic>Rlim</italic> mRNA, closer examination the <italic>Rlim</italic> cDNA sequence revealed a consensus alternative polyadenylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Proudfoot, 2011</xref>) starting 69 bp downstream of the TGA Stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, in mature mouse testes a short, variant <italic>Rlim</italic> RNA is generated by alternative polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A short Rlim mRNA variant highly expressed in testis is generated via alternative polyadenylation in mature male mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A Northern blot containing RNA extracts from various adult mouse tissues (WT for <italic>Rlim</italic>) was hybridized with an <italic>Rlim</italic> probe (upper panel) and a probe recognizing β-actin as loading control (lower panel).

Consistent with our mRNA analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), western blots on protein extracts of testis, brain, and spleen confirmed high expression of full-length RLIM protein in testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on testes sections, we detected strong immunoreactivity in specific regions of some seminiferous tubules, representing differentiating spermatogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, we detected single RLIM-positive cells at the periphery of all tubules. Consistent with published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), little to no RLIM staining was detected in males carrying a Sox2-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi et al., 2002</xref>) – mediated conditional knockout of the <italic>Rlim</italic> gene (cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup>), as these animals lack RLIM in somatic tissues as well as the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). Lack of RLIM protein in testes of cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> animals was confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Because high RLIM levels appeared to be expressed at specific stages during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we performed co-staining using an antibody against peanut agglutinin (PNA) that stains acrosomal structures allowing staging of spermatogenic cells within seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kotaja et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oakberg, 1956a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oakberg, 1956b</xref>). Around seminiferous stage II / III, RLIM levels are detectable but low in all spermatogenic cells, including post-meiotic step 2/3 spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, indicated by RLIM/PNA co-staining, RLIM levels are high in step 6–8 round spermatids (stages VI–VIII), a mid-timepoint in spermiogenesis before spermatids begin to elongate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Donnell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qian et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, RLIM protein levels are low in step 1–5 spermatids, dramatically upregulated in step 6–8 spermatids, and then downregulated in elongating spermatids at step 10 prior to their release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Donnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We noted that the nuclei of RLIM-positive cells located at the periphery of seminiferous tubules displayed a triangular shape characteristic for Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To identify this RLIM-positive cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we performed IHC, co-staining with antibodies against RLIM and the Sertoli cell marker GATA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yomogida et al., 1994</xref>). Positive co-staining identified these cells as Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Thus, we performed RNA-seq experiments on RNA isolated from total testis of 8-week-old animals, comparing global gene expression in cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> and fl/Y male littermates. These experiments including library construction, sequencing, and data processing were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with findings that attribute both positive and negative functions of RLIM for gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gontan et al., 2012</xref>), statistical analyses revealed 118 down-regulated and 83 up-regulated genes (threshold p&lt;0.05) in cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Gene ontology analyses revealed that functions of these genes fell mostly in eight categories with around half of all differentially expressed genes involved in signaling (27.5%) and regulation of metabolism (22.5%), in particular regulatory functions on lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Other genes are involved in transcription/chromatin (14%), cell organization (6%), transport (6%) or the UPS (3%), while 9.5% of gene functions occupy multiple other cellular pathways. Around 10.5% of transcripts constituted non-coding (nc) RNAs. No major differences in functions between up- and down-regulated genes were detected in cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> testes. Combined, these results suggest functions of <italic>Rlim</italic> during spermatogenesis.</p><p>Next, we investigated the characteristics and functionality of sperm isolated from the Cauda of 8-week-old males via swim-out. Indeed, cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> sperm displayed elevated rates of morphological abnormalities, including coiled midpieces and head malformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). However, the sperm capacitation-induced phosphorylation pathways, acrosomal status and induced acrosome reaction in <italic>Rlim</italic> KO sperm were similar to controls as judged by western blot and PNA staining, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>), indicating that the deletion of <italic>Rlim</italic> did not affect general signaling. To examine sperm motility, we used CEROS computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) in swim-out experiments at T0 and after 60 min (T60) under conditions that allow capacitation comparing cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> males with fl/Y littermates. The results revealed significant motility deficiencies of cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> sperm. Indeed, cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> sperm displayed decreased total motility, and out of the total motile sperm the percentages of sperm with progressive motility was lower, while the percentages of slow and weakly motile sperm populations were higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Thus, cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> sperm is less motile. Next, we tested for possible functional consequences of these deficiencies during in vitro fertilization (IVF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>), using oocytes originating from WT females and sperm isolated from either fl/Y or cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> littermates. In these experiments, the numbers of oocytes and sperm cells were adjusted to 100–150 and 100,000, respectively, to achieve fertilization rates of around 80% for the control samples as judged by the number of embryos reaching cleavage stage 24 hr after adding sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). The development of IVF embryos was monitored up to (96 hr) at which point blastocyst stage was reached by the majority of embryos generated by control sperm. Indeed, sperm isolated from fl/Y control animals yielded in 84.3% cleavage stage and 77% blastocyst stage embryos, compared to 67.0% and 46.8% for cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> sperm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>).

We isolated 40–45 Mio cauda swim-out sperm each of 3 fl/Y and 5 cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> animals, and polar metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results showed that, unexpectedly, 66 metabolites were significantly more abundant in the cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> sperm, in particular levels of many amino acids, in contrast to only five metabolites that displayed lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Analyses of these diverse metabolites did not yield in the identification of a specific energy production pathway but rather revealed that metabolite intermediates of many cellular pathways are increased in the <italic>Rlim</italic> cKO sperm, suggesting a more general problem. Thus, we included electron microscopy (EM) in our analyses. Interrogating sperm via scanning EM (SEM) revealed significantly more <italic>Rlim</italic> cKO/Y<sup>Sox2-Cre</sup> sperm displaying cytoplasmic droplets in the midpiece, and these droplets were also increased in size as measured using ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>).

In contrast, no significant effects on testes weights and sperm numbers were measured in cKO/Y<sup>Sf1-Cre</sup> animals.

The appearance of a variant mRNA in males coincides with sexual maturation, suggesting that this form is predominantly expressed in differentiating round spermatids, which express high levels of RLIM protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and, because <italic>Rlim</italic> acts in the spermatogenic cell lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), also coincides with the exertion of its in vivo function in males. Indeed, alternative mRNAs display different time of synthesis, mRNA stability and/or translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>). At the protein level, we find RLIM expression in spermatogenic cells is post-meiotically upregulated from low levels in step three spermatids to high levels peaking in round spermatids at step 6–8 and then downregulated again in elongating step nine spermatids and thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, <italic>Rlim</italic> joins many X-linked genes that are reactivated after meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>) and it is tempting to speculate that this reactivation is connected with the occurrence of the alternative <italic>Rlim</italic> mRNA. Moreover, the downregulation of RLIM in elongating spermatocytes coincides with a change in transcriptional and chromatin dynamics at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>). Even though <italic>Rlim</italic> is X-linked, the finding that the RLIM protein is detected in most/all round spermatids, including those that presumably harbor a Y chromosome, is explained by the fact that cytoplasmic bridges exist between spermatids and that RLIM efficiently shuttles between nuclei in heterokaryon cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our RNA-seq analyses indicate that many genes are affected in testes lacking <italic>Rlim</italic> influencing various cellular functions including signaling and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As <italic>Rlim</italic> regulates transcriptional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ostendorff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krämer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Güngör et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gontan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Her and Chung, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), it is thus likely that many of the differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>) might be affected indirectly. Because the vast majority of cells in the testis reflect spermatogenic cells, where <italic>Rlim</italic> exerts its functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), many differentially expressed genes reflect those expressed in this cell lineage and therefore may collectively contribute to the observed <italic>Rlim</italic> KO phenotypes in testes. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that subtle and hence undetected changes in testicular cell types in mice lacking <italic>Rlim</italic> may contribute to the observed differences in gene expression as well as testes weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Sperm produced by males lacking <italic>Rlim</italic> is dysfunctional with decreased motility and increased cytoplasm and head abnormalities. Because excess cytoplasm affects sperm motility, morphology including head morphology as well as fertilization potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cooper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rengan et al., 2012</xref>), and the cytoplasmic volume is regulated during spermiogenesis just after RLIM protein is highly detected in spermatids, it is likely that the increased cytoplasmic volume is responsible for much of the defects detected in sperm lacking <italic>Rlim.</italic> Moreover, as the midpiece cytoplasm is particularly important for sperm osmoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cooper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rengan et al., 2012</xref>), an increased size of cytoplasmic droplets is predicted to render sperm more vulnerable to osmotic challenges, which may ultimately lead to midpiece rupturing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, while the finding of increased metabolite content in cKO sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) suggests defective cytoplasmic reduction during spermiation even though major defects were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), it is likely that the some of the increase in cytoplasmic size might have occurred in released sperm after spermiation. In this context, an increased sperm cytoplasm has been associated with higher activities of specific enzymes of the energy pathway including G6PDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitken et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>), which diverts glucose metabolism away from glycolysis toward the pentose pathway. It is thus tempting to speculate that increased G6PDH activity might be partially responsible for the decreased Acetyl-CoA levels measured in sperm lacking <italic>Rlim</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Our combined data suggests that inefficient cytoplasmic reduction during spermiogenesis/spermiation renders <italic>Rlim</italic> KO sperm vulnerable to adequately adjust to the changing environment that occurs during transit through the epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gervasi and Visconti, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sullivan and Saez, 2013</xref>) leading to functional defects.</p><p>Concerning the cell type of <italic>Rlim</italic> action, RLIM protein is detected in spermatogenic cells specifically in round spermatids, in Sertoli cells and in epididymal epithelial cells. Our combined data reveals that lack of RLIM specifically in round spermatids is responsible for much of the observed sperm phenotype. This is demonstrated by targeting the <italic>Rlim</italic> cKO via Ngn3-Cre in the spermatogenic cell lineage, resulting in defective spermiogenesis, and similar sperm phenotypes when compared to the systemic <italic>Rlim</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). In contrast, targeting the <italic>Rlim</italic> cKO via Sf1-Cre to Sertoli cells failed to induce a testis/sperm phenotype and providing strong evidence that <italic>Rlim</italic> in Sertoli cells is not involved in the regulation of spermiogenesis provided by this cell type. Thus, while we cannot exclude minor functions of <italic>Rlim</italic> in Sertoli cells and possibly also epididymal epithelial cells, our results provide strong evidence that <italic>Rlim</italic> in round spermatids is required for normal spermiogenesis. Therefore, <italic>Rlim</italic> adds to a very limited number of genes in the spermatogenic cell lineage that regulate the cytoplasmic reduction/droplet size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mikolcevic et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Considering early lethality of female mouse embryos with a maternally transmitted <italic>Rlim</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shin et al., 2010</xref>), mathematical modeling of this exclusively female phenotype indicates that a deleterious mutation in the <italic>Rlim</italic> gene would shift selective evolutionary pressure entirely on females leading to a gender bias toward males in a mouse population over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiao et al., 2012</xref>). Because gender biases in mouse populations represent an unfavorable strategy for reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamilton, 1967</xref>), it is likely that the observed functions of <italic>Rlim</italic> during male reproduction will contribute to counter-act gender biases induced by its female function.</p><p>In summary, our data provide first evidence that in addition to crucial epigenetic functions in female embryogenesis and reproduction, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RLIM also occupies important roles during the reproduction of male mice.

Tissues were dissected and immediately immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Na Cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2 for 60 min at RT. The samples were rinsed three times in the same fixation buffer and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hr at room temperature. Samples were then washed three times with ddH<sub>2</sub>O for 10 min, and in block stained with a 1% Uranyl Acetate aqueous solution (w/v) at 6°C overnight. After three rinses in ddH2O the samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series of 20% increments, before two changes in 100% ethanol. Samples were then infiltrated first with two changes of 100% Propylene Oxide and then with a 50%/50% propylene oxide / SPI-Pon 812 resin mixture. The following day 5 changes of fresh 100% SPI-Pon 812 resin were done before the samples were polymerized at 68°C in flat embedding molds. The samples were then reoriented, and thin sections (approximately 70 nm) were placed on copper support grids and contrasted with Lead citrate and Uranyl acetate. Sections were examined using the a CM10 TEM with 100Kv accelerating voltage, and images were captured using a Gatan TEM CCD camera.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to M Krykbaeva, L Huang, A Schlueter, G Pazour, J Shin and E Torres for advice and/or experimental help.

after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Deficient spermatogenesis and sperm maturation in mice lacking <italic>Rlim</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we cannot proceed with the current form of the manuscript.</p><p>Your manuscript revisits the effect of <italic>RLIM</italic> deficiency on male fertility. Previously, your work showed that <italic>Rlim</italic> deletion has no obvious effect on male fertility (Shin et al., 2010), but the current study shows expression of a testis-specific <italic>Rlim</italic> transcript variant with a shorter 3' UTR and more detailed study shows that KO males have smaller testes, epididymides, fewer sperm, more frequent morphological abnormalities, lower motility, and aberrant gene expression. Furthermore, embryos generated from in vitro fertilisation using <italic>Rlim</italic> KO sperm progress to blasts at a lower rate.</p><p>These are interesting observations, but all reviewers find the study to be on the preliminary side and all agree that a characterization of mechanism would be required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers pointed out a number of additional technical issues that would need to be addressed. We recognize that you might be able to perform additional work to shed light on mechanism and address technical concerns. We would ordinarily only proceed to a revised manuscript if the amount of work required for revision can be managed in 1-2 months. In this case, we feel that much more than 2 months would be needed. Although we reject the current version of the paper, we invite you to resubmit the manuscript should you be able to perform additional experiments to elucidate how <italic>Rlim</italic> defects can lead to defective spermatogenesis. We do not know what the reviewers specifically have in mind, but we imagine that something like an RNA-seq analysis that identifies differentially expressed genes involved in KO versus control sperm at the level of metabolomics and/or lipidomics. Alternatively, a mass spec analysis for differentially ubiquinated proteins or differences in protein profiles might be helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In previous work, the Bach lab showed that <italic>Rlim</italic> deletion has no obvious effect on male fertility (Shin et al., 2010). In this follow-up manuscript, they show that <italic>RLIM</italic> protein is expressed in pachytene spermatocytes, Sertoli cells (testis) and epithelial cells (epididymis). Northern blot and RNA-seq analyses reveal expression of a testis-specific <italic>Rlim</italic> transcript variant with a shorter 3' UTR. Loss of function of <italic>Rlim</italic> using <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre-induced whole embryonic knockout (KO) shows that <italic>Rlim</italic> KO males have smaller testes, with dysregulated gene expression. <italic>Rlim</italic> KO males also have smaller epididymides, which contain fewer sperm, more frequent morphological abnormalities and lower motility. Accordingly, embryos generated from in vitro fertilisation using <italic>Rlim</italic> KO sperm develop to blastocysts at a lower rate compared to control.</p><p>My comments are as follows:</p><p>1) In its current form the study doesn't provide mechanistic insight. The analysis is incremental and would not contribute to the significant advance of reproductive biology. Therefore, whether the findings are of the highest scientific importance which <italic>eLife</italic> aims to publish is unclear.</p><p>2) Figure 2A: western blot data of <italic>RLIM</italic> should be added. If the short variant has a full-length ORF, protein size would be the same in testis and other tissues.</p><p>3) Figure 3A, B: please indicate age of the mice used for analysis. What does &quot;testis 1/2&quot; mean in B? If just single testis of each mouse was weighed, the data might be biased and mean weight of both testes should have been used. Is apoptosis in <italic>Rlim</italic> KO testis observed as it could explain smaller testis size?</p><p>4) Figure 3C-E: it is unclear whether gene dysregulation in the KO occurs in germ cells or other cell types. The authors could sort different stages of spermatogenic cells in testis (example shown in Bastos et al., Cytometry Part A, 2005) and perform RNA-seq analysis.</p><p>5) Figure 3—figure supplement 1: the macro-H2A1 data is not convincing, and looks like background staining. I would suggest performing immunofluorescence staining of meiocyte nuclear spreads. Also, marker protein expression doesn't reveal whether XY silencing is affected. The authors' RNA-seq data could be used to ask whether sex-genes are de-repressed or not. Again, cell-type specific analysis suggested in comment 3 is important as the authors can focus the analysis on pachytene cell population, in which sex chromosome silencing occurs.</p><p>6) Figure 4-6: the relationship between <italic>RLIM</italic> expression and the spermiogenesis phenotype is not clear. This mechanistic deficiency could be addressed using Cre lines that deplete <italic>Rlim</italic> in specific cell types (e.g. pachytene, Sertoli cells).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study reported a role of <italic>Rlim</italic> in male reproduction. <italic>RLIM</italic> is a RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase. Previous studies have shown that <italic>Rlim</italic> knockout females are embryonic lethal due to a failure in the maintenance of X-inactivation in extraembryonic tissues but KO males are fertile. In the current study, <italic>Rlim</italic> expression was examined in both testis and epididymis at both protein and RNA levels. It was concluded that <italic>RLIM</italic> protein level peaks in pachytene spermatocytes. The <italic>Rlim</italic> KO males show reduced sperm count and decreased testis weight. The KO sperm display reduced motility and reduced fertilization rate in vitro. RNA-seq on adult KO and control testes revealed altered transcriptome. While sperm and fertilization defects are well characterized and interesting, the overall study is very preliminary. It is unclear how inactivation of <italic>Rlim</italic> causes such sperm defects. No attempt was made to identify the <italic>RLIM</italic> target proteins in testis. The fact that the <italic>Rlim</italic> KO males are still fertile diminishes its significance. There is a major problem with data interpretation. Overall, I don't feel that this preliminary study represents a significant contribution.</p><p>1) Expression of <italic>RLIM</italic> protein in testis: The expression data interpretation (Figure 1) is not correct. It was concluded that <italic>RLIM</italic> expression peaks in pachytene spermatocytes at stages VI/VII (Figure 1B). <italic>RLIM</italic>-positive cells are also PNA-positive (acrosomal caps) and thus are round spermatids instead of pachytene spermatocytes. <italic>RLIM</italic>-positive round spermatids are obvious in the Figure 1A-1 tubule. Based on the data presented, the correct interpretation is that <italic>Rlim</italic> is expressed in round spermatids and Sertoli cells in the testis. While this mistake can be easily corrected, it has impacted the entire manuscript in a wrong way, which needs to be re-interpreted and re-written.</p><p>2) Figure 2 shows the generation of a short testis-specific transcript due to alternative polyadenylation. This is quite common in testis and is not really meaningful.</p><p>3) Impact on MSCI. First, <italic>Rlim</italic> is not expressed in pachytene spermatocytes (see point #1), thus discussion of MSCI is not relevant. Second, gammaH2AX and macroH2A1 are very abundant, their presence may not necessarily indicate lack of effect on MSCI.

The authors show that spermatozoa from <italic>Rlim</italic> knockout (KO) males are malformed, less motile and present with a defect in cytoplasmic reduction leading to a small decrease in their fertilizing abilities. They looked at <italic>Rlim</italic> testicular expression and identified a smaller transcript isoform which is highly expressed in postmeiotic cells. Expression in epididymis epithelium was also observed but its role remains unclear. Finally by producing a male germ cell specific KO, the authors conclude that <italic>Rlim</italic> postmeiotic isoform is at the basis of the observed sperm defects in the KO.</p><p>This is a resubmission of work rejected previously because it failed to elucidate how <italic>Rlim</italic> defects can lead to defective spermatogenesis. While all three current reviewers (two of which were not involved in the initial evaluation) applauded the addition of new data (i.e., additional data of metabolite and detailed morphology analyses of <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre <italic>Rlim</italic> KO sperm, as well as conditional <italic>Rlim</italic> KO analyses using Cre lines specific to testicular germ cells or Sertoli cells), they also felt that the issues raised in the first round of revision (e.g., the molecular function of <italic>Rlim</italic> in spermatids) had not been fully addressed. They were optimistic, however, that they could be addressed with another round of revision addressing the points below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1, point 1) The authors showed that germline <italic>Rlim</italic> KO phenocopies the <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre <italic>Rlim</italic> KO phenotype in sperm (Figure 7). In this experiment, quantification of <italic>RLIM</italic> protein decrease in the target cell types (germ cells in Ngn3-Cre KO and Sertoli cells in Sf1-Cre KO) should be shown. Also, is the IVF phenotype (Figure 4 F-G) also observed in the Ngn3-Cre <italic>Rlim</italic> KO? This will provide more important and direct evidence than the morphology analyses in Figure 7 to show sperm defects in the Ngn3-Cre <italic>Rlim</italic> KO.</p><p>2) Reviewer 1, point 2) Figure 2A: The data requested was <italic>RLIM</italic> western blot using wildtype tissues to compare the <italic>RLIM</italic> protein size of the testis-specific short variant and the long variant expressed in other tissues. Because ORF is shared in these transcripts, their protein size would be same. This data should be added in the revision.</p><p>3) Reviewer 1, point 9) It is stated that &quot;the Cauda region of many cKO/YSox2-Cre animals contained thinner tubules when compared to control males&quot;. The requested data was quantification of this thinner tubule phenotype. This data should be added in the revision.</p><p>Reviewer 1, point 10) Figure 4—figure supplement 1F suggests that <italic>Rlim</italic> deletion in sperm affects embryonic development after fertilisation. This point should be discussed more.</p><p>4) Throughout the Introduction including on the first line there is in appropriate reference to adult spermatogenesis involving primordial germ cells. These are not present in adult testes – should be undifferentiated spermatogonia or spermatogonial stem cells instead e.g. the progression of PGCs to mature spermatozoa should be progression of spermatogonia; stem cells to mature spermatozoa</p><p>5) First paragraph of Introduction – midpiece is a section of the sperm tail so should read “formation of the sperm head and tail” or to be more precise “the formation of the sperm head, HTCA and tail” not “formation of the sperm head, midpiece and tail”</p><p>6) First paragraph of Introduction – “the number of genes involved remain limited.” Should be “the number of genes identified to be involved remains limited.”</p><p>7) When describing which spermatid population <italic>RLIM</italic> is expressed in should use spermatid step not just seminiferous tubule stage (as some tubules have two types of spermatids in them so it is better practice) e.g. the spermatids that it is expressing in stage VI/VII – are step 6-7 spermatids. Also, the meaning would be clearer especially to non-specialists if you change the following sentence:</p><p>“<italic>RLIM</italic> levels are dramatically upregulated specifically in round spermatids that have undergone meiosis at stages VI / VII, an early timepoint in spermiogenesis (O'Donnell, 2014; Qian et al., 2014).”</p><p>to</p><p>“<italic>RLIM</italic> levels are dramatically upregulated specifically in post-meiotic step 6-7 round spermatids (stages VI / VII), an early timepoint in spermiogenesis (O'Donnell, 2014; Qian et al., 2014).”</p><p>As previous wording could be read to mean that round spermatids undergo meiosis at stage VI / VII which is of course incorrect. Also step 6-7 isn't super early in spermiogenesis it's about 1/3-1/2 to half the way through, what is notable is it is immediately before spermatids begin to elongate in step 8. While you make reference to the fact that its expression is no longer detected in spermatozoa that are released during spermiation – it would also be good to make reference in the results text to the fact that its expression in other spermatid steps is low e.g. once they begin to elongate it goes down and beforehand in step 3 it is low. More precise definition of the all the spermatids steps it is upregulated in would be beneficial</p><p>8) Figure 1B bottom panel is incorrectly staged. Based on acrosome morphology that is likely stage XI not IX, as the acrosome morphology shows that the apical hook/falciform shape has been acquired</p><p>9) More care needs to be taken with basic fertility phenotyping and characterisation of spermatogenesis. For example:</p><p>a) The use of swim out from the epididymis is not a quantitative method of sperm numbers as it is dependent on the cuts made as to how many sperm vacate, in addition non-motile sperm will be less likely to vacate the epididymis. Accurate sperm counts require homogenisation of the epididymis, particularly given the KO mice have lower motility the intrinsic bias of the sperm swim out towards motile sperm may results in KO sperm counts appearing to be lower than they really are</p><p>b) Basic PAS analysis of testis histology of KO testes should be conducted, with particular attention to stage 8 and 9 to see if there are defects in spermiation i.e. are all sperm properly released or do you see spermatid retention at stage 9, do residual bodies form normally, normal size etc (this would help define whether the origin of the cytoplasmic droplet is due to defects during spermiation or if it is related to defects in the normal changes that occur to it during transit through the epididymis). In addition of the steps within spermatids undergo head shaping to identify the origin of these defects.</p><p>c) Despite what the previous reviewer 3 said, testis and epididymis weight should not be expressed relative to body weight</p><p>d) The double axoneme phenotype is not commonly seen in KO models and the origins of this might reveal important insight about sperm tail formation. Have the authors characterized the head to tail coupling apparatus of these sperm and investigated if this is due to supernumerary basal bodies?</p><p>10) The authors need to include data showing validation of their KO models at an mRNA and protein level</p><p>11) How do the authors think the gene transcription changes in the <italic>RLIM</italic> KO mice relates to the phenotypes observed? Some interpretation of this is needed in the Discussion.</p><p>12) Result section <italic>Rlim</italic> expression in testis is highly regulated.</p><p>a) It is not clearly presented when exactly <italic>RLIM</italic> is highly expressed in postmeiotic cells. Is it restricted to stages VI to VIII? Since at stage IX on Figure 2B the signal is no longer strong (but see my comment below regarding staging). On Figure 2A, it seems as if many tubules display strong round spermatid signal. A precise description of <italic>RLIM</italic> protein dynamic at various stages of spermatogenesis is needed. Recapitulating IF/IHC observations using a scheme showing the different stages of spermatogenesis would be useful.</p><p>b) Figure 2</p><p>A – IHC panel:</p><p>Higher magnification insets from negative CTL would be useful to confirm that the signal observed in Sertoli cells is specific (i.e. not seen in neg control)</p><p>B - To me (but the figure is small) the image labelled &quot;stage IX&quot; is not a stage IX. I do not recognize the lectin PNA signal to be a stage IX: At this stage round spermatids have just started to elongate and condensed step 16 spermatids have already undergone spermiation (so are no longer present).</p><p>NB. Higher magnification of the DAPI images (in the merged figure for instance) would be helpful.</p><p>c) It seems odd to present <italic>Rlim</italic> expression in epididymal cells in the part entitled &quot;<italic>Rlim</italic> expression in testis is highly regulated&quot;</p><p>13) Result section Diminished production and functionality of <italic>Rlim</italic> KO sperm</p><p>a) Overall I find this part a bit confusing. At first, the testicular impairment seems to be minimized because of the observation that <italic>Rlim</italic> is expressed in epididymis epithelium. Yet it clearly appears from the last result section that sperm defects originate from a testicular (germ cell) impairment. Maybe this result section could be slightly re-organized?</p><p>specific comments/questions:</p><p>b) The observation of a small but significant reduction in testis weight indicates a (mild) spermatogenesis defect; so do testicular sperm morphological abnormalities.</p><p>Can the authors further investigate testicular cell composition – to see if one particular (likely postmeiotic) cell stage is affected? In the Discussion, it is said that increased cell death and chromatin packaging defects were investigated – even if the results are negative it would be worth presenting (or evoking) them in this section.</p><p>Since spermatogenesis is mildly impaired, RNAseq on whole testis should be interpreted with caution, as it could reflect a mild change in cell population. This emphasizes the need for a more detailed presentation of the testicular defects (or absence of visible defects).</p><p>c) Sentence: &quot;…revealed that the Cauda region of many cKO/YSox2-Cre animals contained thinner tubules when compared to control males (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E), consistent with decreased Caudal sperm (Figure 3C).&quot;</p><p>This sentence suggests that decreased caudal sperm is due to caudal region malformation. But to conclude, one needs to show quantification of testicular spermatozoa (or caput spermatozoa). Figure 6A data could be presented at that point.</p><p>But then I am confused: what is the authors' conclusion? is the decreased sperm count a consequence of testicular or epididymis defects? Since epididymis defects appear to be ruled out by the analysis of Ngn3-Cre KO sperm, it would increase clarity if epididymis analyses were presented separately.</p><p>14) Discussion</p><p>a) The first part about <italic>Rlim</italic> short isoform could be reduced. While it is an interesting fact, I feel it does not require so much emphasis since testis specific isoforms are quite common.</p><p>b) The fact that <italic>Rlim</italic> is X-encoded and expressed in spermatids does not mean it escapes MSCI (as MSCI occurs in pachytene primary spermatocytes). Instead, it means that <italic>Rlim</italic> short isoform is one of the many X-linked genes that are expressed after meiosis, when the X is re-activated (see for instance Ernst et al., 2019)</p><p>c) Considering the fact that the KO impact on male reproductive abilities (at least for the lab mouse) is minor, I find the part about the evolutionary consequences of a spermatogenesis role for <italic>Rlim</italic> a bit far-fetched. The paternal effect of <italic>Rlim</italic> in milk-producing alveolar cells would likely be more predominant (Jiao et al., 2012). I would recommend to put less emphasis on that aspect, especially in the Abstract.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63556.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In previous work, the Bach lab showed that Rlim deletion has no obvious effect on male fertility (Shin et al., 2010). In this follow-up manuscript, they show that RLIM protein is expressed in pachytene spermatocytes, Sertoli cells (testis) and epithelial cells (epididymis). Northern blot and RNA-seq analyses reveal expression of a testis-specific Rlim transcript variant with a shorter 3' UTR. Loss of function of Rlim using Sox2-Cre-induced whole embryonic knockout (KO) shows that Rlim KO males have smaller testes, with dysregulated gene expression. Rlim KO males also have smaller epididymides, which contain fewer sperm, more frequent morphological abnormalities and lower motility. Accordingly, embryos generated from in vitro fertilisation using Rlim KO sperm develop to blastocysts at a lower rate compared to control.</p><p>My comments are as follows:</p><p>1) In its current form the study doesn't provide mechanistic insight. The analysis is incremental and would not contribute to the significant advance of reproductive biology. Therefore, whether the findings are of the highest scientific importance which eLife aims to publish is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the revised manuscript provides much more insight into the mechanisms underlying the reproduction phenotype in male mice lacking <italic>Rlim</italic>. Because <italic>Rlim</italic> KO sperm displays decreased motility we have investigated the energy status of sperm polar metabolites and surprisingly found increased metabolite content (Figure 5). Detailed EM analyses reveals that cytoplasmic reduction is inhibited in <italic>Rlim</italic> KO sperm (Figures 5, 6) and using specific Cre drivers to target the <italic>Rlim</italic> cKO to Sertoli cells or the spermatogenic cell lineage we continue to show that <italic>Rlim</italic> in round spermatids is required for normal spermiogenesis (Figure 7). Using germline KO we show that the testis phenotype occurs independently of the expression of Cre-recombinase (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C). Combined these results identify <italic>Rlim</italic> as a novel and important regulator of cytoplasmic reduction in sperm, a process that is not well studied despite its major impact on male reproduction, thereby illuminating the evolution of the <italic>Rlim</italic> gene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2A: western blot data of RLIM should be added. If the short variant has a full-length ORF, protein size would be the same in testis and other tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, in our experience Western blot data do not allow distinguishing small differences in MW of <italic>Rlim</italic> protein, e.g. <italic>Rlim</italic> deletion mutants in which the NES or NLS is deleted (lacking 13 or 20 amino acids) migrate at a very similar position than the WT protein (see also Jiao et al., 2013; Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3A, B: please indicate age of the mice used for analysis. What does &quot;testis 1/2&quot; mean in B? If just single testis of each mouse was weighed, the data might be biased and mean weight of both testes should have been used. Is apoptosis in Rlim KO testis observed as it could explain smaller testis size?</p></disp-quote><p>All analyses on sperm have been carried out from sperm originating from 8 weeks old males. Even though we have included both testes halves from all animals in the previous version of the manuscript we agree and have changed the figure to reflect the entire testes (Figure 3A, B). We did not observe apoptosis in <italic>Rlim</italic>KO testes as measured via IHC using act. caspase 3 antibodies and mentioned this in the text (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3C-E: it is unclear whether gene dysregulation in the KO occurs in germ cells or other cell types. The authors could sort different stages of spermatogenic cells in testis (example shown in Bastos et al., Cytometry Part A, 2005) and perform RNA-seq analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have targeted the cKO of <italic>Rlim</italic> to the early spermatogenic cell lineage or to Sertoli (and Leydig) cells using Ngn3-Cre and Sf1-Cre, respectively. While Ngn3-Cre <italic>Rlim</italic> cKO mice largely recapitulate defects of the systemic <italic>Rlim</italic> KO, SF1-Cre cKO mice do not (see also comments to point 6, below). Thus, much of the gene dysregulation in the KO likely occurs in the spermatogenic cell lineage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3—figure supplement 1: the macro-H2A1 data is not convincing, and looks like background staining. I would suggest performing immunofluorescence staining of meiocyte nuclear spreads. Also, marker protein expression doesn't reveal whether XY silencing is affected. The authors' RNA-seq data could be used to ask whether sex-genes are de-repressed or not. Again, cell-type specific analysis suggested in comment 3 is important as the authors can focus the analysis on pachytene cell population, in which sex chromosome silencing occurs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this criticism. Because <italic>Rlim</italic> exerts its function in the spermatogenic cell lineage, where it is highly expressed in round spermatids only after MSCI and meiosis has already occurred, it likely is not relevant for these processes and we have therefore removed this figure (see also point 3, reviewer 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4-6: the relationship between RLIM expression and the spermiogenesis phenotype is not clear. This mechanistic deficiency could be addressed using Cre lines that deplete Rlim in specific cell types (e.g. pachytene, Sertoli cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this criticism and have therefore targeted the cKO of <italic>Rlim</italic> to the spermatogenic cell lineage or to Sertoli (and Leydig) cells using Ngn3-Cre and Sf1-Cre, respectively. While Ngn3-Cre <italic>Rlim</italic> cKO mice largely recapitulate defects of the systemic <italic>Rlim</italic> KO, SF1-Cre cKO mice do not (Figure 7; see also comments to 4). Because <italic>Rlim</italic> is highly upregulated in round spermatids (Figure 2), this suggests major functions of <italic>Rlim</italic> during spermiogenesis. Together with the finding of defective cytoplasmic reduction (Figures 5-7), we believe the results shown in the revised manuscript clarify the relation between <italic>Rlim</italic> expression and the spermiogenesis phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This study reported a role of Rlim in male reproduction. RLIM is a RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase. Previous studies have shown that Rlim knockout females are embryonic lethal due to a failure in the maintenance of X-inactivation in extraembryonic tissues but KO males are fertile. In the current study, Rlim expression was examined in both testis and epididymis at both protein and RNA levels. It was concluded that RLIM protein level peaks in pachytene spermatocytes. The Rlim KO males show reduced sperm count and decreased testis weight. The KO sperm display reduced motility and reduced fertilization rate in vitro. RNA-seq on adult KO and control testes revealed altered transcriptome. While sperm and fertilization defects are well characterized and interesting, the overall study is very preliminary. It is unclear how inactivation of Rlim causes such sperm defects. No attempt was made to identify the RLIM target proteins in testis. The fact that the Rlim KO males are still fertile diminishes its significance. There is a major problem with data interpretation. Overall, I don't feel that this preliminary study represents a significant contribution.</p><p>1) Expression of RLIM protein in testis: The expression data interpretation (Figure 1) is not correct. It was concluded that RLIM expression peaks in pachytene spermatocytes at stages VI/VII (Figure 1B). RLIM-positive cells are also PNA-positive (acrosomal caps) and thus are round spermatids instead of pachytene spermatocytes. RLIM-positive round spermatids are obvious in the Figure 1A-1 tubule. Based on the data presented, the correct interpretation is that Rlim is expressed in round spermatids and Sertoli cells in the testis. While this mistake can be easily corrected, it has impacted the entire manuscript in a wrong way, which needs to be re-interpreted and re-written.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer and have addressed this issue, including re-interpretation and rewriting. Thank you for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2 shows the generation of a short testis-specific transcript due to alternative polyadenylation. This is quite common in testis and is not really meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that testis-specific transcripts via alternative polyadenylation are common in testis, we disagree that this is not meaningful, as it might help in the observed upregulation of <italic>Rlim</italic> protein observed in round spermatids (Figure 2, see also Discussion section), where <italic>Rlim</italic> actively regulates spermiogenesis. Moreover, the use of this polyadenylation signal is also observed during mouse preimplantation development, when <italic>Rlim</italic> exerts its crucial role in promoting X chromosome inactivation in females (see Wang et al., 2016; Figure 1E). Finally, our results identify a new and functional polyadenylation signal in the <italic>Rlim</italic> gene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Impact on MSCI.

It is better to look at the expression of sex-linked (X-linked and Y-linked) genes from their RNA-seq data.

Given that the cKO testis is smaller and the sperm count is lower, differential expression of genes (DEGs) identified could be due to the reduced proportion of germ cells in the KO testis. This needs to be taken into consideration.</p></disp-quote><p>Because the vast majority of cells in the testis reflect spermatogenic cells, where <italic>Rlim</italic> exerts its functions (Figure 7), we believe that differentially expressed genes as detected via RNA-seq (Figures 3D-F), likely reflect those expressed in this cell lineage, even though in the KO testis there is a slightly lower proportion of this cell type. We have addressed this point in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Wang et al. identified the localization of RLIM in mouse testes and epididymis.

This point should be discussed more.</p></disp-quote><p>Because male mice lacking <italic>Rlim</italic> develop normally during preimplantation development (see Shin et al., 2010; 2014; see also Figure 3 —figure supplement 1A), our results in IVF (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F) indicates that the lack of <italic>Rlim</italic> appears to affect early embryo development specifically under in vitro conditions. We have added this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Throughout the Introduction including on the first line there is in appropriate reference to adult spermatogenesis involving primordial germ cells. These are not present in adult testes – should be undifferentiated spermatogonia or spermatogonial stem cells instead e.g. the progression of PGCs to mature spermatozoa should be progression of spermatogonia; stem cells to mature spermatozoa</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) First paragraph of Introduction – midpiece is a section of the sperm tail so should read “formation of the sperm head and tail” or to be more precise “the formation of the sperm head, HTCA and tail” not “formation of the sperm head, midpiece and tail”</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) First paragraph of Introduction – “the number of genes involved remain limited.” Should be “the number of genes identified to be involved remains limited.”</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) When describing which spermatid population RLIM is expressed in should use spermatid step not just seminiferous tubule stage (as some tubules have two types of spermatids in them so it is better practice) e.g. the spermatids that it is expressing in stage VI/VII – are step 6-7 spermatids. Also, the meaning would be clearer especially to non-specialists if you change the following sentence:</p><p>“RLIM levels are dramatically upregulated specifically in round spermatids that have undergone meiosis at stages VI / VII, an early timepoint in spermiogenesis (O'Donnell, 2014; Qian et al., 2014).”</p><p>to</p><p>“RLIM levels are dramatically upregulated specifically in post-meiotic step 6-7 round spermatids (stages VI / VII), an early timepoint in spermiogenesis (O'Donnell, 2014; Qian et al., 2014).”</p><p>As previous wording could be read to mean that round spermatids undergo meiosis at stage VI / VII which is of course incorrect. Also step 6-7 isn't super early in spermiogenesis it's about 1/3-1/2 to half the way through, what is notable is it is immediately before spermatids begin to elongate in step 8. While you make reference to the fact that its expression is no longer detected in spermatozoa that are released during spermiation – it would also be good to make reference in the results text to the fact that its expression in other spermatid steps is low e.g. once they begin to elongate it goes down and beforehand in step 3 it is low. More precise definition of the all the spermatids steps it is upregulated in would be beneficial</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. In response, we have rewritten this paragraph, addressing these points in the revised manuscript. We have also added a panel in Figure 2B that allows more precise staging of <italic>RLIM</italic> expression in spermatids. See also our response points 8 and 12b below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 1B bottom panel is incorrectly staged. Based on acrosome morphology that is likely stage XI not IX, as the acrosome morphology shows that the apical hook/falciform shape has been acquired</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have adjusted the staging in Figure 2B (see also point 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) More care needs to be taken with basic fertility phenotyping and characterisation of spermatogenesis. For example:</p><p>a) The use of swim out from the epididymis is not a quantitative method of sperm numbers as it is dependent on the cuts made as to how many sperm vacate, in addition non-motile sperm will be less likely to vacate the epididymis. Accurate sperm counts require homogenisation of the epididymis, particularly given the KO mice have lower motility the intrinsic bias of the sperm swim out towards motile sperm may results in KO sperm counts appearing to be lower than they really are</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this statement. We have changed the text to reflect for the intrinsic bias in swim out sperm numbers towards motile sperm. All sperm preps have been made by the same person (F.W.) ensuring similar cuts and the yields between animals of the same genotype were relatively reproducible (see error margins in Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Basic PAS analysis of testis histology of KO testes should be conducted, with particular attention to stage 8 and 9 to see if there are defects in spermiation i.e. are all sperm properly released or do you see spermatid retention at stage 9, do residual bodies form normally, normal size etc (this would help define whether the origin of the cytoplasmic droplet is due to defects during spermiation or if it is related to defects in the normal changes that occur to it during transit through the epididymis). In addition of the steps within spermatids undergo head shaping to identify the origin of these defects.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this comment we have performed PAS analyses. Focusing on stage 9 tubules, we did not see signs of improper sperm release (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). Because low contrast did not allow for a reliable identification and interrogation of small vesicles including residual bodies, we examined signs of cytoplasmic reduction during spermiation in TEM on testis sections. We did not observe obvious/major defects during cytoplasmic reduction in TEM (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1D). However, as we were unable to quantify droplet/lobe size on spermatids in TEM because of differing section angles combined with an uneven distribution of the droplet over the midpiece, these results do not exclude mild defects. Incorporating these data, because of increased metabolite content (Figure 4A-C), our combined results suggest some defects in cytoplasmic reduction in <italic>Rlim</italic>KO spermatids during spermiation that might become exacerbated after sperm release due to difficulties in adjusting to a changing environment. This is discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Despite what the previous reviewer 3 said, testis and epididymis weight should not be expressed relative to body weight</p></disp-quote><p>Testis weight is commonly expressed relative to body weight. In this paper all three Cre drivers used are in a different genetic background: While <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre mice are in a congenic C57Bl/6 background, the Sf1-Cre and the Ngn3-Cre mice are in different mixed backgrounds and animals display different sizes and weights and swim-out sperm numbers in controls differ (see Figure 7). We feel that it is important under these circumstances to normalize organ weights against the body weight to render data better comparable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The double axoneme phenotype is not commonly seen in KO models and the origins of this might reveal important insight about sperm tail formation. Have the authors characterized the head to tail coupling apparatus of these sperm and investigated if this is due to supernumerary basal bodies?</p></disp-quote><p>The occurrence of sperm with 2 axonemes in <italic>Rlim</italic>KO animals is relatively rare (Figure 6B) and thus represents a minor phenotype. Staining swim-out sperm with antibodies against Centrin2 did not reveal frequent occurrence of supernumerary basal bodies. Therefore, we believe that the proposed investigations are beyond the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors need to include data showing validation of their KO models at an mRNA and protein level</p></disp-quote><p>See also our response to point 1. Using <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre to target the <italic>Rlim</italic> cKO, we have previously demonstrated correct targeting of the floxed region at the mRNA level via single embryo RNA-seq (see Wang et al., 2016; Figure 1E; the parental <italic>Rlim</italic> has been targeted). Correct and efficient targeting of <italic>RLIM</italic> protein in testis by <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre is now shown via IHC (Figure 2A) and Western blot (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Concerning Ngn3-Cre cKO and Sf1-Cre cKO mice, we have performed IHC on testes sections showing correct targeting with high specificity and penetrance (new Figure 7A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) How do the authors think the gene transcription changes in the RLIM KO mice relates to the phenotypes observed? Some interpretation of this is needed in the Discussion</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this comment we have added a paragraph on the interpretation of our RNA-seq results in the Discussion section, as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Result section Rlim expression in testis is highly regulated</p><p>a) It is not clearly presented when exactly RLIM is highly expressed in postmeiotic cells. Is it restricted to stages VI to VIII? Since at stage IX on Figure 2B the signal is no longer strong (but see my comment below regarding staging). On Figure 2A, it seems as if many tubules display strong round spermatid signal. A precise description of RLIM protein dynamic at various stages of spermatogenesis is needed. Recapitulating IF/IHC observations using a scheme showing the different stages of spermatogenesis would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new panel in Figure 2B that shows high <italic>RLIM</italic> expression in step 7-8 spermatids. Thus, <italic>RLIM</italic> expression is high in spermatids from step 6-8, but low at spermatid stages before and after that. We have made this clear in the text. See also our response to point 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 2</p><p>A – IHC panel:</p><p>Higher magnification insets from negative CTL would be useful to confirm that the signal observed in Sertoli cells is specific (i.e. not seen in neg control)</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this comment we have added a higher magnification inset in Figure 2A, which we believe makes it clear that <italic>RLIM</italic> is no longer present in Sertoli cells in the <italic>Sox2</italic>-Cre cKO/Y.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B – To me (but the figure is small) the image labelled &quot;stage IX&quot; is not a stage IX. I do not recognize the lectin PNA signal to be a stage IX: At this stage round spermatids have just started to elongate and condensed step 16 spermatids have already undergone spermiation (so are no longer present).</p><p>NB. Higher magnification of the DAPI images (in the merged figure for instance) would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the Figure accordingly and added a higher magnification inset of DAPI images, as requested. See also our response to points 7 and 12 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) It seems odd to present Rlim expression in epididymal cells in the part entitled &quot;Rlim expression in testis is highly regulated&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment and points 3 and 13a, to avoid confusion, we have summarized all data on epididymis in a single paragraph and figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), as <italic>Rlim</italic> does not play a major role in epididymis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Result section Diminished production and functionality of Rlim KO sperm</p><p>a) Overall I find this part a bit confusing. At first, the testicular impairment seems to be minimized because of the observation that Rlim is expressed in epididymis epithelium. Yet it clearly appears from the last result section that sperm defects originate from a testicular (germ cell) impairment. Maybe this result section could be slightly re-organized?</p><p>specific comments/questions:</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment and points 3 and 12c, to avoid confusion, we have summarized all data on epididymis in a single paragraph and figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), as <italic>Rlim</italic> does not play a major role in epididymis</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The observation of a small but significant reduction in testis weight indicates a (mild) spermatogenesis defect; so do testicular sperm morphological abnormalities.</p><p>Can the authors further investigate testicular cell composition – to see if one particular (likely postmeiotic) cell stage is affected? In the Discussion, it is said that increased cell death and chromatin packaging defects were investigated – even if the results are negative it would be worth presenting (or evoking) them in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>Our PAS analyses (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D; data not shown) did not reveal major visible changes at the level of testicular cell composition. We have mentioned in the Results section that no cell death was observed. No obvious chromatin packaging defect was observed as judged by sperm head density in TEM and is mentioned in the TEM section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since spermatogenesis is mildly impaired, RNAseq on whole testis should be interpreted with caution, as it could reflect a mild change in cell population. This emphasizes the need for a more detailed presentation of the testicular defects (or absence of visible defects).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have added in the Discussion section the sentence: “However, we cannot exclude the possibility that subtle and hence undetected changes in testicular cell types in mice lacking <italic>Rlim</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D) may contribute to the observed differences in gene expression as well as testes weight (Figure 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Sentence: &quot;…revealed that the Cauda region of many cKO/YSox2-Cre animals contained thinner tubules when compared to control males (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E), consistent with decreased Caudal sperm (Figure 3C).&quot;</p><p>This sentence suggests that decreased caudal sperm is due to caudal region malformation. But to conclude, one needs to show quantification of testicular spermatozoa (or caput spermatozoa). Figure 6A data could be presented at that point.</p><p>But then I am confused: what is the authors' conclusion? is the decreased sperm count a consequence of testicular or epididymis defects? Since epididymis defects appear to be ruled out by the analysis of Ngn3-Cre KO sperm, it would increase clarity if epididymis analyses were presented separately.</p></disp-quote><p>See also our response to points 3 and 12c. Based on this comment we have we have summarized all data on epididymis in a single paragraph and figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Discussion</p><p>a) The first part about Rlim short isoform could be reduced. While it is an interesting fact, I feel it does not require so much emphasis since testis specific isoforms are quite common.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have condensed this section in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The fact that Rlim is X-encoded and expressed in spermatids does not mean it escapes MSCI (as MSCI occurs in pachytene primary spermatocytes). Instead, it means that Rlim short isoform is one of the many X-linked genes that are expressed after meiosis, when the X is re-activated (see for instance Ernst et al., 2019)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. This has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Considering the fact that the KO impact on male reproductive abilities (at least for the lab mouse) is minor, I find the part about the evolutionary consequences of a spermatogenesis role for Rlim a bit far-fetched. The paternal effect of Rlim in milk-producing alveolar cells would likely be more predominant (Jiao et al., 2012). I would recommend to put less emphasis on that aspect, especially in the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed this aspect in the Abstract and shortened the corresponding paragraph in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
