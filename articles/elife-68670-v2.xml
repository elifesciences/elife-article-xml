During infection, nontranslating rotavirus transcripts accumulate in cytoplasmic protein-RNA granules known as viroplasms that support segmented genome assembly and replication via a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we analysed the RV transcriptome by combining DNA-barcoded smFISH of rotavirus-infected cells. Rotavirus RNA stoichiometry in viroplasms appears to be distinct from the cytoplasmic transcript distribution, with the largest transcript being the most enriched in viroplasms, suggesting a selective RNA enrichment mechanism. While all 11 types of transcripts accumulate in viroplasms, their stoichiometry significantly varied between individual viroplasms. Accumulation of transcripts requires the presence of 3’ untranslated terminal regions and viroplasmic localisation of the viral polymerase VP1, consistent with the observed lack of polyadenylated transcripts in viroplasms. Our observations reveal similarities between viroplasms and other cytoplasmic RNP granules and identify viroplasmic proteins as drivers of viral RNA assembly during viroplasm formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA viruses</kwd><kwd>biomolecular condensates</kwd><kwd>ribonucleoproteins</kwd><kwd>RNA imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>213437/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borodavka</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jungmann</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MolMap 680241</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jungmann</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Strauss</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The rotavirus (RV) genome is enclosed in a protein shell, inside which 11 double-stranded (ds)RNAs, also known as genomic segments, iteratively undergo rounds of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caddy et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, multiple copies of distinct RV transcripts accumulate in the cytoplasm of infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McClain et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Estrozi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Periz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salgado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borodavka et al., 2018</xref>. It remains a long-standing mystery how RVs robustly select and co-package 11 non-identical RNAs despite the non-stoichiometric transcript accumulation in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayala-Breton et al., 2009</xref>. While recent multiplexed single-molecule RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (smFISH) analyses have identified multi-RNA complexes in influenza A virus-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haralampiev et al., 2020</xref>, so far in RVs, the formation of multi-RNA complexes associated with the viral RNA chaperone NSP2 has only been documented in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borodavka et al., 2017</xref>. Within 2 hr of transcription, viral RNA-binding proteins NSP2 and NSP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patton and Spencer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taraporewala and Patton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trask et al., 2012</xref> begin to form membraneless cytoplasmic replication factories, also known as viroplasms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jayaram et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Papa et al., 2021</xref>, that accumulate additional viral proteins and RNAs required for subsequent genome replication and assembly. Experimental evidence suggest that viroplasms may provide a selective environment that may protect viral transcripts from siRNA-mediated degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Silvestri et al., 2004</xref> where RV transcripts serve as templates for the synthesis of dsRNA genome. Previous attempts to investigate the ultrastructure of viroplasms have not succeeded in revealing the identities and stoichiometry of individual transcripts therein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crawford and Desselberger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Criglar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcés Suárez et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>Recently, we discovered that early replication stage (2–6 hr post infection, hpi) viroplasms represent RNA-protein condensates that are formed via phase-separation of the non-structural phosphoprotein NSP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger et al., 2021</xref> and the RNA chaperone NSP2. These condensates could be rapidly and reversibly dissolved by treating RV-infected cells with small aliphatic diols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>. RV transcripts can be released from viroplasms when they were briefly treated with 4.7% propylene glycol or 4% 1,6-hexanediol, followed by reversible recruitment of the RV transcripts into these condensates when these compounds were removed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>. Paradoxically, while the RNA chaperone NSP2 possesses low nanomolar affinity for any single-stranded (ss)RNA, viroplasms appear to be highly enriched only in viral transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>. Thus, several aspects of viroplasm formation resemble the assembly of other ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assemblies formed from non-translating mRNAs, for example, stress granules (SGs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khong et al., 2017</xref> and P-bodies. For SGs, it has been proposed that essentially every mRNA could partition into these granules, albeit with partitioning efficiencies significantly varying. This suggests that SGs do not represent a defined mRNP assembly but instead form via condensation of non-translating mRNAs and associated proteins in proportion to the RNA length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khong et al., 2017</xref>. Similarly, efficient partitioning of mRNAs into P-bodies was shown to primarily correlate with their poor levels of translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matheny et al., 2019</xref>. Recent evidence argues that intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions play a role in forming and determining the composition of certain RNP granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Treeck and Parker, 2018</xref>. In principle, the formation of specialised viral ribonucleoprotein condensates could facilitate selective enrichment of untranslated RV transcripts required for a stoichiometric genome assembly via inter-molecular RNA-RNA interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borodavka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bravo et al., 2018</xref>. Despite the extensive evidence of the importance of viroplasms in RV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Silvestri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichwald et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taraporewala et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vascotto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eichwald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Papa et al., 2020</xref>, the analysis of their molecular composition have been confounded by both their dynamic and liquid-like nature that precluded successful isolation from the RV-infected cells. Thus, the exact RNA composition of these assemblies has remained enigmatic, and it is unclear whether these granules contain all 11 non-identical RNA species, and if so, how these organelles maintain their unique RNA composition.</p><p>To unravel the principles of RNA partitioning into viroplasms, we have visualised the RV transcriptome using a DNA barcode-based multiplexing approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schueder et al., 2017</xref>, combined with single-molecule RNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (smFISH). Initially, rotavirus transcripts are detected as cytoplasmically distributed non-stoichiometric species, prior to the formation of RNA clusters that precede the assembly of viroplasms. Furthermore, smFISH analysis of individual viroplasms reveals that all RV transcripts are enriched, and that intact 3'UTRs and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1 are required for efficient transcript partitioning into viroplasms. Overall, our data reveal key differences in the mechanisms of RNA partitioning that underlie the assembly of viroplasms and other cytoplasmic RNP granules, including stress granules and P-bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Treeck and Parker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Standart and Weil, 2018</xref>.

Since each target-specific pool consisted of 48 probes (<bold>Methods</bold>), at 2 hpi, both Seg3 and Seg4 transcripts were readily detectable as high-intensity single point sources that were sufficiently far apart to be resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The observed uniformity of intensities of point sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref><bold>, panel a</bold>) was comparable to the GAPDH RNA signal distribution visualised using a set of smFISH probes labelled with an identical fluorophore under the same imaging conditions (<bold>Methods</bold>), further confirming that these objects represented single viral transcripts. Both Seg3 and Seg4 transcripts were equally abundant and randomly distributed in the cytoplasm of infected cells without a discernible pattern. Such random point distribution further suggested a lack of directional transport of RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Femino et al., 1998</xref> released by the transcribing viral particles. The overall cytoplasmic density of transcripts increased over time, reflecting ongoing viral transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). A hallmark of the rotavirus replication cycle is an exponential increase in the amount of RNA produced after 4–6 hpi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayala-Breton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patton et al., 2004</xref> emanating from the second wave of transcription by the newly assembled particles. We therefore initially focused on analysing the intracellular distribution of viral transcripts between 2 and 3 hpi. Despite the apparently equal ratio of Seg3 and Seg4 transcripts produced between 2 and 4 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), at 6 hpi the amount of Seg3 was significantly higher than that of Seg4 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that individual viral transcripts have different half-lives. Moreover, after 3 hpi, multiple Seg3 and Seg4 transcripts co-localised, resulting in higher intensity signals compared to single transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The number of high-intensity RNA foci further increased between 3 and 6 hpi, manifesting in a higher density of co-localising Seg3 and Seg4 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Further analysis of Seg3 and Seg4 RNA intensities of individual viroplasms reveals significant variations in the RNA content between granules. By quantifying Seg3 and Seg4 RNA signals in viroplasms at 4 hpi and 6 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>), a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.93) between Seg4 and Seg3 RNA intensities was noted, with both RNA intensities linearly increase as the intensity of the NSP5-EGFP signal increases, i.e., proportionally to the size of an EGFP-NSP5-tagged viroplasm. Interestingly, a similar Seg3/Seg4 RNA ratio was maintained in viroplasms at a later infection stage at 6 hpi (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9), while the transcript to NSP5-EGFP ratio was significantly different from that seen at 4 hpi (R<sup>2</sup>=0.8 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.13 for 4 and 6 hpi, respectively). These observations suggest that while both Seg3 and Seg4 mRNAs are present in viroplasms, individual mRNA ratios vary between viroplasms even within the same cell.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Segment-specific transcript accumulation during Rotavirus infection.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) smFISH of RV transcripts at early infection time points (2–6 hpi) using segment-specific probes.

To investigate the role of NSP2 in the observed RNA assembly, we analysed two cell lines, each of which was expressing a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting either the NSP2 gene, or a scrambled control RNA. At 4 hpi, shRNA-mediated NSP2 knockdown resulted in an overall reduction of signal intensities for both Seg3 and Seg4 RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, NSP2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) disrupted the apparent aggregation of Seg3 and Seg4 transcripts that no longer formed high-intensity RNA foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Signal intensity analysis of Seg3 and Seg4 RNAs suggests that Seg3 transcripts appear to be more stable upon NSP2 depletion compared to Seg4 RNAs in RV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these data indicate that NSP2 expression is required for RV RNA clustering, further suggesting the role of NSP2 in the formation of higher order RNA assemblies. Although we observed a lack of transcript clustering in rotavirus-infected cells expressing shRNA targeting NSP2, it is important to note that the formation of viroplasms was also impaired under these conditions, supporting the essential role of NSP2 in viroplasm assembly. To directly visualise transcript oligomerisation, we also carried out super-resolution imaging of individual transcripts using DNA-based Point Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (DNA-PAINT) approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jungmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schnitzbauer et al., 2017</xref>.

Assuming that in viroplasms RNA target accessibility is expected to be lower than that of a single transcript, we note that the number of Seg3 transcripts in these structures is likely to be higher and using this approach transcripts are likely to be undercounted in larger granules.

While some key protein constituents of various RNP granules have been identified, their transcriptomes remain less well-characterised due to the granule isolation and purification challenges. Recently, we have shown that rotavirus viroplasms represent RNP granules initially formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the RNA chaperone NSP2 and a condensate-forming protein NSP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>. Here, we provide the first glimpse at the unique RNA composition of the viral condensate that support replication of an 11-segmented RNA genome.</p><p>RNA-Seq and single-cell UDEx-FISH analyses have revealed that at 6 hpi, rotavirus infection resulted in non-stoichiometric accumulation of distinct viral transcripts, in agreement with previous bulk kinetic studies of RV replication carried out during late infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayala-Breton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patton and Spencer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Silvestri et al., 2004</xref>. Early infection (2 hpi) RV transcriptome analysis by UDEx-FISH shows that all 11 types of the RV transcripts were diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of infected cells. At 6 hpi, Seg1 (VP1-coding) transcripts represented the smallest fraction of the RV transcriptome. While RNA-Seq quantification provided the relative ratios of viral and non-viral protein-coding transcripts, it failed to reveal specific RNA localisation and subcellular distribution in individual RV-infected cells. In contrast, our UDEx-FISH analysis appeared to undercount smaller RNA targets (Seg11 and Seg10), presumably due to a limited number of smFISH probes successfully hybridized to these transcripts. We therefore used both approaches to quantify the viral transcriptome in RV-infected cells. The initial transcription stage was followed by the apparent formation of higher order assemblies of the RV transcripts during a process that required the viral RNA chaperone NSP2. Our observations are fully consistent with previously reported inhibition of genome replication and virion assembly resulting from the loss of NSP2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Silvestri et al., 2004</xref>, providing new evidence for NSP2 as a multivalent RNA chaperone that links together populations of viral transcripts. While NSP2 has been demonstrated to promote RNA oligomerisation in vitro, the shRNA-mediated knockout of NSP2 may also disrupt RNA distribution and localisation due to the impaired viroplasm formation, suggesting a potential role for NSP2 in these processes. In light of our recent findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geiger et al., 2021</xref>, these results reveal several parallels between viroplasmic condensates and other cytoplasmic RNP granules, including stress granules (SGs) and P-bodies. Both SGs and viroplasms represent liquid-like RNP assemblies that form from untranslating mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Treeck and Parker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>. Expression of SG-specific or viroplasm-specific multivalent RNA-binding proteins is essential to their formation. While many aspects of viroplasm formation mimic those seen in assembly of stress granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Treeck and Parker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tauber et al., 2020</xref>, RNA partitioning into viroplasms and the observed clustering of transcripts appears to be virus-specific, implying that both processes depend on cognate, RV-specific RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions. Unlike SGs, whose RNA composition is biased toward larger, AU-rich mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khong et al., 2017</xref>, our data reveal that viroplasmic RNA enrichment is likely to be determined by transcript-specific terminal sequences of each RV gene segment. It remains to be determined how the individual sequences within the transcript-specific UTRs of different length and composition determine RNA partitioning to these condensates.</p><p>A plausible model for such enrichment is based on a high affinity, specific protein-RNA recognition, such as previously reported conserved interaction between the 3' terminal sequence of each RV transcript and its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) VP1 that exhibits high affinity for NSP5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patton and Chen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnoldi et al., 2007</xref>. We propose that RdRP-binding sites within the 3' UTRs of RV transcripts would facilitate their enrichment in viroplasms. Interestingly, a similar RdRP-facilitated viral transcript selection mechanism was recently alluded to in SARS-CoV-2 RNA-nucleoprotein-rich condensates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Savastano et al., 2020</xref>, suggesting that selective viral transcript enrichment in replicative condensates may be widely employed by other RNA viruses. Our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) also accounts for the accumulation of VP1-bound nontranslating viral transcripts in viroplasms, in which the formation of inter-molecular RNA-RNA interactions between Seg1-Seg 11 transcripts is favoured in the presence of the viral RNA chaperone NSP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borodavka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borodavka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bravo et al., 2021</xref>.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A proposed model of viral transcript partitioning into viroplasms.</title><p>RV transcripts (for clarity, only 3 out of 11 distinct transcripts are shown) associate with viral RNA-binding proteins NSP2 (cyan doughnut-like octamers), as well as the RV RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase VP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viskovska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patton, 1996</xref> (not shown).

While the number of individual types of transcripts varies, their relative numbers in viroplasms is close to equimolar, suggesting an RNA partitioning mechanism distinct from the formation of stress granules or P-bodies. High effective concentration of cognate RNAs within viroplasms is conducive to the formation of inter-molecular RNA-RNA interactions between 11 distinct RV transcripts required for their stoichiometric assembly.

Given the degenerative nature of RNA-RNA base-pairing, such non-specific interactions would be expected to interfere with the stoichiometric assembly of viral transcripts. Thus, such transcript sequestration within the specialized RNP granules offers a solution to the problem of RNA assortment which is likely governed by inter-molecular RNA interactions and must avoid spurious non-cognate RNA-RNA interactions. We propose that viroplasms may act as the crucibles for the assortment of RV transcripts, and further studies to explore the exact mechanisms of RNA enrichment in these granules will underpin search for new antiviral strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line<break/>(<italic>Chlorocebus aethiops</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MA104 Clone 1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC CRL-2378.1; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_3845">CVCL_3845</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stable cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line<break/>(<italic>Chlorocebus aethiops</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MA104-NSP5-EGFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cells obtained from Dr. O.

Samples were rinsed with the labelling buffer, followed by addition of the imaging buffer (<italic>vide supra</italic>). After a round of image acquisition, hybridized labelling strands were dissociated by briefly incubating samples in 30% (v/v) formamide in PBS (‘Wash buffer’) for 2–3 min at RT, repeating this procedure twice, whilst monitoring for any residual fluorescence signal in four acquisition channels (Cy5, Cy3, GFP, DAPI). Formamide-containing wash buffer was then aspirated, and samples were rinsed twice with fresh labelling buffer prior to the introduction of the next batch of ‘Imager’ DNA strands, thus concluding a single imaging cycle. To calibrate the recorded fluorescence intensities to quantify the signals originating from the individual transcripts in an unbiased manner due to differences in properties of spectrally distinct dyes (Cy3 vs Cy5), we swapped Cy5 and Cy3-dye-labelled DNA imagers for one of the RNA targets in each imaging cycle. A total number of six imaging cycles were required to image the RV transcriptome, and the last cycle always contained an Imager targeting the segment imaged during cycle 1 to control for a possibility of the signal loss due to the dissociation of FISH probes, and for signal calibration purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA production and RNA delivery</title><p>A pT7-NSP3-EGFP construct (see Key Resources Table) was used for amplification of EGFP ORF-containing transcription templates using a Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase with the forward primer (For_UTR) and either Rev_UTR (to make the 5’UTR-EGFP-3’UTR DNA template) or Rev_dUTR (to produce the EGFP-3’ΔUTR DNA template).

Images were acquired using a region of interest of 512×512 pixels. The camera read-out rate was set to 540 MHz and images were acquired with an integration time of 200ms, using 50 W/cm<sup>2</sup> laser power. 5’-ATACATTGA-Cy3B-3’ was used as imager strand sequence. Further details of imaging conditions for each experiment are summarised below (2 hpi sample: 1 nM imager, 20,000 frames; 4 hpi sample: 125 pM imager; 40,000 frames; 6 hpi: 100 pM imager; 30,000 frames).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image processing and colocalisation analysis</title><p>Deconvolution analysis was applied to all acquired widefield images using the Huygens Essential software (Scientific Volume Imaging B.V., the Netherlands).

Regions of interest were drawn around individual cells prior to the analysis. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) was chosen as a statistic for quantifying colocalisation to measure the pixel-by-pixel covariance in the signal levels between two distinct channels. This allows subtraction of the mean intensity from each pixel’s intensity value independently of signal levels and the signal offset for each ROI. Pearson’s correlation coefficient values were calculated in Icy Colocalization Studio that employs pixel scrambling method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lagache et al., 2015</xref>.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, GAPDH and RV RNA transcripts peak intensities were detected using the ImageJ ‘Find Maxima’ function, with noise settings 100 (GAPDH) and 1000 (RV).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and myself (Sara Sawyer – U Colorado Boulder – USA) as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Roy Parker (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In this particular case, we are going to ask you to go through and address all reviewers' comments carefully. Both reviewers felt that the manuscript would be improved by careful quantification of all experiments and by putting the results into more rigorous analyses. We do feel that you will have a much stronger paper after addressing the comments of these reviewers, which will help you better interpret and explain your findings to readers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In general, the manuscript would be improved by careful quantification of all experiments and putting the results into a more rigorous analysis.</p><p>2) I think the work would be much more interesting if additional analyses were performed by the images where all 11 segments are examined. For example:</p><p>a) Do all viroplasms have all 11 segments? If so, this implies specificity in the assembly mechanism that ensures this distribution.</p><p>b) Is the stoichiometry the same in each viroplasm, or is there significant variation between assemblies? Again, this would have implications for the assembly mechanisms.</p><p>I raise this issue since for publication in <italic>ELife</italic>, the work should provide new significant biological or mechanistic insight.</p><p>3) The manuscript would be improved by adding a co-localization quantification of the data presented in figure S5 (seg3 and seg4), which would communicate the importance of NSP2 more effectively than trying to gauge intensity from the images.</p><p>4) The analysis of the requirement for a specific 3' UTR is limited since there are multiple differences between the RNAs being examined. To really make this conclusion, one would need to express the positive control RNA from a nuclear transgene with a ribozyme to generate the proper 3' end, and show that nuclear RNA is still efficiently recruited to viroplasms. in addition, the mRNA with the poly(A) does seem to partition into the viroplasms to some extent. How does that affect the conclusions presented?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Strauss et al. studied the mechanism of RNA recruitment to ribonucleoprotein condenstates using rotavirus. They used multiplexed DNA-barcorded smFISH and DNA-PAINT for direct visualization of the RNP condensates in cells. They observed the early onset of viral transcript oligomerization before the formation of viroplasms and the process of enrichment in RNP condensates. They imaged all eleven transcript in a RNP condensate and quantified the amount of the transcripts. Based on these findings, they suggested a selective RNA enrichment mechanism of rotavirus. The authors conducted well the experiments with good control measurement. The results looks significant enough for understanding the RNA recruitment to RNP condensates and provide a potential usefulness of their approach in the future work. I have a few concerns before fully supporting its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. It may be very helpful for a non-expert in rotavirus to understand the purpose of this work by putting a schematic illustration of their biological systems in Supplementary Figures. For example, Figure 4 is easy to understand the experimental schemes and the results with the help of the illustration.</p><p>2. In the same manner, the conclusion of this work is rather difficult to understand. It may be very helpful to provide a schematic illustration of their results in a figure.</p><p>3. The last paragraph of introduction part. The authors provided all their results, which seems to make it difficult to understand the major findings of this work. It will be helpful to be concise here.</p><p>4. in Figure 1, the authors performed colocalization analysis. What is the error bar of their colocalization methods (how many pixels)? Please provide the dyes they used here for smFISH. Is there any cross-talk between EGFP and the dyes?</p><p>5. In Supplementary Figure 1. How did the authors obtained the intensity distribution of GAPDH? It is an intensity based on a pixel?</p><p>6. In Figure 3. The authors estimated 20-50 transcript for RNA clusters. When RNA formed clusters, the accessibility of DNA probes will be low compared with bare (or single) RNAs. The discussion on this point may be needed for the RNA quantification.</p><p>7. in page 13, &quot;Assuming similar rates of transcription for each individual genomic segment, transcription of longer segments is expected to yield fewer copies of longer Seg1-Seg4 transcripts (3.4-2.6 kb).&quot; The copy number of transcript typically depends on the promoter strength, i.e., initiation, not the length of transcript. Degradation rate may be different.</p><p>8. in Figure 5. It is difficult to compare the result in Figure 5c (RNA-seq) and 5d (FISH).

We carried out additional analyses of the imaging data, and we have provided further comments and interpretation throughout the text. More specifically, we have shown that all analysed viroplasms contained 11 distinct RNA transcripts, albeit the transcript stoichiometry appears to deviate from the equimolar ratio of dsRNA segments present in each rotavirus particle (Figure 5). However, we cannot rule out that this would universally apply to all viroplasms, as we have only analysed those detectable around 6 hours post infection (HPI), when all transcripts are highly abundant in RV-infected cells. Furthermore, since viroplasms represent RNP granules with poorly defined RNA and protein stoichiometries, we expect significant variation in the RNA content between individual viroplasms. To test this, we have carried out additional quantitative analyses of Seg3 and Seg4 RNAs in viroplasms detected at 4 HPI and 6 HPI (Figure 2c and Figure 2 —figure supplement 3, b). Figure 2c reveals a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93) between Seg4 and Seg3 RNA intensities (overall intensities per detected spot per RNA target), both of which linearly increase as the intensity of the NSP5-EGFP signal increases, i.e., proportionally to the size of an EGFP-NSP5-tagged viroplasm. Interestingly, a similar Seg3/Seg4 RNA ratio is also maintained in viroplasms at 6 HPI (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9), however, the RNA:EGFP-NSP5 ratio is distinct from that seen at 4 HPI (R<sup>2</sup>=0.8 for 4 HPI and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.13 for 6 HPI). These observations suggest that while all 11 distinct transcripts are present in viroplasms, transcript : protein ratios are likely to change during infection, reflecting the dynamic composition of viroplasmic RNP granules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The manuscript would be improved by adding a co-localization quantification of the data presented in figure S5 (seg3 and seg4), which would communicate the importance of NSP2 more effectively than trying to gauge intensity from the images.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their suggestion, and we have significantly improved the layout of Figure 2 —figure supplement 4 by (i) adding schematic diagrams of the experimental system; (ii) adding signal intensity analysis for both Seg3 and Seg4 for RV-infected WT MA104 cells, and after shRNA-mediated depletion of NSP2, as suggested by the Reviewer. As you can see from the signal intensity analysis, the overall RNA signal intensities in shRNA-expressing cells were much lower than those observed in WT cells. Thus, we refrained from carrying out colocalization analysis due to significant differences in signal intensities to avoid biases introduced by significantly different thresholds required for estimating colocalizations between these conditions (i.e., in images with low signal levels an appropriate threshold value is much lower and it fails to discriminate RNA signals from background (Dunn KW, Kamocka MM &amp; McDonald JH. A practical guide to evaluating colocalization in biological microscopy. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol, 2011)). More importantly, high intensity foci containing colocalising Seg3 and Seg4 RNAs were only present in RV-infected WT cells, whereas no RNA clusters containing both Seg3 and Seg4 RNAs could be detected in NSP2-depleted cells after RV infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The analysis of the requirement for a specific 3' UTR is limited since there are multiple differences between the RNAs being examined. To really make this conclusion, one would need to express the positive control RNA from a nuclear transgene with a ribozyme to generate the proper 3' end, and show that nuclear RNA is still efficiently recruited to viroplasms. in addition, the mRNA with the poly(A) does seem to partition into the viroplasms to some extent. How does that affect the conclusions presented?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their comment above, we agree that the presented data do not rule out the possibility of other factors being involved in viral transcript partitioning into viroplasmic condensates. However, expressing viral transcript as a transgene would pose many additional challenges. Specifically, such a strategy could be confounded by (i) cryptic splice sites resulting in splicing of the exported viral transcript; (ii) processing of the 3’ end during nuclear export; (iii) processing of the 3’ end by the HDV ribozyme in the nucleus, resulting in the loss of its nuclear export. We expanded our discussion to mention that association of cellular RBPs with the viral transcripts exported from the nucleus may also impede their partitioning into viroplasms. We have also mentioned that given the high density of NSP5-EGFP in viroplasms, it is hard to rule out the possibility of residual cross-talk between high-density EGFP and the low-level RNA FISH signal (Atto647N-labelled FISH probes, please see the spectral data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, EGFP Excitation/Emission in green, Atto647N Excitation/Emission spectra in red).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-68670-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Nevertheless, our experimental data show that non-viral, heterologous EGFP sequences inserted into the RV transcripts containing intact UTRs would partition into viroplasms much more efficiently compared to nuclear transcripts. These data, together with our observation that GAPDH transcripts are also not enriched in viroplasms, suggest that poly-adenylated transcripts do not efficiently partition into viroplasmic condensates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Strauss et al. studied the mechanism of RNA recruitment to ribonucleoprotein condenstates using rotavirus. They used multiplexed DNA-barcorded smFISH and DNA-PAINT for direct visualization of the RNP condensates in cells. They observed the early onset of viral transcript oligomerization before the formation of viroplasms and the process of enrichment in RNP condensates. They imaged all eleven transcript in a RNP condensate and quantified the amount of the transcripts. Based on these findings, they suggested a selective RNA enrichment mechanism of rotavirus. The authors conducted well the experiments with good control measurement. The results looks significant enough for understanding the RNA recruitment to RNP condensates and provide a potential usefulness of their approach in the future work. I have a few concerns before fully supporting its publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their comments, and for appreciating the usefulness of our approach for investigating RNA composition of RNP granules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Spot detections for intensity correlations (Figure 2 and Figure 2 —figure supplement 3) were performed using ‘Spot Detection’ tool in Icy (Version 1.9.10.0), an open bioimage informatics platform (http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/). The spot detection input parameter sensitivity was set to 20 and the object size to 7 pixels. The sum intensity of each detection was calculated prior to the intensity correlation analysis. For spot intensities measured in Figure 2 —figure supplement 4 sensitivity was set to 20 and the object size to 3 pixels.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 3. The authors estimated 20-50 transcript for RNA clusters. When RNA formed clusters, the accessibility of DNA probes will be low compared with bare (or single) RNAs. The discussion on this point may be needed for the RNA quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for making this excellent point. Indeed, target accessibility inside the dense phase of RNP granules/other phase-separated systems remains one of many challenges for quantitative imaging analyses of their composition. We have added the following sentence in the Results section: ‘We note that within viroplasms, target accessibility for smFISH probes is expected to be lower than that for single transcripts. Thus, Seg3 transcripts present in these RNA clusters and larger viroplasms are likely to be undercounted’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. in page 13, &quot;Assuming similar rates of transcription for each individual genomic segment, transcription of longer segments is expected to yield fewer copies of longer Seg1-Seg4 transcripts (3.4-2.6 kb).&quot; The copy number of transcript typically depends on the promoter strength, i.e., initiation, not the length of transcript. Degradation rate may be different.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified this statement to highlight that in rotaviruses, the RdRP-binding sites for each individual dsRNA segment are identical, and their segment-specific transcription rates deduced from previous in vitro studies suggest that the number of transcripts produced by a transcriptionally active particle is inversely proportional to their length (e.g., shorter transcripts are more abundant than the longer transcripts).

We have also added the following statement in Discussion: ‘While NSP2 has been demonstrated to promote RNA oligomerization in vitro, the shRNA-mediated knockout of NSP2 may also disrupt RNA distribution and localization due to the impaired viroplasm formation, suggesting a potential role for NSP2 in these processes.’ (p.8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The manuscript would be greatly strengthened by quantification of Figure 6 and 7, which otherwise just show one image (and the GFP intensity in the images in Figure 6 looks strikingly different, which could affect the result).

We inspected all datasets carefully, and we agree that the GFP background appears to be higher, also due to the lower intensity of the transfected RNA, for which we had to use longer exposure times. In addition, we had our concerns that covalent ATTO647N dye-labelling of the RNA could also impact the physicochemical properties of labelled transcripts (e.g., addition of multiple cationic and hydrophobic ATTO647N dye molecules). We therefore devised a modified strategy that avoids the use of dye labelled RNAs and relies on the following:</p><p>(i) Production of unmodified, capped EGFP mRNA containing intact UTRs derived from Segment 1 RNA. We chose the EGFP ORF sequence as a target since we have already validated our EGFP-targeting FISH probes labelled with the 647 dye.</p><p>(ii) NSP2-mCherry cell line was then electroporated with unmodified capped EGFP mRNAs containing either both 5’ and 3’ UTRs derived from Segment 1 RNA, or without the 3’UTR (denoted EGFP-D3’UTR), and then these cells were infected with rotaviruses, subsequently fixed and EGFP mRNA distribution was analysed by smFISH.</p><p>(iii) Imaging viroplasms using the NSP2-mCherry MA104 cell line was carried out as both NSP5-EGFP and NSP2-mCherry are equally susceptible to RVs, both being useful for visualising viroplasms (doi.org/10.15252/embj.2021107711). mCherry has approximately two-fold lower molecular brightness compared to EGFP (15,840 vs 33,540, respectively, based on their extinction coefficients and the quantum yields), while its absorption spectrum does not overlap with the 641 nm excitation line required for smFISH visualisation of transfected EGFP mRNAs. This allowed us to further reduce the fluorescence background, while EGFP-specific probes do not cross-react with mCherry transcripts (53.6% sequence similarity between mCherry and EGFP).</p><p>The new images further support the notion that functional, UTR-containing non-viral EGFP mRNAs electroporated to MA104 cells would partially localise to viroplasms in RV-infected cells. We have included these new data in Figure 6, and we updated Methods section.</p><p>Furthermore, for Figure 7, we have also included quantitation of colocalizing signals, as requested by the Reviewer.
