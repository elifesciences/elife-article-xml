locations is well understood. In particular, these sites are made competent to initiate replication by loading of the Mcm replicative helicase prior to the start of S phase; thus, ‘a site that binds Mcm in G1’ might be considered to provide an operational definition of a replication origin. By fusing a subunit of Mcm to micrococcal nuclease, we previously showed that known origins are typically bound by a single Mcm double hexamer, loaded adjacent to the ARS consensus sequence (ACS). Here, we extend this analysis from known origins to the entire genome, identifying candidate Mcm binding sites whose signal intensity varies over at least three orders of magnitude. Published data quantifying single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) during S phase revealed replication initiation among the most abundant 1600 of these sites, with replication activity decreasing with Mcm abundance and disappearing at the limit of detection of ssDNA. Three other hallmarks of replication origins were apparent among the most abundant 5500 sites. Specifically, these sites: (1) appeared in intergenic nucleosome-free regions flanked on one or both sides by well-positioned nucleosomes; (2) were flanked by ACSs; and (3) exhibited a pattern of GC skew characteristic of replication initiation. We conclude that, if sites at which Mcm double hexamers are loaded can function as replication origins, then DNA replication origins are at least threefold more abundant than previously assumed, and we suggest that replication may occasionally initiate in essentially every intergenic region. These results shed light on recent reports that as many as 15% of replication events initiate outside of known origins, and this broader distribution of replication origins suggest that S phase in yeast may be less distinct from that in humans than widely assumed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>replication origin</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>replication initiation</kwd><kwd>Mcm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM117446</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedalov</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Replication origins in yeast are more widespread than previously believed.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA replication in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> initiates at multiple sites across the genome known as replication origins. Fragments of DNA containing these sites were initially isolated in the late 1970s on the basis of their ability to support replication of plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stinchcomb et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beach et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan and Tye, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broach et al., 1983</xref>), and in this context they acquired the designation of ‘autonomously replicating sequences’ or ‘ARSs’. In subsequent years, additional origins were discovered using a variety of techniques to demonstrate their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saffer and Miller, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brewer and Fangman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liachko et al., 2013</xref>). Origins vary widely in their efficiency, with some being used in almost every cell cycle while others may be used in only 1 in 1000 S phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boos and Ferreira, 2019</xref>), with only the former being capable of supporting plasmid replication in the traditional ARS assay. The total number of reported yeast origins of replication is between 350 and 830 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wyrick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2006</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nieduszynski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siow et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which these sequences function as replication origins has been elucidated in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fragkos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa and Diffley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu and Stillman, 2023</xref>): During the G1 phase of the cell cycle, a six-protein ‘origin recognition complex’ (ORC) binds to the origin at a loosely defined ‘ARS consensus sequence’ (ACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>) and loads a replicative helicase complex called MCM (for ‘mini-chromosome maintenance’). MCM exists as two rings that encircle the DNA double helix, with each ring composed of six subunits encoded by MCM2-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and Botchan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deegan and Diffley, 2016</xref>). Mcm complexes are activated at the beginning of S phase through a combination of CDK and DDK kinase activities, and the two single hexamers then move in opposite directions to separate the two strands of DNA in front of the replication apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Francis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deegan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis et al., 2022</xref>). MCM is not loaded at every origin during every cell cycle, nor does every MCM complex that is loaded become activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rhind and Gilbert, 2013</xref>). This variation in both loading and firing leads to the variation in origin efficiency mentioned above.</p><p>Replication origins exhibit several characteristics that distinguish them from the surrounding DNA. First, they appear in nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipford and Bell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berbenetz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>). While nucleosomes are typically spaced at 165 base pairs, leaving approximately 18 base pairs of unbound DNA between, NFRs consist of longer (100–200 base pairs) stretches of DNA that are not only devoid or depleted of nucleosomes, but are also flanked on one or both sides by well-positioned nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rando and Chang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berbenetz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jansen and Verstrepen, 2011</xref>). Second, these NFRs occur predominantly between rather than within genic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang and Gao, 2019</xref>). Finally, an evolutionary footprint marking the point of divergence of leading and lagging strand replication, which manifests itself as a skewing in the numbers of Gs versus Cs along a single strand of DNA, has been reported at replication origins. This is thought to reflect increased susceptibility of Cs to deamination when they are replicated in the more single-stranded context of the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lobry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grigoriev, 1998</xref>). The association of patterns of GC skew with replication origins is more firmly established in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes, because the presence of a single replication origin and terminus makes this subtle signature easier to discern.</p><p>Until recently, limitations of population-based measurements of replication initiation precluded identification of very low activity origins. However, the development of single-molecule nanopore-based techniques such as Fork-seq and D-Nascent have overcome these constraints, and studies employing these techniques have revealed many initiation events between known origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Müller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hennion et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Theulot et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, the fraction of initiations that occur outside of known replication origins has been reported to be as high as 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hennion et al., 2020</xref>). Given that the vast majority of these ‘extra-origin’ initiation events are detected as unique events in single-molecule studies, whether they reflect initiation from origins that are qualitatively similar to better characterized origins but are simply less active or, instead, reflect stochastic initiation events remains unclear. Thus, identification of further origins would benefit from a technique with higher throughput, to distinguish repeated use from stochastic events, while retaining the sensitivity required to distinguish very low activity origins from background noise.</p><p>We have previously shown that ‘chromatin endogenous cleavage’ (‘ChEC’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmid et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zentner et al., 2015</xref>) allows one to identify sites at which Mcm double hexamers have been loaded with both high resolution, revealing that Mcm complexes are present immediately on or adjacent to the ACS, and also high sensitivity, with Mcm complexes identified at almost all known origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foss et al., 2021</xref>). The sensitivity of this technique is due, at least in part, to the fact that it creates relatively short fragments of interest within a background of much longer PCR-recalcitrant fragments: When Mcm subunits are tagged on their C-terminal ends with micrococcal nuclease (MNase), cleavage of the DNA underneath complexes loaded at origins will release small (50–100 base pairs) fragments of DNA in a background of much larger (tens of kb) inter-origin fragments. Because these small fragments are more amenable to PCR amplification steps, one can create sequencing libraries that are composed almost exclusively of the fragments of interest without size-based purification.</p><p>Here, we apply the ChEC technique to identify candidate MCM binding sites (CMBSs), and we then ask how deeply we can proceed into the lower intensity ChEC signals while still finding evidence that these sites serve as replication origins. Using replication itself as a readout, by making use of previously published data measuring the generation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in S phase, we find evidence that the 1600 sites with the most intense ChEC signals are used as replication origins, with the magnitude of the ChEC signal corresponding to the level of ssDNA generated all the way down to the limits of detection of ssDNA. The next approximately 4000 peaks of ChEC signal continue to exhibit the hallmarks of replication origins described above, namely appearance in NFRs located in intergenic regions that are flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes and ACSs, and also a skewing of the numbers of Gs versus Cs. We conclude that low abundance sites of Mcm binding represent qualitatively similar, but less active, counterparts to better characterized origins of replication. This relaxation of the notion of what constitutes an origin of replication makes S phase in yeast resemble that in mammals more closely than has been previously thought.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of CMBSs that vary in abundance across three orders of magnitude</title><p>Our first goal was to determine, as comprehensively as possible, the genome-wide distribution of Mcm binding.

Briefly, we fused the C-terminus of either MCM2, MCM4, or MCM6 to MNase, permeabilized cells, activated the MNase with calcium, and prepared sequencing libraries without size fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As previously reported, the size distribution of the DNA fragments produced by MCM-MNase cleavage peaked at 61 base pairs, which corresponds to the length of DNA covered by the MCM double hexamer in cryo-EM studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In order to capture the most robust peaks, we analyzed a total of 12 samples, collected under a variety of conditions, including G1 arrest, hydroxyurea (HU) arrest, and log phase. Measurements were highly reproducible, with mean and median values for r<sup>2</sup> of 0.98 and 0.99, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Data sets derived from digestion with free MNase in G1-arrested cells are shown as controls (bottom rows within each panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foss et al., 2021</xref>). In ChIP-exo, the signal on the Watson and Crick strands are shown separately, because each strand serves to delineate just one edge of the protein binding site: Specifically, the right and left sides of the binding site correspond to the steep declines on the right side of the Watson (blue) strand and the left side Crick (red) strand, respectively, and computational algorithms that recognize these patterns in the two strands are used to integrate the signals and thereby define binding site midpoints. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows the distribution of read depths on chromosome IV centered at ARS1 at four different scales. Both ChEC- and ChIP-based techniques identified a common set of sites (top left panel), which correspond largely to known origins. The higher sensitivity of ChEC over ChIP derives from the lower background signal, which is evident at all four scales. The advantage in resolution of ChEC over ChIP is most clear at the 3 kb scale: While both ChEC and ChIP reveal a footprint at the midpoint of Mcm binding (yellow shaded area in bottom right panel), the fraction of the total signal at ARS1 (red rectangle) that is derived from this midpoint is much higher in the former case. Our ability to determine the location of Mcm relative to the ACS and thereby to potentially infer the directionality of loading, or to detect evidence for DNA replication in the form of GC skew (described below), would not be possible without this high level of resolution. In summary, we conclude that ChEC reveals known sites of Mcm binding with a high degree of both sensitivity and resolution.</p><p>We next used a peak identification algorithm to convert our continuous genome-wide measurements of Mcm binding activity into a discrete list of CMBSs. Because a central goal of this study was to explore the behavior of low abundance Mcm binding sites, we wanted to avoid arbitrarily specifying an abundance cutoff to distinguish meaningful low abundance binding sites from background noise. Instead, we chose to compile an exhaustive list of CMBSs, assigning approximately one per kb for the entire genome, and then retrospectively determine how far down this list we could go while still discerning known characteristics replication origins.</p><p>We used a simple iterative algorithm to generate a list of CMBSs, first creating a genome-wide per-base pair read depth matrix based on our 12 MCM-ChEC data sets and smoothing these values with a 200 base pair moving window. The highest peak in this data set was assigned a rank of 1. To avoid assigning multiple IDs to essentially the same peak, once a CMBS was assigned, we eliminated the region within 500 base pairs of the midpoint of that peak from consideration for the definition of further peaks before repeating the process to assign a CMBS with a rank of 2, etc., ultimately arriving at a list of 17,618 candidate sites (for details, see Materials and methods). CMBS signal magnitude exhibited a rapid decline over the course of the first 500 CMBSs, followed by a relatively gradual decline, punctuated by a slight inflection around 5500 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As discussed below, this inflection point coincides approximately with the point at which CMBSs no longer exhibit characteristics of replication origins. There were high abundance CMBSs (ranks ≤ 500) within 100 base pairs of 82% of origins reported in SGD (282 out of 343 unambiguously mapping origins). We note, however, that the regions defined as origins of replication in SGD tend to be significantly larger (mean size 290 base pairs) than the 61 base pairs occupied by an Mcm double hexamer. More precise origins’ midpoint coordinates can be assigned for that subset of origins that have a defined ACS (187 of 343), and in these cases, there were CMBSs within 100 base pairs of 78% (146 out of 187) of these ACSs. These 146 CMBSs, marked by blue vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, were all ranked among the most abundant 500. Thus, whether we use relaxed or stringent criteria for the coordinates of reported origins, we conclude that the vast majority of known origins are associated with the 500 most abundant CMBSs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Assessment of replication initiation at CMBSs</title><p>To determine how CMBSs correspond to sites where DNA replication initiates, irrespective of what has previously been defined as a replication origin, we used published data measuring the appearance of ssDNA during S phase in cells released from an alpha factor G1 block into medium containing HU, which impedes replication fork progression by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2006</xref>). To establish a benchmark for replication initiation, we first analyzed ssDNA accumulation at 181 well-characterized origins centered on their known ACSs and, as expected, we observed a peak of ssDNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, this peak was similar in both shape and magnitude to an analogous peak generated by juxtaposing the midpoints of the 200 most abundant CMBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, black line), which is expected, because the two groups are largely overlapping. Extending this line of analysis, we asked how far down in abundance we could go, in groups of 200, and still discern a signal of replication initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, colored lines). Two aspects of these results are notable: First, peaks of ssDNA signal, as judged by higher signal at the midpoints than the edges, extend down to the eighth cohort (brown line), which corresponds to CMBSs ranked 1401–1600. Of course, this does not imply that all of these sites function as replication origins, nor does it imply that no sites below that rank do so, since we have reached the limits of detection of this ssDNA-based assay. Nonetheless, it suggests that replication activity is common among sites extending at least down to rank 1600. Second, there is a rapid drop in ssDNA after the second cohort, demonstrating that the sharp drop in Mcm abundance shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> is recapitulated in a drop in replication activity. We have previously used southern blotting to demonstrate that approximately 90% of the DNA at one of the most active known origins (ARS1103) is cut by Mcm-MNase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foss et al., 2021</xref>), and to thereby infer that 90% of cells have a double helicase loaded at this origin. Combining this measurement with six additional measurements of licensing in cohort 1, we used linear regression (r<sup>2</sup>=0.7) to infer a median value of 69% for cohort 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the median abundance in the eighth cohort is 1.5% of that in the first cohort, we estimate that CMBSs in the eighth cohort are typically licensed in 1% of cells in the population (69% × 0.015=1.0%). <italic>rad53</italic> mutants are used here because they do not suppress firing of late origins, and therefore allow a more comprehensive assessment of origin activity. ssDNA measurements for both wild type and <italic>rad53</italic> genotypes at other time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as BrdU-based measurements of replication activity in <italic>rad53</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), yielded comparable results. We conclude that replication activity parallels Mcm abundance, and that this activity continues to be prevalent at least through the top 1600 CMBSs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Replication activity at known origins and Mcm binding sites.</title><p>Replication activity was assessed by generation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in <italic>rad53</italic> mutants released from G1 arrest into medium containing hydroxyurea (HU).

Linear regression using qPCR at seven origins allowed us to determine that the candidate MCM binding site (CMBS) with rank 100 is licensed at 69% (green lines), and thereby to infer that the CMBSs in the eighth cohort, whose median CMBS abundance is 1.5% of that of the first cohort, is licensed at approximately 1% (69% × 0.015=1.0%).

To determine whether these lower abundance sites, whose potential origin activity was below the limits of detection by ssDNA, might, nonetheless, function as replication origins, we assessed them for another hallmark of replication origins, namely their presence in intergenic NFRs. Nucleosome positions were determined based on published data that exploit site-directed mutagenesis to confer chemical cleavage activity to a histone subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chereji et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, residue 85 of histone H3 was changed from a glutamine to a cysteine. With two copies of H3 per histone octamer, each nucleosome ends up containing two of these engineered cysteines, with the two cysteines separated by a 51 base pair stretch of the DNA backbone centered on the nucleosome dyad. Ex vivo coupling of these residues to phenanthroline in the presence of copper ions and peroxide endows these cysteines with endonuclease activity, thereby releasing a 51 base pair fragment of DNA centered at the midpoint of the nucleosome, where the DNA is most tightly wrapped. High-throughput sequencing, followed by read depth profiling of library fragments in the 51 base pair range (46–56 base pairs), thus provides a high-resolution map of nucleosome positioning that is relatively robust to variable cleavage of the DNA due to unwrapping at nucleosome entry and exit sites. Heat maps of these data centered at the midpoints of the CMBSs reveal an approximately 150 base pair NFR, consistent with the size of NFRs at the known origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berbenetz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>), for the first 5000 CMBSs and their flanking nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, we observed a clear nucleosomal signal at the midpoints of most CMBSs that rank &gt;5000. To better characterize this transition from NFR to nucleosome, we analyzed cumulative chemical cleavage signal in cohorts of 500 successively ranking CMBSs centered at their midpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This analysis revealed a central valley of ChEC signal corresponding to the NFR in the first 10 cohorts (through 4501–5000), at which point we observe a gradual transition from central NFR to a predominantly nucleosomal signal at the midpoint, which is complete by the 14th cohort (ranks 6501–7000). These findings indicate that most of the low abundance (rank &gt;5000) CMBSs correspond to nucleosomes, presumably due to low-level non-specific MNase activity. Mapping of nucleosome locations by enzymatic digestion of chromatin with MNase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foss et al., 2021</xref>) confirmed these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is notable that, when Mcm is present, it is present predominantly as a single double hexamer (based on the size of the protected region in the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and that this remains true across the entire range of abundance shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. This argues against models in which higher replication activity at more active origins is caused by the loading of more Mcm double hexamers at those origins within a single cell, since such models predict that multiple Mcm footprints should be more prevalent at the top (high abundance) of the Mcm-ChEC heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> than at the bottom. We conclude that nucleosome mapping studies using two orthogonal methods demonstrate a fundamental difference between the first 5000 CMBSs, which are located in the NFR and are flanked by adjacent nucleosomes, from those that rank &gt;5000, which largely correspond to nucleosomes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Most abundant 5500 peaks of MCM-chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC) signal are located predominantly in nucleosome-free regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left heat map shows 46–56 base pair fragments marking nucleosome dyads that were generated by ex vivo nuclease activity of H3Q85C coupled to phenanthroline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chereji et al., 2018</xref>).

As expected, the most abundant sites, which contain most of the known origins of replication, were located predominantly between rather than within genes (89% of sites ranked ≤ 500 were intergenic). Furthermore, in those instances when high abundance sites were located within genes, those genes were frequently non-transcribed. For example, 15 of the 56 genes that contained a high abundance site have been implicated in meiosis and sporulation and are not expressed during vegetative growth (~5 out of 56 expected from random sampling), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mori and Shirahige, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blitzblau et al., 2012</xref>). CMBSs remained largely intergenic with decreasing abundance until approximately rank 5000, at which point they switched rather abruptly to genic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, the level of transcription of genes that contained CMBSs showed an abrupt increase at this same point. This coincides approximately with the point at which sites transition from nucleosome-free to nucleosome-occupied regions. Thus, the first 5000 ranking CMBSs, in addition to being located in the NFR, are also largely intergenic, or located within poorly transcribed genes, whereas the CMBSs that rank &gt;5000 correspond largely to nucleosomal signal within transcribed genes. Such a distribution of ChEC signal can be appreciated throughout the genome, with most intergenic fragments featuring a clear high-ranking ChEC signal within their NFR (black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), whereas the low abundance signal within gene corresponds to nucleosomes (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Locations of candidate MCM binding sites (CMBSs) with respect to locations and both levels and directions of transcription of adjacent genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Continuous curve shows number of CMBSs, from a sliding window of 50, that are located within gene bodies.

Lower abundance intergenic MCM signals (ranks between 500 and 4000) showed a distinct preference for divergent over convergent transcription of flanking genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is the opposite of what would be expected if these helicase complexes were loaded within gene bodies and then pushed out by transcription. Furthermore, this is consistent with our observation that these sites are flanked by ACSs (see below). In contrast to the low abundance sites, the most abundant 500 sites showed a preference for convergent over divergent transcription (left of vertical dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">MacAlpine and Bell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2014</xref>). While this might be interpreted to suggest displacement of helicase complexes by transcription, our published ChEC analysis of Mcm locations at origins with defined ACSs, all of which fall within the most abundant 500 sites, demonstrates that these helicases are found almost exclusively immediately adjacent to the ACS. In summary, we favor the parsimonious view that Mcm complexes are initially loaded within the same NFRs in which we have localized them through ChEC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mcm binding sites are flanked by ACSs, and Mcm is loaded downstream of known ACSs</title><p>Another characteristic of known origins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (although not in most other organisms) that we could use as a criterion to assess the nature of Mcm binding sites is the presence of an ACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broach et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kearsey, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Srienc et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deshpande and Newlon, 1992</xref>). The ACS is a loosely defined AT-rich 11–17 base pair sequence whose directionality is determined on the basis of the relative numbers of As versus Ts in the two strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breier et al., 2004</xref>). This sequence is recognized by the Orc, a six-protein complex that loads MCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newlon and Theis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berbenetz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eaton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singh and Krishnamachari, 2016</xref>). Although the characteristics that allow a sequence to serve as an Orc binding site remain poorly understood, with, for example, only approximately half of the origins listed in SGD reporting associated ACS signals, researchers have calculated a probability weight matrix to evaluate the fidelity of the correspondence of any 17 base pair sequence with a hypothetically ‘perfect’ ACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>). Because the ACS is asymmetric, these scores are calculated separately for the Watson and Crick strands (shown in blue and red, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Using this metric, we found that the most abundant 5500 CMBSs are enriched for flanking ACSs, approximately 35 base pairs from the midpoint of Mcm binding. Furthermore, these ACSs are oriented in a direction consistent with that expected from in vitro loading of Mcm complexes by Orc. Finally, the degree to which these sequences match a hypothetically perfect ACS decreases with increasing rank (i.e. with decreasing abundance), largely disappearing by rank 6000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Our results allowed us to explore the question of whether individual Mcm binding sites contain two Orc binding sites or whether, instead, the cumulative high scores on both sides of CMBSs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> reflect the juxtaposition of multiple unoriented sites, each of which contains just one Orc binding site. This issue has implications for the mechanism by which Orc loads two hexameric helicases and for the design of biochemical experiments aimed at elucidating that mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupta et al., 2021</xref>).

In interpreting the results above, it is important to remember that the locations at which we are detecting Mcm complexes by ChEC do not necessarily reflect the locations at which those complexes were loaded, since Mcm double hexamers can slide along the DNA after loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rando and Chang, 2009</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gros et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foss et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, in the case of ARS1, two reports have demonstrated a requirement for the B2 element for Mcm loading, though not for Orc binding, suggesting that Orc may bind to the ACS but then load Mcm at the B2 element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zou and Stillman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lipford and Bell, 2001</xref>). This would still leave Mcm loaded downstream of the ACS, but we note this result to emphasize that not all details of Mcm loading in vitro have been definitively established. In summary, our results not only provide in vivo support for in vitro predictions of the directionality of Mcm loading by Orc, but they are also consistent with the notion that essentially all of the most abundant 5500 Mcm binding sites can function, at least on rare occasions, as replication origins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>GC skew as evolutionary footprint of replication initiation</title><p>GC skew, which is a measure of the deviation from the expected 1:1 ratio of Gs to Cs along a single strand of DNA, suggests another potential metric to determine whether sites have been used as replication origins. GC skew is calculated as (G-C)/(G+C), with G and C representing the numbers of Gs and Cs, respectively, within a specified window sliding along a single strand of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lobry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grigoriev, 1998</xref>). Consistent use of particular sequences as replication origins over long time scales can leave evolutionary ‘footprints’ in which an excess of Gs over Cs reverses to become an excess of Cs over Gs as one traverses the site of initiation of replication. Such reversals of GC skew reflect the combination of: (1) the transition between leading and lagging strand synthesis precisely where DNA replication initiates; (2) the fact that the template for lagging strand synthesis exists in a single-stranded state more than does the template for leading strand synthesis; (3) the increased vulnerability of cytosines to deaminases when in a single-stranded state; and (4) replication-induced conversion of deaminated cytosine to thymine. This phenomenon has been best characterized in bacteria, where the presence of a single origin and terminus of replication on each circular chromosome ensures that, at any particular location in the genome, each strand of DNA consistently serves as a template for exclusively either the leading or the lagging strand polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu and Salzberg, 2020</xref>). A change in GC skew across origins has also been reported in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2014</xref>), but the magnitude of the effect is small, and the direction of the effect is contrary to both the observation in bacteria and the theoretical expectation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine whether sites identified by MCM-ChEC exhibited patterns of GC skew consistent with their use as replication origins, we aligned 400 base pair sequences centered on the 5500 most abundant CMBSs and calculated GC skew using a 51 base pair sliding window. This analysis revealed a general rise in GC skew as one follows either strand in the 5' to 3' direction across the CMBS, a result that is consistent with both the theoretical expectation and the empirical observation in bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Subdividing CMBSs into groups of 1100 and arranging these groups according to decreasing abundance revealed that GC-skew-based evidence for DNA replication initiation continued until approximately rank 6000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Our ability to detect this subtle effect requires precise alignment at the midpoint of Mcm double-hexamer binding, as alignment of identical sequences according to the ACS does not recapitulate the result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). A short inversion of this pattern at the midpoint is consistent with biochemical results showing that the two Mcm hexamers cross over each other before they begin diverging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>) (see Discussion). We conclude that the distortion of the expected 1:1 ratio of Gs to Cs on a single strand of DNA is consistent with the hypotheses that the most abundant 6000 CMBSs have served as replication origins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Average GC skew increases across the midpoints of the most abundant 5500 peaks of MCM-chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC) signal.</title><p>GC skew was calculated according to the numbers of Gs and Cs in the Watson strand along a 51 base pair moving window, as (G–C)/(G+C); the skew value plotted corresponds to the score at the midpoint of that window.

Not surprisingly, given the assay by which it was discovered, ARS1 is among the most active origins in the genome. Over the subsequent 25 years, this simple assay for origin activity led to numerous other genomic sequences being designated as origins, with the number stabilizing at around 500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nieduszynski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siow et al., 2012</xref>). While few of these origins are as efficient as ARS1, all must exhibit replication activity sufficient to support colony formation. For example, origins that fire in only 1 in 10 S phases will not produce even a microcolony in a plasmid transformation assay, and therefore will not be detected. Thus, the set of known origins is largely restricted to those with relatively high activity. This conclusion is consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, in which the known (light blue) origins are strikingly concentrated on the left (high abundance) side of the curve.</p><p>We used MCM-ChEC to identify a more comprehensive set of replication origins. In this approach, we first identify sites at which Mcm helicases are loaded and then subsequently examine those sites for characteristics of replication origins. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, replication itself. There are four advantages to this approach: First, the ChEC assay is exceptionally sensitive because, as noted in the Introduction, the short DNA fragments of interest enjoy a tremendous selective advantage for amplification during PCR steps involved in library construction. Thus, we can detect Mcm complexes that are loaded in as few as 1 in 500 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foss et al., 2021</xref>), even though such low affinity Mcm binding sites are not expected to be capable of supporting autonomous replication of a plasmid. Second, by averaging signals of replication from multiple Mcm binding sites, we were able to extract weak signals of replication. This is due to the fact that noise, which is randomly distributed, will tend to cancel itself out, while signals of replication will consistently augment the signal at the midpoint of the origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). An inevitable shortcoming to this approach is that it precludes analysis of specific sites; in other words, not every member of the group will share the average characteristic of that group. Third, even beyond the level of detection possible through direct measurements of replication, such as generation of ssDNA, we were able to infer past replication activity from the subtle evolutionary signatures of replication that manifest themselves in GC skew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The ability to detect these evolutionary footprints is exquisitely sensitive to the precision with which DNA sequences can be aligned to the site of replication initiation, where the bias in Gs to Cs reverses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, we were able to use the power of averaging signals from multiple Mcm binding sites to extract not only direct (ssDNA) and indirect (GC skew) metrics of replication, but also to discern other characteristics of replication origins, namely their appearance in intergenic NFRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) with flanking ACS signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>It is notable that multiple criteria converge on the conclusion that the total number of replication origins is approximately 5500 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>): For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (left heat map), one can see the chemical cleavage nucleosomes signature transitioning from relatively sharp to fuzzy at rank 5000. This transition is recapitulated in the MNase-seq-based nucleosome assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and in the MCM-ChEC signal itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right heat map). Furthermore, it is in this same general region, i.e., from ranks 4000 to 6000, that: (1) CMBSs transition from being mostly intergenic to mostly genic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>); (2) transcription levels for genes that contain CMBSs rise sharply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>); (3) position weight matrix scores for ACSs decrease sharply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>); and (4) transitions in GC skew across peak midpoints disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Of course, we do not conclude that all CMBSs with ranks lower than 5500 function as replication origins, nor that none with ranks above 5500 do so, but only that the number of replication origins is likely to be approximately an order of magnitude higher than widely believed. Furthermore, it is possible that, as one moves to lower abundance groups of CMBSs within the most abundant 5500 sites, a smaller fraction of sites within those groups have any origin function at all. If one takes this model to the extreme, it would suggest that the continuous decline in replication activity seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> between the group comprised of ranks 1–200 and that comprised of ranks 1401–1600 reflects an ever-increasing fraction of CMBSs with zero origin activity. At the other extreme, the decline in replication activity could be interpreted within a framework in which 100% of CMBSs in each group function as replication origins, but that their replication activity declines with rank, perhaps because continuously decreasing fractions of cells in the population contain a single double hexamer. While the truth presumably lies between these two extremes, we favor a model that tilts toward the latter view, because of the abruptness of the transition that appears around rank 5000 in: (1) nucleosomal architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>); (2) intergenic versus genic localization and transcription levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>); (3) EACS position weight matrix scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>); and (4) GC skew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). By these criteria, the most abundant 5000 CMBSs appear relatively homogeneous, while still showing a gradual decline in replication activity with MCM abundance within the range of detection (1–1600). Our assumption is that the qualitative homogeneity is more consistent with a quantitative, but not qualitative, change in CMBSs with declining MCM abundance among the top 5000 CMBSs. Finally, it is important to note that, in equating Mcm binding sites with potential replication origins, we are assuming that if an Mcm double hexamer is loaded onto the DNA, then it is conceivable that that complex can be activated. With approximately 6000 genes in the yeast genome, this would suggest that replication can initiate, if only rarely, in essentially every intergenic region. Cumulatively, 500 most abundant peaks of ChEC signal, which contain most of the known replication origins, comprise 85% of the abundance of total 5500 peaks, which we propose serve as likely replication origins. This distribution of MCM abundance is consistent with that of replication initiation from two single-molecule nanopore-based studies, which found that 9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hennion et al., 2020</xref>) and 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Müller et al., 2019</xref>) of replication initiates outside the known replication origins. Our study also suggests that ~15% of replication initiation is distributed among 5000 sites, which can explain why most of these initiation events appear unique in single-molecule studies.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Estimates of total number of origins by different criteria (estimates from all but first two rows rely on candidate MCM binding sites [CMBSs] from this report).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Criterion</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Estimate of number of origins</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SGD classification</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">354 (343 of which map unambiguously)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">OriDB classification</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">829 (410 confirmed, 216 likely, 203 dubious)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generation of ssDNA in HU</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1600</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BrdU incorporation</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1400</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nucleosome-free regions</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transition from mostly intergenic to mostly genic</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transition from low transcription genic to high transcription genic</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ACS motif</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GC skew</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">6000</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In addition to their ramifications about the number of sites from which replication initiates, our results have implications regarding the mechanism by which this occurs at individual sites. First, the high resolution of our approach allowed us to demonstrate that Mcm is typically loaded downstream of the ACS, something that has been demonstrated in vitro, but that researchers have thus far been unable to confirm in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dukaj and Rhind, 2021</xref>). Specifically, in 112 out of 146 instances in which a peak of Mcm signal was within 100 base pairs of a known ACS, that peak was downstream of the ACS. The 34 exceptions may reflect: (1) incorrect identification of the ACS; (2) incorrect inference of the directionality of the site; or (3) sliding of the Mcm complex after it has been loaded. In interpreting these results, it is important to keep in mind that the relationship between the theoretical consensus sequence for Orc binding (i.e. the ACS) and the actual sequence to which Orc binds is so weak that approximately half of the origins reported in SGD do not have a corresponding ACS specified. Second, while we observed a general increase in GC skew across Mcm binding sites, there was a short but obvious reversal in the trend precisely at the midpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This feature is consistent with the in vitro observation that Mcm single hexamers are loaded such that they must cross over each other before diverging in bidirectional replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Douglas et al., 2018</xref>). Given that both the location and the size of the inflection are consistent with this hypothesis, we favor this explanation. Finally, as we have noted previously, peaks of Mcm binding typically reflect the binding of just one double hexamer, with no trend toward larger numbers of double hexamers being bound at a single origin in a single cell when moving toward higher activity origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, Mcm-ChEC heat map). This is inconsistent with models in which higher origin activity is achieved by loading of more Mcm complexes in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das and Rhind, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dukaj and Rhind, 2021</xref>). In summary, we conclude that: (1) replication at individual origins occurs as predicted in vitro, with Mcm complexes loaded downstream of the ACS in a configuration such that they must cross over each other; and (2) part of control of origin activity that operates at the level of origin licensing is exerted by modulation of the fraction of cells in a population that have a single double hexamer bound to an origin, rather than the through variation of the number of double hexamers that are bound to individual sites in a single cell.</p><p>One potentially unexpected aspect of the change in GC skew that we observed across Mcm binding sites was the fact that the pattern was visible not just among the most abundant 1100 member cohort CMBSs, which included the most active origins, but continued to be evident, though to a lesser degree, all the way down to the fifth cohort (ranks 4401–5500), comprising the least active origins. We suggest that either or both of the following possibilities may cause even very low activity origins to leave an evolutionary footprint of replication initiation: (1) the depletion of cytosines through deamination-mediated conversion to thymines may function as a unidirectional ‘ratchet’, fixing changes to permanence even if they occur only rarely; and (2) the relative activity of different yeast origins may be in continual flux over evolutionary time frames, such that origins that are currently barely active were not always so.</p><p>Over the last 40 years, the field of eukaryotic DNA replication has been built largely on a foundation of discoveries made in budding yeast. Yeast’s strength as a model organism came in large part because it made available short DNA sequences capable of serving as efficient replication origins. On the other hand, the sharply focused nature of its replication origins made S phase in yeast appear distinct from that in other organisms. Although by no means eliminating this distinction, our discovery that sites of replication initiation in yeast are much more widely dispersed than previously believed, with at least 1600 and possibly as many as 5500 origins, emphasizes yeast’s continued relevance to understanding S phase in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, S288c)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16535</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antonio Bedalov, Fred <break/>Hutch Cancer Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16535</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mat A, his3, leu2, met15, <break/>ura3, hmla:: HYG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, S288c)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16747</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antonio Bedalov, Fred <break/>Hutch Cancer Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16747</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mat A, his3, leu2, met15, ura3, hmla:: HYG, <break/>with MCM2 MNase 3xFlag Tag with KanMx</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, S288c)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16753</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antonio Bedalov, Fred <break/>Hutch Cancer Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16753</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mat A, his3, leu2, met15, ura3, hmla:: HYG, <break/>with MCM6 MNase 3xFlag Tag with KanMx</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, S288c)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16754</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antonio Bedalov, Fred <break/>Hutch Cancer Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16754</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mat A, his3, leu2, met15, ura3, hmla:: HYG, <break/>with MCM6 MNase 3xFlag Tag with KanMx</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, S288c)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16749</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antonio Bedalov, Fred <break/>Hutch Cancer Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16749</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mat A, his3, leu2, met15, ura3, hmla:: HYG, <break/>with MCM4 MNase 3xFlag Tag with KanMx</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, S288c)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16964</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antonio Bedalov, Fred <break/>Hutch Cancer Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> 16964</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mat A, his3, leu2, ura3, met15, hmla::NAT, <break/>MCM2 3x Flag Mnase tag with KanMX</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain and plasmid construction and growth conditions</title><p>HU arrest in budding yeast was carried out by adding 200 mM HU to logarithmically growing cultures for 50 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sequencing</title><p>Sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in Rapid mode employing a paired-end, 50 base read length (PE50) sequencing strategy.

Briefly, cells grown to log phase in rich medium, Yeast Peptone Agar with 2% glucose (YEPD), from an overnight 25 mL culture were synchronized with 3 μM alpha factor for 1.5 hr at 30°C. Arrested cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature water bath with shaking. Formaldehyde was quenched with 125 mM glycine and cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with water and resuspended in 1.5 mL Buffer Z (1 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4) with 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol (1.1 μL of 14.3 M beta-mercaptoethanol diluted 1:10 in Buffer Z) per 25 mL culture. Cells were treated with 100 μL 20 mg/mL zymolyase at 30°C for 20–30 min depending on cell density. Spheroplasts were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in 5 mL NP buffer (1 M sorbitol, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) supplemented with 500 μM spermidine, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, and 0.075% NP-40. Nuclei were aliquoted in tubes with varying concentrations of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington), mixed via tube inversion, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Chromatin digested with 1.9–7.5 U micrococcal nuclease per 1/5th of spheroplasts from a 25 mL culture yielded appropriate mono-, di-, tri-nucleosome protected fragments for next-generation sequencing. Digestion was stopped with freshly made 5× stop buffer (5% SDS, 50 mM EDTA) and proteinase K was added (0.2 mg/mL final concentration) for an overnight incubation at 65°C to reverse crosslinking. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Micrococcal nuclease digestion was analyzed via gel electrophoresis prior to proceeding to library preparation. Sequencing libraries were prepared as described above for ChEC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of nucleosome chemical cleavage data</title><p>Numbers were derived from 46 to 56 base pair library fragments from bwa-aligned SRR5399542 fastq files (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chereji et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of genic versus intergenic regions</title><p>Coordinates for gene bodies were based on the ‘SGD_features.tab’ file, available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yeastgenome.org">https://www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>EACS-PWM analysis</title><p>EACS-PWM scores were based on the following position-weight matrix (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coster and Diffley, 2017</xref>).</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Position A C G T</p></list-item><list-item><p>1 0.288 0.097 0.052 0.563</p></list-item><list-item><p>2 0.451 0.021 0.052 0.476</p></list-item><list-item><p>3 0.236 0.028 0.028 0.708</p></list-item><list-item><p>4 0.253 0.007 0.097 0.642</p></list-item><list-item><p>5 0.052 0.000 0.000 0.948</p></list-item><list-item><p>6 0.038 0.007 0.003 0.951</p></list-item><list-item><p>7 0.160 0.073 0.007 0.760</p></list-item><list-item><p>8 0.969 0.000 0.000 0.031</p></list-item><list-item><p>9 0.087 0.177 0.000 0.736</p></list-item><list-item><p>10 0.288 0.056 0.576 0.080</p></list-item><list-item><p>11 0.066 0.000 0.017 0.917</p></list-item><list-item><p>12 0.000 0.000 0.000 1.000</p></list-item><list-item><p>13 0.000 0.007 0.000 0.993</p></list-item><list-item><p>14 0.517 0.000 0.014 0.469</p></list-item><list-item><p>15 0.021 0.056 0.708 0.215</p></list-item><list-item><p>16 0.076 0.076 0.295 0.552</p></list-item><list-item><p>17 0.104 0.125 0.045 0.726</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of GC skew</title><p>GC skew was calculated according to the numbers of Gs and Cs in the Watson strand along a 51 base pair moving window, as (G-C)/(G+C).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-88087-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode1"><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>Perl script to run as first step in quantifying paired-end reads such that one infers the entire library insert.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-88087-code1-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode2"><label>Source code 2.</label><caption><title>Perl script to run as second step in quantifying paired-end reads such that one infers the entire library insert.</title><p>This will provide quantitation along the entire library insert.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-88087-code2-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode3"><label>Source code 3.</label><caption><title>Perl script to run as second step in quantifying paired-end reads such that one infers the entire library insert.</title><p>This will provide quantitation for only the midpoint of each library insert.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-88087-code3-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All high-throughput sequencing data have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO;

The authors need to come up with a consistent name for loaded Mcms at an origin. In the manuscript they variously use 'MCM'(page 3), 'Mcm complexes' (page 4), 'MCM double hexamer' (page 6), and 'double-helicase' (page 8) to describe the Mcm2-7 complexes detected in their ChEC experiments. They should pick one name (Mcm2-7 double hexamer or MCM double hexamer would be the most accurate and clear) and stick with it throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the criticism and agree that consistency is important for clarity, thus we tried using the term &quot;Mcm2-7 double hexamer&quot; in every instance in which we refer to Mcm loaded at an origin. However, upon reading the resulting manuscript, we felt that these changes hurt readability more than they helped with clarity, so we left the manuscript in its original form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors state that &quot;It is notable that, when Mcm is present, it is present predominantly as a single doublehexamer (right panel of Figure 3A), and that this remains true across the entire range of abundance shown in Figure 3A.&quot; This statement would be improved by prefacing it with &quot;Based on the size of the protected regions&quot; or some other clarifying statement that lets the reader know what they should be looking for in the data in 3A.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestion.

The revised statements that &quot;We have previously used Southern blotting to demonstrate that approximately 90% of the DNA at one of the most active known origins (ARS1103) is cut by Mcm-MNase (Foss et al., 2021), and to thereby infer that 90% of cells have a double- helicase loaded at this origin. Using this as a benchmark, we estimate that ~1-2% cells have an Mcm complex loaded at the Mcm binding sites in the eighth cohort (ranks 1401- 1600).&quot; partially clarifies how the authors came to the 1-2% number, however, the calculation is still unclear. Based on Figure 1A, there are at least three logs (1,00 fold) difference in the number of CBMSs between the best origins (which is what they state the 90% comes from) to anywhere close to the 1400-1600 rank. Seems like the number should be at best 0.1% and probably less. Either way, the authors need to explain this calculation either in the text or in the text. This sort of number tends to get thrown around later and without a clear explanation readers cannot evaluate its credibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for insufficiently clarifying how we arrived at our estimate of licensing. We believe that we have now remedied this, both by incorporating more measurements of licensing to improve our accuracy and by expanding the text to make our calculation unambiguous. We have added a supplemental figure showing the linear regression, based on 7 qPCR-based measurements of licensing, that we used to determine the median level of licensing of the first cohort of 200, and the altered text in the main text reads as follows:</p><p>We have previously used Southern blotting to demonstrate that approximately 90% of the DNA at one of the most active known origins (ARS1103) is cut by Mcm-MNase (Foss et al. 2021), and to thereby infer that 90% of cells have a double-helicase loaded at this origin. Combining this measurement with 6 additional measurements of licensing in cohort 1, we used linear regression (r2=0.7) to infer a median value of 69% for cohort 1. Because the median abundance in the 8th cohort is 1.5% of that in the first cohort, we estimate that CMBSs in the 8th cohort are typically licensed in 1% of cells in the population (69% x 0.015 = 1.0%).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors make the point in the introduction and discussion that recent single-molecule studies of replication origins indicate that as many as 20% of the origins identified are outside of known origins. This is very interesting but there seems to be a missed opportunity of comparing the location of these origins with the CBMSs. It would improve the manuscript to include some sort of comparison rather than using only the much older and less accurate ssDNA analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, coverage and resolution with nanopore-based single-molecule precludes such an analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors state at the end of the first paragraph on page 6 that the ChEC data is &quot;very reproducible&quot; which does seem to be the case but it is a little confusing for the knowledgeable reader since one would expect quite different results for an HU arrested strain versus a asynchronous or G1 arrested strain. This is hidden in the analysis in Figure S1 since 13 experiments are compared against one in each plot, however, if one x one comparisons were done there would certainly be substantial differences (or if there are not, there is a problem with the data - e.g. HU arrested cells should lack licensing at early firing origins).</p></disp-quote><p>It may appear counterintuiAve that one could obtain high r2 values when comparing G1 and HU-arrested samples. However, HU arrest was performed by transferring log phase cultures to 200 mM HU and harvesting cells after just 50 minutes. In this situation, most cells will be in G1 or very early S phase. Presumably, increasing times of incubation in HU would cause r2 values to decline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. On page 8 the authors state, &quot;First, clear peaks of ssDNA extend down to the eighth cohort...&quot; This seems to be stretching the data. There are clear peaks for the first five cohorts and then there is a notable change with any peak being much broader, extending over at least 10,000 bp. The authors should reconsider their statement here as it is not well supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have softened our language to the following: First, peaks of ssDNA signal, as judged by higher signal at the midpoints than the edges, extend down to the eighth cohort (brown line), which corresponds to CMBSs ranked 1401-1600.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
