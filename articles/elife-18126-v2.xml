referred to as the Warburg effect. Models mimicking this process are often incomplete due to genetic complexities of tumors and cell lines containing unmapped collaborating mutations. In order to establish a system where individual components of oncogenic signals and metabolic pathways can be readily elucidated, we induced a glycolytic tumor in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc by activating the oncogene PDGF/VEGF-receptor (Pvr). This causes activation of multiple oncogenic pathways including Ras, PI3K/Akt, Raf/ERK, Src and JNK. Together this network of genes stabilizes Hifα (Sima) that in turn, transcriptionally up-regulates many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. Collectively, this network of genes also causes inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity resulting in diminished ox-phos levels. The high ROS produced during this process functions as a feedback signal to consolidate this metabolic reprogramming.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18126.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18126.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>warburg effect</kwd><kwd>Pvr</kwd><kwd>hypoxia-inducible factor</kwd><kwd>LDH</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship (#PF-10-130-01-DDC)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Kevin T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-EY008152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>Utpal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A Drosophila tumor model reveals how the activation of an oncogenic pathway can lead to both tumor growth and a reprogramming of metabolism known as the Warberg effect.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During cancer formation, developing tumor cells acquire multiple biological capabilities that ultimately lead to malignancy. These events include, sustained proliferation, resistance to cell death, induction of angiogenesis, cellular metastasis and a reprogrammed energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pavlova and Thompson, 2016</xref>). Warburg discovered that many cancer cells reprogram their glucose metabolism by transitioning from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Warburg, 1956a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">1956b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>). Such a metabolic state was termed 'aerobic glycolysis' and the ability of cancer cells to acquire this new metabolic state has since been referred to as the 'Warburg effect'. The phenomenon was understudied for decades, as it became clear, that contrary to Warburg’s assertions, cancers were largely attributable to oncogenes and tumor suppressors, rather than to exclusive changes in metabolic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huebner and Todaro, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stehelin et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Knudson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shih and Weinberg, 1982</xref>). However, more recent studies have explored the link between metabolic processes and oncogenesis, and have noted that altered metabolism is an important element that contributes to the etiology of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pavlova and Thompson, 2016</xref>). Drugs targeting key regulators of aerobic glycolysis are being developed to be included in the cancer therapy regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Weinberg and Chandel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galluzzi et al., 2013</xref>). Several oncogenic pathways, including PI3K/TOR, JNK, Ras/ERK, regulate the catalytic activity or expression of key metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chambers and LoGrasso, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones and Thompson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps not any longer universally supported by modern evidence in cancer-metabolism, Warburg had also proposed that cancer cells undergo a glycolytic shift for the purpose of generating the bioenergetic makeup of the rapidly dividing cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Warburg, 1956a</xref>). Pyruvate is the key metabolite that is used to control the last step of glycolysis in a tumor, and in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate is converted to lactate. In contrast, oxidative phosphorylation requires the mitochondrial enzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, essential for the initiation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Linn et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leiter et al., 1978</xref>). PDH is rendered inactive when it is phosphorylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) and is activated when dephosphorylated by the phosphatase, PDHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowker-Kinley et al., 1998</xref>). Many cancers maintain high ox-phos as well as glycolysis, maximizing the anapleuretic functions of the cell that provide the building blocks for lipid, protein and nucleotide synthesis.</p><p>The mammalian transcription factor, Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (Hif-1α; called Sima or Hifα in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), regulates a number of target genes that promote various aspects of cancer, including metabolism, angiogenesis, cell survival, drug resistance, and invasive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wykoff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carmeliet et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ryan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pennacchietti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ema et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Semenza, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dang and Semenza, 1999</xref>). Hif-1α participates in this process as hypoxia favors glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation for ATP generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keith and Simon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertout et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dang and Semenza, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Hypoxia has been the proposed mechanism for oncogenes to effect a change in metabolic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Finley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Ying et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Levine and Puzio-Kuter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukuda et al., 2002</xref>). Mammalian studies often involve immortalized cell-lines with a variable and often unknown genetic background. Furthermore, while initiation of glycolysis has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>), the mechanism for the maintenance of the altered metabolic state under normoxic conditions is not as clear. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model system, we provide here, a complete genetic dissection of one mechanism that leads to and sustains a metabolic reprogramming in which Hifα, but not hypoxia, plays an important role.</p><p>Hif-1α and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are associated together in many tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Comerford et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laderoute et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2013</xref>). It is well established that reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and peroxide radicals can cause both activation of the JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>) and stabilization of Hif-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dröge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandel et al., 2000</xref>). It is increasingly apparent that persistent activation of JNK signaling is involved in cancer development, progression and perhaps cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Manning and Davis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Raitano et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Smeal et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wagner and Nebreda, 2009</xref>). In addition to the above functions, it is likely that JNK could have an indirect role in attenuating oxidative phosphorylation by activating PDHK, thus blocking PDH function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">2008</xref>). Determining how a variety of oncogenic pathways interact together to cause the metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis is the central focus of this investigation. We achieve this by activating a single oncogene and show that this leads to a cascade of events that ultimately cause a glycolytic activation and allow maintenance of this altered metabolic state. There are multiple ways to model the 'Warburg effect'. This study takes advantage of the powerful genetic techniques in <italic>Drosophila</italic> used to identify epistatic relationships to provide a comprehensive and mechanistic basis for the establishment and maintenance of this metabolic transition in a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) induced tumor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LDH activation and transcription by a specific RTK</title><p>Aerobic glycolysis in tumors is characterized by the conversion of pyruvate to lactate by the enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Importantly, LDH has been demonstrated to be a marker for poor prognosis in multiple malignancies such as renal cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains a single gene encoding an LDH enzyme (<italic>ImpL3</italic>), and biochemical studies demonstrate that it functions most like LDHA, the human form predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle that favors the conversion of pyruvate to lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rechsteiner, 1970</xref>). An increase in LDHA enzymatic activity has been observed in diverse malignant cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dang and Semenza, 1999</xref>).</p><p>We adapted a classic biochemical enzymatic assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Shumays and Fristrom, 1997</xref>) to visualize the activity of LDH in vivo.

Using the Gal4/UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>) to individually activate oncogenes in the wing disc, we found that the activated PDGF/VEGF receptor (known as Pvr) causes robust LDH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) while many other oncogenes do not (see later).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18126.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>LDH</italic> induction by a single activated oncogene.</title><p>Wing discs are from wandering third instar larvae.

However, <italic>LDH</italic> is not expressed in every tumor that shows increased cell proliferation and over-growth. For example, over-expression of the secreted ligand, Wingless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Neumann and Cohen, 1996</xref>), causes overgrowth and duplication of the tissue but does not cause <italic>LDH</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Similarly, overexpression of the JAK/STAT pathway ligand Unpaired (Upd), promotes tissue growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rodrigues et al., 2012</xref>), but does not induce <italic>LDH</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). The transcription factor Yorkie is a potent growth-promoting signal in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), but at best, it induces very weak and variable expression of <italic>LDH-GFP</italic> in the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). These results indicate that the up-regulation of LDH by Pvr is not a general consequence of stepped up cell proliferation seen in all tumors.</p><p>Furthermore, given Pvr’s function as an RTK, it was initially a surprise to find that neither constitutively signaling form of the insulin receptor (InR<sup>act</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>) nor the activated form of epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr<sup>act</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>) can induce <italic>LDH-GFP</italic> expression even though both cause significant overgrowth of the tissue. This observed specificity of Pvr, compared with other RTKs, in the expression of <italic>LDH</italic>, presents a unique opportunity for investigating the mechanism by which an oncogene can regulate the metabolism of a tumor tissue.</p><p>Hif-1α is a well-known inducer of LDHA expression in many cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dang and Semenza, 1999</xref>). As with the mammalian counterpart, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hifα (called Sima) is rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions and therefore no Sima protein is detected in the wild-type wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), but Sima protein is stabilized in a Pvr<sup>act</sup> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Overexpression of Sima (but not of a Sima mutant lacking its DNA binding domain) robustly induces both LDH activity and expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). It also causes growth defects, similar to the phenotypes of the <italic>Hph</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Centanin et al., 2005</xref>). These growth defects associated with gross overactivity of Sima are likely independent of its role in hypoxia related responses.</p><p>Importantly, <italic>LDH</italic> expression induced by Pvr<sup>act</sup> is strongly suppressed upon silencing <italic>sima</italic> using either one of two independent transgenic RNAi constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>). Thus, Sima is essential for LDH induction by Pvr<sup>act</sup>. Knockdown of <italic>sima</italic> does suppress some of the overgrowth caused by Pvr<sup>act</sup>, but this effect is small (about a 20% reduction in volume. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and the tumor-growth loss is clearly not as robust as the complete loss of <italic>LDH-GFP</italic> seen using the same knockdown construct. We conclude that tumor growth is a result of multiple interacting events, and blocking glycolysis alone will not be sufficient to fully rescue the growth of a tumor.</p><p>The Pvr induced tumor is characterized by unrestrained, disorganized growth, and in principle, one mechanism for Sima stabilization could involve the hypoxic environment that might exist within the disorganized mass of a tumor tissue. Examples of such a mechanism in which deeper tissues within solid tumors become hypoxic have been demonstrated in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertout et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keith and Simon, 2007</xref>). However, it is also true that in addition to hypoxia, Hif can be stabilized under normoxic conditions by multiple metabolites such as NO, ROS, succinate, and fumarate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isaacs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Selak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mateo et al., 2003</xref>). To address whether the Pvr induced <italic>LDH-GFP</italic> expression is specifically due to a hypoxic core within a tumor, we utilized the <italic>AyGal4</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ito et al., 1997</xref>) to generate flip-out clones expressing Pvr<sup>act</sup>. This technique allows analysis of <italic>LDH</italic> expression in single or small groups of cells expressing Pvr<sup>act</sup> that are surrounded by normal tissue. Under these conditions, there is no over-growth or tumor formation, yet these single/small number cell clones express <italic>LDH</italic> in a strikingly cell-autonomous fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). We conclude that a large tumor with a hypoxic core is not a requirement for Sima stabilization or <italic>LDH</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Both ERK and PI3K pathways are necessary for LDH expression</title><p>Ras is the major effector of RTK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moodie et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002</xref>), and indeed we have found that constitutively active dRas1 is sufficient for a small increase in <italic>LDH</italic> expression and activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).

Finally, Pvr<sup>act</sup> dependent accumulation of Sima protein is significantly suppressed when either Dsor1 or Akt is silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Thus, the PI3K/Akt/TOR axis is also definitively needed for LDH regulation.</p><p>Importantly, individual overexpression of either an activated form of human Raf (hRaf<sup>act</sup>) or a constitutively active form of PI3K (PI3K<sup>act</sup>, active due to a mutation in the p110α catalytic subunit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brand and Perrimon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leevers et al., 1996</xref>) does not induce <italic>LDH-GFP</italic> expression although each genotype causes significant over-growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3o–p</xref>). In combination, however, co-expression of hRaf<sup>act</sup> and PI3K<sup>act</sup> either using drivers or in small clones, leads to extensive <italic>LDH</italic> induction even more robustly than what is seen for Pvr<sup>act</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3q–r</xref>). Furthermore, dual PI3K/ERK activation is also sufficient to increase Sima expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c–d</xref>). Knock down of Sima significantly attenuates PI3K/ERK induced <italic>LDH-GFP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1h–i</xref>). Similar to its role in mediating Pvr<sup>act</sup> induced <italic>LDH</italic> expression, this demonstrates that Sima is the critical regulator of glycolytic genes upon co-activating PI3K and ERK pathways. We conclude that a combination of ERK and PI3K signaling is both necessary and sufficient to induce Hifα-dependent <italic>LDH</italic> induction. On its own, each signal is necessary but not sufficient to cause <italic>LDH</italic> expression.</p><p>InR/TOR pathway is associated with translational control in diverse systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukuda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hay and Sonenberg, 2004</xref>). In particular, both translation and degradation critically control Hifα level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bacon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorr et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with this notion, the induction of <italic>LDH</italic> by Pvr<sup>act</sup>/Sima remains unaffected when Pointed (<italic>Drosophila</italic> ETS2), the well–established direct nuclear target of the ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">O'Neill et al., 1994</xref>), is mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3v</xref>). In contrast, the ribosomal S6 kinase, a known target of TOR signaling that promotes translation of a subset of mRNA transcripts, including Hif-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ma and Blenis, 2009</xref>) is prominently involved in this process since a dominant-negative form of S6k is a strong suppressor of Pvr-mediated <italic>LDH</italic> induction and Sima accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3s</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f</xref>). The ERK signal also modulates protein translation through the Mnk kinase (LK6 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). Lk6 binds ERK and phosphorylates the initiation factor eIF4E to promote Cap dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arquier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parra-Palau et al., 2005</xref>).

Finally, published literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miron et al., 2001</xref>) has established 4E-BP (Thor) as a downstream effector of the PI3K/Akt pathway that forms a complex with elF4E and inhibits translation. mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP releasing it from eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Furic et al., 2010</xref>) allowing efficient translation. We found that co-expression of 4E-BP with Pvr<sup>act</sup> suppresses <italic>LDH</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3u</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly support a mechanism in which ERK and PI3K pathways converge at the level of translational control of gene products including Sima. We propose that initially, the increased translation of <italic>sima</italic> transcript generates sufficient Sima protein (in excess of the rate of Sima degradation), leading to <italic>LDH</italic> induction; later we will show that this reprogramming is further augmented by a feedback loop involving ROS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pvr<sup>act</sup> induced metabolic changes</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Intensification of glycolytic pathway</title><p>In order to gain better understanding of the transcriptional basis of Pvr-induced glycolytic transition at a genome-wide level and the role of <italic>sima</italic> in the regulation of this process, we carried out an RNA-Seq experiment in which transcriptomes of wild-type wing imaginal discs were compared with those with the genotypes <italic>Pvr<sup>act</sup></italic>(glycolytic activity), or <italic>InR<sup>act</sup></italic>(no detectable glycolytic activity) or <italic>Pvr<sup>act</sup> + sima<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (glycolytic activity suppressed).

Similar effects are seen upon knockdown of hep (JNKK) or Src42A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d–e</xref>). Thus Src-JNK signaling plays an important role in the inhibition of mitochondrial activity and in raising ROS levels in Pvr<sup>act</sup> tumors.</p><p>Two notable facts about ROS have a bearing on the data presented here. The first is that ROS can activate the JNK pathway through interaction with the upstream component ASK (JNKKK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tobiume et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>). The second is that high ROS conditions result in potent stabilization of the Hif protein even under normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fandrey et al., 2006</xref>). This provides the opportunity for ROS generated downstream of both Hif and JNK, to feedback and reinforce these two pathways. To test this hypothesis, several antioxidant (free radical scavenging) proteins were expressed to reduce the level of ROS. Of these, the strongest ROS scavenging activity was seen upon Peroxidasin (Pxn) expression. In addition to a decrease in ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–h</xref>), we found that JNK is no longer activated when Pxn is co-expressed in Pvr<sup>act</sup> discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i–j</xref>). Similarly, <italic>LDH-GFP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k–l</xref>) and the accumulation of Sima protein are strongly suppressed by co-expression of Pxn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6m–n</xref>). These results establish ROS as the central player in enforcing the metabolic reprogramming. Initially established through the activation of three oncogenic pathways by Pvr, the shift to glycolysis is then reinforced when ROS is generated as a subsequent step. This establishes one means to maintain a stable Warburg effect by oncogene activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) can be constructed that is consistent with all our observations on the Pvr<sup>act</sup> induced interacting network that leads to aerobic glycolysis and potentially also allows this new metabolic state to be maintained through later stages of tumor growth. This is a genetic model derived from analysis that allows placement of gene function according to their hierarchy along a pathway. Many genetic backgrounds that achieve full or partial Warburg effect have been described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elstrom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim and Dang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Faubert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hitosugi et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jin et al., 2016</xref>). Although the details may seem to vary, the three critical components involved in this process are the two pyruvate-metabolism enzymes, LDH and PDH and the free radical metabolite class designated as ROS. During the acquisition of the aerobic glycolytic activity in a tumor environment, LDH actively converts pyruvate to lactate, and high PDHK inactivates PDH resulting in low pyruvate to acetyl-CoA conversion, low TCA flux and electron transport activity. Our results suggest that these events can be sustained over long periods of tumor growth only when coupled with a feed back signal from accumulating ROS in a mechanism that reinforces and enhances the high-LDH/low-PDH activity state. This genetic study was achieved in an in vivo context of an animal that is only mutant for the one specific activated oncogene that we introduce and is otherwise normal. Additional pathways are activated without accumulating new mutations. Also, while hypoxic conditions might favor a glycolytic activation in general, hypoxia is not an essential component for a tumor to become glycolytic, as in this system, where Hif is stabilized by alternative means in a normoxic environment.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18126.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for induction and maintenance of a metabolic reprogramming. </title><p>Pvr<sup>act</sup> induced tumor tissues show a robust metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis.

The second is the Raf/ERK pathway targeting the L6K (MNK in mammals) protein that is also independently required for translational initiation. On their own, any one of these pathways can cause tumor growth, presumably due to independent downstream transcriptional events. But both pathways must act simultaneously in order to establish translational control of both Hifα (Sima), and PDHK. Interestingly, while the PI3K and ERK pathways acting together causes significant amounts of PDHK translation, the protein thus produced is inactive. In contrast, the PDHK translated in a Pvr<sup>act</sup> background is enzymatically active and capable of inactivating PDH. Our data show that yet another parallel pathway initiated by Pvr<sup>act</sup> that involves Src and JNK helps generate the active form of PDHK. Therefore all three downstream effectors of activated Pvr (Src/JNK, PI3K/S6K and ERK/Lk6, eIF4E) are essential in generating an active form of PDHK protein to down-regulate oxidative phosphorylation, while only the last two of these pathways are needed for LDH production and glycolysis. It is easy to visualize how, in the context of the triggering oncogene, the tumor caused could either be non-glycolytic, or be glycolytic but not lacking in oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pavlova and Thompson, 2016</xref>). In the system described in this paper, it is Inevitable that direct pyruvate to acetyl-CoA conversion within the mitochondrion, and therefore the TCA flux will be attenuated since PDH function is inhibited by PDHK in the tumor cells. However, we do not have direct evidence for or against any bypass mechanisms such as those using glutamine as the primary driver of anabolic processes being operational in the context of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pvr<sup>act</sup> induced tumors as they are for many cancers. This issue requires further direct measurement of metabolic activity of the tumor tissue in the near future.</p><p>While this sequence of events can initiate a switch in the metabolic profile of the cell, an additional mechanism is required to sustain this transition over a long period of time. The central player in this sustenance is ROS. The level of these free-radical species rises as the mitochondrion becomes dysfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glushakova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Owusu-Ansah et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, this excess ROS functions as a feedback signal that has at least two important consequences. First, ROS stabilizes Hif using the same mechanism that is used during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fandrey et al., 2006</xref>), thus reinforcing the glycolytic pathways. The second is that ROS can activate the JNK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tobiume et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>). Thus, after the initial reprogramming in metabolism, the transition is made stable over time, as the generated ROS reinforces the upstream members. All of the results shown here are consistent with this positive feedback model that enforces the Warburg effect and sustains it over time. For example, scavenging ROS blocks phosphorylation of components that are upstream of it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i–j</xref>). Unlike Pvr, activation of PI3K and Raf together does not raise ROS even as it increases LDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>); and activation of Ras, which will not lead to high ROS causes only very weak metabolic reprogramming compared with Pvr<sup>act</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–e</xref>). Thus, the positive feedback function of ROS is a critical step in tumors undergoing metabolic reprogramming or cell lines that are not necessarily under hypoxic conditions. Although tissue hypoxia does stabilize Hif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wenger, 2002</xref>), this would be true of large non-vascularized solid tumors but not necessarily in circulating cells or in cancer cell lines. The mechanism detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is Hif dependent but hypoxia independent, a condition often observed in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ivan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Park et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with translational control, transcript levels of PDHK or Sima are not altered in Pvr<sup>act</sup> cells, whereas the PDHK and Sima protein levels are very significantly up-regulated by Pvr<sup>act</sup> through the translational module controlled by PI3K/ERK pathways. Unlike in several published mammalian studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaplon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2006</xref>), we did not find evidence for transcriptional control of PDHK by Hif. Analysis of our RNA-Seq data reveals that PDHK transcription levels remain unaltered in Pvr<sup>act</sup> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was also confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1p</xref>), The reason for this discrepancy is unclear; perhaps Hif does control basal transcriptional levels of PDHK, but the oncogene induced up-regulation of activity results from a post-transcriptional control of PDHK activity as we observe here.</p><p>It is interesting that the activation of a single oncogene, the PDGF/VEGF Receptor (Pvr) induces multiple phenotypes associated with tumor formation, including overgrowth, cell shape change, local migration and importantly for this study, a likely shift in metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. These tumors are not metastatic presumably because this requires complete loss of epithelial polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pagliarini and Xu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Although only a single oncogene is activated, the observed Warburg effect is caused by the activation of several interconnected pathways that are precisely dissected in this genetically tractable model system. The distinct advantage of this analysis is that the tumor is generated in an otherwise wild-type background such that the pathways activated reflect primary drivers of the different aspects of the tumor and the analysis is not complicated by background mutations. In some cancer cell-lines, a Warburg effect is often entirely attributed to PI3K activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</xref>). This interpretation is complicated by the presence of background mutations that make cell-lines immortal, before they are transformed. For example, PI3K activated tumors are often seen only in backgrounds in which either Raf, ERK or Ras is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McCubrey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Steelman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yuan and Cantley, 2008</xref>). With the advent of modern gene manipulation technologies, it is now possible to create in vivo models in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xue et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Platt et al., 2014</xref>), but determining the epistatic relationships between all genetic components continues to be a challenge. Given the complete conservation of all the relevant components between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, it is reasonable to propose that a similar set of epistatic relationships to the one proposed here, will hold in mammalian cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p>The following fly stocks were used: <italic>w<sup>1118</sup>, dpp-Gal4<sup>blk-1</sup>, UAS- dRas1<sup>V12</sup>(Ras<sup>act</sup>), UAS-wg, UAS-upd, UAS-CD8:mCherry, Ay-Gal4 UAS-CD2, Ay-Gal4 UAS-lacZ, MKRS hsFLP.86E, UAS-dRas1<sup>N17 </sup>(Ras<sup>DN</sup>), UAS-S6k<sup>KQ </sup>(S6K<sup>DN</sup>), lk6<sup>2</sup>, UAS-cRaf1<sup>gof</sup>, UAS-dp110<sup>CAAX</sup>(PI3K<sup>act</sup>), UAS-PI3K92E<sup>A2860C</sup> (PI3K<sup>DN</sup>), UAS-InR<sup>A1325D </sup>(InR<sup>act</sup>), UAS-Bsk<sup>DN</sup>, UAS-hep<sup>act</sup>, UAS-sima<sup>RNAiHMS00832</sup>, UAS-Dsor1<sup>RNAiHMS00710</sup>, UAS-Dsor1<sup>RNAiHMS00145</sup>, UAS-Dsor1<sup>RNAiJF03100</sup>, UAS-rl<sup>RNAiHMS00173</sup>, UAS-PI3K92E<sup>RNAiJF02770</sup>, UAS-Akt1<sup>RNAiHMS00007</sup>, UAS-dTOR<sup>RNAiHMS00504</sup>, UAS-dTOR<sup>RNAiHMS01114</sup>, UAS-PDHK<sup>RNAiGL0009</sup>, UAS-Src42A<sup>RNAiHMS02755</sup> </italic>(Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center, Bloomington, IN), <italic>UAS-Pvr<sup>act</sup> (</italic>λ<italic>-Pvr)</italic> (N.

TO-PRO-3 or DAPI was used for a DNA counterstain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and tissues were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). The following antibodies were used: anti-dpERK (1:100; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), anti-phospho <italic>Drosophila</italic> Akt (Ser505) (1:25; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-Sima (1:100; generated by PRF&amp;L, Canadensis, PA), anti-phospho PDH (S293) (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-PDHK1 (1:100; Abcam), anti-phospho PDHK1 (Tyr243) (1:200; Cell Signaling), anti-phospho JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) (1:500; Cell Signaling), and anti-phospho Src (Tyr418) (1:200; Invitrogen). Single- plane fluorescence images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope with Zen 2009 acquisition software.

After allowing newly hatched larvae to grow for 96 hr at 29°C, wing discs were dissected, fixed, washed, and stained with TO-PRO-3. Discs were then mounted in a drop of Vectashield and slowly moved to edge of drop (in increasingly less mounting medium) until they were stuck in position to the glass slide. Small, square coverslips were placed on either side of drop, and a larger, rectangular coverslip was placed spanning the smaller ones. All slides were fixed with nail polish. This mounting creates a gap (of coverslip thickness) between the top coverslip and slide, preventing the coverslip from pressing and deforming wing discs. When imaging, z-stacks were obtained with a distance between slices of 14 μm, and the entire disc was covered. To measure volumes, plugin 'A 3D editing' was used (ImageJ). Briefly, each disc was manually outlined in each z-section (using the channel for mCherry), and the plugin then calculated total volume. Brightness and contrast were enhanced identically for each sample to aid in outlining. At least 10 discs were used for each genotype per experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>ROS assay</title><p>For ROS detection in wing discs, after incubation with DHE (Invitrogen) in RT, discs were rinsed twice in Schneiders medium, fixed for 5 mins in 4% Formaldehyde, and rinsed once with 1XPBS before confocal imaging.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Wei Liao for his help with bioinformatic analysis of RNA expression data.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;in vivo Genetic Dissection of Tumor Growth and the Warburg Shift&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Leonard I Zon (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this elegant study, the authors observe over-expression of Pvr<sup>act</sup> (PDGFR/VEGFR) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs caused tumorous growths and uniquely caused glycolysis induction, measured by LDH enzymatic staining as well as increased LDH transcription via enhancer trap. Importantly, Pvr<sup>act</sup> expressed in small clones caused cell autonomous LDH induction, allowing the authors to conduct the subsequent genetic dissection in an in vivo system assumed to lack secondary mutations. Using this system, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hif-α (Sima) is found to be necessary and sufficient to induce LDH expression, although loss of Sima only reduced overgrowth by about 20%. Downstream of Pvr<sup>act</sup> overexpression, ERK and PI3K signaling were necessary and sufficient to induce increased Sima protein levels and LDH expression. Pvr<sup>act</sup> mediated glycolytic induction required several downstream factors that regulate translation, leading to the conclusion that activated Pvr, working through PI3K and ERK signaling, leads to increased protein levels of Sima, inducing LDH expression. To assess the transcriptional changes caused by Pvr<sup>act</sup> over-expression, RNA-sequencing was performed in Pvr<sup>act</sup> (glycolytic shift), activated InR (no glycolytic shift control), and Pvr<sup>act</sup> +sima loss of function (glycolytic shift suppressed) wing discs. Transcripts encoding glycolytic enzymes were enriched in Pvr<sup>act</sup> over-expression wing discs in a Sima-dependent manner. The manuscript then explored the parallel process of oxidative phosphorylation inhibition downstream of Pvr<sup>act</sup> over-expression via the observed increase in PDHK activity. PI3K and ERK signaling were found to increase PDHK transcript levels, but not PDHK phosphorylation (activation). Src/jun signaling were found to be required for PDHK activation resulting in inactivation of PDH, and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, ROS (created when oxidative phosphorylation is inhibited) reinforced <italic>JNK</italic> signaling and Hif-α protein levels, stabilizing a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis downstream of Pvr<sup>act</sup> over-expression in the wing disc.</p><p>A great many of the regulatory steps covered in the manuscript have been described in mammalian models (see review by Pavlova and Thompson, 2016, The Emerging Hallmarks of Cancer Metabolism. Cell Metab 23, 27-47), and some also in <italic>Drosophila</italic> – which are appropriately cited in the manuscript. However, the work reported here has the merit of integrating these in a network to provide a more comprehensive picture of how aerobic glycolysis is brought about.</p><p>We recommend publication of this manuscript contingent on the completion of the experiments below, essential for supporting the major conclusions. These experiments, or variations thereof which address our concerns, are eminently do-able within a 2-month period.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although it is likely that LDH induction is through Sima in the double PI3K/ERK pathway activation genetic background, in order to conclude LDH induction is via Sima in this context, Sima protein staining and Sima necessity for LDH induction in double pathway activation wing discs should be assessed.</p><p>2) Similarly, in order to conclude that LDH induction downstream of Pvr<sup>act</sup> over-expression relies on translational regulation of Sima, Sima protein staining in wing discs should be assessed in Pvr<sup>act</sup> over-expression in combination with S6k, lk6/+, and Thor.</p><p>In addition, these important points need to be addressed:</p><p>An important part of the general scheme that is not totally clear is the postulate that the glycolytic phenotype might be due to mitochondrial dysfunction. This has, indeed, been the accepted view for almost a century, but many recent studies suggest that tumor´s mitochondria are capable of sustaining oxidative phosphorylation. There is no definitive evidence in the manuscript proving that increased lactate levels result from inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (compared to wild type levels) rather than from a higher glycolytic activity fuelled by increased nutrient uptake (i.e. glucose). Indeed, Ras and PIK3/Akt signalling do regulate glucose uptake. The possibility must be considered that pyruvate conversion to lactate, and the resulting decreased in pyruvate transport into mitochondria, might be a mechanism to avoid an overload of the respiratory chain. To clarify this point glucose uptake and OXPHOS activity should be measured. Without these data it may not be appropriate to refer to a &quot;metabolic shift&quot;. The authors are experts in the field and are best placed to see how to address this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18126.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>We recommend publication of this manuscript contingent on the completion of the experiments below, essential for supporting the major conclusions.

We had previously demonstrated these results with Pvr<sup>act</sup> only, with the expectation that the activated PI3K/ERK combination will yield the same, but given that multiple pathways are activated at the same time, the reviewer is correct in asking whether this is indeed the case.</p><p>In new experiments, we have now made the proper genetic combinations and show (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) that dual PI3K/ERK activation is indeed sufficient to induce Sima, and also sufficient to regulate LDH expression. (text: subsection “Both ERK and PI3K pathways are necessary for LDH expression”, last paragraph; Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Briefly, we stained for expression of Sima protein in dpp-Gal4&gt;hRaf<sup>act</sup>+PI3K<sup>act</sup> wing discs and find that Sima level indeed increases dramatically (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C-D). Sima is also required for LDH induction, since a simultaneous knock down of Sima and co-activation of ERK and PI3K pathways (dpp-Gal4&gt;hRaf<sup>act</sup>+PI3K<sup>act</sup>+Sima<sup>RNAi</sup>) results in a significant reduction in LDH-GFP expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 2H-I).</p><p><italic>2) Similarly, in order to conclude that LDH induction downstream of Pvr<sup>act</sup> over-expression relies on translational regulation of Sima, Sima protein staining in wing discs should be assessed in Pvr<sup>act</sup> over-expression in combination with S6k, lk6/+, and Thor.</italic></p><p>We agree, this issue is now resolved with new data presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><p>As suggested, we stained for Sima protein in both dpp-Gal4&gt;Pvr<sup>act</sup>+S6K<sup>DN</sup> and dpp-Gal4&gt;Pvr<sup>act</sup>; lk6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2</xref></sup>/+ background and find that Sima accumulation is suppressed in both of these genetic backgrounds (Figure 3—figure supplement 2E-G). For Thor (4EBP), this will require overexpression and not loss of function, and unfortunately the newly acquired chromosomes from Bloomington are not viable as a combination of UAS-Pvr<sup>act</sup> and UAS-Thor. Nevertheless, we feel that the reviewer’s concern, whether translational control is indeed key to Sima regulation is more directly addressed by loss of function experiments with lk6 and S6K (now shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2F-G). (Figure: Figure 3—figure supplement 2; Text: subsection “Both ERK and PI3K pathways are necessary for LDH expression”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>In addition, these important points need to be addressed:</italic></p><p><italic>An important part of the general scheme that is not totally clear is the postulate that the glycolytic phenotype might be due to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Unfortunately, at this point we can only provide relief to this argument by pointing this out as a caveat of genetic analysis. What the paper shows unambiguously is that PDH activity is lowered and therefore the pyruvate induced TCA cycle must become inefficient. Some cancer cells avoid this situation by bypass mechanisms, such as by up-regulating Gln usage that can result in formation of αKG and citrate.</p><p>We do not know if such mechanisms operate in our system, although we do not see any increase in either glucose or glutamine transporters.</p><p>We have tried to measure oxygen conversion rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) using a Sea Horse XF24-3 system. This technique is optimized for single cell layers and we see we wild variations when we use whole discs for one of many possible reasons. Dissociating the cells will also have uncertain effects on their metabolic status. We are developing methods that work with small quantities of whole tissue, but this will take a long time to complete and is therefore outside the scope of this genetic analysis. We have also, eliminated any nonessential use of the word “shift” to describe the metabolic effect.</p><p>In Summary, the text now reflects the following:</p><p>1) That the normal pyruvate driven TCA cycle is attenuated (inactive PDH will not allow the pyruvate acetyl CoA conversion).</p><p>2) Glycolysis is enhanced (all glycolytic genes are activated, LDH is functional) compared to normal.</p><p>3) However, as other mechanisms (chiefly through increased glutamine import) could produce α-ketoglutarate, as in some cancer cells, we could not be sure that ox-phos is indeed down-regulated. We did acknowledge this in our manuscript, but now made clearer in the new version (Discussion, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
