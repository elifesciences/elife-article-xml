indirect pathway within the basal ganglia. Little is known about the role of the STN in mediating cognitive functions in humans. Here, we explore the role of the STN in human subjects making decisions under conditions of uncertainty using single-neuron recordings and intermittent deep brain stimulation (DBS) during a financial decision-making task. Intraoperative single-neuronal data from the STN reveals that on high-uncertainty trials, spiking activity encodes the upcoming decision within a brief (500 ms) temporal window during the choice period, prior to the manifestation of the choice. Application of intermittent DBS selectively prior to the choice period alters decisions and biases subject behavior towards conservative wagers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36460.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Deep brain stimulation, or DBS for short, is used to treat movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease in patients who are responding inadequately to medications. It requires implanting an electrode into the brain and using electrical stimulation aimed at a specific cluster of brain cells to reduce unwanted symptoms. DBS helps to normalize abnormal brain activity similar to a pacemaker resetting an abnormal heart rhythm. Scientists are currently studying whether DBS might also help people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, Alzheimer’s disease or other disorders that affect thinking.</p><p>To alter human behavior and treat disorders that affect thinking, DBS will have to be delivered at precise time points as the brain processes information. One potential target is for DBS in both movement and thinking disorders is the subthalamic nucleus. This is a small almond-shaped cluster of brain cells that helps people stop movements. Recent studies suggest it also may play a role in processing emotions, controlling inappropriate responses, and psychiatric illnesses.</p><p>Now, Patel et al. show that the subthalamic nucleus helps people decide what to do in the face of uncertainty and that targeting this brain structure with DBS can shift a person’s decision-making. In the experiments, patients with Parkinson’s disease who were awake and undergoing surgery to implant the DBS electrodes also played a computerized gambling game. Patel et al. recorded the electrical activity in the brain cells of the patient’s subthalamic nucleus during the game. The experiments showed that when patients were faced with a decision with 50/50 odds, the pattern of electrical activity in the cells of their subthalamic nucleus reveals their choice about 500 milliseconds before they act on it.</p><p>After their surgeries, patients engaged in the same gambling game. This time, Patel et al. specifically targeted the decision-related activity in their subthalamic nucleus with DBS. This caused the patients to make fewer risky decisions in the game. The experiments show DBS can change decision-making behavior in humans. Newer DBS technology may be even more effective at treating brain disorders and cause fewer side effects. Further study into how the brain processes information will also help scientists to better target DBS and possibly treat a broader range of diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>subthalamic nucleus</kwd><kwd>neurophysiology</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>deep brain stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SUBNETS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Shaun R</given-names></name><name><surname>Herrington</surname><given-names>Todd M</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jimmy C</given-names></name><name><surname>Widge</surname><given-names>Alik S</given-names></name><name><surname>Dougherty</surname><given-names>Darin</given-names></name><name><surname>Eskandar</surname><given-names>Emad N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep brain stimulation can selectively modify neural activity within the subthalamic nucleus to modify decisions under uncertainty in human subjects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a remarkable therapy that has revolutionized the potential for treating neurological and neuropsychiatric illness by directly modifying neural function, though the underlying mechanism of action remains unknown. In its simplest form, DBS can be thought of as a pacemaker for the brain. Current DBS devices deliver continuous electrical stimulation to a targeted brain region to modify or reset abberant neural activity or synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herrington et al., 2016a</xref>). A major area of current research is in identifying more refined methods of stimulation delivery by exploring the timing of stimulation delivery, multi-site stimulation, and real-time sensing and stimulation.</p><p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a small almond-shaped nucleus in the basal ganglia classically known for its role in inhibiting motor responses as part of the indirect pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schmidt and Berke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, a growing body of literature has begun to uncover a more nuanced role of the STN in higher-order cognitive processes such as, emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Le Jeune et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Le Jeune et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Drapier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eitan et al., 2013</xref>), response inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Isoda and Hikosaka, 2008</xref>), and even psychiatric illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mallet et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The STN is also an important deep brain stimulation (DBS) target for the treatment of movements disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD). DBS surgery provides one of only a few opportunities to record neuronal responses in humans subjects engaged in cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zénon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zaghloul et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, researchers can leverage implanted DBS electrodes as a neuromodulation tool to study the role of the STN in an extra-operative setting. As such, numerous researchers have utilized this approach to interrogate the function of the STN in conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schroeder et al., 2002</xref>), decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Seymour et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Seinstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wylie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zaehle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>), and emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Le Jeune et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Le Jeune et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Studies of STN stimulation using current generation DBS systems have been limited by the systems’ design to deliver continuous stimulation. This is a critical limitation to using DBS to explore dynamic aspects of cognition and might be an important source of variability on DBS effects reported in the literature. We hypothesized that targeting stimulation to specific temporal windows during the evolution of a cognitive process (e.g., decision-making), rather than delivering long periods of continuous stimulation, will be critical to understanding the cognitive function and developing new neuromodulation therapies going forward.</p><p>In this study, we explore the role of the STN in making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. We employed single-neuronal recordings and intermittent electrical stimulation in human subjects while they engaged in a financial decision-making task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Patel et al., 2012</xref>). We find that the STN is selectively activated during a brief window for high-uncertainty trials from single-neuronal data. To assess the role of the STN in decision-making during this brief temporal window, we built a custom device which allowed us to precisely deliver intermittent stimulation within short temporal windows. We found that a brief, high-frequency stimulation pulse delivered prior to the choice period promoted a reduction in risk-seeking behavior. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply intermittent DBS in humans actively engaged in a cognitive task and the first to demonstrate a reduction in risk-seeking behavior following STN DBS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The task is analogous to the classic card game, <italic>War</italic>. Each player was dealt a card – the player with the highest card won (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Subjects were first presented with their card. They were then prompted to make either a $5 or $20 wager based on the perceived value of their hand. After a wager was selected, the opponent’s hand was revealed followed by visual feedback on the outcome of the trial. For each trial, subjects either won or lost the wagered amount. To simplify the game, we reduced the deck to even cards from 2 through 10 of one suit. Thus, if a subject was dealt a 10-card, the optimal choice would be to place a $20 wager as the outcome is likely to be positive or at worst a draw. Conversely, if the subject received a 2-card the optimal choice would be to place a $5 wager. Uniquely, there is no optimal strategy for the 6-card – the outcome is probabilistically equal.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36460.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task description and behavioral results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the gambling task.

The low-dopamine state may have contributed to subject’s risk-avoidant behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">St Onge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Claassen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Current models suggest that STN activity inhibits responses during cognitively demanding situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frank et al., 2007</xref>). This inhibition may serve to allow for additional time to process internal and environmental information before ultimately arriving at and executing a decision. To explore this hypothesis in our study we leveraged the intrinsic symmetry of the behavioral paradigm, and divided trials into low and high cognitive demand. The 10- and 2-cards are extreme situations in which the player is probabilistically likely or unlikely to win, respectively — we call these low-uncertainty trials. Conversely, on the 6-card trials the player has an equal probability of winning and losing and there is no optimal strategy — we call these high-uncertainty trials.</p><p>We examined single-neuronal data from the STN using standard stereotactic and intraoperative microelectrode mapping procedures.

No similar differences were observed for the omitted and fixation stimulation conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We used a multi-modal approach consisting of single-neuronal recordings and intermittent stimulation to characterize the neurophysiological role of the STN in decision-making under uncertainty. To do so, we used a financial decision-making task designed to interrogate risk-taking behavior. Using this task, we categorized trials into high and low-uncertainty. We defined high-uncertainty as trials in which the probability of a positive and negative outcome are equal. As a result there was no optimal behavioral strategy. Conversely, low-uncertainty trials were cases in which the outcome was heavily biased towards or against a positive outcome. On these trials, subject behavior was reliably stereotyped towards the most appropriate wager to maximize gains or minimize losses. We found that on high-uncertainty trials STN neural activity encoded the upcoming decision in a discrete 500 ms temporal window immediately before the choice period. In a recent functional imaging study, Fleming et al. found a bilateral increase in BOLD response localized to the STN selectively for high-uncertainty trials where subjects responded against a status-quo bias. Although their study uses perceptual decisions, we demonstrate that the same underlying mechanism may extend to value-based decisions made under conditions of uncertainty. Other studies have observed similar neural responses in the STN following conflict related encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zaghloul et al., 2012</xref>) and control signal encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Isoda and Hikosaka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wiecki and Frank, 2013</xref>).Unfortunately, the task design in the present study does not let us dissect the influence of conflict, control, and uncertainty on the observed neural responses reported here. This remains an open question within the STN literature body. It is worth noting the possibility that the observed STN neural response in this experiment is a combination of conflict and control. More specifically, a departure from a prepotent response (i.e. placing a high wager) induces STN activity and allows for the recruitment of control centers to mediate a new decision. This would be supported by computational models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wiecki and Frank, 2013</xref>) and experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coulthard et al., 2012</xref>) but require further investigation to tease apart.</p><p>Furthermore, Cavanaugh et al. have previously shown that increases in local-field potential oscillations in the medial prefrontal cortex and STN correlate with trial-by-trial decision conflict and that continuous electrical stimulation through implanted DBS electrodes can prevent adjustments in decision thresholds ultimately resulting in rapid or impulsive decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, in our data the application of intermittent DBS prior to the choice period resulted in an increasein risk-averse decisions and in reaction times for those decision. One potential explanation for these seemingly conflicting findings is that the effects of stimulation may vary depending on the duration of stimulation. It has previously been suggested that short bursts of high-frequency STN stimulation serve to increase local firing rates which are subsequently silenced with prolonged stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Continuous, high-frequency stimulation has also been proposed to act as an informational lesion, essentially overwriting the normal time-varying activity of the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herrington et al., 2016b</xref>). Our finding also appears to correspond to the observed neurophysiological data from this study, where a slight increase in overall STN activity during the choice period correlates with placing a low wager. An interesting limitation of the stimulation study is that stimulation was only delivered on the high-uncertainty trials, limiting our ability to understand the constraints of its effect on modifying behavior on medium- or low-uncertainty trials. We would hypothesize the effect would be limited or not present on low-uncertainty trials given that no differential encoding was observed, however this remains to be studied.</p><p>Interestingly, our findings differ from other human neurophysiology studies in which conflict activity was observed during the stimulus presentation, as opposed to the choice period, in the dorsal anterior cingulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sheth et al., 2012</xref>) and the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zaghloul et al., 2012</xref>). To further explore the temporal dynamics of the observed signal, we performed a second experiment in which we applied intermittent STN stimulation through implanted DBS electrodes selectively during high-uncertainty trials. Stimulation was delivered either during the fixation period, choice period, or it was omitted. This technique is uniquely different than previous studies using DBS as a method to interrogate neural circuits because we implemented a system for rapidly turning on and off the implanted device, permitting us to time-lock delivery to specific task-epochs. This approach may further reduce confounding effects of long-term stimulation, such as carry-over effects. As a result, we found that intermittent stimulation prior to the choice period—the same interval during which we observed the neurophysiological decision signal from the first experiment—selectively altered subject behavior. No differences were observed in subject behavior when stimulation was omitted or delivered during the fixation period. We found that stimulation prior to the choice period interrupted subjects’ ability to appropriately slow responses when betting against their bias (i.e. when they placed a high bet), resulting in a shortened reaction time, consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although we attempted to reduce confounding effects by demonstrating both physiological and stimulation evidence to support our claim, our experimental design has several fundamental limitations. In the first experiment, we perform intraoperative recordings in patients undergoing a neurosurgical procedure. Naturally, there are several limitations for performing studies in the operating room, such as the length of each experimental session. For this reason, the total number of trials and neurons we are able to record can often be limited. In this study, we focus our neurophysiological findings to population responses. Despite this limitation, however, we find the reported effects to be consistent across the population. In addition, we compensate for this limitation by developing a novel stimulation method to carefully test the relationship between our neurophysiological findings and subject behavior. Furthermore, the subjects in this study all suffer from advanced PD, a disease known to affect natural reward processing. For obvious reasons, these experiments are constrained to populations requiring neurosurgical treatment, and direct comparisons to a healthy population are limited to behavioral measures.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide functional imaging and neurophysiological evidence in human subjects demonstrating the critical role of the STN in encoding decisions under conditions of uncertainty. Moreover, we demonstrate that electrical stimulation of the STN within a finite temporal window can selectively bias subject behavior towards more risk-averse decisions. Together, this provides evidence for the role of precision neuromodulation approaches and closed-loop deep brain stimulation for the advancement of neurological and neuropsychiatric therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study subjects</title><p>We recruited six subjects undergoing STN DBS for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease to participate in the intraoperative neurophysiology study.

On each trial, the subject and computer are each dealt a card and the player with the higher card wins. To simplify the game the deck is limited to five cards: even cards from 2 through 10 from one suit. The rules were carefully explained to each subject prior to the study. Each trial requires the subject to evaluate his/her card, determine its value, and place a $five or $20 wager with the goal of maximizing profits. Thus, when the subject is dealt a 10-card, the optimal choice is to place a $20 wager as the outcome is likely positive or at worst a draw. Conversely, the optimal choice for a 2-card is to place a $five wager since the outcome is likely negative or at best a draw. There is no optimal strategy for the 6-card—the outcome is probabilistically equal.</p><p>Each trial began with a fixation point presented at the center of the screen for 350 ms to indicate the start of trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Next, the subject’s card and the back of the opponent’s card were displayed for 1000 ms. Two red circles then appeared, indicating the mapping of each button (left and right buttons) to its respective wagers ($five and $20). The button map was presented randomly such that the $five and $20 wagers are assigned to the left and right buttons equally. The presentation of the button map also serves as the choice period, indicating when to initiate a wager. The time it took the subject to press a button was considered the reaction time with a maximum of 5 s. Following the wager, there was a randomized delay period of 250–500 ms, which was immediately followed by the presentation of the subject’s and computer’s card for 1000–1250 ms.

Intraoperative microelectrode recordings were performed using three Para-sagittal tungsten microelectrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The electrodes were advanced using a motorized Alpha Omega (Alpha-Omega Engineering, Nazareth, Israel) Microdrive. Intraoperative motor testing was performed at &lt;1 mm increments throughout the dorsolateral-ventromedial axis of the STN to characterize the motor and non-motor compartments. Recordings were band-pass filtered between 300 Hz and 6.5 kHz by an Alpha Omega acquisition system. Data was recorded at 20 kHz by a PowerLinc 1401 acquisition system (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, England) and stored for post-hoc analysis. Offline, the neurophysiology data was sorted into individual neuronal records using a template clustering method (Offline Sorter, Plexon, Houston, TX). Data from each electrode was sorted separately.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral and neuronal analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed using a combination of iPython and R. Because of inter-subject variability in baseline motor performance, we explored reaction time differences by first z-scoring data using each session’s mean and variance reaction time. Normalized subject data and allowed for equal comparisons for group level analyses. We then applied either a one-way or two-way ANOVA on the z-scored reaction time data to assess statistical differences. Post-hoc analyses were performed using two-tailed <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf116"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-tests.</p><p>To visualize neural activity, the instantaneous firing rate was approximated by convolving a Gaussian kernel (sigma = 150 ms) with 1 ms binned spike trains. Because of the limitations in the number of trials recorded in each experimental session, statistical analyses at the individual cell level were rarely significant, and instead all analyses were performed at the population level. Statistical differences between population responses were assessed using two-tailed <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf117"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-tests during pre-defined 500 ms windows: 500–1000 during the choice period and −250–250 centered on the button press based on a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Patel et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To explore the relationship between neural activity and the decision, we applied a linear regression model of the form: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf118"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf119"><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is a vector of z-scored spike counts (relative to each neuron) in a 500 ms window, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf120"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the card value, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf121"><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the wager, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf122"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> the interaction between the two terms.

A study staff member contacted potential study participants by telephone to introduce the study and invite the patient to participate. On the day of the study, after obtaining written informed consent, the patient’s deep brain stimulator was turned off. Subsequently the stimulation voltage was lowered in small increments with the stimulator being turned on and off in a blinded fashion until a voltage threshold was reached at which the patient was unable to detect the stimulation. The stimulator controller was secured over the patient’s pulse generator, and after approximately 15 min with the stimulator off, the patient began playing the task.</p><p>The task was conducted during the day in a quiet room. Patients were permitted to take short breaks as needed during the task. We used three different stimulation conditions on 6-card trials: 1 s of stimulation at the fixation epoch, 1 s of stimulation at the choice period, or no stimulation was delivered. This design allowed each subject to act as his own control, helping to account for variance due to differing disease, medication, and electrode location factors between patients and also allowed us to control for general versus time specific effects of stimulation. This study was approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board (protocol number 2007P001806).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the patients that participated in this study.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Intermittent subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation induces risk-aversive behavior in human subjects&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Birte Forstmann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study provides evidence for a role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in modulating risk-attitude in humans. This is based on three different experimental methods. First, the authors show that human STN is particularly active during decisions under risk, when uncertainty is high. Second, spiking activity of single STN units are significantly more active for risk-averse choices during high uncertainty, but not low uncertainty trials. Third, short-duration DBS stimulation while subjects make a decision increases the number of risk-averse choices. This last finding indicates that the increased STN activity might be causally related to the shift in risk attitude.</p><p>All reviewers thought that the topic of your study addresses a very interesting and timely question, and that your basic experimental design is sound, and sufficient to support the main conclusions. The reviewers liked in particular that you combined a number of different experimental techniques to investigate a common underlying question. That is a great strength of the paper. However, the reviewers also noted a number of weakness that need to be addressed, before the paper can be considered for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are considerable reservations among the reviewers regarding the fMRI experiments included in the paper. First, there are issues with the comparability of study populations. All reviewers agreed that you should have tested healthy age-matched controls, since behavioral strategies might change with age. Secondly, there are issues with the MRI scanning protocol and data analyses. The description of the MRI protocol lacks a lot of important information and in light of the recent literature, it appears unlikely that (a) sufficient tSNR, and (b) anatomical specificity to extract signal from the STN is obtained in this study (see, e.g., de Hollander et al., (2017); de Hollander et al., (2015)). This is particular worrisome since voxels were resampled to 2mm voxels, and subsequently smoothed with a three-dimensional Gaussian kernel of 6 mm width (FWHM). In light of these shortcomings, we request that you take out the description of the fMRI experiments from the paper.</p><p>2) The exact functional interpretation of the STN activity is not clearly expressed. There are a number of possibilities: (1) a 'conflict' signal that represents the presence of two mutually incompatible response tendencies, (2) 'uncertainty' in the economic sense of risk (i.e., high variability in the response outcome distribution), (3) a 'control signal' that inhibits the risk-seeking response and thus biases choices towards risk-avoiding behavior. Addressing this question requires the inclusion of a computational model that makes clear the author's interpretation of STN activity. Specifically, could choice behavior on the &quot;6&quot; trials be modeled using choice and reward history in such a way as to predict behavior? Such a model might produce parameters that could be more systematically related to observe STN responses and behavior to identify what decision-related parameters might be driving neural activity or modified by stimulation.</p><p>3) The basic result that intermittent DBS during the choice period on high-uncertainty trials leads to risk averse behavior is supported by the evidence provided; however, if stimulation had been delivered on all trials (not just 6-card trials), it would have been possible to determine if the effect of stimulation was restricted to conditions with high uncertainty, or if stimulation led to a systematic, consistent bias toward risk averse behavior irrespective of uncertainty. The authors should include such experiments, if possible. If these experiments are too effortful, we strongly suggest that the authors consider this issue as a notable limitation of the study in their discussion, specifically addressing how their interpretation would change depending on what broader patterns might have been observed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36460.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are considerable reservations among the reviewers regarding the fMRI experiments included in the paper.

We agree that a computational model dissecting risk vs. uncertainty vs control could aid in providing potential mechanistic underpinnings on the observed neural responses. After considerable thought we do not believe that this task captures the necessary variability required to draw reliable conclusions.</p><p>The’ War’ task, as presented, is designed to capture’ uncertainty’ through 6-card trials which represent the experimental condition with the highest decision entropy. A mixed-effects generalized linear model on spiking activity in the 500 ms window during the choice period supports uncertainty encoding with no significant terms on reward history (win/loss on previous trial) or Gratton effect (uncertainty on the previous trial).</p><p>Conflict and control encoding are particularly challenging to address with this task design. Conflict requires mutually competing choices which is not explicitly controlled for in this design. Control is similarly difficult as there were no time-to-choice constraints placed on subjects. Other studies have demonstrated both conflict (Cavanaugh et al., 2011, Zaghloul et al., 2012) and control related STN encoding (Isoda and Hikosaka, 2008; Wiecki and Frank, 2013).</p><p>We have added this limitation to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The basic result that intermittent DBS during the choice period on high-uncertainty trials leads to risk averse behavior is supported by the evidence provided; however, if stimulation had been delivered on all trials (not just 6-card trials), it would have been possible to determine if the effect of stimulation was restricted to conditions with high uncertainty, or if stimulation led to a systematic, consistent bias toward risk averse behavior irrespective of uncertainty.

If these experiments are too effortful, we strongly suggest that the authors consider this issue as a notable limitation of the study in their discussion, specifically addressing how their interpretation would change depending on what broader patterns might have been observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree and have previously considered this experiment ourselves. Although we hope to perform this experiment in the future, at the moment, it will need to remain outside of the scope of this manuscript. The lab in which this work was originally performed has recently moved to another university. Additional time and resources will be required to re-initiate these experiments. We have expanded the Discussion to reflect this experimental limitation and elaborate on potential implications.</p></body></sub-article></article>
