Also, systemic signals appear to be required for some transcriptional rhythms in the mammalian liver and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body. Here we show that free-running oscillations of the fat body clock require clock function in the PDF-positive cells of the fly brain. Interestingly, rhythmic expression of the cytochrome P450 transcripts, <italic>sex-specific enzyme 1 (sxe1</italic>) and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic>, which cycle in the fat body independently of the local clock, depends upon clocks in neurons expressing neuropeptide F (NPF). NPF signaling itself is required to drive cycling of <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> in the fat body, and its mammalian ortholog, Npy, functions similarly to regulate cycling of cytochrome P450 genes in the mouse liver. These data highlight the importance of neuronal clocks for peripheral rhythms, particularly in a specific detoxification pathway, and identify a novel and conserved role for NPF/Npy in circadian rhythms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13552.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13552.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13552.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many processes in the body follow rhythms that repeat over 24 hours and are synchronized to the cycle of day and night. Our sleep pattern is a well-known example, but others include daily fluctuations in body temperature and the production of several hormones. Internal clocks located in the brain and other organs drive these rhythms by altering the activity of certain genes depending on the time of day.</p><p>Animals have specific organs that contain enzymes needed to break down toxic molecules in the body, and the levels of several of these enzymes rise and fall over each 24-hour period. In mammals, these enzymes are found in the liver, but in insects they are found in an organ called the fat body. Here, Erion, King et al. set out to determine the extent to which the internal clock in the brain influences the daily rhythms of these enzymes.</p><p>The experiments show that a hormone released by the nervous system is required for the levels of the detoxifying enzymes to change in 24-hour cycles. This hormone – termed Neuropeptide F in fruit flies and Neuropeptide Y in mice – is also known to stimulate both mice and fruit flies to eat. Since toxic molecules often enter the body during feeding, Erion, King et al. speculate that it may be beneficial to link the detoxification process to feeding by using the same mechanism to control both processes. The next step following on from this work would be to find out exactly how neuropeptide F drives the 24-hour rhythms in the fat body and other organs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13552.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13552.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>neuropeptide F</kwd><kwd>neuropeptide Y</kwd><kwd>cytochrome P450</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>neural clocks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS048471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sehgal</surname><given-names>Amita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erion</surname><given-names>Renske</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Anna N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuropeptide F/Y from neurons drives rhythmic expression of detoxification-related genes in a peripheral metabolic tissue in flies and mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian clocks constitute an endogenous timekeeping system that synchronizes behavior and physiology to changes in the physical environment, such as day and night, imposed by the 24 hr rotation of the earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zheng and Sehgal, 2012</xref>). A coherent circadian system is composed of a cooperative network of tissue-specific circadian clocks, which temporally coordinate and compartmentalize biochemical processes in the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wijnen and Young, 2006</xref>). Clock disruption is associated with numerous deleterious health consequences including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marcheva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marcheva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Turek et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the neuronal clock network is comprised of roughly 150 circadian neurons, which are grouped based on their anatomical location and function in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allada and Chung, 2010</xref>). The lateral neurons include the small and large ventral lateral neurons (LNvs), the dorsal lateral neurons (LN<sub>d</sub>s) and the lateral posterior neurons (LPNs). The dorsal neurons are divided into three subgroups, dorsal neurons (DN) 1, 2, and 3. The small LNvs (sLNvs) have traditionally been referred to as the central clock because they are necessary and sufficient for rest:activity rhythms under constant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>), but recent studies also indicate an important role for the LN<sub>d</sub>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). The LNvs express the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF), which is important for rest:activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Renn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stoleru et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoshii et al., 2009</xref>) and for the function of circadian clocks in some peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Myers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krupp et al., 2013</xref>). The LN<sub>d</sub>s constitute a heterogeneous group of neurons differentiated by the expression of peptides and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>). Thus far, these peptides, which include Neuropeptide F (NPF), have only been implicated in behavioral rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hermann-Luibl et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Most physiological processes require clocks in peripheral tissues, either exclusively or in addition to brain clocks. For instance, a peripheral clock located in the fat body, a tissue analogous to mammalian liver and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrese and Soulages, 2010</xref>), regulates feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seay and Thummel, 2011</xref>) and nutrient storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2008</xref>) and drives the rhythmic expression of genes involved in metabolism, detoxification, innate immunity, and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Molecular clocks in the brain and fat body have different effects on metabolism, suggesting that clocks in these two tissues complement each other to maintain metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Such homeostasis requires interaction between organismal clocks, but how this occurs, for example whether neuronal clocks regulate fat body clocks, as they do for some other tissue-specific clocks, is not known. In addition, the fat body clock does not regulate all circadian fat body transcripts. 40% of rhythmically expressed fat body transcripts are unperturbed by the absence of a functional fat body clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting these genes are controlled by rhythmic external factors, which could include light, food, and/or signals from clocks in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wijnen et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise in the mammalian liver, where circadian gene regulation has been well-studied, cyclic expression of many genes persists when the liver clock is ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornmann et al., 2007a</xref>). Brain specific rescue of clock function in <italic>Clock<sup>Δ19</sup></italic> animals partially restored liver gene expression rhythms (~40%), albeit with compromised amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>). The specific signals that mediate this rescue, however, were not identified, although systemic signals that regulate peripheral clocks have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cailotto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornmann et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reddy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oishi et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The relative simplicity of fly neuroanatomy and physiology, the vast array of genetic tools, and the conservation of molecular mechanisms with mammals make the fly an ideal organism to dissect complex interactions between physiological systems. In this study, we found that neural clocks regulate circadian gene expression in the fly fat body, a peripheral metabolic tissue. We demonstrate that cycling of the core clock gene, <italic>period (per</italic>), requires PDF-expressing cells in constant darkness. Interestingly, however, clocks in the NPF-expressing subset of LN<sub>d</sub>s, as well as NPF itself, are important for driving rhythmic expression of specific cytochrome P450 genes that cycle independently of the fat body clock. Lastly, we show that Npy, the mouse homolog of NPF, regulates transcriptional circadian output in the mouse liver. Microarray analyses reveal that Npy contributes to the rhythmic expression of hundreds of transcripts in the liver, including a subset of cytochrome P450 genes. In summary, we identified a conserved role for NPF/Npy neuropeptides in the circadian system in coupling neuronal clocks to transcriptional output in peripheral tissues in flies and mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The central clock regulates the fat body clock in constant darkness</title><p>While some peripheral clocks in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are completely autonomous, e.g. malphigian tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hege et al., 1997</xref>), others rely upon cell-extrinsic factors, in particular the clock in the brain. For example, PDF-positive LNvs are required for rhythmic expression of clock components in the prothoracic gland, a peripheral tissue that gates rhythmic eclosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Myers et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, PDF released by neurons in the abdominal ganglion is necessary to set the phase of the clock in oenocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krupp et al., 2013</xref>), which regulate sex pheromone production and mating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krupp et al., 2008</xref>). We investigated whether clocks in PDF-positive LNvs were necessary for clock function in the abdominal fat body. The molecular clock in <italic>Drosophila</italic> consists of an autoregulatory loop in which the transcription factors, CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC), activate expression of the genes <italic>period (per)</italic> and <italic>timeless (tim)</italic> and PER and TIM proteins feedback to inhibit the activity of CLK-CYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zheng and Sehgal, 2012</xref>). To disrupt the molecular clock exclusively in PDF-positive cells, we used the GAL4/UAS system to express a dominant-negative version of the CLK transcription factor, CLKΔ. CLKΔ lacks regions of its DNA-binding domain, preventing it from binding DNA and activating transcription of genes, including components of the molecular clock. However, CLKΔ can still heterodimerize with its partner, CYC, through its protein interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tanoue et al., 2004</xref>).

We found that circadian expression of <italic>per</italic> in the fat body was not altered in flies with a disrupted central clock (<italic>Pdf</italic>-GAL4/UAS-CLKΔ) under a 12 hr light: 12 hr dark (LD) cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Unlike mammals, peripheral clocks in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can detect light, which acts as the dominant entrainment signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Plautz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oishi et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, under LD conditions, light may directly synchronize oscillations in <italic>per</italic> transcript levels in fat body cells, masking the effects of ablating the central clock. Consequently, we evaluated <italic>per</italic> rhythms in the absence of light. Since rhythmic gene expression dampens under constant conditions and is undetectable in the fat body by the sixth day of DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), we tested rhythmic expression of <italic>per</italic> on the second day in DD (DD2). <italic>per</italic> levels were rhythmic in the fat body of control flies on DD2. In contrast, flies expressing CLKΔ in the LNvs showed an apparent lack of <italic>per</italic> rhythms in the fat body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; see Discussion). This suggests that the clock in PDF-positive LNvs influences the peripheral fat body clock in the absence of external environmental cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rhythmic expression of fat body transcripts that cycle independently of the local tissue clock requires organismal circadian function</title><p>The fat body clock regulates roughly 60% of circadian genes in the fat body; the mechanisms that drive daily cycling of the other 40% of circadian genes in this tissue are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Several potential mechanisms could explain rhythmic gene expression in the absence of the local tissue-specific clock, for example, light, nutrients, or clocks located in other tissues. As noted above, many tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have photoreceptors. Therefore, in addition to entraining clocks to the external environment, LD cycles can drive rhythmic transcription via clock-independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wijnen et al., 2006</xref>). LD cycles can even drive a rhythm of feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), which could lead to cyclic expression of metabolic genes. Nutrients are known to be strong entrainment signals in peripheral tissues; in fact, rhythmic or restricted feeding, even in the absence of a clock, can drive cyclic expression of several fat body genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>).

In fact, DN1s were recently shown to be part of an output circuit regulating rest:activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavanaugh et al., 2014</xref>), and clocks in the DN1s are known to mediate other circadian behaviors, such as aspects of the male sex drive rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujii and Amrein 2010</xref>). However, aside from behavioral rhythms, little is known about the functional significance of the DN1 and LN<sub>d</sub> clusters in regulating circadian outputs. We investigated whether rhythmic <italic>sxe1</italic> expression requires clocks in the DN1 cluster by using the 911-GAL4 driver to target the DN1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavanaugh et al., 2014</xref>). Since expressing CLKΔ in the DN1s was lethal, we expressed dominant negative CYCLE, CYCΔ, in the DN1s and found the manipulation did not alter <italic>sxe1</italic> rhythms or expression levels in the fat body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>The six LN<sub>d</sub>s express NPF (neuropeptide F), sNPF (short neuropeptide F), and ITP (ion transport peptide) in different cells, with some overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muraro et al., 2013</xref>). In adult males, NPF is expressed in 3 out of 6 LN<sub>d</sub>s, as well as a subset of the LNvs and some non-clock neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermann et al., 2012</xref>). NPF is also expressed in endocrine cells in the midgut, although the role of NPF in these cells is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 1999</xref>). We first used <italic>Npf-</italic>GAL4 to target the LN<sub>d</sub>s. Interestingly, we found that expressing CLKΔ under <italic>Npf</italic>-GAL4 severely disrupted expression of <italic>sxe1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This effect was not specific to the CLKΔ transgene, because <italic>sxe1</italic> expression was also abolished using CYCΔ to disrupt clocks in NPF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Since it was possible that expression of CLKΔ or CYCΔ in non-clock NPF cells was disrupting <italic>sxe1</italic> expression, we sought other ways to ablate the clock in LN<sub>d</sub> neurons. A subset of the LN<sub>d</sub> cluster can also be targeted with the <italic>Dvpdf</italic>-GAL4 driver in combination with <italic>pdf</italic>-GAL80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Expressing CLKΔ under <italic>Dvpdf</italic>-GAL4;<italic>pdf</italic>-GAL80 reduced <italic>sxe1</italic> levels throughout most of the day, particularly at ZT16, the time of peak <italic>sxe1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The manipulation did not completely abolish rhythmic expression of <italic>sxe1,</italic> presumably because the <italic>Dvpdf-</italic>GAL4 driver does not target all the NPF clock neurons.</p><p>We also assessed the circadian expression profile of another fat body clock-independent cytochrome P450 gene, <italic>Cyp6a21</italic>. Fat body expression of <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> robustly cycles in wild type flies but rhythmic expression was dampened in <italic>Npf-</italic>GAL4/UAS-CLKΔ flies, with a relatively small reduction in its overall expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This suggests that clocks in NPF-positive neurons have a broader role in regulating the expression of cytochrome P450 genes in the fat body. Furthermore, ablating clocks in NPF-positive cells did not alter rhythmic expression of <italic>per</italic>, indicating that while rhythmic transcriptional output was impaired, the fat body clock remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Together, these data suggest that a subset of LN<sub>d</sub>s expressing NPF drive rhythmic expression of specific fat body genes.</p><p>Next we tested whether overexpressing CLKΔ in NPF-positive neurons in adulthood is sufficient to alter circadian gene expression in the fat body. To limit the expression of CLKΔ to adulthood, we used flies with a tubulin-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> transgene (<italic>tub</italic>-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>) in addition to <italic>Npf</italic>-GAL4 and CLKΔ transgenes. Tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> ubiquitously expresses a temperature-sensitive GAL80 protein, which represses GAL4 activity at the permissive temperature of 18°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>). All <italic>Npf-</italic>GAL4/UAS-CLKΔ; <italic>tub</italic>-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>/+ flies were raised at 18°C and upon reaching adulthood, control flies were kept at 18°C, while experimental flies were shifted to the restrictive temperature (30°C) to induce CLKΔ expression. We found that after shifting flies to 30°C, expression of <italic>sxe1</italic> remained rhythmic and similar to 18°C controls, suggesting adult-specific clock ablation in NPF-positive neurons is either incomplete or insufficient to affect <italic>sxe1</italic> rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). However, this manipulation had a different effect on cyclic expression of <italic>Cyp6a21</italic>. Robust cycling of <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> cycling was maintained in control flies kept at the permissive temperature, although the phase was shifted, perhaps due to the different temperature (18°C) required for this assay. Importantly though, rhythmic expression of <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> was dampened by adult-specific clock ablation in LN<sub>d</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Together these data indicate that clocks in NPF-expressing neurons have differential effects on the expression of cycling fat body genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NPF-NPF receptor axis regulates rhythmic expression of <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic></title><p>After identifying NPF-positive clock neurons as relevant for rhythmic gene expression in the fat body, we reasoned NPF itself might act as a circadian signal. Indeed, NPF was reported to cycle in a subset of NPF-positive neurons, including LN<sub>d</sub>s and LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2013a</xref>). NPF regulates a variety of behavioral processes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> including feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lingo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Itskov and Ribeiro, 2013</xref>), courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dierick and Greenspan, 2007</xref>), and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2013b</xref>). Therefore, we asked if molecular clocks in NPF-positive neurons mediate free-running behavioral rhythms. We found that flies expressing CLKΔ with <italic>Npf</italic>-GAL4 as well as flies carrying a null mutation in <italic>nfpr</italic>, the gene encoding the receptor for NPF, display normal rhythms of rest:activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Dvpdf</italic>-GAL4;<italic>pdf</italic>-GAL80 driving UAS-CLKΔ increased the number of arrhythmic flies and slightly lengthened the period of rhythmic flies, further indicating that <italic>Dvpdf</italic>-GAL4;<italic>pdf</italic>-GAL80 and <italic>Npf</italic>-GAL4 do not represent the exact same population of LN<sub>d</sub>s (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These data suggest that NPF plays at best a minor role in regulating rhythmic locomotor behavior. However, NPF might play a role in other aspects of circadian rhythms, such as circadian control of energy homeostasis.</p><p>To determine whether NPF drives rhythmic <italic>sxe1</italic> expression in the fat body, we began by knocking down <italic>npf</italic> in all NPF-positive cells with RNA interference (RNAi), as <italic>npf</italic> mutants are not available. Driving UAS-<italic>npf</italic> RNAi under <italic>Npf</italic>-GAL4 resulted in dampened but still rhythmic <italic>sxe1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although this manipulation vastly reduced <italic>npf</italic> levels in fly heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), it is possible that very small amounts of NPF can drive some level of cycling; alternatively, knockdown efficiency may have been limited in the NPF-positive clock cells. Thus we tested the null mutant of the sole NPF receptor in <italic>Drosophila, npfr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garczynski et al., 2002</xref>). Our results show <italic>sxe1</italic> levels do not cycle and are dramatically reduced in <italic>npfr</italic> mutants, which phenocopies the daily <italic>sxe1</italic> expression profile of flies expressing either CLKΔ or CYCΔ under <italic>Npf</italic>-GAL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Rhythmic expression of <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> was also lost in the fat body of <italic>npfr</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We speculate that expressing CLKΔ under <italic>Npf</italic>-GAL4 alters the circadian production or release of NPF. Indeed, mRNA analysis of <italic>Npf</italic>-GAL4/UAS-CLKΔ heads showed that <italic>npf</italic> levels were reduced compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) while cyclic <italic>per</italic> expression, which arises from clock function in many different cells, was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Using the newly developed MetaCycle package (see Materials and methods) and a stringent <italic>P-</italic>value cutoff of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 to detect cyclic transcripts, we found that 289 transcripts were cyclic in controls but not in <italic>Npy</italic> KO, indicating that the oscillation of these transcripts is under the regulation of Npy signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Furthermore, the loss of transcript cycling was generally not accompanied by differences in expression levels; in other words, the median transcript abundance in wild type animals correlated with that in <italic>Npy</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Based on our <italic>Drosophila</italic> data and also the fact that Npy regulates <italic>Cyp2b10</italic> expression, we speculated that Npy might have a broader role in regulating cytochrome P450 gene expression. We examined the microarray data for cyclic P450 transcripts and found several of these genes were not cyclic in <italic>Npy</italic> KOs. Notably, the microarray data confirmed our qPCR data for <italic>Cyp2b10</italic> and indicated that <italic>Cyp2r1, Cyp17a1</italic>, and <italic>Cyp2c70</italic> transcripts also cycle in wild type but not in <italic>Npy</italic> KO liver. In contrast, <italic>Cyp3a13 and Cyp7a1</italic> transcripts cycle robustly in both genotypes.</p><p>Lastly, we compared our <italic>Npy</italic> KO data to the previously reported set of liver transcripts whose expression oscillates independently of the liver clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornmann et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2007b</xref>).

As only a subset of liver-clock independent transcripts requires Npy for oscillations, other mechanisms likely contribute to rhythmic expression of these genes (further discussed below). Although many genes, including clock genes, continued to cycle in <italic>Npy</italic> knockout livers, the overall phases and amplitudes of expression for cycling transcripts in <italic>Npy</italic> KO slightly differed from those in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

of circadian gene expression in a peripheral tissue. We find that clocks in PDF-positive neurons influence cycling of the <italic>per</italic> clock gene in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body in the absence of external cues. More importantly, we identify the non-cell autonomous mechanism that underlies cycling of specific fat body transcripts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and specific liver transcripts in mice. We show that clocks in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NPF-positive neurons drive daily expression of <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic>, fat body genes not controlled by the fat body clock. Likewise, mammalian Npy drives rhythmic expression of specific liver transcripts, indicating a conserved role of NPF/Npy in the control of peripheral circadian rhythms.</p><p>Prior to this report, it was proposed that clocks in the brain and fat body interact, but the extent of the interaction and the mechanisms driving it were not identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Our data suggest that in light:dark cycles, the central clock is not required for cycling of the fat body clock, although we cannot exclude an effect on the phase of cycling. However, in constant conditions, the clock in PDF cells influences the fat body clock, as it does the prothoracic gland clock. Future work will determine whether PDF release into the hemolymph influences the fat body clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Talsma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krupp et al., 2013</xref>). Why the central clock regulates only some peripheral clocks in the fly is unclear. Unlike other peripheral clocks, the fat body clock modulates behavioral rhythms, specifically the phase of feeding rhythms, in addition to its own physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seay and Thummel, 2011</xref>). Thus, synchrony between clocks in the brain and fat body is likely essential for metabolic homeostasis.</p><p>The circadian system controls behavior and physiology in large part through its regulation of circadian gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zheng and Sehgal, 2012</xref>). Tissue-specific gene expression patterns are thought to be generated primarily by local clocks; however, few studies have comprehensively evaluated rhythmic expression driven by local clocks versus external factors. A previous comparison of gene expression profiles of flies containing or lacking an intact fat body clock found that the fat body clock only regulates ~60% of all circadian fat body genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Here we report that at least some of the other 40% of circadian fat body genes are regulated by clocks located in other tissues. We found that disrupting clocks in NPF-positive cells abolished rhythmic expression of two cytochrome P450 genes, <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic>. Since we specifically disrupted the molecular clock by expressing CLKΔ or CYCΔ, only NPF-positive cells containing circadian clock components should have been targeted (LNds). We cannot formally exclude the possibility that expression of CLKΔ or CYCΔ in non-clock cells or even in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 1999</xref>) contributes to this phenotype; however, the effect of targeting CLKΔ to specific LN<sub>d</sub>s with the <italic>Dvpdf</italic> driver suggests that these cells contribute to the peripheral rhythm phenotype. In addition, even though NPF expression has been reported in both the LN<sub>d</sub>s and LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermann et al., 2012</xref>), it is unlikely the LNvs regulate <italic>sxe1</italic> rhythms, because disrupting clocks in PDF-positive LNvs does not abolish <italic>sxe1</italic> oscillations. LN<sub>d</sub>s can be synchronized by inputs from LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2014</xref>), but cell-autonomous entrainment mechanisms in the LN<sub>d</sub>s may limit the influence of LNvs in light:dark cycles, which may explain why ablating clocks in LNvs has a small effect on <italic>sxe1</italic> expression. Thus, we suggest that the clocks in LN<sub>d</sub>s are required for cycling of <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> expression in the fat body.</p><p>NPF neuropeptide reportedly modulates rest:activity rhythms in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2013a</xref>). We did not detect a role for clocks in NPF cells, nor for the single known NPF receptor, in the regulation of rest:activity, but it is possible that other mechanisms are utilized. However, we show that NPF regulates the expression of circadian genes in the fat body. Consistent with the assertion that NPF is the relevant output for fat body rhythms from NPF-positive cells, we also found that flies lacking functional clocks in these cells display significantly reduced <italic>npf</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, Lee <italic>et al</italic>. previously showed that <italic>npf</italic> mRNA is absent in the LN<sub>d</sub>s of adult male <italic>Clk<sup>jrk</sup></italic> mutant brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). This further supports our hypothesis that NPF is regulated by the circadian clock in LN<sub>d</sub>s, and its release from these neurons is necessary for mRNA rhythms of specific fat body genes. However, the effect of NPF on the fat body is likely not direct. Some insect species release NPF into the hemolymph to reach other tissues, but this does not appear to be the case in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nässel and Wegener, 2011</xref>). The NPF receptor may function in clock neurons in the dorsal fly brain (i.e. DN1s), neurons in the suboesophageal ganglion, or neurons innervating the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2013a</xref>). Alternatively, NPF could signal through recently identified neurons downstream of the clock network, which are part of the circadian output circuit driving rest:activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavanaugh et al., 2014</xref>). Although much is known about the neuronal clock network, very little is known about the neurons and signals downstream of the clock network, which make up the output pathways leading to rhythms in behavior and physiology. Our discovery that NPF-positive clock neurons drive rhythmic gene expression in the fat body provides a unique opportunity to investigate the pathway(s) that convey circadian information from the brain to peripheral tissues.</p><p>We report a striking parallel in the mammalian system, where the NPF ortholog, Npy, drives cyclic expression of specific liver genes, notably several in the cytochrome P450 pathway. Npy is not required for free-running rest:activity rhythms in mice, but it promotes phase shifts in these rhythms in response to non-photic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yannielli and Harrington, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maywood et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besing et al., 2012</xref>). Behavioral effects of Npy are likely mediated by its brain expression, but as Npy is also expressed in the periphery, it is possible that a peripheral source contributes to cycling in the liver. Regardless, it is clear that Npy has a profound effect on circadian gene expression in the liver.</p><p>Since NPF promotes feeding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lingo et al., 2007</xref>) and Npy does so in mice, it is possible NPF/Npy drive cycling in the fat body/liver through the regulation of feeding. Feeding is known to be a potent stimulus for metabolic clocks, with circadian gene expression in peripheral tissues driven by restricted feeding cycles in both flies and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vollmers et al., 2009</xref>). However, under conditions of <italic>ad lib</italic> food, feeding rhythms in flies are of low amplitude and likely insufficient to drive robust cycling. Consistent with this, while cyclic expression of <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> can be driven by a restricted feeding paradigm, as can the clock in the fat body, cycling is more robust when this paradigm is conducted in wild type versus clockless animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that its regulation is not through feeding alone. Finally, time restricted feeding experiments of mice do not support the idea that restricted feeding drives cycling of <italic>Cyp2b10</italic> in clockless mice, even though it is sufficient to maintain rhythms of many other liver genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vollmers et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, while feeding cannot be discounted as an important factor, which may contribute to the cycling of the genes reported here, these genes are unique in their dependence on Npy. Only a limited subset of liver transcripts previously shown to be independent of the liver clock require Npy for cyclic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornmann et al., 2007a</xref>). Similarly, several fly genes, for example <italic>sxe2</italic> and <italic>CG17562</italic>, continue to oscillate when CLKΔ is expressed under <italic>Npf</italic>-GAL4 (data not shown). These results suggest there are additional mechanisms regulating circadian rhythms in the fat body/liver. Why would more than one mechanism exist to couple rhythmic gene expression in a specific peripheral tissue to other clocks? One possibility is that different mechanisms regulate distinct phases of circadian gene expression. Alternatively, different mechanisms may couple gene expression to different cell populations, processes, or behaviors.</p><p>The functional importance of the interaction between NPF/Npy and fat body/liver genes in the circadian system is unclear. Cytochrome P450 genes, such as <italic>Cyp6a21, sxe1 and Cyp2b10</italic>, are associated with detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">King-Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujii et al., 2008</xref>), which is likely rhythmic, although not yet reported. Overexpression of NPFR in larvae increases foraging behavior as well as consumption of noxious or bitter compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, NPF/Npy signaling is generally associated with an increase in feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lingo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck, 2006</xref>), which can lead to ingestion of toxic substances. Thus, coordination of feeding with expression of detoxification enzymes, such as <italic>sxe1, Cyp6a21</italic> and <italic>Cyp2b10,</italic> through NPF/Npy may have evolved to promote survival. Large delays between consumption of noxious substances and their removal could affect an animal’s health; thus, the need for coordination between clocks in processing such substances. Conservation of cytochrome P450 regulation from flies to mammals supports the idea that neural control of detoxification in the periphery promotes organismal fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13552.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>NPF/Npy regulate rhythmically expressed P450 enzymes in the periphery of flies and mammals.</title><p>A model of brain clock regulation of peripheral cycling. Brain clocks regulate clocks in peripheral tissues. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, clocks in PDF-positive neurons (LNvs) regulate the clock in the fat body. Similarly, in mammals, clocks in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) have been shown to regulate peripheral clocks such as the liver clock via autonomic innervation, glucocorticoids, body temperature, and feeding. In both the fat body and liver, not all circadian transcripts depend on the local-tissue clock. Clocks in NPF-positive LN<sub>d</sub>s and NPF itself regulate circadian expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the fly fat body. The LNvs can influence other brain clocks (such as the LN<sub>d</sub>s), but are not required for rhythms of fat body transcripts in LD as LN<sub>d</sub>s may entrain directly to light. In mammals, Npy was previously known to be a non-photic signal involved in entraining the SCN. However, the SCN could also influence Npy production or release, which in turn drives rhythmic expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13552.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13552.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13552-fig6-v3"/></fig></p><p>In this study we exclusively evaluated males, because the initial studies reporting rhythmic gene expression in the presence and absence of the fat body or liver clock in flies or mammals respectively, were based on males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornmann et al., 2007a</xref>).

The functional significance of sex-specific regulation is unclear, but indicates that other mechanisms could contribute to such coordination in females.</p><p>This work has implications for chronopharmacology, which is based on the circadian timing of drug metabolism, transport, tolerance, and efficacy. Rhythmic expression of genes involved in drug breakdown and absorption in the liver influences drug efficacy and toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dallmann et al., 2014</xref>), and loss of such rhythms can have long-term effects on health and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gachon et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, expression of these genes may be tightly coordinated to optimize drug metabolism, and speaks to the importance of controlling the timing of drugs that have toxic side effects. The role for Npy reported here suggests it could be a potential target for improving drug efficacy and toxicity. Ultimately, understanding circadian rhythms at a systems level, including interactions between tissues and other physiological systems, will be useful from biological and clinical perspectives.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly genetics</title><p>Flies were grown on standard cornmeal-molasses medium and maintained at 25°C.

RNA was purified as described above. Expression profiling was done at the Penn Molecular Profiling Facility using Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, which also provided the annotation files). For extracting expression values of transcripts, raw CEL files were analyzed with the RMA algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Irizarry, 2003</xref>) implemented in the affy package in Bioconductor in R (R 2.14.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gautier et al., 2004</xref>). The newly developed MetaCycle (version 1.0.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gangwug/MetaCycleV100.git">https://github.com/gangwug/MetaCycleV100.git</ext-link>) was used to detect circadian transcripts from time-series expression data in the wild type (WT) and <italic>Npy</italic> knockout (KO) groups, respectively. Key parameters in MetaCycle were the periodicity detection algorithms, JTK_CYCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hughes et al., 2010</xref>) and Lomb-Scargle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glynn et al., 2006</xref>), the period length (set at exactly 24 hr), and the p-value integration method (Fisher’s method, Fisher 1956). Using MetaCycle, we calculated two new features of circadian transcripts, baseline expression level (bEXP) and relative amplitude (rAMP). The former one is defined as the average expression level of a cycling transcript within one period length, and the latter one is a normalized amplitude value with bEXP. Based on analysis results from MetaCycle, expressed transcripts (bEXP larger than 101.6) with a p-value &lt;0.01 in WT and &gt;0.8 in the KO group were considered WT-specific rhythmic transcripts and shown in the heatmap. To generate the heatmap, expression values from replicate libraries in each group were averaged, median normalized by transcript, sorted by phase, and plotted as a heatmap using pheatmap in R.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Sehgal laboratory for input and advice throughout this project.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Erion et al. study an important issue in circadian biology: how peripheral circadian oscillators communicate with the main pacemaker in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The main claim in the manuscript is that <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic>, two genes that cycle independently of the fat body clock require clocks in other tissues. The authors report that both genes are regulated by NPF-expressing neurons which are themselves regulated by CLK. Moreover, the authors present data showing that the mammalian homolog of NPF (Npy) regulates P450 genes in the mouse liver, suggesting that this mechanism is evolutionary conserved. Although the manuscript provides new and interesting data, we have a concerns regarding the interpretation and significance of the data. These are given below. If these important concerns are addressed, this will be a strong addition to the literature. The inclusion of fly and mouse data makes a strong statement and the interesting relationship between circadian timing, metabolism and behaviour becomes more intriguing as it is detailed with genes like <italic>npy</italic> and <italic>sxe1</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> shows that adult ablation of NPF-positive neurons is not sufficient to affect <italic>sxe1</italic> rhythms. Unless we are missing something, does this not contradict the main model stating a relationship between NPF and <italic>sxe</italic> in adults? A clear explanation for this should be provided.</p><p>Another important issue is whether the effect of the brain clock over <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> mRNA level and oscillations are direct through NPF or mediated by another oscillating behavior such as feeding or mating. Determining whether time-restricted feeding (TRF) can have an effect in the phase and amplitude of <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> rhythms in the NPF-DClock flies will help determine whether the observed effects could be due to secondary effects related to feeding or not. Even understanding how TRF affect <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> oscillations could be illuminating in this aspect and provide support for the main hypothesis on the manuscript. Further, it is indeed surprising that the authors don't use the data in Gill et al. (Science, 2014) to determine if this is the case.</p><p>The authors clearly demonstrate that the oscillations of <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>Cyp6a21</italic> are abolished on <italic>Clk<sup>Jrk</sup></italic> mutants and that <italic>Npf</italic> itself it is regulated by CLK. However, these flies have multiple defects and determining the same parameters in <italic>tim</italic> or <italic>per</italic> mutants would be more informative. The authors should either speedily include these results or explain why they are not necessary.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Brain clocks and NPF regulate circadian gene expression in a peripheral metabolic tissue&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior editor and three peer reviewers, one of whom was also guest Reviewing editor, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting paper from Sehgal and colleagues, which concerns the control of circadian cycling of fat body gene expression by the brain clock in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Previously, the Sehgal lab has shown that 40% of cycling fat body transcripts oscillate independently from the local fat body clock, i.e., they are driven by factors external to the fat body clock. The situation is vaguely similar to mammalian liver. The claim now is that the neuropeptide NPF is produced from some clock neurons and regulates the fat body clock. However, all three reviewers had only muted enthusiasm for the current version of this paper. They were also unanimous in wanting a lot more data to support the claim and to raise the profile of the paper. It seemed unlikely to all the reviewers that the authors would be able to gather these data in the requisite 2-month time interval recommended by <italic>eLife</italic>. Moreover, the authors run a substantial risk that the data will change major conclusions of the paper. So with these issues in mind, the reviewers agreed that a rejection decision is more appropriate than revise and that the authors return to <italic>eLife</italic> with a new manuscript if that is the route they choose; this will obviate any temporal issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper from Sehgal and colleagues concerns the control of the fat body clock by the brain clock in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The story is that the neuropeptide NPF is produced from some clock neurons, and it regulates the fat body clock. However, the focus is on a single fat body transcript (out of the 40% that have been reported to oscillate independently from the fat body clock), and it is unclear that this result is applicable to a wider set of mRNAs. The data also make me concerned about developmental effects. Moreover, I am not convinced that any aspect of the fat body clock is influenced by NPF – as distinct from some other effect on gene expression of a rather limited subset of fat body mRNAs. The authors also admit that the effect of NPF on the fat body is almost certainly indirect (through feeding?), so we do not know anything mechanistic about how NPF is exercising its influence.</p><p>I hope the specific comments will be of help to the authors.</p><p>1) In the subsection “The Central Clock Regulates the Fat Body Clock in Constant Darkness”: It would have been much better to use another tool rather than CLK∆, a tool that isn't so disruptive of gene expression. Also, the authors should definitely use gene switch (GS) to avoid developmental effects.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: There are poor fat body rhythms already at DD2 in WT. So they are indeed worse without PDF neuron function, but this is on the whole a quite unimpressive result. The effect is therefore too weak to make such a strong claim, especially without a GS driver and an immediate assay after feeding drug.</p><p>3) The three scenarios the authors describe in the subsection “Rhythmic Expression of Fat Body Transcripts that Cycle Independently of the Local Tissue Clock Require Organismal Circadian Function” include a straw man. The effect of nutrients on the fat body clock depends on the robustness of feeding rhythms, which are rather weak in flies.</p><p>4) The <italic>Clk<sup>jrk</sup></italic> effect could be developmental. This could be addressed (imperfectly but nonetheless appropriately) with <italic>elav</italic> GS.</p><p>5) The authors describe the level of 2 of the 4 fat body cycling genes (externally driven) as &quot;attenuated.&quot; This is inaccurate in my view, as mRNA levels are virtually absent. And it is quite troubling that <italic>sxe1</italic>, the gene that they focus on for the rest of the paper just isn't expressed in <italic>Clk<sup>jrk</sup></italic>. So how does this relate to circadian oscillations?</p><p>6) The authors spend a large amount of text describing negative results, the different clock neuron drivers that have no effect on rhythmicity. It is strange that they do not also use the more typical Clk 4.1 DN1 driver.</p><p>7) The positive result is with the <italic>Npf-GAL4</italic> driver. However, disrupting the clock in these neurons doesn't really eliminate rhythmic expression of <italic><underline>sxe1</underline></italic> mRNA as much as it dramatically lowers expression, i.e., I can imagine a rhythm with very low levels of mRNA.</p><p>8) There are several other difficulties with this result. First there is the usual developmental effects possibility, i.e., no use of gene switch or <italic>tub</italic>-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> to reduce the influence of these effects. Second there is no attempt to address clock neuron specificity. (Could there be relevant CLK and CYC expression in non-clock neurons? Would the addition of cry-GAL80 be informative?)</p><p>9) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> further suggest a developmental effect. This would explain why expression of CLK∆ and the NPFR strain have strong effects (on <italic>sxe1</italic> expression levels, not necessarily rhythmicity) whereas the knockdown is much less potent.</p><p>10) Unfortunately, the mammalian result suffers from similar criticisms. There are lower levels of <italic>cyp2b10</italic> mRNA but still some cycling to my eye. Moreover, this is a systemic KO and all through development.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Erion et al., addresses an important issue in circadian biology: the communication between central and peripheral circadian oscillators in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While I find the work solid and important for the field, I have a few concerns about the interpretation and significance of the data, especially in light of a recent manuscript from the Panda lab (Gill et al., Science 2014). The main claim in the manuscript is that <italic>sxe1</italic> and <italic>sxe2</italic>, two genes that cycle independently of the fat body clock require clocks in other tissues. This seems more prominent for <italic>sxe1</italic>, which they report is regulated by NPF-expressing neurons.</p><p>The main issue is whether the effect of the brain clock over <italic>sxe1</italic> mRNA level and oscillations is direct through NPF or mediated by another oscillating behavior like feeding or mating. I think that determining whether time-restricted feeding (TRF) can have an effect in the phase and amplitude of <italic>sxe1</italic> rhythms in the NPF-DClock flies will help determine whether the observed effects could be due to secondary effects related to feeding or not. Even understanding how TRF affect <italic>sxe1</italic> oscillations could be illuminating in this aspect. I looked into the Gill et al. manuscript, but unhappily <italic>sxe1</italic> was not found among the oscillating mRNAs neither in heads or periphery. This is likely due to difference in strains.</p><p>In the same line as above, some of the Npf-related effects might be developmental and experiments using induced expression of DClk in the NPF cells (i.e. by the use of the GAL80ts system) could rule out this possibility.</p><p>Despite my concern stated above, the authors find good support for their hypothesis that NPF neurons regulate <italic>sxe1</italic> oscillations. However, I would be surprised if this will be the only gene regulated in this way and the manuscript will gain a lot from the description of a second gene in this route.</p><p>Based on the experiment performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> the authors suggest that Clk regulates NPF levels. However, the effect could be due also to effects of CLK∆ in gene expression in cells that normally don't express Clk. In order to rule this out the authors should show that NPF mRNA levels are also downregulated in Clk mutants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study is a follow-up to the author's earlier manuscript showing that ~40% of oscillating transcripts in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body continue to oscillate in the absence of a functional circadian oscillator in the fat-body. Although food, temperature cycle, and light can drive oscillations in the absence of a local peripheral clock, the authors focused on specific transcripts that cannot be driven by these stimuli and hence were dependent on clocks elsewhere. They have systematically addressed this issue by examining the fat-body oscillation of <italic>sxe</italic> genes in fly strains lacking circadian clock in specific neurons and have found the NPF expressing neurons and the NPF signaling system somehow drives peripheral oscillations. To test the relevance of this regulation in mammals, they have tested <italic>Cyp10b2</italic> gene expression in the liver of NPY knockout mice and have shown dampened oscillation. The authors imply that this is the first time a brain derived neuropeptide drives circadian oscillation in a peripheral organ and suggest NPY may be targeted to improve circadian regulation of xenobiotic metabolism.</p><p>Most of the experiments are straightforward in which the authors test mRNA expression of candidate gene by qPCR in various fly lines or liver gene expression in NPY knockout mice.</p><p>Given the role of NPY and NPF in feeding, and feeding is known to drive ~24 hr oscillation in gene expression in the complete absence of a clock anywhere in the body, it is important to have some measure of feeding pattern in these experiments in both flies and mice.</p><p>In rodents, NPY is also expressed in peripheral tissues including the gut. A recent paper from Chang's lab has shown the gut plays a profound role in driving liver circadian gene expression. Therefore, it is premature to state the CNS expression of NPY is driving liver circadian gene expression. The authors may use a hypothalamus specific knockout of NPY if they want to drive this message. Along the same line, it will be worth examining whether NPF system is expressed in the peripheral organs of flies.</p><p>With the lab's track record in genome wide studies and this paper being a follow-up of their earlier gene expression studies in fat body, it is worth including a RNA-seq or microarray study to examine to what extent the NPF system in flies and NPY system in mice regulate circadian fatbody/liver gene expression independent of feeding pattern. Such experiments will expand the impact and relevance of the paper beyond just a couple of liver transcripts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13552.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> shows that adult ablation of NPF-positive neurons is not sufficient to affect sxe1 rhythms.

Thus, it does not appear to be driven by a feeding cycle alone.

The story is that the neuropeptide NPF is produced from some clock neurons, and it regulates the fat body clock. However, the focus is on a single fat body transcript (out of the 40% that have been reported to oscillate independently from the fat body clock), and it is unclear that this result is applicable to a wider set of mRNAs.

Indeed, we make the case in the manuscript that the clock is <italic>not</italic>affected, as <italic>per</italic> cycling is normal when the clock is disrupted in NPF cells. ~30 transcripts in the fat body cycle independently of the fat body clock, and appear to be controlled by different mechanisms. For instance, in other work we have found that cycling at least one of these transcripts requires insulin-producing cells. The transcripts reported in this manuscript, <italic>sxe1</italic> and a second characterized in the revised manuscript, <italic>cyp6a21</italic>, depend on NPF. As noted below, we have now conducted experiments to address the developmental issue raised by the reviewer. The identification of NPF as a neural factor that drives rhythmic expression in a metabolic tissue provides a mechanism for a longstanding question of interest in the circadian field, namely how coordinated action of clocks in different tissues regulates circadian outputs (metabolic gene expression in this case).</p><p>Exactly how NPF does so is, we believe, beyond the scope of this manuscript. As discussed in detail in response to Reviewer 3 (and also in the manuscript in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion), feeding may contribute to the effects of NPF/NPY, but it is unlikely to be the only mechanism.</p><p> <italic>1) In the subsection “The Central Clock Regulates the Fat Body Clock in Constant Darkness“: It would have been much better to use another tool rather than CLK</italic>∆<italic>, a tool that isn't so disruptive of gene expression.

Unfortunately, no other tool effectively disrupts the clock. In response to the reviewer’s question, we conducted experiments to avoid developmental effects. As a gene switch (GS) driver was not available for NPF cells and we felt that disrupting the clock in all neurons (with <italic>elav</italic> GS) constituted too blunt a tool, we used the longer and more laborious method of coupling <italic>Npf-</italic>GAL4 with temperature sensitive tubulin-GAL80. Restricting clock disruption in NPF cells to the adult stage did not affect <italic>sxe1</italic> cycling, suggesting that the effect is developmental. However, it did affect cycling of <italic>cyp6a21</italic>. We conclude that NPF has differential effects on rhythmically expressed transcripts in the fat body.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: There are poor fat body rhythms already at DD2 in WT.

In our experience, the Clk 4.1 DN1 is a weak driver and so we switched to the stronger 911 driver. However, as noted in the text, even this driver did not indicate a role for DN1s.</p><p>7) The positive result is with the NPF-gal4 driver. However, disrupting the clock in these neurons doesn't really eliminate rhythmic expression of <underline>sxe1</underline> mRNA as much as it dramatically lowers expression, i.e., I can imagine a rhythm with very low levels of mRNA.</p><p>As noted above, manipulations of NPF cells do greatly reduce levels of <italic>sxe1</italic> so an effect on levels alone cannot be excluded (note that <italic>Clk<sup>jrk</sup> </italic>mutants show similar levels of <italic>sxe1</italic> so this most likely reflects the effect of loss of the clock on <italic>sxe1</italic>). However, the revised manuscript shows that disrupting the clock in NPF cells clearly dampens cycling of <italic>cyp6a21.</italic></p><p>8) There are several other difficulties with this result. First there is the usual developmental effects possibility, i.e., no use of gene switch or tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> to reduce the influence of these effects. Second there is no attempt to address clock neuron specificity. (Could there be relevant CLK and CYC expression in non-clock neurons? Would the addition of cry-GAL80 be informative?)</p><p>We have addressed a possible developmental effect through the use of <italic>tub</italic>-GAL80 (see above). Also, the manuscript demonstrates a role for the LN<sub>d</sub> clock neurons through the useof the <italic>DvPdf</italic> driver.</p><p>9) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> further suggest a developmental effect. This would explain why expression of CLK∆ and the NPFR strain have strong effects (on sxe1 expression levels, not necessarily rhythmicity) whereas the knockdown is much less potent.</p><p>As our new data indicate, the effect of NPF on <italic>sxe1</italic> is indeed developmental. However, adult-specific manipulation of NPF cells clearly has an effect on cycling of <italic>cyp6a21.</italic></p><p><italic>10) Unfortunately, the mammalian result suffers from similar criticisms. There are lower levels of cyp2b10 mRNA but still some cycling to my eye. Moreover, this is a systemic KO and all through development.</italic> In response to Reviewer 3’s last comment, we conducted microarray analysis to compare cycling gene expression in wild type and <italic>NPY</italic> knockout livers, and find that many liver transcripts require NPY for rhythmicity. We show also that average levels of transcripts are not altered in NPY livers.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Erion et al., addresses an important issue in circadian biology: the communication between central and peripheral circadian oscillators in Drosophila. While I find the work solid and important for the field, I have a few concerns about the interpretation and significance of the data, especially in light of a recent manuscript from the Panda lab (Gill et al., Science 2014). The main claim in the manuscript is that sxe1 and sxe2, two genes that cycle independently of the fat body clock require clocks in other tissues. This seems more prominent for sxe1, which they report is regulated by NPF-expressing neurons.</p><p>The main issue is whether the effect of the brain clock over sxe1 mRNA level and oscillations is direct through NPF or mediated by another oscillating behavior like feeding or mating. I think that determining whether time-restricted feeding (TRF) can have an effect in the phase and amplitude of sxe1 rhythms in the NPF-DClock flies will help determine whether the observed effects could be due to secondary effects related to feeding or not. Even understanding how TRF affect sxe1 oscillations could be illuminating in this aspect. I looked into the Gill et al. manuscript, but unhappily sxe1 was not found among the oscillating mRNAs neither in heads or periphery. This is likely due to difference in strains.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we conducted time-restricted feeding (TRF) experiments and assayed effects on cycling of <italic>sxe1</italic> as well as of the <italic>period (per)</italic> clock gene. We found that restricting food to a time of day when flies do not normally feed alters the phase of both <italic>per</italic> and <italic>sxe1</italic> cycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). Thus, <italic>sxe1</italic> is sensitive to feeding, but not more so than <italic>per</italic>, which is not regulated by NPF. In addition, as noted below, we have found that effects of NPF on <italic>sxe1</italic> are developmental, so it does not appear that cycles of feeding directly drive cycling of <italic>sxe1</italic>. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that at least some effects of NPF on peripheral rhythms are mediated through feeding. (See also the response to Reviewer 3’s first point)</p><p>(A) The restricted feeding procedure for flies. Food was restricted to ZT9-ZT15, the trough of feeding determined in Xu et al. 2008. Flies were transferred to a 1% agar vial from a normal food vial on day 1. Restricted feeding was started on day 2 and continued until day 7 at which point the flies were collected. (B, C) Quantitative PCR was performed to assay expression of <italic>sxe1</italic> (B)and <italic>per</italic> (C)at different times of day in the fat body of flies maintained on ad lib food (blue) or restricted to food between ZT9 and ZT15 (red). Expression values are normalized to α-tubulin. Each data point represents the average of <italic>n</italic>=2-3 independent samples, and the error bars represent SEM.</p><p>In the same line as above, some of the Npf-related effects might be developmental and experiments using induced expression of DClk in the NPF cells (i.e. by the use of the GAL80ts system) could rule out this possibility.</p><p>Upon the reviewer’s recommendation, we used the GAL80ts system to restrict expression of DClk to adult NPF cells. We show in the revised manuscript that effects of NPF on <italic>sxe1</italic> are developmental. However, a new gene we have characterized in the revised manuscript, <italic>cyp6a21</italic>, is regulated by NPF in adults.</p><p>Despite my concern stated above, the authors find good support for their hypothesis that NPF neurons regulate sxe1 oscillations. However, I would be surprised if this will be the only gene regulated in this way and the manuscript will gain a lot from the description of a second gene in this route.</p><p>As suggested, we have included analysis of a second gene, <italic>cyp6a21</italic>.</p><p>Based on the experiment performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> the authors suggest that Clk regulates NPF levels. However, the effect could be due also to effects of ClkDelta in gene expression in cells that normally don't express Clk. In order to rule this out the authors should show that NPF mRNA levels are also downregulated in Clk mutants. This is an important point. In fact, it was previously shown that NPF mRNA levels are reduced in <italic>Clk</italic> mutants (Lee, Bahn, and Park 2006).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This study is a follow-up to the author's earlier manuscript showing that ~40% of oscillating transcripts in the Drosophila fat body continue to oscillate in the absence of a functional circadian oscillator in the fat-body. Although food, temperature cycle, and light can drive oscillations in the absence of a local peripheral clock, the authors focused on specific transcripts that cannot be driven by these stimuli and hence were dependent on clocks elsewhere. They have systematically addressed this issue by examining the fat-body oscillation of sxe genes in fly strains lacking circadian clock in specific neurons and have found the NPF expressing neurons and the NPF signaling system somehow drives peripheral oscillations. To test the relevance of this regulation in mammals, they have tested Cyp10b2 gene expression in the liver of NPY knockout mice and have shown dampened oscillation. The authors imply that this is the first time a brain derived neuropeptide drives circadian oscillation in a peripheral organ and suggest NPY may be targeted to improve circadian regulation of xenobiotic metabolism.</p><p>Most of the experiments are straightforward in which the authors test mRNA expression of candidate gene by qPCR in various fly lines or liver gene expression in NPY knockout mice.</p><p>Given the role of NPY and NPF in feeding, and feeding is known to drive ~24 hr oscillation in gene expression in the complete absence of a clock anywhere in the body, it is important to have some measure of feeding pattern in these experiments in both flies and mice.</p><p>As noted by Reviewer 1, feeding rhythms are relatively low amplitude and so it would be difficult to see changes in these. We did examine the response of <italic>sxe1</italic> to restricted feeding and found that it is not affected any more than <italic>per</italic> (see response to Reviewer 2, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). In addition, as noted above, the effect of NPF on <italic>sxe1</italic> is developmental and, therefore, not a direct response to feeding. Regarding <italic>Cyp6a21</italic>, we showed previously that while it can be driven by restricted feeding (RF) in <italic>Clk<sup>jrk</sup> </italic>flies the rhythm is not as robust as seen upon RF in wild type flies (Xu et al., 2011). Thus, it does not appear to be driven by a feeding cycle alone. Finally, the Panda database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://circadian.salk.edu/about.html">http://circadian.salk.edu/about.html</ext-link>) does not indicate restoration of <italic>Cyp2b10</italic> cycling by restricted feeding of clockless mice. While all these data do not exclude a role of feeding, they indicate that NPF/NPY likely does not act through feeding alone to drive expression of these peripheral genes. We note too that only a limited subset of circadian genes that are independent of the liver clock depend on NPY. If NPY were driving gene expression through rhythmic feeding alone, it would impact most liver genes. The potential role of feeding is now fully discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p> <italic>In rodents, NPY is also expressed in peripheral tissues including the gut. A recent paper from Chang's lab has shown the gut plays a profound role in driving liver circadian gene expression. Therefore, it is premature to state the CNS expression of NPY is driving liver circadian gene expression. The authors may use a hypothalamus specific knockout of NPY if they want to drive this message. Along the same line, it will be worth examining whether NPF system is expressed in the peripheral organs of flies.</italic> We acknowledge that the mouse data do not exclude a role for NPY function in the periphery. This possibility is now mentioned. However, in the fly, our data with the DvPdf driver show that LN<sub>d</sub>s are important for cycling of <italic>sxe1</italic>. In addition, the previous work of Jae Park and colleagues (2006) showed that in <italic>Clk<sup>jrk</sup> </italic>mutants <italic>npf</italic> is downregulated in LN<sub>d</sub>s, but not in other NPF-positive cells. While LN<sub>d</sub>s and NPF could act independently to regulate <italic>sxe1</italic>, it is more likely that LN<sub>d</sub>s are the source of NPF in this case.</p><p>With the lab's track record in genome wide studies and this paper being a follow-up of their earlier gene expression studies in fat body, it is worth including a RNA-seq or microarray study to examine to what extent the NPF system in flies and NPY system in mice regulate circadian fatbody/liver gene expression independent of feeding pattern. Such experiments will expand the impact and relevance of the paper beyond just a couple of liver transcripts.</p><p>We have done as the reviewer suggested, and examined the genome-wide impact of loss of NPY. The revised manuscript presents our new microarray data showing that the cycling of several liver transcripts is regulated by NPY.</p></body></sub-article></article>
