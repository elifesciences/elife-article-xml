birds or insects. However, the effect of this rapid divergence on transcriptional evolution remains unclear. Recent reports have indicated a faster divergence of transcription factor binding in mammals than in insects, but others found the reverse for mRNA expression. Here, we show that these conflicting interpretations resulted from differing methodologies. We performed an integrated analysis of transcriptional network evolution by examining mRNA expression, transcription factor binding and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motifs across &gt;25 animal species, including mammals, birds and insects. Strikingly, we found that transcriptional networks evolve at a common rate across the three animal lineages. Furthermore, differences in rates of genome divergence were greatly reduced when restricting comparisons to chromatin-accessible sequences. The evolution of transcription is thus decoupled from the global rate of genome sequence evolution, suggesting that a small fraction of the genome regulates transcription.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11615.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11615.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11615.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic information that makes each individual unique is encoded in DNA molecules. Cells read this molecular instruction manual by a process called transcription, in which proteins called transcription factors bind to DNA in specific places and regulate which sections of the DNA will be expressed. These 'transcripts' are active molecules that determine the cell’s – and ultimately the individual’s – characteristics. However, it is not well understood how alterations in the DNA of different individuals or species can lead to changes in where the transcription factors bind, and in which transcripts are expressed.</p><p>Carvunis, Wang, Skola et al. set out to determine if there is a relationship between how often DNA changes and how often transcription changes during the evolution of animals. The experiments examined the abundance of transcripts in the cells of a variety of animal species with close or distant evolutionary relationships. For example, the house mouse was compared to a close relative called the Algerian mouse, to another species of rodent (rat) and to humans.</p><p>The experiments show that the changes in transcript abundances are happening at similar rates in mammals, birds and insects, even though DNA changes at very different rates in these groups of animals. This similarity was also observed for other aspects of transcription, such as in changes to where transcription factors bind to DNA. The next challenges are to find out what makes transcription evolve at such similar rates in these groups of animals, and whether these findings extend to other species and to other processes in cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11615.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11615.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>transcription factor binding</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>genome evolution</kwd><kwd>comparative genomics</kwd><kwd>cis-regulatory sequences</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM084279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ideker</surname><given-names>Trey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 GM085764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ideker</surname><given-names>Trey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Tina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 GM108865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carvunis</surname><given-names>Anne-Ruxandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcriptional regulation evolves at indistinguishable rates in mammals, birds and insect lineages despite large differences in underlying rates of sequence evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A long-standing question in biology is what fraction of the genome regulates transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niu and Jiang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kellis et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies of chromatin structure have implicated half of the human genome in regulatory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>). Comparative genomic studies, however, have shown that less than 10% of the human genome is evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that many of the experimentally-detected interactions are not functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graur et al., 2013</xref>). Recent studies have measured the association between sequence changes and changes in transcript levels, epigenetic modifications or binding of transcription factors regulating specific gene sets (gene-specific transcription factors, GSTF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cookson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McVicker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heinz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibata et al., 2012</xref>). These experiments demonstrated that genomic sequences can influence transcription even in the absence of evolutionary conservation. For instance, some repetitive elements previously thought to be 'junk' DNA have been shown to effectively regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rebollo et al., 2012</xref>). The rapid evolution of repetitive and other rapidly-evolving sequences could cause pervasive rewiring of transcriptional networks through creation and destruction of regulatory motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villar et al., 2014</xref>). Such rapid transcriptional evolution would set mammals apart from other metazoans like birds or insects, whose genomes contain far fewer repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taft et al., 2007</xref>) and tend to be more constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A few studies have attempted to assess whether transcriptional networks evolve more rapidly in mammals than in insects from the fruit fly genus <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These studies have reached conflicting conclusions. When examining the evolution of GSTF binding, chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) studies in mammalian livers have generally described faster divergence rates than similar studies in fly embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stefflova et al., 2013</xref>). However, divergence rates were estimated with different analytical methods in the different ChIP studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardet et al., 2012</xref>). Another study found that gene expression levels may diverge at a slower rate in mammals than in flies, by comparing genome-wide correlations of mRNA abundances estimated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for mammals but by a mixture of technologies for flies including microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coolon et al., 2014</xref>). Although the inconsistencies between these conclusions may indicate that the evolution of transcriptional networks is fundamentally different in mammals and insects, they may also reflect a sensitivity of evolutionary rate estimations to technical methodology.</p><p>Here, we jointly examined the evolution of gene expression levels and the underlying genome-wide changes in GSTF binding and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences using consistent methodologies both within and across various animal lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We assembled a comparative genomics platform encompassing &gt;40 publicly available datasets spanning &gt;25 organisms representative of the <italic>Mammalia</italic> (mammals), <italic>Aves</italic> (birds) and <italic>Insecta</italic> (insects) phylogenetic classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We designed a statistical framework to objectively compare the rates of divergence of these various datasets across lineages. In brief, an exponential model describing evolutionary divergence under a common, lineage-naïve rate was evaluated against a lineage-aware model, accounting for both statistical significance and effect size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; Materials and methods). We assessed the power of this statistical framework using simulations and found that it could detect differences in divergence rates with high sensitivity (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>As a baseline, we first performed a comparative analysis of the evolution of genome sequences. We randomly sampled genomic segments from designated reference genomes: <italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic> (C57BL/6) for mammals, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> for birds and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> for insects. The rates at which genomic segments that retained homologs with the other species within each lineage accumulate nucleotide substitutions were then estimated and compared using our statistical framework. Segments retaining homologs displayed high sequence conservation across all three lineages, although our framework detected a slightly but significantly faster divergence in insects than in mammals or birds (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we compared the rates at which randomly sampled genomic segments lost homology with the other species within each lineage. We observed a much larger difference in evolutionary rates across lineages using this measure (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For instance, after 100 million years (Myrs) of evolution, only ~30% of mammalian segments retained homology, whereas &gt;60% of bird and insect segments did. These findings recapitulated previous observations according to which genome sequences are less constrained in mammals than in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>) or birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11615.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Statistical framework to evaluate differences in evolutionary rates of change.</title><p>Throughout this study we frequently evaluated whether the rate of evolutionary divergence of a given layer of transcriptional regulation differs between lineages.

We considered all GSTFs that were profiled using ChIP followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) in at least three related species, where separate ChIPs were performed per species. GSTFs meeting these requirements were Twist and Giant in fruit fly embryos, and CEBPA, FOXA1 and HNF4A in mammalian livers (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

In total, we executed 108 analytical pipelines to compare divergence rates across 6 pairs of GSTFs (2 in insects each compared with 3 in mammals), the occupancy profiles of which were examined in 3–7 species per lineage (Materials and methods). The values of the estimated rates varied greatly from one combination of parameters to the next (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>). However, in the majority of cases (56–78% over the 6 comparisons), GSTF binding patterns diverged at statistically indistinguishable rates in mammals and insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). Although the computed divergence rates were sensitive to technical methodology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), for a given method the results were generally similar across lineages for all of the five GSTFs investigated.</p><p>To substantiate these findings, we devised a method to compare genome-wide occupancy profiles at single-nucleotide resolution without discretization. We correlated occupancy profiles between pairs of species across all nucleotides where genomes aligned, after accounting for the differences in sequencing depth, read length and fragment size across datasets (Materials and methods). Again, we found indistinguishable divergence rates, regardless of which GSTF or lineage was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). After 100 Myrs of evolution, the correlation of GSTF occupancy profiles was 0.10 in mammals and 0.13 in insects. As a control, we also applied this method to CTCF, a pleiotropic DNA-binding protein that acts as chromatin insulator and looping factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohlsson et al., 2010</xref>). In mammals, patterns of DNA occupancy have been shown to be more conserved for CTCF than for GSTFs using unified analytical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, CTCF DNA occupancy was shown to diverge rapidly in insects, perhaps due to the existence of other insulator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). Our analysis successfully recapitulated this difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), demonstrating that the common evolutionary rate observed among GSTFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>) was not an artifact of our method for profile correlation.</p><p>The similarity of divergence rates observed across lineages for gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and GSTF binding patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) was unexpected given the rapid evolution of genomic sequences in mammals relative to insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>) or birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We therefore further examined these trends at the level of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences. First, we considered the DNA sequence motifs thought to be specifically recognized by the mammalian and insect GSTFs included in the previous ChIP-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Next, we studied the evolution of a broader set of motifs corresponding to GSTFs shared between <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We found that these motifs were retained at similar rates across lineages relative to background expectations in 8 out of 12 cases (one example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>; all other cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11615.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Regulatory sequences diverge at similar rates across lineages.</title><p>(<bold><bold>a</bold></bold>) The motifs for CEBPA, HNF4A and FOXA1 in mammals and for Twist and Giant in insects are retained at a common rate.

By applying unified analytical methods to data from different lineages, we were able to glean novel insights into the evolution of transcription in animals. We observed that gene expression levels, GSTF binding patterns, regulatory motifs and chromatin-accessible sequences each diverged at rates that were similar across mammals, birds and insects. These unexpected results reconcile previously conflicting findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Villar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coolon et al., 2014</xref>), highlighting the importance of unified study methodologies and providing evidence for a common evolutionary rate in metazoan transcriptional networks.</p><p>Most functional genomics studies have focused on humans and model organisms such as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> or <italic>M. musculus</italic>, which are distantly related to each other. However, data on closely related species, like those which we collected in this study, are needed to investigate the dynamics of molecular network evolution. Unfortunately, such data remain scarce, leading to important limitations of our work. We only investigated three lineages and six to twelve organisms per lineage with non-uniform coverage over evolutionary time. In addition, we only examined a small number of tissues for each lineage and a total of five GSTFs (none in birds). The generalizability of our observations thus remains to be further evaluated as more data becomes available. Despite these limitations, our finding that transcriptional networks evolve at a common rate per year across animal lineages was strikingly robust across data layers.</p><p>The underlying mechanisms responsible for this concordance of evolutionary rates are unclear. Mammals, birds and insects exhibit wide differences in the features that are traditionally associated with evolutionary rates, such as generation times and breeding sizes. Populations with small breeding sizes, such as mammals, are thought to be more prone to genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohta, 1992</xref>). This theory accounts for the abundance of repetitive elements and the rapid evolution of genomic sequences in mammals relative to insects, which have much larger breeding sizes. If the same theoretical principles also governed the evolution of transcriptional networks, we would have expected that transcription would evolve more rapidly in mammals than in insects. Instead, our results show that the evolution of transcriptional networks, whether slow (e.g. transcript levels) or fast (e.g. GSTF binding), is decoupled from the lineage-specific features that govern genome sequence evolution.</p><p>One potential model could be that repetitive and rapidly-evolving sequences, which make up the majority of the mammalian genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taft et al., 2007</xref>), play a negligible role in the global regulation of gene expression. Rather, chromatin-accessible regions may represent the only portion of the mammalian genome that effectively regulates transcription. We observed that chromatin-accessible regions diverge much more slowly than other non-coding sequences in mammals, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). These differences in divergence rates, however, were not found in birds and insects. As a result, chromatin-accessible regions in mammals are conserved at levels similar to those in birds and insects, in contrast to the genome as a whole. According to this model, the similar rates of evolution of chromatin-accessible sequences would constrain the dynamics of transcriptional evolution to be similar across lineages. The regulatory potential of repetitive and other rapidly-evolving elements could be rendered functionally inconsequential by silencing, or could be concentrated on controlling the expression of genetic elements that we did not investigate, such as non-coding RNAs or species-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sundaram et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>An alternative model could be that the sequences that control transcriptional regulation in birds and insects evolve particularly rapidly within otherwise stable genomes. In these organisms, transcriptional networks would diverge under the action of natural selection, through specific single nucleotide substitutions resulting in rapid compensatory turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2011a</xref>). In mammals, transcriptional networks would diverge in a largely neutral fashion driven for instance by transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sundaram et al., 2014</xref>). In this case, similar rates of transcriptional divergence across lineages would arise through very different evolutionary processes.</p><p>Importantly, none of the aforementioned models account for the differences in generation times between lineages. Evolutionary changes occurring based on chronological time and not generation time has also been observed for many protein-coding sequences. Observations such as these led to the molecular clock theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar, 2005</xref>). The mechanisms through which environmental forces entrain these chronological evolutionary clocks remain to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genome and annotation sources</title><p>We downloaded genome sequences for organisms belonging to three metazoan lineages: mammals, birds and insects.

Our framework detected an absolute rate difference of 0.001 in 39.3% of simulations and an absolute rate difference of 0.003 in 88.9% of simulations when the standard deviation was high (5%).

The output of each pipeline was the fraction of reference subset segments that overlapped segments occupied in the others species (i.e. segments retaining occupancy between the two species). This output was used as a cross-species similarity measure for GSTF binding patterns. We analyzed these similarity measures for 6 pairs of GSTFs (Twist and Giant were each compared to FOXA1, CEBPA and HNF4A) using our statistical framework. Two GSTFs were considered to diverge differently from each other over time when 1) the significance of the test was less than 0.05 and 2) the effect size was greater than 5%. In summary we found that the choice of parameters greatly influenced what the evolutionary dynamics of a given GSTF looked like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>) but that in general the rate of divergence of mammal and insects GSTFs were statistically indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

We applied the same statistical framework to the within-lineage comparison between FOXA1 and CEBPA and detected that FOXA1 evolves faster than CEBPA in 74/108 instances. We believe that most of these detected differences are artifacts because the conservation of binding patterns for FOXA1 and CEBPA is in fact highly correlated throughout all combinations of parameters when restricting analyses to data points up to 20 Myrs (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.96).

We used a modified approach that considered only the density of 5' read start sites on each strand, rather than the density of the entire read. The first peak of the cross-correlation values was identified by approximating the first derivative by the finite difference method, smoothing the derivative values with a Gaussian kernel of bandwidth 10, and identifying the first downward zero-crossing of the curve. This position was used as the estimated mean fragment size <italic>L</italic>. We created imputed fragments by extending each read start site by <italic>L</italic> base pairs in the 3' direction.

Any multi-mapping reads with the ‘XS:’ flag were removed and the 5’ and 3’-most positions of the remaining read alignments recorded.

We then calculated the percentage of segments that were successfully mapped (i.e. retained homology), excluding segments that mapped to a region longer than 1000 bp. The entire simulation was repeated 20 times, starting each time with different sets of 5000 segments. The percentages of segments retaining homology were recorded for each of the 20 simulations, and averaged for each pair of species. These averages were plotted and used as inputs for our statistical framework. Varying the minMatch parameter of the LiftOver tool to 0.5 and segment length to 150 bp allowed us to verify that the observed trends were robust to sequence similarity thresholds and length sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Nucleotide substitution rate within retained genomic segments (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>)</title><p>The nucleotide sequences of the genomic segments from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that retained enough homology to undergo a pairwise alignment were extracted using the getfasta function of BEDTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). These sequences were then pairwise aligned using EMBOSS suite’s implementation of Smith-Waterman local alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rice et al., 2000</xref>). Default values for gap open penalty (10), gap extend penalty (0.5) and scoring matrix (EDNAFULL) were used to dynamically choose the best local alignment between reference and query sequences. For each cross-species comparison, we calculated the average percent identity of the ungapped alignments of all the segments across 20 randomizations. This procedure yielded values similar to those described previously for the mouse / human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Waterston et al., 2002</xref>) and <italic>D. melanogaster / D. pseudoobscura</italic> comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richards et al., 2005</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors (Duncan Odom).

Carvunis et al. confirm that the rate of gene expression evolution is comparatively stable in both fruit flies and mammalian clades, and newly show that using a uniform analysis approach strongly suggests that underlying TF binding evolution also appears to occur at a comparable rate. They provide some evidence towards the hypothesis that this rate is mediated by the different rates of change found in euchromatic versus heterochromatic components of the mammalian genome.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The methods should be more carefully documented and the main text and supporting materials sections better cross-referenced (Reviewer #1).</p><p>2) The Discussion should be somewhat increased, and the major points brought up by all three reviewers addressed.</p><p>3) A few of the results should be revisited with new analysis (see Reviewer #3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an extremely important manuscript in regulatory evolution that, in essence, harmonizes apparently contradictory results from a number of previously published studies by using a carefully designed and uniform analysis methodology. There has been considerable debate around how rapidly transcription and transcriptional regulation evolve between species. In particular, fruit flies and mammals have been reported to have surprisingly different tempos of gene-specific TF binding divergence. Carvunis et al. extract the raw data from a number of studies, and then apply rigorously a combination of analysis protocols with many combinations of widely used tools. They reveal that when analyzed together, gene expression and TF binding evolve similarly in drosophila and mammals. Finally and importantly, Carvunis et al. reveal that a likely culprit for the disconnect between rapid sequence evolution of mammals and the slower SPTF binding and gene expression evolution is the rapid divergence of chromatin inaccessible DNA in mammals. This last point is the key intellectual (as opposed to technical/analytical) insight within this paper.</p><p>Aside from more clearly outlined computational handling and a few minor revisions I suggest for consideration below, this straightforward and timely paper will be an excellent contribution to the ongoing discussion of evolutionary genetics.</p><p>Major considerations:</p><p>1) Materials and methods. Starting from paragraph two of the Results, the authors should direct the reader to the Methods section, and write a concise, but carefully laid out, description of how each step was performed. For instance from paragraph two of the Results, the inter-species normalization of gene expression is a notoriously tricky bit of analysis, per the Brawand et al. Nature 2011 study. I think this really must be carefully walked through. Similarly for all the other sections later.</p><p>2) Points not mentioned in this version that could be additionally dissected in the Discussion include:</p><p>The impact of effective breeding sizes on how chromatin accessible and inaccessible DNA is handled.</p><p>How the breeding rate and absolute time (MY) could interplay in driving evolution (in other words, 40 MY for flies is a LOT more generations than for mice).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study draws on published datasets to study the evolution of transcriptional regulation in three clades (mammals, birds, and diptera). The basic finding is that rates of evolutionary divergence in transcript abundance, transcription factor binding site occupancy, open chromatin sequence evolution, and transcription factor motif sequences are similar in the three clades. This result is unexpected, as previous studies have reported rather different rates of evolution for some of these features. The authors use this observation to argue that only a small fraction of the genome is involved in transcriptional regulation.</p><p>A notable strength of this study is that the authors applied uniform methods of analysis to similar kinds of data, demonstrating that the differences in evolutionary rates reported in the earlier publications are at least in part an artifact of the different methods of analysis that they used. (The impact of different technology platforms, which is also likely a contributing factor, was not addressed.) These results provide an important cautionary lesson, namely that it is essential to work with closely comparable data and to apply uniform methods of analysis before drawing conclusions about biological differences or similarities based on functional genomic datasets. The study is valuable for this reason alone.</p><p>Where it is less successful is in providing new insights:</p><p>1) The plots showing similar overall rates of evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) are striking and I'm convinced that the rates are similar among the three clades. But I have no idea what this tells us about the evolution of transcription. I couldn't find any mention in the Results or Discussion sections about how to interpret the observation of rate constancy.</p><p>2) The only conclusion presented in the Discussion concerns the fraction of the genome that regulates transcription. Unfortunately, the bulk of the evolutionary comparisons have no bearing on this conclusion. The only one that does is the rate of sequence evolution within chromatin-accessible regions of the genome after removing core promoters. This comparison is relevant, but not because of the rate constancy among clades. It is relevant because the rate in this fraction of the genome is notably slower than the genome as a whole, and specifically within mammals, which have the greatest proportion of noncoding sequences among the three clades. Thus, most of the rate comparisons among the three clades contribute little or nothing to the conclusion that a small fraction of the genome regulates gene expression.</p><p>3) The observation that regulatory sequences evolve more slowly than other noncoding sequences is by no means a novel observation. This has been noted previously not just in Sundaram et al. (2014) (as the authors point out), but in several others, including Yue et al. (2014) and papers from Odom's group and Crawford's group. So the basic conclusion of the study was already apparent. Indeed, this is the logic that Graur et al. (2013) used to argue that the ENCODE team overestimated the fraction of noncoding sequences that are functional.</p><p>4) The argument that sequence conservation implies that a small fraction of sites regulate transcription is not as straightforward as implied in the Discussion. The ENCODE team wrote a thoughtful rebuttal of the Graur et al. paper (Kellis et al. 2014 PNAS 111:6131) that should be cited in this regard. Beyond the narrow debate about the ENCODE claims, it has been clear for quite some time that some enhancers and transcription factor binding sites turn over quite rapidly in evolution even though they are known to play a role in transcriptional regulation. See Yue et al. (2014) for a recent example, but there are many others. It is clear that negative selection is not the only evolutionary mechanism that operates on regulatory sequences. Using conservation as a criterion for function will thus overlook some functional sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Carvunis et al. present an interesting analysis comparing evolutionary rate of genomic sequences and transcriptional regulation, by examining gene expression, transcription factor binding, and open chromatin marks across multiple species of mammals, birds, and drosophila. The authors' analyses recapitulate previous results that sequence gain and loss are much more prominent in mammals than in birds and insects, while rates of gene expression level changes are similar. The authors show that the rates of regulatory changes, such as gain and loss of orthologous TF binding and open chromatin events, are indistinguishable between lineages, providing an answer to conflicting reports on the different rates of evolution for genomic sequences and transcription regulation.</p><p>This is a well-written study with important insights. The authors draw a significant conclusion. However, the study has several limitations in their results, reducing their supports to a rather strong conclusion. The authors should either be very clear with the assumptions they made, or presenting stronger and more comprehensive evidence. But I am very excited about this work.</p><p>First, the authors use fraction of ortholog sequence retained as a metric to measure rate of genomic sequence evolution. However, the study should consider sequence evolution in the context of rate of substitution, in addition to what the authors already provide. Retained sequences can evolve at different rate, which is directly related to the arguments the authors make.</p><p>Second, the authors choose to use the exponential decay model to fit this data. While this is a useful model for evolutionary analysis, this is not the only one. Would their conclusion be solid if they fit the data with a different model?</p><p>Third, the species chosen for the study does not provide enough coverage across the 100myrs span. For mammals, there was one data point at 20myrs, and many more data points at either &gt;5myrs, or more than 90myrs. This is a serious concern, because the skewed distribution could potentially bias any model fitting. This is reflected by the TF data for the 20myr comparison. The datapoints at 20myrs were consistently below the fitted curve, often appears quite significantly deviated from the curve.</p><p>Lastly, the number of TFs included in the study is too small to support a quite general and significant conclusion. I don't expect many TF data will become available for the study, so perhaps tuning down some of the claims would be a good response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11615.062</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) The methods should be more carefully documented and the main text and supporting materials sections better cross-referenced (Reviewer #1).</italic> </p><p>We agree with Reviewer #1 that our methods should be more clearly laid out than they were in the original submission.

The description of each step performed for the gene expression analysis is presented in the subsection “Gene expression evolutionary rates (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)” of the revised manuscript and relies on the orthology relationships described in the subsection “Genome and Annotation Sources”. The revised manuscript now includes a paragraph clarifying the steps involved. Similar clarifications were also introduced in other Materials and methods sections. Regarding normalization of RNA-seq data, the algorithm we used for transcript quantification, Sailfish, performs several bias correction steps that are described in the corresponding publication (Patro Nature Biotech, 2014). We note that Brawand and colleagues (Nature, 2011) implemented additional normalization steps in order to search for differentially expressed genes, which we did not attempt in this work.</p><p><italic>2) Points not mentioned in this version that could be additionally dissected in the Discussion include:</italic> </p><p><italic>The impact of effective breeding sizes on how chromatin accessible and inaccessible DNA is handled.</italic></p><p><italic>How the breeding rate and absolute time (MY) could interplay in driving evolution (in other words, 40 MY for flies is a LOT more generations than for mice).</italic> </p><p>To address this comment, we have significantly lengthened our Discussion.

We present the hypothesis that a small fraction of the mammalian genome contributes to transcriptional regulation as a plausible explanation given our observations within chromatin-accessible regions. We also present alternative hypotheses where rapidly evolving portions of the bird and insect genomes may make significant contributions to transcriptional regulation.</p><p><italic>3) The observation that regulatory sequences evolve more slowly than other noncoding sequences is by no means a novel observation. This has been noted previously not just in Sundaram et al. (2014) (as the authors point out), but in several others, including Yue et al. (2014) and papers from Odom's group and Crawford's group.

(2013) used to argue that the ENCODE team overestimated the fraction of noncoding sequences that are functional.</italic> </p><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that the fact that many regulatory sequences are conserved across species was known before our submission. We specifically quoted Yue et al. (2014) in this context as it pertains specifically to comparing chromatin-accessible sequences to random non-coding regions, similar to what we do in the corresponding paragraph. While the slow divergence of chromatin-accessible regions relative to other non-coding regions in mammals may have been easily predicted from pre-existing literature, there was no previously published indication that such difference would be practically nonexistent in birds and insects, leading to a shared divergence rate across the three clades. We have now added text raising and explaining these points in the manuscript Discussion.</p><p><italic>4) The argument that sequence conservation implies that a small fraction of sites regulate transcription is not as straightforward as implied in the Discussion. The ENCODE team wrote a thoughtful rebuttal of the Graur et al. paper (Kellis et al. 2014 PNAS 111:6131) that should be cited in this regard.

Using conservation as a criterion for function will thus overlook some functional sites.</italic> </p><p>We wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer that conservation is by no means the only indicator of regulatory function. We have included the Kellis (2014) reference in the Introduction of our revised manuscript. We never meant to imply that only conserved sites can be functional. Our study is showing that, at different levels of the transcription process, evolutionary rates are shared across mammals, birds and insects. Our point is that these rates could not have been predicted from genome-wide patterns of DNA evolution, as they can be slow (transcript levels, chromatin-accessible sequences) or fast (TF binding, motifs), irrespective of how slow or fast the genome evolves as a whole. We have clarified our language in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>First, the authors use fraction of ortholog sequence retained as a metric to measure rate of genomic sequence evolution. However, the study should consider sequence evolution in the context of rate of substitution, in addition to what the authors already provide. Retained sequences can evolve at different rate, which is directly related to the arguments the authors make.</italic> </p><p>To address this comment, we have measured how much retained sequences changed in nucleotide identity over time. We found that retained sequences were highly conserved at the nucleotide level in mammals, birds and insects. However, insect sequences diverged slightly but significantly faster than bird and mammal sequences. The results of this analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Second, the authors choose to use the exponential decay model to fit this data. While this is a useful model for evolutionary analysis, this is not the only one. Would their conclusion be solid if they fit the data with a different model?</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer’s comment, we conducted an additional analysis aimed at comparing an exponential decay with a linear decay and with a power law decay. Models with more than two parameters were not investigated due to the higher risk of over-fitting.</p><p>To compare the quality of these various decay models, we encoded them in R in a unified regression framework relying on non-linear least squares (nls) – as opposed to the linear least square regression (lm) method used in the original submission. We quantitatively estimated fit qualities across all the data layers and lineages used throughout our manuscript using the AICc criteria, a small-sample-size corrected version of Akaike information criterion. We found that the data are almost always better represented by an exponential decay than by either a linear or a power law decay (as determined by the lowest AICc). The only data type better modelled by a power law decay than by an exponential decay was the nucleotide identity of retained genomic segments, a data type introduced to the manuscript as per the above suggestion of the same reviewer. We felt that introducing additional models that do not adequately fit the majority of the data would not make our results more robust. Therefore, we did not specifically investigate if linear or power law decays would give different results than an exponential decay when comparing lineages with our statistical framework, and we kept the exponential model as the basis of our work.</p><p>While performing this analysis, we discovered that model fitting using nls was much more sensitive to detect changes in decay rates than fitting with lm. In spite of this increase in sensitivity, the vast majority of our results and all of our major conclusions remained unchanged. We thus opted to use nls throughout our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Third, the species chosen for the study does not provide enough coverage across the 100myrs span. For mammals, there was one data point at 20myrs, and many more data points at either &gt;5myrs, or more than 90myrs. This is a serious concern, because the skewed distribution could potentially bias any model fitting. This is reflected by the TF data for the 20myr comparison. The datapoints at 20myrs were consistently below the fitted curve, often appears quite significantly deviated from the curve.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the distribution of mammalian species with fully sequenced genomes across the 100 Myrs range is less than ideal for model fitting. We were able to include a large number of species in some of our analyses (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> includes rabbit and guinea pig, separated from mice by 75 and 86 Myrs, respectively), but the lack of ChIP data for species separated from mouse by more than 20 but less than 90 Myrs is indeed a concern (reflected specifically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).</p><p>In these specific figure panels, the data points at 20 Myrs (corresponding to mouse-rat comparison) are often below the fitted curve while the data points at 91 Myrs (mouse-human) are reasonably well captured. Given the data presented in the submitted manuscript, it is unclear whether the mouse-rat or the mouse-human comparison is the outlier. To remedy this gap to the best of our ability given the available ChIP data, we have added dog samples to our analyses of HNF4A, CEBPA and CTCF. Since dog is very distant from mouse (97 Myrs), adding these samples improved fit confidence at large evolutionary distances. In addition to this improvement, we also added to the revised manuscript a discussion of the limitations of our study posed by the non-uniform coverage of datasets across evolutionary time.</p><p><italic>Lastly, the number of TFs included in the study is too small to support a quite general and significant conclusion. I don't expect many TF data will become available for the study, so perhaps tuning down some of the claims would be a good response.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the number of TFs with occupancy data investigated is too small to make a generalization on TF occupancy evolution, and we have therefore toned down our language in the corresponding paragraphs accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
