Little is known about the organization of the 1.2 Mb genome inside the membrane-limited nucleoid filling the ~0.5 µm icosahedral capsids. Cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, and proteomics revealed that it is encased into a ~30-nm diameter helical protein shell surprisingly composed of two GMC-type oxidoreductases, which also form the glycosylated fibrils decorating the capsid. The genome is arranged in 5- or 6-start left-handed super-helices, with each DNA-strand lining the central channel. This luminal channel of the nucleoprotein fiber is wide enough to accommodate oxidative stress proteins and RNA polymerase subunits identified by proteomics. Such elegant supramolecular organization would represent a remarkable evolutionary strategy for packaging and protecting the genome, in a state ready for immediate transcription upon unwinding in the host cytoplasm. The parsimonious use of the same protein in two unrelated substructures of the virion is unexpected for a giant virus with thousand genes at its disposal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mimivirus</kwd><kwd>giant virus</kwd><kwd>viral dsDNA organization</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>cryo-ET</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>832601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abergel</surname><given-names>Chantal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE11-0033-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abergel</surname><given-names>Chantal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-08-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Couté</surname><given-names>Yohann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-EURE-0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Couté</surname><given-names>Yohann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107806/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grünewald</surname><given-names>Kay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>152/774-1</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST 152/772-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grünewald</surname><given-names>Kay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRA 1200789 HFST-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quemin</surname><given-names>Emmanuelle RJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abergel</surname><given-names>Chantal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Giant viruses now represent a highly diverse group of dsDNA viruses infecting unicellular eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abergel et al., 2015</xref>) which play important roles in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schulz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moniruzzaman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaneko et al., 2021</xref>). They also challenge the canonical definitions of viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forterre, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claverie and Abergel, 2010</xref>) as they can encode central translation components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raoult et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abergel et al., 2007</xref>) as well as a complete glycosylation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piacente et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Notaro et al., 2021</xref>) among other unique features.</p><p>Mimivirus has been the most extensively studied giant virus infecting <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Colson et al., 2017</xref>). The virions are 0.75 µm wide and consist of icosahedral capsids of 0.45 µm diameter surrounded by a dense layer of radially arranged fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raoult et al., 2004</xref>). Structural analyses of the virions have provided some insights into the capsid structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuznetsov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klose et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ekeberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schrad et al., 2020</xref>) but given the size of the icosahedral particles (and hence the sample thickness), accessing the internal organization of the core of the virions remains challenging. Consequently, little is known about the packaging of the 1.2 Mb dsDNA genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chelikani et al., 2014</xref>). Inside the capsids, a lipid membrane delineates an internal compartment (~340 nm in diameter, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), referred to as the nucleoid, which contains the viral genome, together with all proteins necessary to initiate the replicative cycle within the host cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schrad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuznetsov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Claverie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arslan et al., 2011</xref>). Acanthamoeba cells engulf mimivirus particles, fooled by their bacteria-like size and the heavily glycosylated decorating fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">La Scola et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raoult et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Notaro et al., 2021</xref>). Once in the phagosome, the Stargate portal located at one specific vertex of the icosahedron opens up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zauberman et al., 2008</xref>), enabling the viral membrane to fuse with that of the host vacuole to deliver the nucleoid into the host cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schrad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Claverie et al., 2009</xref>). EM studies have shown that next the nucleoid gradually loses its electron dense appearance, transcription begins and the early viral factory is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arslan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suzan-Monti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mutsafi et al., 2014</xref>). Previous atomic force microscopy studies of the mimivirus infectious cycle suggested that the DNA forms a highly condensed nucleoprotein complex enclosed within the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuznetsov et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that opening of the large icosahedral capsid in vitro led to the release of rod-shaped structures of about 30-nm width. These structures were further purified and the various conformations characterized using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), tomography, and mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The mimivirus genomic fiber.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Micrograph of an ultrathin section of resin-embedded infected cells showing the DNA tightly packed inside mimivirus capsids (C) with electron dense material inside the nucleoid (N).

Assuming that the length of DNA in B-form is ~34 Å for 10 bp, the mimivirus linear genome of 1.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> bp would extend over ~400 µm and occupy a volume of 1.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> nm<sup>3</sup> (~300 µm and ~1 × 10<sup>6</sup> nm<sup>3</sup> if in A-form) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2019</xref>).

Obviously, the mimivirus genome cannot be simply arranged linearly in the genomic fiber and must undergo further compaction to accommodate the 1.2 Mb genome in a ~40-µm-long genomic fiber. As a result, the complete mimivirus genome, folded at least five times, fits into the helical shell.

In fact, qu_431 and qu_446 represent, respectively, 4.5% and 9.4% of the total protein abundance in virions whereas they only account for 0.4% and 0.7% of the total protein abundance in the genomic fiber, suggesting that they could be contaminants in this preparation. On the contrary, we calculated enrichment factors of more than 500 (qu_946) and 26 (qu_143) in the genomic fiber samples compared to the intact virion. Finally, the most abundant RNA polymerase subunit (qu_245) is increased by a factor of eight in the genomic fiber compared to intact virion (if the six different subunits identified are used, the global enrichment is sevenfold).

Herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), bacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rao and Feiss, 2015</xref>), and APBV1 archaeal virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ptchelkine et al., 2017</xref>) package their dsDNA genome as naked helices or coils. Yet, APBV1 nucleocapsid structure strikingly resemble the mimivirus genomic fiber with a proteinacious shell enclosing the folded dsDNA genome. Consequently, mimivirus genomic fiber is a nucleocapsid further bundled as a ball of yarn into the nucleoid, itself encased in the large icosahedral capsids. The structure of the mimivirus genomic fiber described herein supports a complex assembly process where the DNA must be folded into five or six strands prior to or concomitant with packaging, a step that may involve the repeat containing regulator of chromosome condensation (qu_366) identified in the proteomic analysis of the genomic fiber. The proteinaceous shell, via contacting residues between the dsDNA and the GMC oxidoreductases, would guide the folding of the dsDNA strands into the structure prior loading into the nucleoid. The lumen of the fiber being large enough to accommodate the mimivirus RNA polymerase, we hypothesize that it could be sitting on the highly conserved promoter sequence of early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suhre et al., 2005</xref>). This central position would support the involvement of the RNA polymerase in genome packaging into the nucleoid and could determine the channel width <italic>via</italic> its anchoring on the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). According to this scenario, the available space (although tight) for the RNA polymerase inside the genomic fiber lumen suggests it could be sterically locked inside the compact form of the genomic fiber and could start moving and transcribing upon helix relaxation, initiating the replicative cycle and the establishment of the cytoplasmic viral factory. The genome and the transcription machinery would thus be compacted together into a proteinaceous shield, ready for transcription upon relaxation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). This organization would represent a remarkable evolutionary strategy for packaging and protecting the viral genome, in a state ready for immediate transcription upon unwinding in the host cytoplasm. This is conceptually reminiscent of icosahedral and filamentous dsRNA viruses which pack and protect their genomes together with the replicative RNA polymerase into an inner core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toriyama, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ding et al., 2019</xref>). As a result, replication and transcription take place within the protein shield and viral genomes remain protected during their entire infectious cycle. In the case of dsDNA viruses however, the double helix must additionally open up to allow transcription to proceed, possibly involving the helicase identified in our proteomic study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Finally, in addition to their structural roles, the FAD containing GMC oxidoreductases making the proteinaceous shield, together with other oxidative stress proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), could alleviate the oxidative stress to which the virions are exposed while entering the cell by phagocytosis.</p><p>Mimivirus virion thus appears as a Russian doll, with its icosahedral capsids covered with heavily glycosylated fibrils, two internal membranes, one lining the capsid shell, the other encasing the nucleoid, in which the genomic fiber is finally folded. To our knowledge, the structure of the genomic fiber used by mimivirus to package and protect its genome in the nucleoid represents the first description of the genome organization of a giant virus. Since the genomic fiber appears to be expelled from the nucleoid as a flexible and subsequently straight structure starting decompaction upon release, we suspect that an active, energy-dependent, process is required to bundle it into the nucleoid during virion assembly. Such an efficient structure is most likely shared by other members of the Mimiviridae family infecting <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> and could be used by other dsDNA viruses relying on exclusively cytoplasmic replication like poxviruses to immediately express early genes upon entry into the infected cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malkin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanc-Mathieu et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, the parsimonious use of moonlighting GMC oxidoreductases playing a central role in two functionally unrelated substructures of the mimivirus particle: (1) as a component of the heavily glycosylated peripheral fibril layer and (2) as a proteinaceous shield to package the dsDNA into the genomic fibers questions the evolutionary incentive leading to such an organization for a virus encoding close to a thousand proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nucleoid extraction</title><p>Mimivirus reunion virions defibrillated, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Notaro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuznetsov et al., 2010</xref>), were centrifuged at 10,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, resuspended in 40 mM TES pH 2 and incubated for 1 hr at 30°C to extract the nucleoid from the opened capsids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Extraction and purification of the mimivirus genomic fiber</title><p>The genomic fiber was extracted from 12 ml of purified mimivirus reunion virions at 1.5 × 10<sup>10</sup> particles/ml, split into 12 × 1 ml samples processed in parallel.

Three independent infections using three different batches of virions were performed and the genomic fiber was extracted from the resulting viral particles to analyze three biological replicates. Extracted proteins were stacked in the top of an SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE gel (4–12% NuPAGE, Life Technologies), stained with Coomassie blue R-250 (BioRad) before in-gel digestion using modified trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casabona et al., 2013</xref>. Resulting peptides were analyzed by online nanoliquid chromatography coupled to tandem MS (UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano and Q-Exactive Plus, Thermo Scientific). Peptides were sampled on a 300 µm × 5 mm PepMap C18 precolumn and separated on a 75 µm × 250 mm C18 column (Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch) using a 60 min gradient for fiber preparations and a 140 min gradient for virion. MS and MS/MS data were acquired using Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific). Peptides and proteins were identified using Mascot (version 2.7.0) through concomitant searches against mimivirus reunion, classical contaminant databases (homemade), and the corresponding reversed databases. The Proline software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouyssié et al., 2020</xref>) was used to filter the results: conservation of rank 1 peptides, peptide score ≥25, peptide length ≥6, peptide-spectrum-match identification false discovery rate &lt;1% as calculated on scores by employing the reverse database strategy, and minimum of 1 specific peptide per identified protein group. Proline was then used to perform a compilation and MS1-based quantification of the identified protein groups. Intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>) values were calculated from MS intensities of identified peptides.

This returned a concentration of 1.5 ng/µl for the dsDNA and 24 ng/µl for the proteins in one sample and 10 ng/µl for the dsDNA and 150 ng/µl for the protein in the second sample (deposited on agarose gel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Considering that all proteins correspond to the GMC-oxidoreductase subunits (~71 kDa), in the sample there is a molecular ratio of 7.2 dsDNA basepairs per GMC-oxidoreductase subunit in the first sample and 7.68 in the second. Based on our model, a 5-start genomic fiber containing the complete mimivirus genome (1,196,989 bp) should be composed of ~95,000 GMC-oxidoreductases subunits (~93,000 for a 6-start). This gives a molecular ratio of 12.5 dsDNA basepairs per GMC-oxidoreductase subunit, which would be more than experimentally measured. However, in the cryo-EM dataset, there are at most 50% of genomic fibers containing the DNA genome (mostly Cl1), while some DNA strands can be observed attached to the relaxed genomic fiber Cl3 but the vast majority of released DNA was lost during the purification of the genomic fiber. Applying an estimated loss of 50% to the total DNA compared to the measured values, we obtain a ratio, which is in the same order of magnitude of the ones measured in the purified genomic fiber samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Model visualization</title><p>Molecular graphics and analyses were performed with UCSF Chimera 1.13.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and UCSF ChimeraX 1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>), developed by the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco, with support from National Institutes of Health R01-GM129325 and the Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Analysis of macromolecules in NS-TEM images of mimivirus genomic fiber</title><p>Manually picked positions of the particles of interest have been used to automatically extract 193-Å square area from the micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (E)).

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Adam Frost as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sara Sawyer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jonatas S Abrahão (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Several reviewers expressed uncertainty about the significance of the structural observations for our understanding of viral behavior. Critically, one reviewer noted: &quot;In light of the presented results, it is reasonable to assume that GMC-type oxidoreductases of the mimivirus are very important for the formation of functional virions. However, in a previous study (PMID: 21646533), it has been shown that the genes encoding GMC-type oxidoreductases can be deleted from the virus genome (M4 mutant) without the loss of infectivity. The M4 virions were devoid of the external fibers decorating the icosahedral capsid, but the genome was still packaged. How do the authors reconcile these results with those presented in the present manuscript? This should be addressed in the Discussion section.&quot; Another review notes that the answer to this question should address &quot;previously published data on proteomics of viral factories and transcriptomics of mimivirus: is there any temporal association between GMC-type oxidoreductases peak of expression and genome replication during the viral cycle? what about RNA pol subunits? Are all those proteins highly expressed during the late cycle? or [do] they reach the peak concomitantly with genome replication?&quot; Another reviewer noted &quot;The presented data do not [enable us] to estimate the amount of [the] mimivirus genome organized into 30 nm diameter filaments. Hence, the title of the paper is [overreaching]&quot; and &quot;The filamentous structures [result from] an extremely harsh treatment of the virus particle, which starts with a 1.5 hour-long incubation at pH 2. Do the filaments actually exist inside the virus particle as the title of the paper implies? Or [might] these filaments [form during] host take over? Or [perhaps] these filaments [result from a harsh in vitro treatment] and have nothing to do with either?&quot; Addressing these comments is essential.</p><p>2. The reviewers requested a more comprehensive description of the GMC oxidoreductase paralogs and the properties of the helical coat. One reviewer noted &quot;The authors describe the interactions between the monomers in the dimer of qu_946 as well as between qu_946 and DNA. I would also like to see a brief description of protein-protein interactions between subunits within the same helical strand as well as between helical strands, which hold the whole assembly together (i.e., what are the contacts between green subunits as well as between green and yellow subunits shown in Figure 2C). The authors suggest that the shell &quot;would guide the folding of the dsDNA strands into the structure&quot; (L310). To support this statement, the authors could show the lumen of the fiber rendered by electrostatic potential.&quot; And multiple reviewers requested a more detailed description of whether the helically averaged density map is simply unable to distinguish between qu_946 and qu_143, including a description of the amino acid percent identity versus similarity, especially for the contact-forming surface residues that govern the protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid contacts?</p><p>Another reviewer noted &quot;Please provide some background information on the distribution of GMC-type oxidoreductases in other families of giant viruses, so that it is clearer whether the described packaging mechanism is specific to mimiviruses or is more widespread.&quot; A reviewer wrote concerning the properties of the coat &quot;[the] authors could better explain why we only see 20 kb fragments in the gel, including in the control (in Figure S2).&quot; Another reviewer wrote &quot;Equally important, what is going on with the N-terminal 50-residue domain of qu_946? Is there a space for it in the cryoEM map? Is it disordered?&quot; Another wrote, &quot;Rough estimation of genome compaction to fit into the nucleoid&quot; section. Even though these back-of-the-envelope-type calculations appear to be reasonable, the last sentence &quot;As a result, the Mimivirus genome is probably organized…&quot; throws a monkey wrench into all of this. I see no resemblance in the organizations of the APBV1 genome and the DNA in mimivirus fibers. Finally, an EM reviewer wrote &quot;I am not yet convinced the authors have resolved the putative disulfide bridge between protomers. Please make a figure of the density around this bond at a more stringent map threshold so that the reader can appreciate the strength of the EM evidence for the disulfide.&quot; Addressing these comments is essential.</p><p>There were also less critical but still valuable requests to consider:</p><p>3. Several reviewers were unsure how to think about the &quot;balls of yarn.&quot; One reviewer wrote &quot;slightly puzzled by the observed &quot;ball of yarn&quot;. It is hard for me to imagine that a cylindrical container/fiber-containing continuous dsDNA genome could be bent or fragmented into bundles because this would break the protein-protein interactions holding the fiber together. In Figures 1C and S1, are these parts of the same fiber or multiple fibers coming out of one capsid? Related to this question – is there evidence (e.g., from qPCR) that mimivirus carries a single copy of genomic dsDNA per capsid?&quot; Another reviewer wrote &quot;The &quot;ball of yarn&quot; analogy is nice, but Figure 1C shows several fibers unconnected (free) in one of their ends. I am wondering if it means that the genomic fiber is not a long-single structure covering the whole genome, but a bunch [of] several independent helical structures covering the whole genome and attached in such [a] &quot;ball of yarn&quot;.

The reviewers suggest the following modifications to which and where certain figures are included. At least two EM reviewers agree that &quot;The bubblegram analysis is not very convincing. The bubbles appear to correlate with the length or thickness of the structure – the long or overlapped structures form bubbles. The bubbles may not be due to the presence of DNA.&quot; and would favor minimizing arguments that depend on these data. Another reviewer wrote &quot;Panels C and D of Figure 4 are too speculative to be included in the main text. Panels A and B are fascinating and pose a hypothesis worthy of further investigation, but please omit panels C and D.&quot; This request was modified with a great suggestion by another reviewer &quot;All images of the putative RNA polymerases should be boxed out from the panel A (from the whole photograph, that is) and a collage of these boxes should be shown on the same scale as the Poxvirus RNAP. The latter should be shown in several orientations. Perhaps, projection views instead of the molecular surface (which is shown in Figure 4C) would match the negatively stained images better (but maybe not). Panel 4B should be shown on the same scale as panel A and the putative RNAP can be placed (in color) into the channel of the fiber.&quot;</p><p>6.

The observation that the genomic fibers are constructed from different proteins in other mimiviruses, and potentially in the M4 mutant which lacks qu_946 and qu_143 poses quite a puzzle and raises concerns about the validity of the structural assignment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77607.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. Several reviewers expressed uncertainty about the significance of the structural observations for our understanding of viral behavior. Critically, one reviewer noted: &quot;In light of the presented results, it is reasonable to assume that GMC-type oxidoreductases of the mimivirus are very important for the formation of functional virions. However, in a previous study (PMID: 21646533), it has been shown that the genes encoding GMC-type oxidoreductases can be deleted from the virus genome (M4 mutant) without the loss of infectivity. The M4 virions were devoid of the external fibers decorating the icosahedral capsid, but the genome was still packaged. How do the authors reconcile these results with those presented in the present manuscript? This should be addressed in the Discussion section.”</p></disp-quote><p>These reviewers are totally right and this point also bothered us. We thus managed to extract the genomic fiber of M4 (the isolate without GMC oxidoreductases). The fiber also has a rodshaped structure but protein composition analysis of the purified fiber shows that different proteins are involved in its assembly.</p><p>We do not think GMC-oxidoreductases are essential. The packaging machinery appears to be able to use a variety of the most abundant proteins available at the stage of genome packaging. This corresponds to the GMC-oxidoreductases for mimivirus but is another protein in the case of M4. Follow up studies we are currently conducting clearly show the GMC-oxidoreductase is not essential for the genomic fiber formation.</p><p>The focus of the current manuscript is to report the structure of mimivirus genome organization in the genomic fiber, which is already a first piece of work. We consider the study of M4 genomic fiber, and the testing of the hypotheses this finding raises, as follow up studies. We would prefer not to discuss this in the current manuscript and hope the reviewers and the editor will believe our preliminary data and will agree on keeping this information for a subsequent publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another review notes that the answer to this question should address &quot;previously published data on proteomics of viral factories and transcriptomics of mimivirus: is there any temporal association between GMC-type oxidoreductases peak of expression and genome replication during the viral cycle? what about RNA pol subunits? Are all those proteins highly expressed during the late cycle? or [do] they reach the peak concomitantly with genome replication?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The transcriptomic data of mimivirirus prototype infectious cycle have been published and corresponding data are publicly available under this link: http://www.igs.cnrsmrs.fr/mimivirus/ (clicking on mimivirus Genome Browser).

For reference, the DNA polymerase starts being expressed after 1h until the end, with a peak at 3 hours PI. The RNA polymerase subunits start also being expressed after 1 h PI until the end of the cycle. The RNA polymerase subunits are loaded in the virions as well as the mRNA maturation machinery (PolyA polymerase, mRNA capping enzyme, etc…) (supplementary file 2B).We now added a sentence in the main text reporting the late expression of the GM-Coxidoreductases and the fact that they start being expressed after DNA replication (p5, main text). In the section “Additional proteins, including RNA polymerase subunits, are enriched in the genomic fiber” we also provide a sentence on RNA polymerase subunits and GM-Coxidoreductases, kinesin, regulator of chromosome condensation expression, all expressed until the end of the cycle (main text, p9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another reviewer noted &quot;The presented data do not [enable us] to estimate the amount of [the] mimivirus genome organized into 30 nm diameter filaments.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the entire genome can only be packaged in the capsid through its assembly within the protein shell. We also think the genomic fiber is progressively built on the genomic DNA while it progresses into the capsid, most likely by an energy driven packaging machinery. This process can be compared to bacterial pili assembly, except that pili are built on the surface of the cell, while the genomic fiber is built into a compartment, the nucleoid, forcing it to fold into this compartment. This is only possible due to the high flexibility of the genomic fiber. So, the entire genome corresponds to ~40 µm of genomic fiber, which when packaged as a ball can entirely fit into the nucleoid (~350 nm diameter).</p><p>The organization of the genome in a large tubular structure and its folding inside the nucleoid compartment has been previously reported by AFM studies of the mimivirus particles (Kuznetsov, Y. G. et al. Virology 2010; Kuznetsov YG et al. J. Virol. 2013, Figure 15), which the authors refer to as “highly condensed nucleoprotein masses about 350 nm in diameter within the inner membrane sacs of virions”, with the presence of tubular structure they refer to as “thick cables of the nucleic acid”.</p><p>We believe the Reviewers should think in terms of packaging. The folded genome is packaged through two lipid membranes (the one lining the capsid interior and the one in the nucleoid), concomitantly with its wrapping by the protein shell ribbon. Thus, there is plenty of space in the nucleoid at the beginning of the packaging and the genomic fiber is gently folded inside. But as more genome needs to be packaged, this compresses the flexible fiber into the nucleoid until it is totally encased in the nucleoid and that also defines the size of the nucleoid in the icosahedral capsid. This tight packaging is exemplified in Figure 1A for instance or in the AFM images of the nucleoid in Kuznetsov, Y. G. et al. Virology 2010; Kuznetsov YG et al. J. Virol. 2013, Figure 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Hence, the title of the paper is [overreaching]&quot; and &quot;The filamentous structures [result from] an extremely harsh treatment of the virus particle, which starts with a 1.5 hour-long incubation at pH 2.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a misunderstanding here. The 1 h incubation at 30°C and pH 2 was only applied to recover the nucleoids (see material and method section “Nucleoid extraction”) presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A. Acidic treatment was never applied to produce the genomic fiber as we noticed it is sensitive to temperature and acidic pH. All steps of the extraction protocol were performed at pH 7.5 (section: “Extraction and purification of the mimivirus genomic fiber”). We must emphasize that the release of the genomic fiber can be seen at the very first step of the extraction protocol (protease treatment). The sample was also controlled at each step of the protocol by negative staining TEM to assess the status of the genomic fiber. We had to optimize the protocol as using a too soft proteolytic treatment led to too few opened particles but with mostly a compact genomic fiber released, if it was too harsh, all particles were opened but the genomic fiber was mostly in the ribbon state. We had to compromise to get a decent amount of compact and relaxing structures to be able to perform the present work. We would like to stress out that we could reproducibly obtain the genomic fiber from many preparations and that we could observe them with different virions (including M4), even using different protocols (only the one with the better yield is reported in the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the filaments actually exist inside the virus particle as the title of the paper implies?</p></disp-quote><p>In the Figure 1B the genomic fiber can be seen inside a virion and is still encased in the membrane compartment. These structures were not reported in previous cryo-EM analyses of the virions. As said above, they were only reported by AFM studies of the mimivirus particles (Kuznetsov, Y. G. et al.

The crystallographic data obtained by others by on the mimivirus GMC-oxidoreductase did not produce tubular structures either and they reported 3 crystal forms.

The reviewers requested a more comprehensive description of the GMC oxidoreductase paralogs and the properties of the helical coat. One reviewer noted &quot;The authors describe the interactions between the monomers in the dimer of qu_946 as well as between qu_946 and DNA. I would also like to see a brief description of protein-protein interactions between subunits within the same helical strand as well as between helical strands, which hold the whole assembly together (i.e., what are the contacts between green subunits as well as between green and yellow subunits shown in Figure 2C).</p></disp-quote><p>A new Table (Supplementary file 3) has been provided with contacting residues intra and inter strands and their conservation. We also changed Cl2 by Cl1a maps in Figure 3F to show the qu_143 contacts with DNA in the same map as for qu_946 (Figure 3E). Finally, to comply with another reviewer’s question these contacting residues are shown for both qu_946 and qu_143 in the Cl1a, Cl2 and Cl3a maps. Conserved and divergent residues are highlighted in green and red, respectively, in Supplementary file 3. Inter- and intra-strands contacts are clearly loosening between the two compact Cl1a and Cl2 structures, compared to the relaxed Cl3, supporting the unfolding process and the use of an energy driven machinery to build and package the genomic fiber into the capsids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that the shell &quot;would guide the folding of the dsDNA strands into the structure&quot; (L310). To support this statement, the authors could show the lumen of the fiber rendered by electrostatic potential.&quot; And multiple reviewers requested a more detailed description of whether the helically averaged density map is simply unable to distinguish between qu_946 and qu_143, including a description of the amino acid percent identity versus similarity, especially for the contact-forming surface residues that govern the protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid contacts?</p></disp-quote><p>We think this is an excellent suggestion and we thus replaced in Figure 3 previous panels by the corresponding electrostatic views of the protein shell with the DNA (Figure 3C-D). We believe it is interesting to note that the electrostatics are different between qu_946 or qu_143, showing that despite the high level of identity (69%) between the two proteins, there are differences and that this does not impact the packaging of the DNA. Along with the finding that M4 use a different protein to package its DNA, we believe this supports even further an energy driven packaging machinery.</p><p>We now added a sentence in the main text p5:” The two mimivirus reunion proteins share 69% identity (81% similarity).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another reviewer noted &quot;Please provide some background information on the distribution of GMC-type oxidoreductases in other families of giant viruses, so that it is clearer whether the described packaging mechanism is specific to mimiviruses or is more widespread.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>If reviewers still think it would be useful, we can provide a multiple alignment of the GM-Coxidoreductases of prototype members of the different clades of the family as a supplementary figure.</p><p>This is a central point, also linked to the question about M4. In fact, like the reviewers, we initially assumed that the GMC-oxidoreductases were essential.

This gel was simply to show there is DNA associated with the genomic fiber and not to show the size of the DNA as the genomic fiber has been broken into pieces by the extraction protocol, pipetted several times before being loaded on the gel and we thus did not expect to have very high molecular weight. I must point out that when extracting the DNA form Mimivirus capsids using standard kits and pipetting, it also migrates at the top of the gel (Lane 1 in Figure 1—figure supplement 3) while it would likely appear as a smear above 20 kb on a PFGE. By contrast when the viral particles are put into plugs prior lysis, the genomic DNA migrates at the proper size, as shown in the publication from Boyer et al. 2011 (reference 31), showing the genome of Mimivirus is a linear genome migrating around 1.37 Mb (Figure 1, Panel B, Lane M1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another reviewer wrote &quot;Equally important, what is going on with the N-terminal 50-residue domain of qu_946? Is there a space for it in the cryoEM map?

The N-terminal domain is clearly covered when the fibrils or intact virions are analyzed and not covered when the analysis is performed on the purified genomic fiber. That is why we propose this N-terminal domain could be an addressing signal (see main text) and that a protease could be cleaving it prior to genomic fiber assembly.</p><p>Main text: “The proteomic analyses provided different sequence coverages for the GMC-oxidoreductases depending on whether samples were intact virions or purified genomic fiber preparations, with substantial under-representation of the N-terminal domain in the genomic fiber (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). Accordingly, the maturation of the GMC-oxidoreductases involved in genome packaging must be mediated by one of the many proteases encoded by the virus or the host cell.”</p><p>Indeed, there is no space to accommodate this domain as it would prevent the interaction between the protein shell and the DNA or induce an increase of the genomic fiber diameter that would be too big to be accommodated into the nucleoid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another wrote, &quot;Rough estimation of genome compaction to fit into the nucleoid&quot; section.

I see no resemblance in the organizations of the APBV1 genome and the DNA in mimivirus fibers.</p></disp-quote><p>The APBV1 nucleocapsid is also a 30 nm diameter helical structure made of proteins with the dsDNA genome lining the interior of the shell. The genomic fiber also looks like a nucleocapsid, but the DNA is circular for APBV1 and linear for mimivirus. The most important difference being that the mimivirus genomic fiber is actually folded in the nucleoid, itself encased in the icosahedral capsid, while APBV1 nucleocapsid is the virion. If this reviewer thinks this is confusing, we could remove the reference to this archaeal virus. We tried to clarify by proposing the following sentence: “As a result, the complete mimivirus genome folded at least 5 times fits into the helical shell. This structure surprisingly resembles a nucleocapsid, such as the archaea infecting APBV1 nucleocapsid.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, an EM reviewer wrote &quot;I am not yet convinced the authors have resolved the putative disulfide bridge between protomers. Please make a figure of the density around this bond at a more stringent map threshold so that the reader can appreciate the strength of the EM evidence for the disulfide.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that the density does not permit to totally confidently conclude that there is a disulfide bridge. Our rational was as follow: building additional residues into the uninterpreted density brought the cysteines of the two chains close enough to allow a disulfide bridge and fully filled the available density. Clearly in the fully relaxed structure the density is weaker, suggesting there is some additional disorder at this location that led us to think that a disulfide bridge break could fragilize the helix and initiate its decompaction.

As we recovered the motion corrected micrographs from the Hamburg platform, the “Import” task of the raw micrographs is not available, but a corresponding task was added to the project directory in order to summarize and have coherence for all steps of the procedure. The different “.mrc” or “.mrcs” files were replaced by empties “.zip” to reduce the disk usage as they are not needed to summarize the processes applied. The directory can be found under this link: https://src.koda.cnrs.fr/igs/genfiber_cl1a_focusrefine_relion_pipeline</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The reviewers suggest the following modifications to which and where certain figures are included. At least two EM reviewers agree that &quot;The bubblegram analysis is not very convincing. The bubbles appear to correlate with the length or thickness of the structure – the long or overlapped structures form bubbles. The bubbles may not be due to the presence of DNA.&quot; and would favor minimizing arguments that depend on these data.</p></disp-quote><p>The point is, as demonstrated by our structural studies, that the relaxed structure lost the DNA. This is why bubble cannot be seen in the relaxed broken fibers. On long fibers still in compact form, the DNA is visible in the structure and bubble can be seen. Yet the evidence for the presence of DNA in the structure is also provided by the agarose gel of the purified genomic fiber and the cryo-EM structures. Bubblegrams were just one additional analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another reviewer wrote &quot;Panels C and D of Figure 4 are too speculative to be included in the main text. Panels A and B are fascinating and pose a hypothesis worthy of further investigation, but please omit panels C and D.&quot; This request was modified with a great suggestion by another reviewer &quot;All images of the putative RNA polymerases should be boxed out from the panel A (from the whole photograph, that is) and a collage of these boxes should be shown on the same scale as the Poxvirus RNAP. The latter should be shown in several orientations. Perhaps, projection views instead of the molecular surface (which is shown in Figure 4C) would match the negatively stained images better (but maybe not). Panel 4B should be shown on the same scale as panel A and the putative RNAP can be placed (in color) into the channel of the fiber.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We now changed Figure 4 accordingly and increased the size of Figure 4B. We now present projections of six orientations of the vaccinia virus RNAP corresponding to the best extracted boxes. We must mention that negative staining imaging may dehydrate the objects and change macromolecules volumes. This is also mentioned in Figure 4 legend.</p><p>Concerning the last sentence: “Panel 4B should be shown on the same scale as panel A and the putative RNAP can be placed (in color) into the channel of the fiber.&quot; We did change the scale of Panel 4B but it is unclear to us if we can leave the colored RNAP fitted in the channel?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The genomic fiber also looks like a nucleocapsid, but the DNA is circular for APBV1 and linear for mimivirus. The most important difference being that the mimivirus genomic fiber is actually folded in the nucleoid, itself encased in the icosahedral capsid, while APBV1 nucleocapsid is the virion.

Please upload the cryo-EM maps and fitted atomic coordinates for the reviewers. Second, while we understand your decision to describe the genetic system and the genomic fibers of the M4 mutant in a separate publication, we feel that an additional explanation regarding the M4 mutant is necessary for this manuscript. The observation that the genomic fibers are constructed from different proteins in other mimiviruses, and potentially in the M4 mutant which lacks qu_946 and qu_143 poses quite a puzzle and raises concerns about the validity of the structural assignment.</p></disp-quote><p>I do not understand the Reviewers additional request as all maps and coordinates files were already provided for review purposes.</p><p>They are also available on the <italic>eLife</italic> site as Supporting Zip Documents that we thought were made available to the reviewers and editors:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Cl1a : compact 5-start map and coordinates</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cl1a : focus refine map and coordinates</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cl1a focus refine DNA map</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cl3 : relaxed 5-start genomic fiber map and coordinates</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cl2 : compact 6-start map and coordinates</p></list-item></list><p>From the very beginning the reviewers could thus assess the quality of the reconstruction and the fit of the GMC-oxidoreductases in the various maps, including the focus refined map at 3.3 A resolution showing the FAD co-facteur into density.</p><p>Reviewers could go back to the 5 maps and coordinates of the GMC-oxidoreductase whenever they wish. They can visualize these data using a variety of software tool (coot, pymol, chimera, chimeraX…) and activate the symmetry to visualize the entire helices.</p><p>A video of the focus refined map with the fitted pdb structure was also provided as supplementary video (Video_S2.mp4) with a final zoom on the FAD co-factor showing it was in density. I wonder if the reviewers were aware of all this supplementary material.</p><p>The presence of the GMC-oxidoreductase as a main scaffolding protein in the Mimivirus genomic fiber is an experimental fact strongly supported by MS-based proteomics and by the 4 maps. Again, reviewers could assess the unambiguous fit of the protein into the 4 maps. The fact that this result is unexpected (i.e. &quot;confusing&quot;), and thus constitutes an important discovery, should not be used to deny its validity a priori.</p><p>As for M4, I really don't understand why it has become the focus of all attentions, as it is not the subject of our study, the purpose of which is to establish the first high resolution structure of a <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> chromosome.</p><p>Microbiology is full of examples of genes and structures once thought to be essential, then subsequently discovered lacking in related microorganisms. Considering that the GMC-oxidoreducase cannot compose Mimivirus genomic fiber simply because the homologous genes are not present in M4 is a mere opinion, not a scientific argument.</p><p>I did include in the revised version of this manuscript a sentence explicitly referring to M4:</p><p>“Interestingly, mimivirus M4 (<italic>31</italic>), a laboratory strain having lost the genes responsible for the synthesis of the two polysaccharides decorating mimivirus fibrils (<italic>11</italic>) also lacks the GMC-oxidoreductase genes. Additional studies on this specific variant will be key to establish if it exhibits a similar genomic fiber, and if yes, which proteins are composing it.”</p><p>We hope the reviewers will now have a careful look to the fit of the structure in the different maps and will get convinced on the validity of our results. I would recommend to use Coot or Pymol to be able to zoom easily into the structure and thus assess the fit of the secondary structures, the side chains as well as the one of the co-factor.</p></body></sub-article></article>
