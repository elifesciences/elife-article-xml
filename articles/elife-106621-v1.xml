information from cortical regions that are functionally related. However, in vivo, DLS neuronal responses to sensory stimuli have shown unexpectedly high selectivity, raising questions about the actual degree of convergence of functional corticostriatal projections on individual striatal cells. Here, we investigated this question by focusing on the projections from different whisker cortical columns in mice, as they overlap in the striatum and are co-active during behavior. Using ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in the DLS and glutamate uncaging for focal stimulations in the barrel cortex, we were able to map the location of presynaptic neurons to individual striatal projection neurons (SPNs). We found that each SPN was innervated by cells located in a small number of whisker cortical columns scattered across the barrel field in the slice. Connectivity of single SPNs with cortical neurons was thus highly discontinuous horizontally, despite the presence of more potential connections. Moreover, connectivity patterns were specific to each cell, with neighboring SPNs sharing few common clusters of presynaptic cells in the cortex. Despite this sparse and distinct innervation of individual SPNs, the projection was topographically organized at the population level. Finally, we found similar innervation patterns for D1- and D2-type SPNs, but observed differences in synaptic strength in their connections with certain cortical layers, notably the associative layer 2/3. Our results suggest that the high convergence of somatosensory inputs to the striatum, enabled by diffuse and overlapping cortical innervation, is accomplished through sparse yet complementary connectivity to individual SPNs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>corticostriatal</kwd><kwd>connectivity</kwd><kwd>barrel cortex</kwd><kwd>striatal projection neurons</kwd><kwd>laser scanning photostimulation</kwd><kwd>functional mapping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE16-0002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robbe</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Bureau</surname><given-names>Ingrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-EURE-0029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amroune</surname><given-names>Kenza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE17-0025-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bureau</surname><given-names>Ingrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/035xkbk20</institution-id><institution>Aix-Marseille Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A*MIDEX Turing Centre for Living Systems</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fontolan</surname><given-names>Lorenzo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/035xkbk20</institution-id><institution>Aix-Marseille Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A*MIDEX AMX-19-IET-004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amroune</surname><given-names>Kenza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03sjk9a61</institution-id><institution>Ministère français de l'enseignement supérieur et de la recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amroune</surname><given-names>Kenza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02vjkv261</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robbe</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Bureau</surname><given-names>Ingrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baude</surname><given-names>Agnès</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional connectivity mapping reveals sparse, specific, and largely complementary cortical innervation of individual striatal medium spiny neurons within overlapping and loosely topographical projections from the barrel cortex.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) receives dense glutamatergic innervation from all sensory cortical areas. Its presumed function is to monitor the animal’s ongoing sensory information, contributing to the modulation of sensory-guided behaviors and the learning of voluntary tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pennartz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sippy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robbe, 2018</xref>). The observations that cortical neurons are overabundant compared to striatal projection neurons (SPNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oorschot, 1996</xref>), that axonal projections originating from functionally linked cortical regions overlap in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flaherty and Graybiel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alloway et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wright et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hooks et al., 2018</xref>), and that synaptic glutamatergic inputs must overcome strong feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mallet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pidoux et al., 2011</xref>) have led to the idea that striatal neurons integrate dense and broad cortical inputs. In fact, studies examining the density of axonal boutons relative to the single-cell dendritic spines have predicted that several thousand cortical neurons could potentially connect every SPN if synapses were formed promiscuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kincaid et al., 1998</xref>). However, if synapses were formed in a selective manner, this would reduce the degree of convergence of cortical input onto individual SPNs and potentially increase the heterogeneity of inputs between SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kincaid et al., 1998</xref>), a scenario with important implications for how cortical information is integrated in the striatum. These alternative connectivity models schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> remained to be tested functionally.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Potential connectivity patterns within the corticostriatal projection.</title><p>A rich and overlapping cortical innervation of the striatum (lines) permits different connectivity patterns: Left, synapses are formed promiscuously. In this case, convergence is high as each striatal projection neuron (SPN) receives broad cortical input, from many cortical origins (colored bars on top). Middle and right, only a fraction of the potential connections are actually formed and, in these cases, convergence is lower. The selected presynaptic neurons are either scattered (middle) or topographically (right) positioned in the cortex. Increasing the selectivity of the corticostriatal connections while keeping their broad origin (middle) could generate maximal heterogeneity in the patterns of input for SPNs sharing the same striatal volume, due to a large number of combinations of cortical origins. In the case of a topographic innervation (right), neighboring SPNs form synapses with presynaptic neurons located in the same cortical region, reducing the local heterogeneity.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106621-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Here, we investigated this question at the level of the projections originating from the barrel field in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and targeting the SPNs. Vibrissal information is transmitted to the cortical columns of S1 through parallel sensory channels, each corresponding to an individual whisker (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adibi, 2019</xref>). In S1, layer 4 contains optically dense, barrel-shaped structures whose organization mirrors the spatial arrangement of whiskers on the snout. This feature provides a framework for studying neuronal connectivity in relation to the whisker cortical columns ex vivo. However, this model has not yet been used to examine connectivity within the functional vibrissal corticostriatal projections, leaving the degree of input convergence in this pathway unclear. On the one hand, axons of neurons located in different whisker cortical columns overlap heavily in the dorsal striatum, suggesting that SPNs could receive dense and broad vibrissal cortical input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wright et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alloway et al., 2000</xref>). On the other hand, cell activity evoked by whisker deflection showed notable heterogeneity in the DLS: neurons were either tuned to multiple whiskers, selective to a single whisker, or yet non-responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carelli and West, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pidoux et al., 2011</xref>). These observations prompted us to investigate whether the vibrissal innervation of SPNs violated Peters’ rule stating that connectivity is proportional to the overlap of axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peters, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braitenberg and Schüz, 1998</xref>).</p><p>SPNs comprise two main populations, defined by their projection targets and expression of dopamine receptors: D1 receptors in the direct pathway and D2 receptors in the indirect pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>) (neurons are hereafter referred to as D1 and D2 SPNs). Electrophysiological studies have found that inputs received by D1 SPNs were stronger than those received by D2 SPNs, both in vivo and ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reig and Silberberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Filipović et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kress et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parker et al., 2016</xref>). These observations may indicate that inputs converge to different degrees to D1 and to D2 SPNs.</p><p>To investigate the connectivity and input convergence on SPNs, we used a functional mapping technique that combines patch-clamp recordings and laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) with glutamate uncaging on a novel slice preparation, which preserved the organization of the vibrissal corticostriatal projections, from the superficial layers of the barrel cortex to the DLS. LSPS enabled precise mapping of corticostriatal functional connectivity by identifying cortical sites where stimulation evoked synaptic currents in the recorded SPNs, thereby localizing the cell bodies of their presynaptic neurons. This approach allowed us to determine both the cortical column and layer of origin within the barrel field in the slice for each SPN input. We found overall discrete innervations, as presynaptic neurons were thinly scattered across the barrel field, or present in a single cortical column. SPNs located nearby in the same slice had distinct patterns of innervation, suggesting that connections on each SPN were fewer than the local potential connections. No difference was found between the innervation patterns of D1 and D2 SPNs, but the strength of their connections with certain layers differed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel preparation for investigating functionally the organization of projections from the barrel cortex to individual SPNs in the DLS</title><p>To investigate the spatial organization of sensory projections to SPNs, we have developed a parasagittal somatosensory corticostriatal slice, which contained ~8 whisker barrels (‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Biocytin-labeled projections extended from the top of the barrel cortex to the DLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To further validate the angles used in the preparation, we virtually re-sectioned a brain from the Allen Mouse Connectivity Atlas in which pyramidal cells of the barrel cortex had been labeled in vivo (i.e., prior to slicing; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1B</xref>). Cortical axons extended into the striatum in a similar manner in both the reconstituted and acute slices (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), supporting the idea that projections from the present cortical columns targeting the recorded striatal region were largely preserved in the acute slice. Animals were Drd1a-tdTomato hemizygous mice in which D1 receptor expressing neurons were labeled. D1<sup>+</sup> and D1<sup>−</sup> (D2<sup>+</sup>) SPNs were recorded in the whole-cell voltage–clamp configuration (n=101 cells, N=54 mice). Simultaneously, an ultraviolet laser beam was directed at every site of a 29×16 pixel grid (2.1×1.1 mm, 75 µm spacing) to uncage glutamate over the barrel cortex, excite cortical neurons, and thereby reveal cells presynaptic to the recorded SPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). When glutamate was uncaged on an excitatory cortical neuron innervating the recorded SPN, it elicited short-lived excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs; &lt;50 ms duration) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We and others have shown that only subthreshold synaptic events are elicited with this method, implying that the evoked EPSCs are mono-synaptic and that feedforward inhibition is prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shepherd et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bureau et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, glutamate uncaging excited cortical neurons above their firing threshold at a maximal distance of 75 µm from their cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), on 2.8±0.3 sites of the LSPS grid (mean±sem; L5 pyramidal cells, n=40; 75 µm spacing grid; see ‘Materials and methods’), consistent with a direct (i.e., non-synaptic) and nearly somatic excitation (data per cell type in ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the sites where LSPS evoked EPSCs in SPNs contained or were adjacent to the cell bodies of cortical neurons that were directly connected to the recorded cell. These sites are hereafter referred to as ‘connected sites’. EPSCs had small amplitudes, 40±1 pA (n=550). Based on known amplitudes of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs in SPNs (10–20 pA on average; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cepeda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dehorter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peixoto et al., 2016</xref>), this finding is consistent with the presence of only one or a few presynaptic cells (≤5) at each connected site of the map.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A novel slice preparation for investigating the spatial organization of the somatosensory projections to the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A somatosensory corticostriatal slice in which axons from L5 neurons were labeled with biocytin iontophoresis.

From this input map, a binary map was derived that reported the presence or lack of evoked EPSC, referred to as ‘connectivity map’. We first analyzed the ensemble of connectivity maps to characterize the global organization of the projections from the barrel field in the slice and checked that their properties were consistent with those described by anatomical studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). When all SPN connectivity maps were superimposed and overlaid on the barrel cortex (see ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), the connected sites principally highlighted the layer (L) 5a. Indeed, ~65% of all SPNs received input from this layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Responses were elicited less frequently when stimulations were in L4, L5b, L2/3, and L6. We found that 50% of L5a cells fired action potentials when stimulations were at the bottom of L4, indicating that a fraction of the relatively high connectivity rate seen at the bottom of L4 was in fact with nearby L5a pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, photo-stimulations in L2/3 never elicited the firing of L5a cells (n=11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that all EPSCs evoked by stimulations in these superficial layers arose from direct synaptic connections between L2/3 pyramidal cells and SPNs. EPSCs evoked with stimulations in L2/3 to L5b had similar amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that L5a dominance over these other layers is primarily due to a higher likelihood of SPNs being connected to it, rather than to stronger synaptic inputs. However, L6-EPSCs were smaller compared to L5a and L5b-EPSCs (Kruskal–Wallis, H(4) = 22.8, p=0.0001; Dunn post hoc test and Šidák correction, p=0.0001 and 0.034; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

An opposite asymmetry was observed when analyzing the striatal region connected to individual cortical columns: sites within a single cortical column (~150 µm in this preparation) were connected to SPNs distributed across a larger striatal region, spanning about 600 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). These two asymmetric relationships (converging vs. diverging), summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, implied that functional projections from adjacent cortical columns overlapped in the DLS, which is consistent with their known anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wright et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alloway et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hooks et al., 2018</xref>).

Its width is the distance between the SPN most distant connected sites; (2) the cluster, a region in the collapsed connectivity map constituted of adjacent connected sites; (3) the cortical column, or its proxy: 1–2 adjacent connected sites in the collapsed connectivity map (i.e., 75–150 µm width). The connected sites were organized in 1–6 clusters, 1.9±0.1 on average in the input fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Typically, the width of clusters was about one cortical column (171±7 µm) and rarely exceeded two adjacent columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, SPNs were innervated by cells distributed in close to 3 columns (2.7±0.2), though some SPNs with several clusters (54%) were innervated by as many as eight columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The distance between clusters was 75–900 µm, 265±28 µm on average (n=55; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, SPNs could receive inputs from clusters of cortical cells separated by substantial connectivity gaps, often spanning several columns. Heterogeneous spacing and number of clusters contributed to the variability of the input fields width, which ranged between 0.075 and 1.6 mm (average, 535±42 µm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Strikingly, regions lacking evoked synaptic responses (i.e., connectivity gaps) made up an average of 45% of the length of input fields with multiple clusters (maps collapsed along the vertical axis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, bottom). Moreover, the number of clusters was not increased proportionally in very large input fields, &gt;1.4 mm, in which connectivity gaps amounted to more than 50% of space in the horizontal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, bottom).

Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that SPNs with small input fields and those with broader ones were intermingled along the horizontal axis in the striatum (open and solid symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, respectively). In fact, the width of the input fields remained relatively constant across SPN positions in the slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, top; Spearman correlation coefficient, <italic>R</italic>=0.05, p=0.61). This suggests that the position of our recordings did not impact the SPN input fields. Furthermore, SPNs receiving input from a single column were often located in slices where other cells received input from multiple ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), reinforcing that the low functional connectivity with barrel columns in the slice was genuine in these cases.</p><p>Next, we investigated these connectivity patterns along their vertical axis. Individual SPNs had connected sites distributed in 2.4±0.1 cortical layers on average (2.9±0.1 for SPNs with several clusters). But these sites were not necessarily vertically aligned within a cortical column (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). In fact, in 55% of the cases, a column of the barrel field innervated an SPN through projections from a single cortical layer. This suggests that neurons projecting to an SPN are dispersed in the barrel cortex in such a way that the transmitted inputs may originate from distinct layers as well as from different whisker cortical columns. Our findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, with schematics of the average and principal connectivity patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Individual SPNs have unique innervation</title><p>The above analysis has revealed great heterogeneity between SPN innervations. We then investigated whether innervations were more similar when SPNs were close to each other. To address this question, we compared the connectivity patterns of SPNs recorded in the same slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). First, we observed that the majority of SPN pairs had their input fields overlapping in the barrel cortex (n=70; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The ratio was the highest, 77%, for SPNs that were neighbors in the striatum (&lt;100 µm, n=33), but remained above 50% for cell distances of 400–500 µm. We next examined to what extent the connected sites were shared or vertically aligned between the connectivity maps. In contrast to input fields, alignment or overlap of connected sites was only observed when SPNs were less than 300 µm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Moreover, this concerned only a small fraction of the pair’s connected sites: when SPNs were less than 100 µm apart, only 18±2% of the connected sites in the two connectivity maps were vertically aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and 7.7± 1.6% of them overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that DLS SPNs could receive inputs from the same domain in the barrel cortex and yet have patterns of cortical innervation without or little redundancy.

SPNs located laterally/medially in the dorsal striatum had an input field whose connectivity center of mass (CM, see ‘Materials and methods’) was in the lateral/medial part of the barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

Given the orientation of the slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1A</xref>), a shift of the connectivity CM on the horizontal axis of the barrel field corresponded principally to a shift between whisker arcs (e.g., E1 to E8 barrel).

To test the hypothesis of a topographic organization influencing synaptic strength, we examined whether strong connections were associated with presynaptic cells located close to the connectivity CM. If such an organization of synaptic strengths existed, we would expect it to improve the correlation between the CM of synaptic input maps and SPN positions. However, we found nearly identical correlations whether taking the connectivity CM or the synaptic input CM, which is based on the connectivity pattern weighted by EPSC amplitudes (see ‘Materials and methods’; <italic>R</italic>=0.60 vs 0.62; F(1) = 115.08, p=0.98, ANCOVA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). While residuals from the correlation curve tended to be smaller using synaptic input CMs, the difference was not statistically significant (−9±7 µm, p=0.084, Wilcoxon, SPNs with &gt;1 cluster). This was because synaptic input CMs were only slightly shifted from the connectivity CMs, by 45±5 µm for SPNs with two or more clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These findings indicate that EPSC amplitudes showed no consistent pattern relative to the connectivity CM of the input field.

Comparing the sum of EPSCs corresponding to clusters, we found substantial variability, with the strongest cluster providing input that was 1.12–55 times greater than other clusters within the input field (×6.8 ± 1.4 on average; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

In addition, they received input from a similar number of cortical columns, which were organized in clusters of similar widths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Paired analysis of D1 and D2 SPNs recorded in the same slice also showed that their input fields did not significantly differ in width, number of cortical columns, or cluster width (p=0.44–0.50–0.26, Wilcoxon; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>).

This finding suggested that each striatal neuron was in fact innervated by one small subregion of S1, although feedforward inhibition could have masked a broader selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pidoux et al., 2011</xref>). Here, the LSPS connectivity maps indicate that convergence from the barrel cortex to individual SPNs is indeed low as 60% of SPNs responded to the stimulation of only one or two whisker cortical columns present in the preparation. The LSPS combined with glutamate uncaging mapped projections contained in the slice, intact from the presynaptic cell bodies to the SPN dendrites. Some cortical inputs targeting distal SPN dendrites may have gone undetected either due to attenuation of synaptic events recorded at the soma or because distal dendritic branches were lost during slice preparation. Indeed, about 80% of S1 synaptic contacts are distributed along dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanabria et al., 2024</xref>). However, synapses located distally are proportionally rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanabria et al., 2024</xref>), and our estimates suggest that the loss of S1 input was minimal (see ‘Materials and methods’). More significantly, our mapping only included projections from neuronal somata located within the S1 barrel field in the slice: projections from cortical columns outside the slice were not stimulated. For this reason, our study characterized connectivity patterns rather than the full extent of connectivity with the barrel cortex. A number of critical findings argue that innervation on individual SPNs is genuinely sparse: (i) the cortical columns present in the slice corresponded to different whisker arcs, an axis associated with the greatest overlap of cortical axons in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alloway et al., 1999</xref>), and therefore where input convergence could have been high. This organization was visible in the global SPN LSPS connectivity map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). (ii) The peak of connectivity was with L5a as previously documented, not with a layer closer to striatum, as this would be the case if the native organization of the projection was altered in the preparation. (iii) The connected sites were scattered along broad horizontal and vertical axes, implying that projections in between were preserved. Critically, the fact that adjacent SPNs had different connectivity patterns in the same slice further supported the presence of a pool of potential connections larger than the number of actual connections made on each SPN. (iv) Connectivity clusters were sparser in larger input fields, suggesting that the number of presynaptic cells to an SPN was regulated and reached a plateau. (v) EPSCs were small, consistent with one or a few presynaptic cells at each connected site. Altogether, our results support the model in which, within a loosely topographical organization of projections, each SPN integrates limited and heterogeneous rather than exhaustive inputs transmitted by the barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The speckled connectivity pattern of individual SPNs, arising from the abundant and diffuse cortical innervation in the DLS, suggests that somatosensory corticostriatal synapses are established through a selective and/or competitive process. It is important to determine whether this sparse innervation of SPNs by S1 is a characteristic shared with other projections. In particular, it will be interesting to test this hypothesis on the auditory projections targeting the posterior striatum, where neurons exhibit clear tone frequency selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Connectivity pattern within the somatosensory corticostriatal projection to striatal projection neurons (SPNs).</title><p>Left, our results support the model in which each SPN integrates limited and heterogeneous rather than exhaustive inputs transmitted by the barrel cortex, intermediate between the middle and right panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Based on this ratio and the ultrastructure of the corticostriatal connection, the density of axonal boutons and spines, C. Wilson’s group concluded that the probability of an SPN being contacted by one given axon entering the domain of its dendritic arborization was low, 0.04–1.4%, depending on the model. Hence, the chance that two SPNs were innervated by the same cortical axon was even lower according to this model. Consistent with it, here, we found that overlaps between the connectivity maps of SPNs were rare and, when present, involved only a small fraction of the connected sites. This indicates that neighboring SPNs predominantly integrated distinct inputs from the barrel cortex, although it is possible that overlapping inputs received in distal dendrites were not all detected. Overlaps occurred only for SPNs located within 250 μm of each other. In contrast, input fields continued to intersect significantly beyond 250 μm and up to 500 μm of separation between SPNs. This means that relatively distant SPNs could share a general region of connectivity in the barrel cortex without any of their presynaptic partners residing within the same cortical column. Interestingly, the observation that two SPNs must be less than 250 µm apart to share some of their inputs was not predicted by the known ultrastructure of corticostriatal connections. In fact, it predicted the opposite: that two SPNs would be more likely to be innervated by the same cortical cell if their dendrites extended into different striatal subregions, as this would increase the likelihood of each SPN contacting boutons of this cortical cell, as these are sparsely distributed in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kincaid et al., 1998</xref>). One possible explanation for this discrepancy could be that, in our experiments, pairs of SPNs with shared connectivity were innervated by different neurons that were co-localized in the barrel cortex (&lt;75 µm apart). Such events could also be at the origin of the striatal clusters described in vivo, in which neurons had similar, yet non-identical, sensory selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carelli and West, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaeger et al., 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Similarities and specificities in the patterns of projection to SPNs of the direct and indirect pathways</title><p>Electrophysiological studies have shown that D1 SPNs exhibit larger responses than D2 SPNs to whisker deflections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reig and Silberberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Filipović et al., 2019</xref>). Also, the optostimulation of cortical efferents in brain slices showed a bias toward D1 SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kress et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parker et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, we had contrasting results. There was no difference in the innervation of D1 and D2 SPNs, neither in the rate at which cells were connected by layers, nor in the organization of the projection. The principal layer innervating SPNs, L5a, delivered inputs of similar strengths to D1 and D2 SPNs. However, layers with lower incidence in the pattern of innervation showed bias in the amplitude of responses: stimulations in L2/3 induced stronger responses in D2 cells, whereas stimulations in L6 activated D1 cells more strongly. We have shown that stimulation in L2/3 activates the L2/3 projection only. Similarly, the L6-evoked EPSCs are consistent with the axon collaterals that L6 corticofugal projection neurons have in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertero et al., 2022</xref>). The larger L2/3 inputs received by the D2 SPNs is intriguing because of the role of this layer in higher-order integration processes, such as those activated during operant sensory discrimination tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kwon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han and Helmchen, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oryshchuk et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, the activity of L2/3 cells during mouse displacement is distinctive, exhibiting a sustained response to ongoing whisker-wall contacts, as opposed to the transient response observed in L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayaz et al., 2019</xref>). In L6, the population of corticofugal projection neurons is diverse, with some responding to whisking and sensory stimuli, while others are active during transitions into quiet periods of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dash et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vélez-Fort et al., 2014</xref>). Further investigation is needed to specifically examine projections from the upper and lower cortical layers and how they influence the dynamics of sensory integration in the direct and indirect pathways of the DLS. However, these data illustrate the diversity of paths of sensory integration involving D1 and D2 SPNs.</p><p>In conclusion, we found a low and sparse connectivity within the cortical vibrissal projections to individual SPNs. While projections respected a loose topography, the innervation patterns of individual SPNs displayed substantial connectivity gaps and heterogeneity. Since the inputs to a single SPN represent only a limited subset of whisker columns, a complete representation of whiskers could emerge at the population level, with each SPN’s representation complementing those of its neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These observations raise the hypothesis of a selective or competitive process underlying the formation of corticostriatal synapses. The degree of input convergence onto SPNs could be modulated by plasticity, potentially enabling experience-driven reconfiguration of S1 corticostriatal coupling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">B6.Cg-Tg(Drd1a-tdTomato)6Calak/J mice</td><td align="left" valign="top">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="top">016204</td><td align="left" valign="top">Hemizygous</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">MNI-caged-L-glutamate</td><td align="left" valign="top">Tocris</td><td align="left" valign="top">1490/10</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.2 mM</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and ethics</title><p>Hemizygous male and female B6.Cg-Tg(Drd1a-tdTomato)6Calak/J mice (JAX stock #016204; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ade et al., 2011</xref>) were used on postnatal day 22–43.

We prepared corticostriatal slices (350 μm thick) from the brain left hemisphere, based on stereotaxic coordinates placing the striatal cells 1–2 mm anteriorly to the projection neurons in the barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aronoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de la Torre-Martinez et al., 2023</xref>). Parasagittal slices were cut with a 60° angle from the midline and a 10° angle in the dorso-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1A</xref>) in a chilled cutting solution containing (in mM) 110 choline chloride, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 D-glucose, 11.6 sodium ascorbate, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.1 sodium pyruvate, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich).

Slices were first incubated at 34°C for 30 min and then maintained at room temperature for 20 min prior to use. Slices used for LSPS (1–2 per animal) contained barrels in the L4 of cortex, the globus pallidus, its external segment (GPe), the internal capsule, the ventral posteromedial nucleus of thalamus, and the anterior hippocampus. ~8 barrels (5–13) were visible in the slice. Two rows of barrels may have been superimposed. At the end of each experiment, a picture of the slice was saved in order to superimpose it digitally to other slices, according to visual landmarks (Photoshop; Adobe Inc). SPNs were visualized under infrared and fluorescent lights in a BX61WI microscope (Olympus) and patched with borosilicate electrodes (3–6 MΩ) and recorded in the voltage-clamp whole-cell configuration using a Multiclamp 700 A amplifier (Axon Instrument, Molecular Devices).

Focal photolysis of caged glutamate was accomplished with a 2 ms 20 mW pulse of a pulsed UV (355 nm) laser (DPSS Lasers Inc) through a 0.16 NA 4× objective (Olympus). 25 mW laser pulses were used for stimulating cortical neurons in mice older than P30 to maintain their excitation at a similar level than in younger mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Ephus software for instrument control and acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suter et al., 2010</xref>) was used. The stimulus pattern for mapping the corticostriatal projections was 464 positions spaced by 75 μm on a 29×16 grid (2.1×1.1 mm) over barrel cortex. The corticostriatal slice and the LSPS grid were oriented in such a way that layer 5a was laid out horizontally. UV stimuli were applied every 700 ms and their successive positions on the LSPS grid were such as to maximize the time between stimulations of neighboring sites. Electrophysiological traces consisted of 100 ms baseline, a 450 ms window followed by a –5 mV 100 ms test pulse. A minimum of two and up to four stimulations were performed at each site at several minutes intervals. Excitation profiles of pyramidal neurons were generated under similar conditions except that cells were recorded in current-clamp mode and glutamate was uncaged on a smaller 8×8 grid covering their soma and dendrites (50 μm spacing; 350×350 μm). In a subset of L5a cell recordings, an 8×24 grid was used to stimulate up in L1 (50 μm spacing).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of LSPS data</title><p>Synaptic input maps of neurons were constructed by taking the peak amplitude of EPSCs detected in a 50 ms time window starting at stimulation onset for each position in the LSPS grid. Measures were averaged across repetitions of stimulations (2–4). The threshold for EPSC detection was 3 standard deviations from baseline, or 9.2±0.4 pA. To disambiguate evoked responses from spontaneous activity, synaptic responses occurring less than two times across repetitions of maps were set to zero. Averaged maps were superimposed taking L5a as reference in the vertical axis and the junction of the GPe, dorsal striatum, and internal capsule as reference in the horizontal axis (Ref<sub>hor</sub>). Pattern analyses were performed using custom software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bureau, 2025</xref>) written in Matlab (MathWorks). In order to detect connectivity clusters and center of mass in the LSPS map, we used the binary version of the map (‘connectivity map’) reporting the location of connected and non-connected sites (i.e., yielding EPSCs or none in the recorded SPN). To detect clusters, the binary map was collapsed along its vertical axis. A cluster comprised one or more consecutive connected sites that was framed by one or more non-connected sites. Thus, a cluster here may include connected sites that were not adjacent on the vertical axis in the original map and may combine synaptic inputs from different layers. The number of cortical columns was estimated based on the number of consecutive connected sites (ConsSites) in the collapsed map and the mean width of a barrel in the slice, 150 μm, which is equal to two connected sites in the map. Hence, the number of cortical columns = Σ (ceiling(ConsSites/2)). The connectivity center of mass was computed based on the uncollapsed map as follows: Σ (Σ<sub>vert</sub> connected sites ×lateral distance from Ref<sub>hor</sub>)/Σ (Σ<sub>vert</sub> connected sites). The synaptic input center of mass was computed based on the original map, after thresholding, as follows: Σ (mean<sub>vert</sub> EPSC ×lateral distance from Ref<sub>hor</sub>)/Σ (mean<sub>vert</sub> EPSC). Traces from current clamp recordings were analyzed to count the number of action potentials (APs) elicited upon glutamate uncaging. In the 8×8 grid, 50 μm spacing, total number of spikes was 2.2±0.2 for L2/3 pyramidal cells (n=26), 5.4±0.6 for regular spiking (RS) pyramidal cells in L5a (n=30) and 9.9±1.6 for non-RS pyramidal cells in L5b (n=10). The number of spikes elicited by uncaging at single sites was one or two and on average: 1.04±0.04 for L2/3 cells, 1.03±0.02 for L5 RS cells and 1.04±0.02 for L5 non-RS cells. As spacing in the stimulation grid was 50 μm in these particular experiments, we used the following equation to compute the number of sites with AP (sAP) in a stimulation grid with a spacing of 75 μm (i.e., as in connectivity maps): sAP<sub>75</sub> = sAP<sub>50</sub> × (75/50)<sup>2</sup>. To estimate the loss of S1 synaptic contacts caused by slice preparation, we modeled the SPN dendritic field as a sphere centered on the soma. S1 synapses were at 80% distributed radially along dendrites, according to the specific distribution described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanabria et al., 2024</xref>. The simulation also incorporated the known distribution of SPN dendritic length as a function of distance from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gertler et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, it was assumed that synapse placement was isotropic, with equal probability in all directions from the soma. Truncation was simulated by removing a spherical cap at one pole of the sphere, reflecting the depth of our recordings (beyond 80 μm). Based on this simulation, the loss of S1 inputs was &lt;10%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Labeling of cortical cells</title><p>In a somatosensory corticostriatal slice prepared as described above, biocytin (2 %) was injected by iontophoresis in the L5a through a patch electrode (200 ms, 2.5 Hz) for 2×10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2000</xref>).

The authors developed and validated a novel slice preparation and method to which they applied rigorous functional mapping and thorough analysis. They found that individual SPNs were driven by sparse, scattered cortical clusters. Interestingly, while the cortical input fields of nearby SPNs had some degree of overlap, connectivity per SPN was largely distinct. Despite sparse, heterogeneous connectivity, topographical organization was identified. The authors lastly compared direct (D1) vs. indirect (D2) pathway cells, concluding that overall connectivity patterns were the same, but D1 cells received stronger input from L6 and D2 cells from L2/3. The paper thoughtfully addresses the question of whether barrel cortex broadly or selectively innervates SPNs. Their results indicate selective input that is loosely topographic. Their work deepens the understanding of how whisker-related somatosensory signals can drive striatal neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall this is a carefully conducted study, and the major claims are well-supported. The use of a novel ex vivo slice prep that keeps relevant corticostriatal projections intact allows for careful mapping of the barrel cortex to dorsolateral striatum SPNs.

First, by virtue of the experiments being performed in an acute slice prep, it is probable that portions of recorded SPN dendritic trees have been dissected (in an operationally consistent anatomical orientation). If afferents happen to systematically target the rostral/caudal projections of SPN dendritic fields, these inputs could be missed. Similarly, the dendritic locations of presynaptic cortical inputs remain unknown (e.g., do some inputs preferentially target distal vs proximal dendritic positions?). As synaptic connectivity was inferred from somatic recordings, it's likely that inputs targeting the proximal dendritic arbor are the ones most efficiently detected. Mapping the dendritic organization of synapses is beyond the scope of this work, but these points could be broached in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this analysis. The positions of S1 spines have been mapped on the SPN dendritic arbor by the group of Margolis (B.D. Sanabria et al., ENeuro 2024,10.1523/ENEURO.0503-23.2023). They observed that S1 spines were at 80 % on dendrites but with a specific distribution, on average rather close to the soma. In this study, S1 spines did not exhibit a specific distribution that would systematically hinder their detection in a slice. But, it remains that the position in the dendritic arbor where an S1 input is received does indeed impact its detection in somatic recordings. We modified the discussion as follows, line 275:</p><p>“The LSPS combined with glutamate uncaging mapped projections contained in the slice, intact from the presynaptic cell bodies to the SPN dendrites. Some cortical inputs targeting distal SPN dendrites may have gone undetected, either due to attenuation of synaptic events recorded at the soma or because distal dendritic branches were lost during slice preparation. Indeed, about 80 % of S1 synaptic contacts are distributed along dendrites (Sanabria et al., 2024). However, synapses located distally are proportionally rare (Sanabria et al., 2024), and our estimates suggest that the loss of S1 input was minimal (see Methods). More significantly, our mapping only included projections from neuronal somata located within the S1 barrel field in the slice: projections from cortical columns outside the slice were not stimulated. For this reason, our study characterized connectivity patterns rather than the full extent of connectivity with the barrel cortex.”</p><p>We explain our estimation of truncated S1 contacts in the Methods, line 434:</p><p>“To estimate the loss of S1 synaptic contacts caused by slice preparation, we modeled the SPN dendritic field as a sphere centered on the soma. S1 synapses were at 80 % distributed radially along dendrites, according to the specific distribution described by Sanabria et al. (2024). The simulation also incorporated the known distribution of SPN dendritic length as a function of distance from the soma (Gertler et al., 2008). Finally, it assumed that synapse placement was isotropic, with equal probability in all directions from the soma. Truncation was simulated by removing a spherical cap at one pole of the sphere, reflecting the depth of our recordings (beyond 80 μm). Based on this simulation, the loss of S1 inputs was &lt; 10 %.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In general, how specific (or generalizable) is the observed SPN-specific convergence of cortical barrel cortex projections in the dorsolateral striatum? In other words, does a similar cortical stimulation protocol targeted to a non-barrel sensory (or motor) cortex region produce similar SPN-specific innervation patterns in the dorsolateral striatum?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that could be addressed using the LSPS approach in areas for which ex vivo preparations have been designed to maintain the integrity of the corticostriatal projections, such as A1, M1 and S2.</p><p>We included this point in the discussion, line 299:</p><p>” The speckled connectivity pattern of individual SPNs, arising from the abundant and diffuse cortical innervation in the DLS, suggests that somatosensory corticostriatal synapses are established through a selective and/or competitive process. It is important to determine whether this sparse innervation of SPNs by S1 is a characteristic shared with other projections. In particular, it will be interesting to test this hypothesis on the auditory projections targeting the posterior striatum, where neurons exhibit clear tone frequency selectivity (Guo et al., 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In general, some of the figure legends are extremely brief, making many details difficult to infer.

This characteristic is important with regards to a limitation of electrophysiological recordings.

Indeed, our experimental conditions were not designed to capture the effects of network oscillatory activity. Instead, LSPS conditions were optimized to reveal monosynaptic connectivity between neurons in S1 and their postsynaptic targets. These optimizations include the use of a high concentration of extracellular divalents (4 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>) to generate robust yet moderate and spatially-restricted stimulations of cortical cells and reliable neurotransmitter release (Shepherd, Pologruto and Svoboda, Neuron 2003; 10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00152-1; in our study, see Fig. 1D and Suppl Fig. 2). Investigating the pre- and postsynaptic modulations of the corticostriatal coupling by up- and down-states would require specific conditions.</p><p>The conclusion now acknowledges that functional connectivity is subject to plasticity in general, line 358:</p><p>“The degree of input convergence onto SPNs could be modulated by plasticity, potentially enabling experience-driven reconfiguration of S1 corticostriatal coupling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In addition to population-level integration (Line 337), sensory integration is likely to involve synaptic plasticity (like via NMDARs), which was not studied in the present work</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point.

Whether the author has considered performing LSPS studies within the striatum (i.e., stimulating ChR2-expressing cortical axon terminals) and whether this experiment may consolidate the conclusion of the present work.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion to employ Subcellular Channelrhodopsin-2-Assisted Circuit Mapping (sCRACM) to study the density of S1 spines on SPNs dendritic arbor. If ChR2 is broadly expressed in S1, this approach would likely increase spine detection, as spines contacted by presynaptic neurons located inside and outside the slice would now be activated. If ChR2 expression could be restricted to the whisker columns present in our preparation, enhanced detection could still occur, but in this case, it would reflect the activation of spines contacted by specific ChR2<sup>+</sup> axonal branches that exit and re-enter the slice to form synapses on the recorded SPN. The anatomy of corticostriatal axonal arbors suggest convoluted axonal trajectories could be relatively rare (T. Zheng and C.J. Wilson, J Neurophysiol. 2001; 10.1152/jn.00519.2001; M. Lévesque et al., Brain Res. 1996; 10.1016/0006-8993(95)01333-4).</p><p>Moreover, it is important to remember that sCRACM does not generate connectivity maps between 2 structures, but maps of spines on dendritic arbors (Petreanu L.T. et al., Nature 2009; 10.1038/nature07709.). Precise localization of presynaptic cell bodies was key for the present study, as it enabled distinguishing between different connectivity patterns and between different degrees of convergence of inputs from adjacent S1 cortical columns present in the slice (schematized in Fig. 1). Distinguishing these inputs using the stimulation of axon terminals would require the possibility to express one distinct opsin in each whisker column (or each cortical layer, depending on the axis of investigation). This is an exciting perspective but the technology is not yet available to our knowledge.</p><p>To emphasize our reasons for using LSPS, we revised the final paragraph of the Introduction, line 69:</p><p>“LSPS enabled precise mapping of corticostriatal functional connectivity by identifying cortical sites where stimulation evoked synaptic currents in the recorded SPNs, thereby localizing the cell bodies of their presynaptic neurons. This approach allowed us to determine both the cortical column and layer of origin within the barrel field in the slice for each SPN input.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 2F: SPN and cortical regions - both are shown in green.
