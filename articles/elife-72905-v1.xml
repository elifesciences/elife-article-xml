evolutionary biology. However, adaptive walks connecting genotypes to organismal fitness, speciation, and novel ecological niches are still poorly understood and processes for surmounting fitness valleys remain controversial. One outstanding system for addressing these connections is a recent adaptive radiation of ecologically and morphologically novel pupfishes (a generalist, molluscivore, and scale-eater) endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We leveraged whole-genome sequencing of 139 hybrids from two independent field fitness experiments to identify the genomic basis of fitness, estimate genotypic fitness networks, and measure the accessibility of adaptive walks on the fitness landscape. We identified 132 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly associated with fitness in field enclosures. Six out of the 13 regions most strongly associated with fitness contained differentially expressed genes and fixed SNPs between trophic specialists; one gene (<italic>mettl21e</italic>) was also misexpressed in lab-reared hybrids, suggesting a potential intrinsic genetic incompatibility. We then constructed genotypic fitness networks from adaptive alleles and show that scale-eating specialists are the most isolated of the three species on these networks. Intriguingly, introgressed and de novo variants reduced fitness landscape ruggedness as compared to standing variation, increasing the accessibility of genotypic fitness paths from generalist to specialists. Our results suggest that adaptive introgression and de novo mutations alter the shape of the fitness landscape, providing key connections in adaptive walks circumventing fitness valleys and triggering the evolution of novelty during adaptive radiation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the main drivers of evolution is natural selection, which is when organisms better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. A common metaphor to explain this process is a landscape covered in peaks and valleys: the peaks represent genetic combinations or traits with high evolutionary fitness, while the valleys represent those with low fitness.</p><p>As a population evolves and its environment changes, it moves among these peaks taking small steps across the landscape. However, there is a limit to how far an organism can travel in one leap. So, what happens when they need to cross a valley of low fitness to get to the next peak? To address this question, Patton et al. studied three young species of pupfish that recently evolved from a common ancestor and co-habit the same environment in the Caribbean.</p><p>Patton et al. sequenced whole genomes of each new species and used this to build a genotypic fitness landscape, a network linking neighboring genotypes which each have a unique fitness value that was measured during field experiments. This revealed that most of the paths connecting the different species passed through valleys of low fitness. But there were rare, narrow ridges connecting each species.</p><p>Next, Patton et al. found that new mutations as well as genetic variations that arose from mating with pupfish on other Caribbean islands altered genetic interactions and changed the shape of the fitness landscape. Ultimately, this significantly increased the accessibility of fitness peaks by both adding more ridges and decreasing the lengths of paths, expanding the realm of possible evolutionary outcomes.</p><p>Understanding how fitness landscapes change during evolution could help to explain where new species come from. Other researchers could apply the same approach to estimate the genotypic fitness landscapes of other species, from bacteria to vertebrates. These networks could be used to visualize the complex fitness landscape that connects all lifeforms on Earth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Cyprinodon</italic></kwd><kwd>fitness landscape</kwd><kwd>genotypic fitness network</kwd><kwd>adaptive radiation</kwd><kwd>introgression</kwd><kwd>de novo mutation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01DE027052‐02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Christopher H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1749764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Christopher H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2109838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patton</surname><given-names>Austin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007890</institution-id><institution>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Christopher H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006978</institution-id><institution>University of California, Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>Christopher H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hybridization not only generates genetic diversity, but this diversity can alter the shape of the fitness landscape, changing which genotypic combinations are favored by natural selection and which accessible genotypic paths lead to novel fitness peaks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>First conceptualized by Sewell Wright in 1932, the adaptive landscape describes the complex relationship between genotype or phenotype and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Wright, 1932</xref>). The landscape is a concept, a metaphor, and an empirical measurement that exerts substantial influence over all evolutionary dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gavrilets, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Pigliucci and Müller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Svensson and Calsbeek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fragata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fear and Price, 1998</xref>). Fitness landscapes were originally depicted as high-dimensional networks spanning genotypic space in which each genotype is associated with fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Wright, 1932</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Simpson, 1944</xref>, later described phenotypic evolution of populations through time on a rugged landscape, in which isolated clusters of fitness peaks represent ‘adaptive zones’ relative to adjacent regions of low fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kauffman and Levin, 1987</xref>). Lande and Arnold formalized the analysis of selection and estimation of phenotypic fitness landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lande and Arnold, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arnold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arnold, 2003</xref>), leading to empirical studies of fitness landscapes in numerous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Schluter and Grant, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Schluter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hendry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beausoleil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Benkman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin and Wainwright, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>). Fitness surfaces are also central components of speciation models and theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gavrilets, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Turelli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Servedio and Boughman, 2017</xref>).</p><p>A central focus of fitness landscape theory is the characterization of the shape of the fitness landscape. Theoretical and empirical studies frequently attempt to describe its topography, such as quantifying the number of fitness peaks, one component of landscape ruggedness that affects the predictability of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fragata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wright, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aita et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, the existence of multiple peaks and valleys on the fitness landscape implies epistasis for fitness, or non-additive effects on fitness resulting from genotypic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wright, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Whitlock et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Poelwijk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Poelwijk et al., 2011</xref>). Fitness epistasis reduces the predictability of evolution because the resultant increase in the number of peaks increases the number of viable evolutionary outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kauffman and Levin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Neidhart et al., 2014</xref>). Increasing fitness epistasis also increases landscape ruggedness, thus reducing the probability of converging on any one fitness peak and ultimately diversifying potential evolutionary outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kauffman and Levin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Neidhart et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This leads to a fundamental concept in fitness landscape theory: Not all genotypic pathways are evolutionarily accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fragata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Poelwijk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Franke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Visser and Krug, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Smith, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ogbunugafor, 2020</xref>). In large populations, paths through genotype space that monotonically increase in fitness at each mutational step are favored over alternatives with neutral or deleterious steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fisher, 1930</xref>). These accessible genotypic paths can be considered adaptive walks under Fisher’s geometric model, by which adaptation proceeds toward a phenotypic optimum via additive mutations of small phenotypic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fisher, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Orr, 2005</xref>). On rugged landscapes as originally envisioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wright, 1931</xref>, greater numbers of peaks (i.e. the ruggedness) increase the mean length of potential adaptive walks to any one fitness optimum, while decreasing the length of accessible paths to the nearest peak. Ultimately, this leads to a decrease in the probability that any one fitness optimum is reached. Simultaneously, increasing landscape ruggedness decreases the length of adaptive walks to the nearest local optimum, owing to the corresponding increase in peak density.</p><p>There are a growing number of experimental studies of adaptive walks in nature, including the evolution of toxin resistance in monarch butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Karageorgi et al., 2019</xref>), alcohol tolerance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Siddiq et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Siddiq and Thornton, 2019</xref>), and host-shift in aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Singh et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, the accessibility of genotypic fitness networks has now been explored in numerous microbial systems, including the evolution of antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>), metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Peng et al., 2018</xref>), citrate exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Blount et al., 2008</xref>), and glucose limitation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Khan et al., 2011</xref>), and adaptation to salinity in yeast via evolution of heat shock protein <italic>Hsp90</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bank et al., 2016</xref>). However, these studies are still limited to the investigation of specific coding substitutions and their effects on fitness in laboratory environments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nosil et al., 2020</xref> estimated genotypic fitness networks for <italic>Timema</italic> stick insects based on a field experiment. Similarly, this study focused on a single large-effect locus underlying dimorphic coloration between ecotypes. These studies represent significant advances, but extension of fitness landscape theory to empirical systems including multiple species remains an underexplored area of future research at the intersection of micro- and macroevolution. Such studies can provide insight into the topography of fitness landscapes in natural systems, the accessibility of interspecific adaptive walks, and ultimately the predictability of evolution.</p><p>One promising system for estimating fitness landscapes is a recent adaptive radiation of <italic>Cyprinodon</italic> pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin and Wainwright, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Martin and Wainwright, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Martin, 2016</xref>). This radiation is comprised of two trophic specialists, a molluscivore (durophage: <italic>Cyprinodon brontotheroides</italic>) and a scale-eater (lepidophage: <italic>Cyprinodon desquamator</italic>), derived from a Caribbean-wide generalist (<italic>Cyprinodon variegatus</italic>) which also coexists in the same habitats. These three species all occur in sympatry in the hypersaline lakes of San Salvador Island, Bahamas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Found in the benthic littoral zone of each lake, all three species forage within the same benthic microhabitat; indeed, no habitat segregation has been observed in 14 years of field studies. Originating less than 10,000 years ago (based on geological age estimates for the lakes: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Turner et al., 2008</xref>), the functional and trophic novelty harbored within this radiation is the product of exceptional rates of craniofacial morphological evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Martin and Wainwright, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">St John et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Martin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">St John et al., 2020b</xref>). Furthermore, species boundaries persist across multiple lake populations, despite persistent admixture among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Martin and Feinstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Richards et al., 2021</xref>). We previously estimated fitness landscapes in these hypersaline lakes from two independent field experiments measuring the growth and survival of hybrids placed in field enclosures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Selection analyses revealed a multi-peaked phenotypic fitness landscape that is stable across lake populations, year of study, and manipulation of the frequency of rare hybrid phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin and Wainwright, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Martin, 2016</xref>). One of the strongest and most persistent trends across studies and treatments was that hybrid phenotypes resembling the scale-eater were isolated in the lowest fitness region for both growth and survival relative to the other two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin and Wainwright, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>). In contrast, hybrids resembling the generalist occupied a fitness peak and were separated by a smaller fitness valley from hybrids resembling the molluscivore, which occurred on a second peak of higher fitness.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>San Salvador Island pupfishes and their hybrids.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) From top to bottom: the generalist, <italic>Cyprinodon variegatus</italic>, the molluscivore <italic>Cyprinodon brontotheroides</italic>, and the scale-eater <italic>Cyprinodon desquamator</italic>.

Fitness peaks and valleys in morphospace may result only from the reduction of the adaptive landscape to two phenotypic dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wagner, 2012</xref>). Additional phenotypic and genotypic dimensions may reveal fitness ridges that entirely circumvent fitness valleys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conrad, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Whibley et al., 2006</xref>).

However, extension of these ideas to more high-dimensional genotypic fitness landscapes remains underexplored.

We were able to address long-standing questions posed by fitness landscape theory in an empirical system and assess the extent to which the shape of the fitness landscape and accessibility of adaptive walks are contingent upon the source of adaptive genetic variation. We show that not only are scale-eaters more isolated than molluscivores from generalists on the fitness landscape, but that the scale-eater fitness landscape is more rugged than molluscivores. This indicates that epistasis is more pervasive on the scale-eater fitness landscape, leading to less predictable evolutionary outcomes and fewer accessible trajectories from generalist to scale-eater genotypes. Overall, we found that most genotypic trajectories were inaccessible and included one or more mutational steps that decreased in fitness from generalist to specialist. This finding is consistent with the patterns observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>, who constructed combinatorially complete fitness networks for five mutations contributing to antibiotic resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic> and found that only 18 of 120 possible genotypic trajectories were evolutionarily accessible. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Khan et al., 2011</xref> estimated that over half of all trajectories were accessible on a complete fitness landscape constructed using the first five adaptive mutations to fix in an experimental population of <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>We also show that fitness landscapes are most rugged, and therefore epistasis most pervasive, when constructed from standing genetic variation alone, ultimately leading to a reduction in the accessibility of fitness peaks on these landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This finding has significant implications for the predictability of evolution in the earliest stages of the speciation process. Adaptation from standing genetic variation is thought to initially be more rapid due to its initial availability and potentially reduced genetic load within a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barrett and Schluter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hermisson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hedrick, 2013</xref>). In contrast, we consistently found that networks constructed from a combination of adaptive standing variation, introgression, and de novo mutations reduced the ruggedness of fitness landscapes and thus increased accessibility of interspecific evolutionary trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This would suggest that adaptive introgression or de novo mutations reduce the impacts of epistasis, resulting in a smoother fitness landscape with a greater number of accessible adaptive walks, facilitating the colonization of new adaptive zones. Future studies testing the generality of these findings will be invaluable for our understanding of the speciation process.</p><p>Furthermore, our results shed light on the classic problem of crossing fitness valleys on three-dimensional phenotypic fitness landscapes. We show that phenotypic fitness valleys may be circumvented by rare accessible paths on the genotypic fitness landscape. These results are consistent with increasing recognition that three-dimensional depictions of the fitness landscape may lead to incorrect intuitions about how populations evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Pigliucci and Müller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fragata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kaplan, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our study represents a significant contribution to the growing body of work applying fitness landscape theory to empirical systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Karageorgi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nosil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Pokusaeva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gong and Bloom, 2014</xref>).

One limitation of this approach is that subsampled fitness networks may not directly correspond to the full landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fragata et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blanquart and Bataillon, 2016</xref>).

Second, nodes (here, SNP haplotypes) can appear disconnected in a subsampled fitness landscape, but may be connected in the full fitness landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fragata et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, given that there are more possible genotypes for a gene of 1000 base-pairs than particles in the known universe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Wright, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Szendro et al., 2013</xref>), nearly all empirical fitness landscapes must necessarily be subsampled at some scale.</p><p>Although inferences from subsampled fitness networks have their limitations, so too do those obtained from combinatorially complete fitness landscapes, which may themselves be misleading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Whitlock et al., 1995</xref>). By including mutations that are not segregating in natural populations, the shape of the ‘complete’ fitness landscape and thus accessibility of fitness peaks may be quite different from what occurs in nature. The shape of fitness landscapes in nature is dictated by the ‘realized’ epistasis that occurs among naturally segregating loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Whitlock et al., 1995</xref>). Changes to ‘realized’ epistasis induced by introgression or de novo mutations appear to be one mechanism altering the shape of the fitness landscape and thus accessibility of fitness peaks.

Future experimental or simulation studies may track how novel adaptive alleles affect fitness landscape topography as they increase in frequency.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence that de novo and introgressed adaptive variation may contribute to rapid speciation and evolution toward novel fitness peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Blount et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Marques et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Meier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nelson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Svardal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lamichhaney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grant and Grant, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Edelman and Mallet, 2021</xref>). We demonstrate that adaptive introgression smooths the fitness landscape and increases the accessibility of fitness peaks. This provides an alternative mechanism to explain why hybridization appears to play such a pervasive role in adaptive radiation and speciation. There are many examples of hybridization promoting or inducing rapid speciation and adaptive radiation. Whether in Galapagos finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grant and Grant, 2019</xref>), African cichlids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Richards et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Meier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Svardal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Meier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Poelstra et al., 2018</xref>), or <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pardo-Diaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Moest et al., 2020</xref>), hybridization has been shown to play a generative role in adaptive radiation and the evolution of novelty. One mechanism is the increased genotypic, phenotypic, and ecological diversity generated by hybridization in the form of transgressive phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Seehausen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewontin and Birch, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Rieseberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kagawa and Takimoto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2013</xref>). This diversity in turn facilitates the colonization of novel fitness peaks and ecological niches, particularly after colonization of a new environment rich in ecological opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mallet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Seehausen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Edelman and Mallet, 2021</xref>). However, this model often assumes that the fitness landscape remains static after adaptive introgression. Here, we show that adaptive introgression directly alters the shape of the fitness landscape, making novel fitness peaks more accessible to natural selection. Thus, hybridization not only generates genetic diversity, but this diversity can alter the shape of the fitness landscape, changing which genotypic combinations are favored by natural selection along with the adaptive walks that lead to them.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling</title><p>Our final genomic dataset was comprised of 139 hybrids subsampled from two separate field experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin and Wainwright, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>) on San Salvador Island.

Because we were primarily interested in admixture proportions of hybrids, we set K = 3 in these analyses, corresponding to the three parental species used in hybrid crosses. Using admixture proportions of hybrid individuals, we tested the hypothesis that ancestry predicts hybrid composite fitness in experimental field enclosures by fitting a GAM including either (1) scale-eater ancestry or (2) molluscivore ancestry with fixed effects for experiment and lake.

We restricted our investigation to networks composed of adaptive loci as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Richards et al., 2021</xref>). This included a total of 380 SNPs in the molluscivores, and 1118 in the scale-eaters. The reduced number of adaptive SNPs sites in our dataset as compared to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Richards et al., 2021</xref> is due primarily to the increased stringency of our filtering. We further partitioned these SNPs by their respective sources: standing genetic variation (molluscivore N = 364; scale-eater N = 1029), de novo mutation (scale-eater N = 24), or introgression (molluscivore N = 16; scale-eater N = 65), again using the assignments from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Richards et al., 2021</xref>. For analyses of trajectories between generalists and molluscivores, we included only SNPs found to be sweeping in molluscivores; likewise, we included only SNPs sweeping in scale-eaters for analysis of trajectories between generalists and scale-eaters.</p><p>The full procedure for constructing genotypic fitness networks, identifying accessible paths, and quantifying accessibility is outlined in the supplement. Briefly, we randomly generated 5000 datasets of five SNPs comprised of either (1) standing genetic variation, (2) adaptive introgression, (3) de novo mutation (scale-eaters only), (4) standing genetic variation + adaptive introgression, (5) standing genetic variation + <italic>denovo</italic> mutation, or (6) standing genetic variation + adaptive introgression + denovo mutation (scale-eaters only). We additionally repeated this procedure using both classes of SNPs for molluscivores to determine whether genotypic trajectories separating generalists to molluscivores are more accessible than those between generalists and scale-eaters. Because different sets of sites are sweeping in each specialist, we conducted these analyses separately for each species. We then constructed genotypic networks, in which nodes are haplotypes of SNPs encoded in 012 format (0 = homozygous reference, 1 = heterozygote, 2 = homozygous alternate), and edges link mutational neighbors. When determining whether a path was accessible or not, we only included paths for which each mutational step (i.e. each intervening haplotype) between generalist to specialist was observed in at least one hybrid sample.</p><p>With these networks, we sought to ask (1) whether molluscivores or scale-eaters are more accessible to generalists on their respective genotypic fitness landscapes, (2) whether the ruggedness of the genotypic fitness landscape varied among specialists, and (3) whether accessibility is contingent upon the source of genetic variation available to natural selection. For each random network sampled and for each measure of fitness, we calculated (1) the minimum length of accessible paths between a random generalist and specialist sampled from our sequenced individuals, (2) the number of accessible paths between the same generalist and specialist pair, (3) the number of nodes, (4) the number of edges in the network, (5) the number of peaks on the landscape (genotypes with no fitter neighbors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferretti et al., 2018</xref>), (6) the distance of parental nodes to these peaks, and (7) the number of accessible paths separating them. Larger networks often have a greater number of potential paths, including both accessible and inaccessible paths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and we were interested in the relative availability of accessible adaptive pathways. Consequently, we divided the number of accessible paths in each random network sampled by the number of nodes. Using our six summary statistics, we tested whether accessibility and landscape ruggedness differed between networks constructed from SGV/introgression/de novo mutations (for scale-eaters) or SGV/introgression (for molluscivores). To do so, we calculated the mean and standard error of each summary statistic across all 5000 replicates. We then modeled the association between each summary statistic and species using a logistic regression, whereby species was modeled as a binary response variable (i.e. scale-eater networks = 0, molluscivore networks = 1), with each measure of accessibility as the predictor. We arbitrarily treated scale-eater networks as the control, and using the estimated coefficients obtained an OR that corresponds to the extent to which molluscivore networks either have increased (OR &gt; 1) or decreased (OR &lt; 1) accessibility measures relative to scale-eater networks. Significance was similarly assessed using a likelihood ratio test. Additional details on this procedure may be found in the supplement. Using the fitted logistic model, we conducted a likelihood ratio test to quantify significance. To explicitly test the hypothesis that increasing landscape ruggedness reduced the length of accessible paths to the nearest fitness peak, we fit a Poisson regression model in R in which the number of fitness peaks predicts the length of the shortest accessible path between any generalist or specialist node and any fitness peak on that landscape: glm(Min. Distance to Peak ~ Number of Peaks, family = ‘poisson’).</p><p>A similar procedure was used to assess whether measures of accessibility (scaled number of accessible paths, length of the shortest accessible path) and landscape ruggedness (number of peaks) differed within species among networks constructed from different sources of genetic variation. Here, networks constructed from SGV were treated as the control, to which all other networks were compared. For example, to test whether accessibility of the generalist-to-scale-eater paths are greater in networks constructed from de novo mutations than those from SGV, a logistic model was fitted wherein the response variable for SGV networks was assigned to be 0, and 1 for de novo networks. As before, significance was similarly assessed using a likelihood ratio test, but here <italic>p</italic>-values were corrected for multiple testing using the FDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). We assessed whether differences in these measures among the two alternate generalist to specialist trajectories in networks constructed from all three sources of variation were significant using an ANOVA in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">R Development Core Team, 2019</xref>). Due to the highly skewed nature of these distributions, post hoc pairwise significance was assessed using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance in the agricolae package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Mendiburu, 2020</xref>) in R.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were carried out following approved protocols from the University of California, Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (#17455), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Animal Care and Use Committee (#18-061.0), and the University of California, Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP-2015-01-7053).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary tables.</title><p>(a)—Table 1.

List of the 31 morphological traits measured for this study and standard length; corresponding landmark IDs match those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>. (k)—Table 11. Generalized additive models fitted to composite fitness. Model fit was assessed using AICc, and Akaike weights represent proportional model support. A thin-plate spline for the two linear discriminant axes s(LD1, LD2) is always included, as is a fixed effect of either experiment (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin and Wainwright, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>) or lake (Crescent Pond/Little Lake) or an interaction between the two. In the last two models, experiment and lake are included as splines, modeled using a factor smooth (bs = ‘fs’). The best-fit model had five estimated degrees of freedom. (l)—Table 12.

A thin-plate spline for the two linear discriminant axes s(LD1, LD2) is always included, as is a fixed effect of either experiment (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin and Wainwright, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>) or lake (Crescent Pond/Little Lake) or an interaction between the two. In the last two models, experiment and lake are included as splines, modeled using a factor smooth (bs = ‘fs’). The best-fit model had 8.93 estimated degrees of freedom. (m)—Table 13. Generalized additive models fitted to survival. Model fit was assessed using AICc, and Akaike weights represent proportional model support. A thin-plate spline for the two linear discriminant axes s(LD1, LD2) is always included, as is a fixed effect of either experiment (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin and Wainwright, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>) or lake (Crescent Pond/Little Lake) or an interaction between the two. In the last two models, experiment and lake are included as splines, modeled using a factor smooth (bs = ‘fs’). The best-fit model had five estimated degrees of freedom. (n)—Table 14. Generalized additive models fitted to growth including SNPs most strongly associated with composite fitness. Model fit was assessed using AICc, and Akaike weights represent proportional model support. The best-fit model for composite fitness using morphology alone (see Table 8) was used as the base model. The SNPs that were most strongly associated with composite fitness (following a Bonferroni correction) were included as fixed effects, modeled as splines using a factor smooth, treating genotype as an ordered factor. Note that three SNPs were excluded due to their close proximity to other SNPs that were more strongly associated. All SNPs were considered individually, as well as all SNPs together. We were unable to assess all possible combinations of SNPs due to the vast number of potential models given the number of SNPs under consideration; rather, we fit one final model that only included SNPs found to be significant in the full model. In turn this model led to a substantial improvement in AICc. The best-fit model had 20.29 estimated degrees of freedom. (o)—Table 15. Generalized additive models fitted to growth including SNPs most strongly associated with growth. Model fit was assessed using AICc, and Akaike weights represent proportional model support. The best-fit model for growth using morphology alone (see Table 9) was used as the base model. Each of the four SNPs that were most strongly associated with growth (following a Bonferroni correction) were included as fixed effects, modeled as splines using a factor smooth, treating genotype as an ordered factor. All SNPs were considered individually, as well as all possible combinations. This was only feasible due to the small number of SNPs assessed (four). The best-fit model had 7.97 estimated degrees of freedom. (p)—Table 16. General linear models fitted to examine the relationship between aspects of network size (i.e. number of nodes, number of edges linking neighboring nodes) and the number of accessible paths between generalists and specialists. Models were fitted using each of the three different fitness measures; bolded lines correspond to the best-fit model for each response variable, within each measure of fitness. Poisson regression was chosen as each response variable correspond to count-data. Because Poisson regression models are log-linear, we report both the estimated coefficient and its exponentiated value which corresponds to the expected multiplicative increase in the mean of Y per unit value of X. (q)—Table 17. Accessibility of specialists to generalists and the ruggedness of their respective fitness landscapes. Odds ratios were obtained by modeling the association between each summary statistic and the species from which adaptive loci were used to construct the fitness network. Scale-eaters were treated as the baseline of comparison in the comparison of odds ratios; thus, positive odds ratios imply that summary statistics for molluscivore fitness networks are greater than those constructed from scale-eater adaptive loci and vice versa. For generalist to specialist comparisons, accessible paths were identified between one randomly sampled generalist node and one randomly sampled specialist node. For comparison of the peaks in networks, these summary statistics were calculated from either molluscivore or scale-eater fitness networks, identifying the number of peaks (nodes with no fitter neighbors – see Materials and methods), and the scaled (total divided by number of nodes in the network) number of accessible paths separating all focal specialist nodes and all peaks in the network. (r)—Table 18. Influence of different sources of adaptive genetic variation on accessibility of fitness paths separating either generalists from molluscivores, or generalists and scale-eaters using all samples. Results for networks using all three measures of fitness (composite fitness, survival, and growth) are reported. Networks were constructed from random draws of five SNPs from either standing genetic variation (SGV), introgression, or de novo mutations, as well as their combinations. Odds ratios were obtained by modeling the association between each accessibility measure and the source of genetic variation used to construct the fitness network, relative to networks constructed from standing variation. Thus, positive odds ratios imply that networks from standing variation have measures of accessibility that are smaller as compared to the alternative (e.g. introgression, de novo mutations, etc.). (s)—Table 19. Influence of different sources of adaptive genetic variation on accessibility of fitness paths separating either generalists from molluscivores, or generalists and scale-eaters using only samples from the second field experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>).

2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>), respectively. Experiments were carried out in two lakes: Little Lake (LL), and Crescent Pond (CP). Following their initial collection at the conclusion of their respective experiments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin and Wainwright, 2013a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>, for protocols), samples were stored in ethanol. In late 2018, 149 hybrid samples were selected for use in this experiment. Of these, 27 are from the experiment conducted in 2011 (14 from LL, 13 from CP), and the remaining 122 are from the 2016 experiment (58 from LL, 64 from CP). Due to reduced sample size for some species within Little Lake, we include fish obtained from Osprey Lake for downstream analyses comparing hybrids to Little Lake, as the two comprise a single, interconnected body of water.</p></sec><sec id="s8-2" sec-type="appendix"><title>Genomic library prep</title><p>DNA was extracted from the muscle tissue of hybrids using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kits (Qiagen, Inc); these extractions were then quantified using a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Thermo Scientific, Inc). Genomic libraries were prepared by the Vincent J Coates Genomic Sequencing Center (QB3) on the automated Apollo 324 system (WaterGen Biosystems, Inc). Samples were fragmented using a Covaris sonicator, and barcoded with Illumina indices. Samples were quality checked using a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Inc). All samples were sequenced to approximately 10× raw coverage on an Illumina NovaSeq.</p></sec><sec id="s8-3" sec-type="appendix"><title>Genotyping and filtering</title><p>Because we are interested in genomic variants found not only within our hybrid samples but across San Salvador Island and the Caribbean, we conducted genotyping including all 247 samples from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Richards et al., 2021</xref>. These samples include members of the three species (<italic>C. variegatus</italic>, <italic>C. brontotheroides</italic>, <italic>C. desquamator</italic>) found on San Salvador Island, as well as individuals of <italic>C. variegatus</italic> found throughout the Caribbean, and numerous outgroups (<italic>C. laciniatus</italic>, <italic>C. higuey</italic>, <italic>C. dearborni</italic>, <italic>Megupsilon aporus</italic>, and <italic>Cualac tesselatus</italic>). We then excluded <italic>M. aporus</italic> and <italic>C. tesselatus</italic> along with 18 additional samples for which necessary data for downstream analyses were missing (e.g. quality photographs for the collection of morphological data). This approach led to the retention of a total of 4,206,786 total SNPs and 139 hybrid individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s8-4" sec-type="appendix"><title>Morphometrics</title><p>Because the morphological measurements used in the 2013 and 2016 experiments differ slightly, we remeasured all sequenced hybrid individuals and up to 30 individuals of each parent species for the 30 morphological characters described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>, as well as for standard length (SL).</p><p>For each photograph, unit-scale was obtained by additionally landmarking points on a regular grid included in each photograph using DLTdv8a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hedrick, 2008</xref>). Landmark data (x-y coordinates in units of pixels) were subsequently uploaded into R and converted to millimeters (in the case of linear measurements) or degrees (for angular measurements) using a custom script.</p><p>We then assessed, for each trait, the need for size correction. That is, we sought to avoid an outsized role of body size in downstream interpretation. Thus, if a trait was colinear with SL, we regressed the two (treating SL as the predictor) and took the residuals. In each case, both SL and the response were log10 transformed. Subsequently, residuals were scaled such that their distribution had a mean of 0, and a standard deviation of 1. Traits that did not need size correction were also log-transformed and unit-scaled.</p><p>We used these morphological measurements to estimate two LD axes that distinguish the generalist, molluscivore, and scale-eater using the LDA function in R. That is, we used morphological data from the 165 parental fish to estimate LD scores for each individual. Doing so, we were able to correctly assign individual fish to their corresponding species with 99.4% accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). Attempting to predict species assignment by lake did not improve this prediction accuracy (instead reducing prediction accuracy to 98.7%); consequently, we proceeded with the LD axes estimated without accounting for lake.</p><p>We additionally asked whether (1) specialists were more morphologically constrained than generalists and (2) if hybrids were less constrained than the three parental species. To do so, we calculated morphological disparity per group using the dispRity.per.group function implemented in the R package dispRity v1.3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Guillerme and Poisot, 2018</xref>). Specifically, this function calculates the median distance between each row (sample) and the centroid of the matrix per group. By bootstrapping the data 100 times, we tested the hypothesis that each of the three parental species differed significantly in their morphological disparity, first using an ANOVA, followed by a post hoc pairwise t-test to assess pairwise significance in R. We corrected for multiple tests using an FDR correction.</p><p>To test whether genetic distance predicts morphological distance, we calculated two distance matrices. First, we calculated pairwise Euclidean distances between all hybrids using all morphological variables. Then, we calculated pairwise genetic distances between all hybrids using the final set of SNPs described above with the genet.dist function implemented in vcfR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Knaus and Grünwald, 2017</xref>). We then fit a simple linear model, regressing genetic distance on morphological distance.</p></sec><sec id="s8-5" sec-type="appendix"><title>Estimation of adaptive landscapes</title><p>We sought to characterize the extent to which the three measures of fitness are predicted by morphology alone and to, in turn, visualize fitness landscapes for our sequenced hybrids. To do so, we fitted six GAMs using the mgcv package v1.8.28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wood, 2011</xref>) in R. All models included a thin-plate spline fitted for the two LD axes. Because we have strong a priori knowledge that fitness outcomes will be contingent to some extent on experiment year and on the lake in which hybrids were placed, we include experiment and lake in all fitted models, modeled either as fixed effects or as an interaction term between the two. Additionally, we fitted models that included individual splines for each LD axis, either with or without experiment or lake as a factor smooth. The full list of models and their respective fits are included in the supplement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–tables 11–13</xref>).</p><p>For composite fitness, we excluded three SNPs that were within close proximity (i.e. &lt;1000 bp) to an SNP that was more significantly associated. Because of the reduced number of significantly associated SNPs identified for growth (4) as compared to composite fitness (10), we were able to fit and compare all combinations of significantly associated SNPs for the former. The best-fit model for composite fitness was also the most complex, including all fitness-associated SNPs. Thus, to reduce model complexity, we fit one additional model, excluding any of the three SNP (fixed effect) that was not significant in the full model. The full range of models and their associated fits are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–tables 14–15</xref>. As before, predicted fitness values across LD space were extracted from the best-fit model and plotted using R.</p></sec><sec id="s8-6" sec-type="appendix"><title>Genotypic fitness networks</title><p>Recent work has shown that the adaptive radiation of the pupfish of San Salvador Island involved selection on standing genetic variation, adaptive introgression, and de novo mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Richards et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the specialists on San Salvador Island received approximately twice as much adaptive introgression as did generalists on neighboring islands. These findings imply that each source of genetic variation may exert a unique influence on the fitness landscape, in turn facilitating the radiation. We sought to explore this possibility and so estimated genotypic fitness networks using sites previously shown to have undergone hard selective sweeps in specialists. To do so, we identified the SNPs in our un-thinned dataset overlapping with sites inferred to have undergone selective sweeps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Richards et al., 2021</xref>) to produce two datasets (one for each specialist). We then constructed networks using the following procedure:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Target SNPs were extracted from the vcf file of all sequenced hybrids and parental species from Crescent Pond and Little Lake in 0/1/2 format using VCFtools. That is, individuals genotyped as homozygote reference were coded as 0, heterozygotes as 1, and homozygote alternatives as 2. Note again that the reference genome used was that of the molluscivore, <italic>C. brontotheroides</italic>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>These SNPs were subsequently loaded into R, and concatenated into haplotypes, such that each sequenced individual has a haplotype. These per-sample haplotypes were subsequently associated with metadata, namely the observed binary survival, growth, assignment as hybrid or one of the three parental species, and lake of origin.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Each haplotype was subsequently collapsed and summarized, such that mean survival, growth, and composite fitness are retained for each unique haplotype. Additionally, the number of hybrids, generalists, molluscivores, and scale-eaters that have the haplotype were recorded.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The distance in number of mutational steps was then calculated for each pairwise combination of haplotypes. For example, the distance between haplotype 000 and 001 is a single mutational step, whereas haplotypes 000 and 002 are two steps away.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Lastly, we constructed networks using the R package igraph v1.2.4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</xref>). Specifically, nodes represent haplotypes, and edges are drawn between haplotypes that are mutational neighbors (i.e. are a single mutational step away). Nodes present in hybrids were colored and sized proportional to their respective mean fitness. Nodes present only in parental species were colored according to the species in which that haplotype is unique to.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s8-7" sec-type="appendix"><title>Estimation of evolutionary accessibility</title><p>The large number of SNPs in our dataset above raises numerous challenges in the visualization and summarization of fitness networks. Perhaps most significant is that, as the number of sites assessed increases, the sequence space increases vastly; the number of potential haplotypes is defined by 3 to the power of the number of SNPs, and the number of potential edges is defined by the number of haplotypes choose 2. Consequently, networks constructed from a larger number of focal SNPs are comprised of haplotypes that are separated on average by more mutational steps than those constructed from fewer SNPs. Because we can only interpret the fitness consequences of evolutionary trajectories for which we have data along each mutational step, we restricted analysis to haplotypes that are mutational neighbors (i.e. separated by a single mutational step).</p><p>To do so, we developed a permutation approach to construct fitness networks from SNPs that were sourced from the three sources of genetic variation defined above as well as all possible combinations including standing variation (i.e. standing genetic variation + adaptive introgression and/or de novo mutation). Specifically, from each set we sampled five SNPs up to 5000 times. For networks constructed from combinations of sources (e.g. SGV + introgression), we ensured that at least one of each source was present. To do so, we generated 1000 random sets of SNPs for all possible combinations (e.g. 1 SGV – 4 introgression, 2 SGV – 3 introgression, etc.). Then, we sampled up to 5000 of these combinations; these samples comprise our permutations. Then, from each permutation, we constructed fitness networks using the five steps defined above; these networks served as the subsequent assessment of evolutionary accessibility of genotypic trajectories separating the generalists from either specialist. Edges were only drawn such that the network is directed; that is, edges were drawn from low to higher or equal fitness nodes.</p><p>We constructed networks using both parental species and hybrids. For each trajectory under consideration (generalist → molluscivore and generalist → scale-eater), we first identified all generalist to specialist trajectories that are connected by accessible (monotonically increasing) paths. From these connected generalist-specialist node pairs, we randomly sampled a single pair. We then identified the number and length of accessible paths separating the generalist node from the specialist node and recorded these values using the ‘all_simple_paths’ function in igraph and excluded any paths that traversed through haplotypes not found in any hybrid (i.e. exclusive to parental species) and thus had no information on fitness.</p><p>Specifically, two node paths (a single mutational step from generalist to specialist) were allowed only if both parental nodes (SNP haplotypes) were also observed in hybrids, with fitness data. Three-node paths were allowed if hybrid fitness data was present for at least one of the parental nodes and the intervening node between the two parental nodes. Paths that were four nodes or longer were allowed only if all intervening nodes between parental nodes had associated hybrid fitness data.</p><p>We additionally calculated the number of peaks on the genotypic fitness landscape, as well as the number of accessible paths between parental nodes and these peaks, and the minimum distance from parental nodes to a peak on the landscape. We define ‘peaks’ on the genotypic fitness landscape as genotypes (SNP haplotypes) with no-fitter neighboring genotype follow the definition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferretti et al., 2018</xref>. This definition is inclusive of nodes/genotypes that are equal in fitness to their neighbors, which may be fitter than all other neighboring nodes. We conservatively excluded nodes that shared only a single neighbor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Supplementary results</title><sec id="s9-1" sec-type="appendix"><title>Population ancestry associations with fitness</title><p>When repeating our test for an association between fitness measures and ancestry proportions as estimated from a supervised ADMIXTURE analyses, we recovered similar results with one exception; generalist ancestry was significantly associated with growth rate (generalist: <italic>p</italic> = 0.021). Admixture proportions estimated from an unsupervised analysis did not significantly predict any measure of fitness when only using hybrids from the second field experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>).

However, PC1 largely explains differences among lakes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>); thus, the positive correlation between PC1 and fitness is likely explained by the previously described overall differences in survival observed between the two lakes in past experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martin and Wainwright, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Martin and Gould, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s9-2" sec-type="appendix"><title>Genomic associations recovered for composite fitness and growth, not survival</title><p>Whereas we identified 132 SNPs that were associated with composite fitness, only 58 were associated with growth and none were associated with survival. Of the SNPs associated with growth, only four remained significant using the conservative Bonferroni threshold. Across all significant sites (either via FDR or Bonferroni correction), a total of 11 were shared across analyses. The only gene proximate to a growth-associated SNP was <italic>csad</italic>. Lastly, we found a single gene shared between our study and the 125 ecological DMIs (putative genetic incompatibilities that are differentially expressed among specialists and misexpressed in F1 hybrids) presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">McGirr and Martin, 2020</xref>. This gene, associated with growth (but not composite fitness) in our study, is <italic>mettl21e</italic>.</p><p>When considering SNPs found to be associated with growth, we did not identify any gene ontologies that were significantly enriched at an FDR &lt; 0.01. However, looking at those enriched at an FDR &lt; 0.05, we do observe a number of ontologies related to biosynthetic processes, and regulation of metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Specifically, the greatest (and most significant) enrichment was for that of phosphorus and phosphate-containing compound metabolic processes and their regulation. Phosphorous deficiencies have previously been associated with poor growth in silver perch (<italic>Bidyanus bidyanus</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Yang et al., 2006</xref>) and skeletal deformaties (including vertebral compression and craniofacial deformaties) in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costa et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, blunt snout bream (<italic>Megalobrama amblycephala</italic>) exhibited greater growth rates with increasing phosphorous levels in their diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). In short, enrichment of growth-associated SNPs for ontologies pertaining to phosphorous metabolism is consistent with the substantial literature documenting that phosphorous availability and metabolism is a determinant of growth in fishes.</p></sec><sec id="s9-3" sec-type="appendix"><title>Morphological variation within sampled hybrids</title><p>As in the previous two experiments, there is a relative paucity of hybrids exhibiting the morphologies that characterize either specialist. Rather, most hybrids fall near the generalists, with a number exhibiting transgressive morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5a</xref>). As expected, both specialists exhibit reduced morphological disparity as compared to generalists, and hybrids show the greatest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5b</xref>). That is, the specialists appear more morphologically constrained than generalists, falling on average closer to the group centroid. Interestingly molluscivores exhibit the least disparity, even less so than scale-eaters.</p></sec><sec id="s9-4" sec-type="appendix"><title>Fitness-associated SNPs influence shape of the adaptive landscape</title><p>Using morphology alone, the best-fit GAM for survival, growth, and composite fitness were simpler than the model for composite fitness using both morphology and fitness-associated SNPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–tables 11–13</xref>). For survival and composite fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6a–b</xref>), this model included a thin-plate spline for LD1 and LD2, with experiment and lake included as fixed effects. The resultant landscape was also similar for these two analyses, supporting an interpretation of directional selection, favoring molluscivores. For growth, the best-fit model had the thin-plate spline for LD1 and LD2, but included an interaction term between experiment and lake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–table 12</xref>). In contrast to the previous two models, the landscape predicted using growth as our proxy of fitness supported an interpretation of directional selection in favor or hybrids most similar to generalists, and to a lesser extent, scale-eaters.</p><p>Notably, model selection using AICc invariably supported the inclusion of fitness-associated SNPs for growth and composite fitness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–tables 14–15</xref>). For growth, the best-fit model including genotypes was an improvement of 22.99 AICc over the model including morphology alone, whereas for composite fitness, the improvement was 94.527 AICc. Interestingly, the best-fit models and growth including associated SNPs was similar to that of the landscape without fitness-associated SNPs, but largely supported an interpretation of directional selection in favor of scale-eaters, and to a lesser extent generalists.</p></sec></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72905.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ebert</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02s6k3f65</institution-id><institution>University of Basel</institution></institution-wrap><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><related-object id="sa0ro1" link-type="continued-by" object-id="10.1101/2021.07.01.450666" object-id-type="id" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.07.01.450666"/></front-stub><body><p>This study reports on the inference of the evolutionary trajectory of two specialist species that evolved from one generalist species.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Molly Przeworski as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The entire paper is very specific to the system investigated and little attempts are made to reach out to other systems. The articles would gain strongly in doing so. I part the problem may be that the Results and Discussion is merged. This does not invite for a wider discussion. Separating the Results section from the discussion would work well here, or, alternatively one could suggest to have a section called &quot;Results and specific discussion&quot; and a section &quot;General discussion&quot;. Clearly the later is largely missing. The conclusion does not rescue this.</p><p>2) Data analysis: at several places the reviewers aired concerns about the analysis, both regarding the analysis itself as well as the explanation and justification of it (e.g. Admixture analysis, use of composite fitness, pooling of low and high density treatments). Details are found in the individual reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is of little interest to learn that this is the first study doing exactly this type of work. In one way or the other, every study is unique, no need to stress this in several places, starting from the title(!), abstract, significance,.. conclusion.</p><p>The section about calculating the &quot;composite fitness&quot; (= survival * growth) seems odd to me. Survival is 0 or 1, and growth is a quantitative trait. If I understand correctly, growth cannot be assessed when the fish did not survive, so fitness would be NA (because growth is NA). Better describe it: composite fitness is equal to growth, unless the fish died, then it is zero.</p><p>How was &quot;composite fitness&quot; statistically analyzed. Tables S2, S8, S11 not allow me to reconstruct this. The distribution of the composite fitness data must be strongly zero inflated, making is hard to analyze them with linear models.

There are certainly many rare alleles that are part of the standing genetic variation, but have previously not been observed. The first time they are seen, may suggest that they are novel mutations.</p><p>Expressing differences in percent is tricky and potentially open to missunderstandings (e.g. 126 % more accessible).

We include new admixture analyses, additional analyses and discussion of our composite fitness measure (as well as the two fitness measures of survival and growth and comparison of the similarities across all three), and new analyses of high and low density fitness experiments analyzed separately to address any concerns about pooling. Our conclusions remained qualitatively unchanged and in some cases our results were strengthened by these additional analyses, detailed below.</p><p>We conducted expanded analyses in response to reviewer two’s request for additional investigation of the shape of the fitness landscapes/fitness peaks. Specifically, we now quantify the number of fitness peaks, a classic measure of epistasis and fitness landscape ruggedness (Ferreti et al., 2016, Journal of Theoretical Biology). Consistent with our finding that adaptive introgression and de novo mutations increased accessibility of interspecific genotypic trajectories as compared to standing variation, we also found that landscape ruggedness was reduced. We now discuss the importance of these findings in the context of fitness landscape theory, epistasis, and their relevance the process of speciation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It is of little interest to learn that this is the first study doing exactly this type of work.

We now more adequately analyze these data to account for zero inflation (Lines 577-580). Specifically, we now model survival using a binomial model and composite fitness using a tobit model, which accounts for the zero-inflation in our composite fitness measure. Growth is modeled using a gaussian model as before when analyzing the relationship between composite fitness and admixture proportions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–tables 2–5</xref>). These tables are also more explicit with respect to model fit and the statistical distribution used to model each fitness measure. We also report the coefficient to aid in interpretation.</p><p>Note that these analyses are further expanded following suggestions from reviewer 2. We now conducted the following expanded analyses (described lines 174 – 177, 580 – 584):</p><p>1) an unsupervised admixture analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–table 2</xref>),</p><p>2) all samples using a supervised admixture analysis (i.e. model is informed a priori which samples are known to belong to either of the three assumed populations/parental species: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–table 3</xref>),</p><p>3) only samples from the second field experiment (Martin and Gould 2020) for which lake was not found to significantly affect fitness using an unsupervised analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–table 4</xref>).</p><p>Note that even with the expanded analyses, results are qualitatively the same; ancestry proportions do not strongly influence fitness in this system (lines 190-193, 1600-1605). There is one exception – generalist ancestry appears to positively predict growth when modeled using all samples and the supervised admixture analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1–table 3</xref>). The inconsistency of this result across the three analyses leads us to cautiously interpretation of this exception, however.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The assumption that mutations are de novo, when they are not known to occur otherwise in samples investigated from San Salvador Island, should be placed by a more realistic framework.
