endometrial carcinomas, However, their precise mechanism of action and the role of other transcription factors involved are not entirely clear. Using Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells, we report that E2 treatment exposes a set of progestin-dependent PR binding sites which include both E2 and progestin target genes. ChIP-seq results from hormone-treated cells revealed a non-random distribution of PAX2 binding in the vicinity of these estrogen-promoted PR sites. Altered expression of hormone regulated genes in PAX2 knockdown cells suggests a role for PAX2 in fine-tuning ERalpha and PR interplay in transcriptional regulation. Analysis of long-range interactions by Hi-C coupled with ATAC-seq data showed that these regions, that we call ‘progestin control regions’ (PgCRs), exhibited an open chromatin state even before hormone exposure and were non-randomly associated with regulated genes. Nearly 20% of genes potentially influenced by PgCRs were found to be altered during progression of endometrial cancer. Our findings suggest that endometrial response to progestins in differentiated endometrial tumor cells results in part from binding of PR together with PAX2 to accessible chromatin regions. What maintains these regions open remains to be studied.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>progesterone receptor</kwd><kwd>PAX2</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>ChIPseq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002923</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PIP 2015-682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saragüeta</surname><given-names>Patricia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006668</institution-id><institution>Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2015-3426</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saragüeta</surname><given-names>Patricia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013 grant agreement 609989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beato</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Binding of progesterone receptor and transcription factor PAX2 to pre-assembled permissive chromatin compartments regulates endometrial cancer gene expression under estrogenic conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Progesterone (Pg) is a key regulator in the female reproductive tract, including uterine and mammary gland development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lydon et al., 1995</xref>). Endometrial and breast tissues exhibit significantly different responses to hormones, resulting in very distinctive morphologies and functions. During pregnancy, Pg prepares the uterine epithelium to receive the embryo and initiates the process of differentiation of stromal cells toward their decidual phenotype. In the mammary gland and in coordination with prolactin, Pg stimulates epithelial proliferation and differentiation of alveolar lobes in the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mulac-Jericevic and Conneely, 2004</xref>). Unlike Pg, estradiol (E2) is the main proliferative signal in the uterine epithelium and exerts its function through activating estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta (ERalpha and beta, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishiwata et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kayisli et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The physiological role of Pg is mediated by the interaction and consequent activation of isoforms A (PRA) and B (PRB) of the progesterone receptor (PR), which are transcribed from alternate promoters of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hovland et al., 1998</xref>). While PRA is more abundant in stromal endometrial cells, PRB is the most representative isoform in ephitelial cells of endometrium. Steroid hormones exert their transcriptional effects through binding of the steroid receptors (SR) to specific DNA sequences in the promoters or enhancers of target genes known as ‘hormone response elements’ (HRE). Estradiol exposure triggers ER binding to estrogen response elements (ERE) regulating target genes such as <italic>PGR</italic>. Previous work showed E2-dependent upregulation of PR in many different target cells, species and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kraus and Katzenellenbogen, 1993</xref>). Exposure to progestins triggers binding of PR to PRE. Once bound to their HREs the hormone receptors interact with other transcription factors, co-regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beato et al., 1995</xref>), such as the p160 family of co-activators of steroid receptors SRC-1–3, and chromatin remodeling enzymes. This evidence favors tissue specific roles of PR isoforms and their co-regulators orientated towards differential transactivation of target genes.</p><p>High levels of PRA and PRB have been described in endometrial hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miyamoto et al., 2004</xref>) while low- and high-grade endometrial cancers reveal reduced or absent expression of one or both isoforms in epithelia or stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shao, 2013</xref>). This PR decrease is often associated with shorter progression-free survival and overal survival rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leslie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miyamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sakaguchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jongen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kreizman-Shefer et al., 2014</xref>). The absence of PR gene expression may be attributed to hypermethylation of CpG islands within the promoter or first exon regions of the PR gene or to the presence of associated deacetylated histones. These modifications were reported for endometrial cancer cell lines as well as tumor samples and may be exclusive to PRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sasaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ren et al., 2007</xref>). Treatment of such cells with DNA methyltranferase or histone deacetylase inhibitors can restore both PRB expression and its regulation of target genes such as <italic>FOXO1</italic>, p21 (<italic>CDKN1A</italic>), p27 (<italic>CDKN1B</italic>), and cyclin D1 (<italic>CCND1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Down-regulation of PR by post-transcriptional mechanisms and through post-translational modifications of PR may contribute to progesterone resistance in endometrial cancer but have not been extensively explored in the context of endometrial cancer. It is known that oncogenic activation of KRAS, PI3K, or AKT and/or loss of functional tumor suppressors such as <italic>PTEN</italic> are common genetic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hecht and Mutter, 2006</xref>), toghether with <italic>ARID1A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liang et al., 2012</xref>), all of them observed in endometrial cancer. Although there are numerous reports of hormonally regulated enhancers and super-enhancers in mammary cancer cells (see in dbsuperenahncer, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/dbsuper/">http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/dbsuper/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khan and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hnisz et al., 2015</xref>), there is a void of information about their presence in endometrial cells.</p><p>To better understand the response to progestin in endometrial cancer cells, we have studied the genomic binding of ER and PR, the global gene expression changes and the state of chromatin by ATACseq as well as the genomic interactions by Hi-C in Ishikawa cells exposed to progestin or estrogen, and also in cells exposed to progestin after a period of estradiol pretreatment. Inside TADs with progestin regulated genes, we identified regions that we named ‘progestin control regions’ (PgCRs) that correlate with the open chromatin compartment independently of hormonal stimuli and include binding sites for the partner transcription factor PAX2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ishikawa endometrial epithelial cells respond to R5020 through activation of PR, whose levels increase upon exposure to E2</title><p>Endometrial epithelial cells respond to ovarian steroid hormones -progesterone (Pg) and estradiol (E2)-, E2 being the main proliferative stimulus and Pg its antagonist.

Pretreatment with E2 significantly increased the number of R5020-dependent PRbs (prePRbs), which included most of PRbs already identified in non-pretreated Ishikawa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Table and Venn Diagram). Quantitative real-time PCR validations performed on six sites occupied by PR confirmed positioning of the receptor in both non-preE2 (non E2 pre-treatment) and preE2 conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). It also showed that E2 pretreatment augments both number of PRbs and occupancy of the receptor (signal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Contrary to PRbs in non-pretreated cells, the number of PRbs doubled between 30 and 60 min of R5020 in preE2 cells, reaching 5701 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

However, a large proportion of these PRbs was considered functionally irrelevant as indicated by the lack of nucleosome remodeling in response to hormone treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballaré et al., 2013</xref>). More recent experiments in T47D exposed to subnanomolar R5020 revealed that around 2000 PRbs are sufficient to evoke a functional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zaurin et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, the number of PRbs found in Ishikawa cells probably reflects the low concentration of PR, which is compatible with a functional response to progestins. To test this possibility we increased the levels of PR in Ishikawa cells by expressing a recombinant FLAG-PR vector. These cells, FPR Ishikawa (FPR), expressed levels of PR comparable to T47D cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>) and showed no impairment in hallmark phosphorylation of serine 294 in PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>), indicating that FPR cells were capable of responding to hormone. Upon hormone exposure, FPR cells exhibited rapid binding of PR to the <italic>EGFR</italic> enhancer sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). ChIPseq experiments after R5020 exposure showed twice the number of PRbs in FPR cells compared to parental Ishikawa cells. The majority of PRbs identified in Ishikawa cells ( &gt; 90%) were also detected in FPR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>), meaning that PR overexpression reflected mostly on an increase in number of binding sites.</p><p>Upon hormone induction, sites engaged by PR in Ishikawa cells were also occupied in FPR and pretreated cells, denoting a strong similarity between them. Although a small number of binding sites was shared between ERalpha and PR in all three conditions, PR binding in pretreated cells exhibited a higher degree of similarity to ERalpha binding than FPRbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, subtracting PRbs from FPRbs (FPR_s) and prePRbs (prePRs) heightens this difference, with a much larger fraction of binding sites shared with ERalpha in the case of prePRbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Among these sites, one located close to the promoter of <italic>TGFA</italic> gene, identified as an ERbs, showed significant PR binding only in preE2 Ishikawa cells, but not in FPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, left panel). ERE-containing ERbs, such as the ones found in the transcription termination site of <italic>PGR</italic> gene and immediately upstream of <italic>CCND2</italic> promoter, were occupied by R5020-bound PR in preE2 Ishikawa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, middle and right panels). These three genes were upregulated by E2 treatment in RNAseq experiments performed on Ishikawa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Importantly, PRbs identified in non-pretreated and E2-pretreated Ishikawa cells resembled the PR binding profile found in samples from normal proliferating and mid-secretory endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>).</p><p>The distribution of PRbs and ERbs in non-pretreated Ishikwa cells, in FPR cells and cells pretreated with E2 (prePRbs) relative to TSS of regulated genes was consistent with previous reports in oher cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballaré et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Need et al., 2015</xref>), in that they were enriched in intronic and distal intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Nearly 50% of binding sites localized to distal regions ( &gt; 50 Kb) and approximately 30% to introns other than the first intron, indicating that regulation of gene expression by the steroid receptors PR and ERalpha is not mediated through proximal promoters but mostly by distal enhancer/silencer sequences. We corroborated these results employing another strategy based on binding site-gene association using the GREAT web tool (see Materials and methods for further details <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McLean et al., 2010</xref>). First, we defined a set of genes associated to binding sites with a basal plus extension rule (extended up to 100 kb away) and then we intersected this group of genes with R5020- or E2-regulated genes. Of the 1886 genes regulated by R5020, only 224 (12%) were potentially associated to PRbs, while only 199 of the 950 genes regulated by E2 (21%) proved to be associated to ERbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A fraction of E2-induced PRbs localize on ERbs and contain half ERE motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Classification of steroid receptor binding relative to genomic features expressed as percentage (%) of peaks after 60 min of hormone treatment inside each feature.

Similar results in PAX2 localization were obtained after treating Ishikawa cells with E2 for 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The increase in nuclear PAX2 signal is not due to changes in protein levels, which were not affected by treatment with either R5020 or E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In accordance to motif analysis results, PAX2 was not detected in nuclei of T47D cells after hormonal treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To extend these findings, we performed PAX2 ChIPseq experiments on untreated cells and in cells exposed for 60 min to either R5020 or E2. The results confirmed PAX2 binding to chromatin following hormonal treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Even though identified PAXbs were few (T0: 43, R60: 202 and E60: 209), most of PAX2 binding occurred after R5020 and E2 treatments. Moreover, PAX2 binding was not stochastically distributed in the genome of Ishikawa cells but rather partially associated to ERbs and PRbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This association was stronger for PR binding in cells pre-teated with E2 than in non-pretreated cells or in cells overexpressing recombinant PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Similar results were observed for ERbs in response to E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In agreement with the coverage plots, the association between PAX2 and binding of the receptors was statistically significant (two-tailed Fisher’s exact test; p-value &lt; 0.001). On the contrary, we found no significant overlap between randomly rearranged PAXbs (shuffled PAXbs) and binding of receptors (two-tailed Fisher’s exact test; p-value &gt; 0.1). These results indicate that PAX2, and possibly other members of the PAX family may co-operate with PR and ERalpha for binding to chromatin in Ishikawa cells but not in T47D cells, in which neither enrichment for PAX binding motif nor nuclear localization of PAX2 was detected.</p><p>In line with evidence on the role of <italic>PAX2</italic> in endometrial cancer, we studied the effect of downregulating expression levels of <italic>PAX2</italic> in Ishikawa cells using a mix of specific siRNAs that produced a marked reduction of its transcript and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Consistently with results described above, pretreatment with E2 for 12 hr did not alter levels of PAX2 or interfered with its knock down. Interestingly, knock down of <italic>PAX2</italic> under estrogenic conditions led to a significant R5020-dependent increased binding of PR to regulatory regions upstream of <italic>TGFA</italic> and in <italic>TIPARP</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), which suggest that lack of PAX2 is probably exacerbating E2 stimulation on PR recruitment. No increment in PR binding was detected in the promoter of TGFA or in an unrelated genomic region (negative).</p><p>This effect did not seem to alter the expression of hormone responsive genes in a similar fashion. In the absence of E2 pretreatment, R5020-dependent expression of <italic>ALPP</italic> was abolished by PAX2 knock down, while <italic>TIPARP</italic> regulation was practically unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that <italic>TIPARP</italic>, but not <italic>ALPP</italic>, had its promoter regulatory region occupied by both PR and ERalpha upon hormone stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus suggesting that PAX2 could modulate PR binding in regions potentially co-occupied by ER alpha. This effect was corroborated under estrogenic conditions and although reduced levels of PAX2 clearly affected the gene regulatory profiles of both genes, differences were not statistically significant probably due to the variable gene expression background in Ishikawa cells and residual levels of PAX2 among replicates. As was observed in the control condition (non-target siRNA), E2-pretreatment increased <italic>ALPP</italic> transcript levels after PAX2 knock down (pretreated vs. non-pretreated cells), which were then further increased by R5020 treatment. However, as in non-pretreated cells, <italic>ALPP</italic> transcript levels were lower compared to siRNA control conditions. In the case of <italic>TIPARP</italic>, we found that in agreement with previous reports on breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rasmussen et al., 2021</xref>), expression levels were increased by E2 (pretreated vs. non-pretreated cells) and apparently by R5020 as well (treated vs. untreated conditions).

Therefore, we used in nucleo Hi-C technology to study the folding of chromatin across the genome of Ishikawa cells by generating genome-wide contact datasets of cells untreated (T0) or pretreated with E2 for 12 hr, and exposed to R5020 or E2 for 60 min. A comparison of contact matrices at 20 kb resolution of untreated Ishikawa cells to T47D cells confirmed the high degree of conservation on the borders of topologically associating domains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). TADs are grouped into two chromatin compartments A and B, which represent the active open chromatin (A) and the closed inactive chromatin (B), respectively. Analysis of such compartments showed a cell type-specific patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in which Ishikawa samples from two independent experiments were more closely related to each other than any of them to a T47D sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). However, A/B profile distribution in Ishikawa cells was independent from hormonal treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and E</xref>), meaning that chromatin was in a primed state that conditioned hormone-dependent regulation of gene expression. Detailed analysis revealed that 7% of A domains in Ishikawa cells were B in T47D cells, and 12% of B domains in Ishikawa cells were A in T47D cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). A total of 861 genes encompassed in the A compartment in Ishikawa cells belong in the B compartment in T47D cells, and 1438 genes in B compartaments in Ishikawa cells belong in A in T47D cells (12%), suggesting that distribution of A and B compartments could in part explain cell type specific gene expression profiles.</p><p>To evaluate whether chromatin states are related to gene expression through differential binding of hormone receptors to DNA, we intersected PR and ER alpha ChIPseq results with the A/B compartment coordinates. Both transcription factors, PR and ER alpha, bound A compartments more frequently than B, meaning that open genomic regions in Ishikawa showed preferential binding of the hormone receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Neither pre-treatment with E2 nor expression of recombinant PR modified the preferential binding of PR to the A compartments.</p><p>As mentioned above, PAX2 binding occurs mostly in close proximity to PR and ER alpha binding sites. In fact, distances between PAXbs and PRbs were remarkably shorter in E2 pretreated cells than in any other condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This raised the question of whether recruitment of PR together with PAX2 to open chromatin compartments facilitates regulation of gene expression. To study this notion, we defined putative endometrial regulatory domains that we named ‘Progestin Control Regions’ (PgCR) with the capacity to potentially regulate nearby genes. The restrictions for being a regulatory domain, which consisted in containing at least two PRbs separated by a maximun distance of 25 kb and a PAXbs (represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>: PgCRs Definition), were met mostly under E2 pretreated conditions. This outcome was due to the strong association between prePRbs and PAXbs, though it may have been aided by the increased PR protein levels. However, the sole increment in PR protein levels was not enough to force an association to PAXbs, given that FPR cells did not show similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>: PgCRs Definition).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Convergence of PR and PAX2 binding in TADs with regulated genes defines potential endometrial regulatory domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upper panel shows the contact matrices at a resolution of 20kb obtained by In Nucleo Hi-C in <italic>PGR</italic> and <italic>ALPP</italic> loci.

In addition, the majority of the 121 identified PgCRs (coordinates in hg38 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>) were not located near the TAD borders, but in the TAD center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J</xref>), where most non-housekeeping genes are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Dily et al., 2019</xref>).

Consistent with these results, ATACseq signal on PgCRs remained unchanged upon hormone exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, top panels). We evaluated the possibility that ATAC-seq signal on PgCRs was simply reproducing any potential region on the genome by relocating the reference regions (‘shuffled regions’) preserving their size and the chromosome they were originally in. Coverage signal was lost upon shuffling the reference regions indicating that chromatin was readily and non-randomly accessible to TFs in these locations. Although ATACseq peaks were also detected on promoters of hormone-regulated genes, the signal did not differ after hormone exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bottom panels), implying that treatments were not responsible for opening the chromatin in these regions.

These results are consistent with ATACseq profiles and imply that chromatin would be pre-assembled into regulatory loops–involving PgCRs and promoters–which are transcriptionally inactive until hormone-dependent binding of steroid receptors and PAX2 triggers PolII activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that specific binding of PR, PAX2, and ERalpha to chromatin occurs in compartments that are present in a permissive (open) or restrictive (closed) status depending on the cell line, and are not modified by short term hormone exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, it is not yet clear the role of PAX2 in PR binding to PgCRs.

There is evidence that the same TF can regulate different gene sets in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gertz et al., 2012</xref>), but the mechanisms through which hormone receptors regulate endometrial-specific gene networks had not been previously deciphered. Here, we describe ER alpha and PR binding to the genome of endometrial cancer cells and analyze their specific chromatin context. In this genomic study, we used Ishikawa cells, given that they are a good model of Type I epithelial endometrial cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nishida, 2002</xref>) containing ERalpha and PR.</p><p>It should be noted that progestin regulation of gene expression in Ishikawa cells is decidedly variable. Then, the effects of perturbations to the model (i.e. treatments, siRNA) are tested in a highly variable gene expression background. We would like to remark that the contribution of our results to the progesterone receptor binding and its interaction with their neighboring genomic regions in endometrial cancer cells is novel and more consistent than their contribution to productive gene expression. Therefore, it was relevant to our model to validate the results by contrasting them with previously publish transcriptomic and PR binding data of normal endometrium and endometrial cancer.</p><p>It was reported that in Pgr Knockout (PRKO) mice the absence of PR results in unopposed estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lydon et al., 1995</xref>). As for the two isoforms of PR, the PRB isoform is considered a strong transcriptional activator while PRA can function as a transcriptional inhibitor of PRB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mulac-Jericevic et al., 2000</xref>). Selective ablation of PRA in mice results in a PRB-dependent gain of function, with enhanced estradiol-induced endometrial proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conneely et al., 2003</xref>). Ishikawa cells express more PRB than PRA, coherent with PRB dominance in glandular epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mote et al., 1999</xref>). To explore the mechanism underlying the endometrial specific response to ovarian steroids hormones, we studied the genomic binding of ERalpha and PR by ChIPseq in hormone untreated Ishikawa cells and in cells exposed to hormone for different time periods. We discovered that the majority (67%) of PRbs after estradiol pretreatment were new sites not present in untreated cells and different as well from ERbs occupied after estradiol treatment. Just 639 PR binding sites (11% of all PRbs) were the same for both PR and ERalpha. This indicates that contrary to what was described in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohammed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Singhal et al., 2016</xref>), in endometrial cells PR binding has little influence on ERalpha binding. In Ishikawa cells, binding of ER and PR occurs mainly at ERE and PRE sequences, respectively, in regions that are also enriched in PAX response elements. Ishikawa cells are rich in PAX TF and PAX ChIPseq shows a similar overlapping with ERbs and PRbs.</p><p>When we analyzed chromatin topology of Ishikawa cells using Hi-C we found that PRbs and ERbs are enriched in Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) containing hormone-regulated genes. These TADs were predominantly part of the open (A) chromosome compartment, even in cells not exposed to hormone. This was confirmed by ATACseq results showing that the sites where the hormone receptors will bind were already accessible, suggesting that hormone-independent mechanisms were responsible for the generation and maintenance of the hormone-responsive TADs. In that respect, it is interesting that we found an enrichment of PAXbs near PRbs in these TADs containing progesterone regulated genes, suggesting that PAX2 could generate the open chromatin conformation that enables PR binding and facilitates the interacting loops detected in Hi-C experiments. Loss of PAX2 expression has been implicated in the development of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanderson et al., 2017</xref>) and PAX2 is potentially useful in the diagnostic of difficult EIN cases (e.g. where there is no ‘normal’ tissue available to act as an internal control when assessing nuclear morphology) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quick et al., 2012</xref>). The fact that PAX2 expression is reduced upon tamoxifen treatment or through neoplastic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monte et al., 2010</xref>) in which altered hormone receptor pathways are hallmark features is indicative of a central role of the estrogen receptor in its mechanism of action. In line with this notion, we propose that E2-induced ERalpha acts together with PAX2 to define key PR regulatory regions that modulate gene expression. Our results connect PR response elements with PAX2 and 3D chromatin conformation, which is consistent with the preservation of progestin regulation in differentiated cancer cells expressing hormone receptors. Undifferentiated tumor cells, which do not express hormone receptors, lose this regulatory capabilities leading to more aggressive manifestations of the malignancy. We hypothesize that PR-PAX-PR binding sites containing regulatory domains that we name PgCRs could reflect PR shadow enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cannavò et al., 2016</xref>) in endometrial cells.</p><p>The redundancy of PRbs associated to endometrial specific gene expression may reinforce a genetic mechanism to ensure progestin regulation in tissue under hormonal influence, in periods in which there is low or no circulating hormone. Notably, the only described super-enhancer in endometrial carcinomas is the Myc super-enhancer and is not hormonally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). We postulate the existence of a novel subset of 121 strategic endometrial regulatory domains in this hormonally responsive endometrial cancer cell line. Among them the <italic>TGFA</italic> gene presents one of PgCR-promoter interaction that could explain hormone regulation previously reported in this cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hata et al., 1993</xref>). This concept could be exploited to guide treatments oriented to recover progestin regulation over estrogen proliferative effects in endometrial malignancy.</p><p>Previous results in T47D mammary cancer cells have shown Hormone Control Regions, which include ERbs and PRbs acting in conjunction with FOXA1 and C/EBPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nacht et al., 2019</xref>) interact with promoters of hormone regulated genes in hormone-responsive TADs and organize the high level folding of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Dily et al., 2019</xref>). Although the analysis of interaction between PgCR and different ERalpha enriched binding regions in endometrial cells remains to be performed, our present study proposes that PR binding sites originated under estrogenic conditions and acting in conjunction with PAX2, fulfil a similar function in differentiated hormone-responsive endometrial cancer cells. Thus, combinations of the same hormone receptors and different transcription factors account for cell-type-specific expression of different gene regulatory networks in part by generating and maintaining different genome topologies.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Droog et al., 2017</xref> highlights that ‘the divergence between endometrial tumors that arise in different hormonal conditions and shows that ER alpha enhancer use in human cancer differs in the presence of nonphysiological endocrine stimuli’. They reported that ERalpha-binding sites in tamoxifen-associated endometrial tumors are different from those in the tumors from nonusers. It has yet to be explored whether the response to progesterone and sinthetic progestins, used in treatments of hormone-dependent endometrial cancers, is affected by the changes resulting from the use of tamoxifen.</p><p>On the other hand, ERalpha and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are expressed in the uterus and have differential effects on growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vahrenkamp et al., 2018</xref>). Expression of both receptors was associated with poor outcome in endometrial cancer and the simultaneous induction of ER alpha and GR leads to molecular interplay between the receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vahrenkamp et al., 2018</xref>). In our conditions, R5020 induces genes with GR/PR putative binding sites, enabling regulation that could result in a similar ERalpha-GR pathological outcome.</p><p>In the last 10 years an enormous effort has been placed in gathering massive amounts of good quality omic and clinical data from healthy women and endometrial cancer patients in different stages of this often sub-diagnosed disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dou et al., 2020</xref>). Besides the underlying mutational triggers, the mechanisms by which normal endometrial tissue progresses into aggressive and potentially lethal malignancies are being extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monsivais et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>). Employing this data, we verified that PAX2, PR and ERalpha levels are reduced in tumor samples (versus normal tissue) and they decreased even further throughout all stages of the disease. In conclusion, it is our belief that loss of PAX2 forces aberrant PR and ER alpha signaling in endometrial cells that may lead to the altered expression of both receptors and consequently PgCR-genes, facilitating the progression of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Edometrial adenocarcinoma (Epithelial) Ishikawa</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. Rochefort UnitÃ Hormones and Cancer INSERM, France</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Female</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FPR Ishikawa</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Flag-tagged PR overexpression;

ChIPseq coverage data of proliferative and secretory normal endometrium were downloaded from GEO accession GSE132712 (SuperSeries GSE132713) (Chi et al, 2020). Human endometrial cancer RNAseq samples (n=575) were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), project TCGA-UCEC. Additional normal and endometrial cancer samples (n=109) were accessed through CPTAC program in the National Cancer Institute using cptac platform installed with python (Dou et al, 2020).</p><p>The

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Carol Lange (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study is devoid of any functional data linking PAX2 to ER/PR signaling. Co-localization data is purely correlative and circumstantial. PAX2 binding enrichment near ER/PR sites over its binding at randomly selected open enhancers needs to be statistically established. Critically, the authors should demonstrate that depleting PAX2 affects ER/PR-driven gene expression or their genomic localization. As a related point, the authors should specify how they arrived at picking PAX2 is a candidate regulator among other members of the Pax family.</p><p>2) Although Ishikawa cells are a well-studied commonly used model system for endometrial cancer cells, they are a unique cell line and it is critical to establish that authors' findings are not a feature specific to Ishikawa cells. The authors need to recapitulate at least some of their observations in a different endometrial ER+/PR+ model cell lines, or human tissue organoids, or in cohorts of clinical samples. If no other models exist, the authors should acknowledge and discuss the limitations of their findings.</p><p>3) Based on the GEO dataset uploaded, there appears to be a single replicate for the ChIP-seq experiments. If so, this does not meet the minimum ENCODE requirement and cannot be analyzed or serve as basis for any conclusions. For example, many of the differential peaks (i.e. the 307 lost peaks) are likely to be false positives that result from only one replicate.</p><p>4) Many of the conclusions are based on small subsets of genes in TADs that correlate with outcome. The authors need to provide evidence that the Hi-C and genomic analyses revealed a statistically enriched gene signature of clinical and prognostic potential in endometrial cancer, rather than pick a handful of genes that happen to correlate with clinical outcome (which would likely be achieved by any random large enough starting set of genes).</p><p>Additional specific revisions:</p><p>1. Based on motif enrichment analysis, the authors claim that PR monomers could bind at 30 min and dimers at 60 min. There is no real evidence that this is the case. Unless the authors plan to pursue this functionally and show dimeric vs. monomeric binding, this statement needs to be removed.</p><p>2. Please clarify what 'shuffling the coordinates' for PgCRs means (lines 362-363)</p><p>3. On page 13, the term 'hormone-regulated' is used frequently. Please state whether you are referring to R5020 or E2.</p><p>3. In line 398, please clarify what list of genes you are referring to.</p><p>4. Some of the text is confusing. For example, the authors talk about the 'proliferative response' to R5020, which implies a proliferation in response to treatment, rather than an anti-proliferative response. Similarly, the sentence starting 'The signature of genes regulated in conjunction with loss….' is unnecessarily confusing and doesn't make obvious sense.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Some functional data linking PAX2 to the PR (and/or) ER pathway.</p><p>2. Some confidence that more than one replicate of ChIP-seq was conducted and if not, I am unwilling to support pursuing this manuscript.</p><p>3. Evidence that the Hi-C and broad genomic analysis revealed a gene signature of clinical value, rather than a handful of genes that happen to correlate with clinical outcome (which would likely be achieved any random set of genes).</p><p>I found the final part confusing and not convincing. Ultimately the key message is: 1. PR is a prognostic gene; 2. A small number of the genes from the TAD analysis correlate with outcome. This would be expected if enough genes are used as a starting point. Is there any statistical enrichment in the genes derived from the Hi-C (assuming they are also regulated in the authors RNA-seq data) that correlate with outcome in endometrial cancer? If not, then any list of genes would inevitably have a handful that correlate with outcome, but the key question is whether the Hi-C compartmentalization allows the discovery of genes that are enriched for clinical prognostic potential? If not, I'm not sure the last part adds anything to the story.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors use Ishikawa cells as a representative cell line model of PR+ endometrial cancer. Are there additional ER+/PR+ models than can be included to support their salient findings around the role of PAX2 as a required co-factor with PR or ER/PR at hormone regulated target genes? The major concern for readers centers on how we dissociate cell line differences from tissue-specific ones with the use of only one cell line to represent the tissue? Can the authors demonstrate a role for PAX2 in human tissue organoids for example? If no other models exist, the authors should discuss the limitations of their findings that are limited to a single cell line herein.</p><p>How does PAX2 expression change during endometrial cancer development and progression (i.e. in the public data)? Loss of PAX2 (i.e. early in cancer development) may explain the loss of responsiveness to progesterone or loss of protection from progesterone as an inhibitor of estrogen-induced proliferation. Furthermore, the authors should demonstrate that PAX2 is actually required for progestin-dependent regulation of known target genes in these cells by performing PAX2 knock-down or knock-out studies (and by individual target gene readouts of mRNA levels and promoter recruitment/ChIP).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The author claims that ER alpha is the predominant isoform present in Ishikawa cells (Supplementary Figure 1G). This relies on a Western blot comparing abundance of ER alpha to ER beta. However, this Western has no positive control for the ER beta antibody, and given different sensitivities of the antibodies, abundance between the two isoforms cannot really be compared in this manner. Has this been looked at previously? Is ER beta not expressed at all in this cell line?</p><p>2) There needs to be more rationale for the use of the Ishikawa cell line. As per the authors' data, there is very low PR expression in these cells, and the luciferase activity of the endogenous PR / number of PR chromatin binding sites is overall low throughout the ChIP-seq studies. The authors also state on line 262 that the hormone-dependent gene regulation is very cell type specific. Why not look at common themes across cell lines instead of looking very specifically at a cell line for which the data likely will not apply to other cell lines?</p><p>3) Figure 4 shows many other enriched TF binding motifs other than PAX family TFs. It would be useful to discuss why the authors chose to focus on PAX family/PAX2 specifically.</p><p>4) On lines 297-307, the authors state that PAX2 ChIP-seq data shows overlap with ER and PR binding sites. However, do the PAX2 binding sites specific ally correspond to new PR binding sites which appear in the presence of E2 pre-treatment?</p><p>5) Can the authors be more clear on what they mean by shuffling the coordinates for PgCRs in lines 362-363?</p><p>6) On page 13, the authors use the term &quot;hormone-regulated&quot; frequently. Please clarify this language to express whether you are referring to progestin or E2 regulated genes.</p><p>7) In lines 398, it is unclear what list of genes the authors are referring to. The data generated in this study have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO); accession number GSE139398.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Chromatin topology defines estradiol-primed Progesterone Receptor and PAX2 binding in endometrial cancer&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The statistical analysis for some of the new figure panels is lacking. Specifically, Figure 5H, 5I, Figure 5—figure supplement 2B (siRNA KD of PAX2) display error bars, and up/down changes are described in Results, however, it is not indicated which tests were used to compare the values and which of the changes are, in fact, significant.</p><p>2. Wording in the abstract describing these results could be streamlined to &quot;…. in PAX2 knockdown cells suggests a role for PAX2 in fine-tuning ERalpha and PR interplay in transcriptional regulation&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66034.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study is devoid of any functional data linking PAX2 to ER/PR signaling.

These effects were observed in both E2 pretreated and non-pretreated cells, indicating that PAX2 is involved in many aspects of PR regulatory action and its interplay with ERalpha. Results on PR binding and gene expression with or without siRNA against PAX2 have been included in new Figure 5 (line 329 of revised manuscript). The Materials and methods and discussion were also revised accordingly.</p><p>As co-localization data could be circumstantial, we evaluated the coverage signal of PR and ERalpha ChIP-seq data on a randomized set of PAX2 peaks (shuffled regions). To do so, we employed the very well-known bedtools module “bedtools shuffle” which preserves information from input file, such as peak size (range of coordinates) and chromosome. Also, we added the results from the module “bedtools fisher” in which we tested the significance of the overlap (paragraph starts in line 314 of revised manuscript).</p><p>We selected PAX2 as a candidate regulator among other members of the PAX family because there is evidence that loss of PAX2 correlates with a bad prognosis of endometrial tumors (EIN) (see Sanderson et al., 2017 in revised manuscript). Also, because there is an enrichment of PAX2 specific DNA response elements in close proximity with PR and ERalpha binding sites and is predicted to bind in genes regulated by both hormones, unlike the other detected PAX family members or TFs (Figure 4). New analyses included in the revised version of our manuscript will also demonstrate that PAX2 is not only significantly downregulated at the onset of endometrial carcinomas but it is involved in PR-ERalpha target gene regulation as well (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although Ishikawa cells are a well-studied commonly used model system for endometrial cancer cells, they are a unique cell line and it is critical to establish that authors' findings are not a feature specific to Ishikawa cells. The authors need to recapitulate at least some of their observations in a different endometrial ER+/PR+ model cell lines, or human tissue organoids, or in cohorts of clinical samples. If no other models exist, the authors should acknowledge and discuss the limitations of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers comment, there are not well established endometrial cell lines with Ishikawa characteristics, and considering that the use of a single cell line is in fact a limitation because there is a possibility that findings are an Ishikawa specific feature, we compared our transcriptomic data to normal endometrial gene expression profiles obtained from publicly available data (Chi et al., 2020). These results were included in Figure 1, in which we studied the resemblance of normal mid-secretory and proliferating endometrium with hormone-treated or not Ishikawa cells. Also, we determined that the PR binding profile of normal endometrium samples (Chi et al., 2020) was mostly reproduced by our PR ChIPseq samples, particularly in the case of E2 pretreated Ishikawa cells (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 2H). By performing these experiments, we showed that treated Ishikawa cells evince the major characteristics of cycling endometrial cells. In addition, we included analyses on publicly available transcriptomic samples from TCGA-UCEC project and CPTAC (Dou et al. 2020) to validate the relevance of our findings. These are shown in Figures 5 and 7.</p><p>The limitations of our findings have now been discussed (line 495).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Based on the GEO dataset uploaded, there appears to be a single replicate for the ChIP-seq experiments. If so, this does not meet the minimum ENCODE requirement and cannot be analyzed or serve as basis for any conclusions. For example, many of the differential peaks (i.e. the 307 lost peaks) are likely to be false positives that result from only one replicate.</p></disp-quote><p>We processed data from replicates and found similar results between them (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2). While PRbs in E2-pretreated cells and ERbs were mostly reproduced (80% and 70%, respectively), PRbs in non-pretreated cells showed 40% of common peaks. This is mainly due to the fact that one of the replicates produced a higher number of peaks above threshold during peak calling, forcing a lower percentage of common peaks. However, we have demonstrated that almost all reported PRbs were independently reproduced by PR ChIP-seq data in other conditions, namely E2-pretreated PRbs and PRbs from FPR cells (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). It is important to note that only PRbs from E2-pretreated cells and ERbs promoted the main conclusions of our manuscript. We will upload new data to GEO as soon as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Many of the conclusions are based on small subsets of genes in TADs that correlate with outcome. The authors need to provide evidence that the Hi-C and genomic analyses revealed a statistically enriched gene signature of clinical and prognostic potential in endometrial cancer, rather than pick a handful of genes that happen to correlate with clinical outcome (which would likely be achieved by any random large enough starting set of genes).</p></disp-quote><p>Using Hi-C coupled with ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data we demonstrated that PgCRs are in close contact with gene promoters, suggesting a role as potential master regulators. However, we redefined the following analyses to avoid biased conclusions. We extracted genes differentially expressed at different stages of progression from a cohort of endometrial cancer samples from TCGA-UCEC. This set included several genes from TADs with PgCRs, many more than what is expected by chance. Also, many of these genes were regulated by R5020 and/or E2 in the opposite direction (see Figure 7 in revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional specific revisions:</p><p>1.

If not, I'm not sure the last part adds anything to the story.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the key question is that the Hi-C compartmentalization allows the discovery of genes that are enriched for clinical prognostic potential. Then, we have revised the analysis in Figure 7 to avoid biased conclusions. These results are shown in new Figure 7. We found 102 genes associated with progression of endometrial cancer. Bootstrapping analysis ensures that this number of genes is higher than random sample distribution (Figure 7E). Not only mRNA encompassed in PR binding TADs could be relevant to deregulation in cancer but also other regulatory elements (like enhancers, insulators, tethers) present in the same domains to be studied in more detail. Then, the last part of the manuscript is critical to understand endometrial progesterone regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors use Ishikawa cells as a representative cell line model of PR+ endometrial cancer. Are there additional ER+/PR+ models than can be included to support their salient findings around the role of PAX2 as a required co-factor with PR or ER/PR at hormone regulated target genes? The major concern for readers centers on how we dissociate cell line differences from tissue-specific ones with the use of only one cell line to represent the tissue? Can the authors demonstrate a role for PAX2 in human tissue organoids for example? If no other models exist, the authors should discuss the limitations of their findings that are limited to a single cell line herein.</p></disp-quote><p>Please, refer to point 2 of the Essential revisions above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How does PAX2 expression change during endometrial cancer development and progression (i.e. in the public data)? Loss of PAX2 (i.e. early in cancer development) may explain the loss of responsiveness to progesterone or loss of protection from progesterone as an inhibitor of estrogen-induced proliferation. Furthermore, the authors should demonstrate that PAX2 is actually required for progestin-dependent regulation of known target genes in these cells by performing PAX2 knock-down or knock-out studies (and by individual target gene readouts of mRNA levels and promoter recruitment/ChIP).</p></disp-quote><p>In silico PAX2 expression from publicly available endometrial cancer data were analyzed (TCGA-UCEC project and CPTAC). These results are represented in Figure 5 and 7.

This relies on a Western blot comparing abundance of ER alpha to ER beta. However, this Western has no positive control for the ER beta antibody, and given different sensitivities of the antibodies, abundance between the two isoforms cannot really be compared in this manner. Has this been looked at previously? Is ER beta not expressed at all in this cell line?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer raises a valid point regarding the absence of a positive control in the experiment. However, it is important to clarify that this figure represents an end-point PCR with specific primers for each gene and not a western blot as it was argued. Moreover, both sets of primers have been previously used in publications from our laboratory (Vallejo et al., 2005) and further experiments involving ERalpha were performed with well-known antibodies that accurately discriminate the proteins. Nevertheless, we consider the Reviewer’s conceptual remark to be accurate, so we will not oppose to remove it altogether as we believe it conveys no major issue to the manuscript’s main conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There needs to be more rationale for the use of the Ishikawa cell line. As per the authors' data, there is very low PR expression in these cells, and the luciferase activity of the endogenous PR / number of PR chromatin binding sites is overall low throughout the ChIP-seq studies. The authors also state on line 262 that the hormone-dependent gene regulation is very cell type specific. Why not look at common themes across cell lines instead of looking very specifically at a cell line for which the data likely will not apply to other cell lines?</p></disp-quote><p>Please, refer to point 2 of the Essential revisions above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4 shows many other enriched TF binding motifs other than PAX family TFs. It would be useful to discuss why the authors chose to focus on PAX family/PAX2 specifically.</p></disp-quote><p>Many other TF binding motifs were enriched in progestin and estradiol regulated genes shown in Figure 4. PAX2 was selected as a candidate regulator among other members of the PAX family because PAX2 response element was the only one found overrepresented in both E2 and R5020 regulated genes and because there is evidence that loss of PAX2 correlates with a bad prognosis of endometrial tumors (EIN) (see Sanderson et al., 2017 in revised manuscript). Please, refer to point 1 of the Essential revisions above for further details on this matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) On lines 297-307, the authors state that PAX2 ChIP-seq data shows overlap with ER and PR binding sites. However, do the PAX2 binding sites specific ally correspond to new PR binding sites which appear in the presence of E2 pre-treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>Our results show that PAX2 cooperates with PR binding in the absence of pretreatment with E2 (Figure 5), though we found that it preferentially co-localizes with PRbs under estrogenic conditions. Comparison between PAX2 enrichment and PRbs in non-pretreated and pretreated cells is included in Figure 5D, E and F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the authors be more clear on what they mean by shuffling the coordinates for PgCRs in lines 362-363?</p></disp-quote><p>Please, refer to point 2 of the Additional specific revisions above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) On page 13, the authors use the term &quot;hormone-regulated&quot; frequently.

The statistical analysis for some of the new figure panels is lacking. Specifically, Figure 5H, 5I, Figure 5—figure supplement 2B (siRNA KD of PAX2) display error bars, and up/down changes are described in Results, however, it is not indicated which tests were used to compare the values and which of the changes are, in fact, significant.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical analysis has now been properly included in the figure panels as well as in legend of these figures. We performed ANOVA statistical analysis followed by Tukey’s HSD on delta Ct values in both datasets (included as Figure 5-Source data1 and 2) as they better modeled data structure (non-transformed values tend to show biased results favoring large differences). Adjusted p-values indicate significant statistical relations between conditions (multiple pairwise comparisons). Also, to improve visualization of panels in Figure 5 and Figure 5-Figure Supplement 2, we included all values in the dataset as dots (see Figure 5H and I and Figure 5—figure supplement 2B of revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
