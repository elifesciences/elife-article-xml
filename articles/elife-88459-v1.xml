The impaired creatine uptake in the brain results in intellectual disability, behavioral disorders, language delay, and seizures. In this work, we generated human brain organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells of healthy subjects and CTD patients. Brain organoids from CTD donors had reduced creatine uptake compared with those from healthy donors. The expression of neural progenitor cell markers SOX2 and PAX6 was reduced in CTD-derived organoids, while GSK3β, a key regulator of neurogenesis, was up-regulated. Shotgun proteomics combined with integrative bioinformatic and statistical analysis identified changes in the abundance of proteins associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autism. Re-establishment of the expression of a functional SLC6A8 in CTD-derived organoids restored creatine uptake and normalized the expression of SOX2, GSK3β, and other key proteins associated with clinical features of CTD patients. Our brain organoid model opens new avenues for further characterizing the CTD pathophysiology and supports the concept that reinstating creatine levels in patients with CTD could result in therapeutic efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ASPIRE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamoudi</surname><given-names>Rifat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>X-traordinaire Association and CEA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mabondzo</surname><given-names>Aloïse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteomic analysis of brain organoids from creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) patients enhance the understanding of CTD offering potential therapeutic targets and a robust foundation for continued research in the field.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CTD is a devastating neurological disorder that results in moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, and a lack of language development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cecil et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">deGrauw et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salomons et al., 2003</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>SLC6A8</italic> gene reduce or eliminate creatine transporter (CRT, SLC6A8) production and impair creatine (Cr) uptake, preventing brain Cr accumulation. Individuals with CTD may have mild generalized muscular atrophy, dysmorphic facial features, microcephaly, and gastrointestinal disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stockler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van de Kamp et al., 2014</xref>). This neglected disorder has been estimated to cause between 1–3% of all X-linked ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van de Kamp et al., 2014</xref>) and about 1% of cases with ID of unknown etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2006</xref>). Currently, there is no efficient treatment for CTD, and the affected males require lifelong familial or institutional care, representing a significant economic burden for both the individual and the society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandes-Pires and Braissant, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The lack of functional CRT in the brain represents a significant roadblock in improving the clinical outcome of CTD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohtsuki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van de Kamp et al., 2014</xref>). Several combinations of nutritional supplements or Cr precursors l-arginine and l-glycine, have been studied as therapeutic approaches for CTD, but they have shown limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bruun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valayannopoulos et al., 2013</xref>), compelling development of alternative strategies for the treatment of CTD. Mechanistic understanding of how and where Cr functions in the brain is poorly documented although would be crucial to develop efficient therapies. While several rodent models of CTD have been developed, most studies focused on the description of behavioral and cognitive deficits caused by a lack of brain Cr and have not investigated the molecular underpinnings of this disorder. In addition, while these models do appear to recapitulate the phenotype of humans with CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baroncelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duran-Trio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Skelton et al., 2011</xref>), the important translational gap between rodents and humans needs to be addressed. In the case of this disorder, human post-mortem samples may be difficult to obtain and frequently lack proper controls, thus limiting the investigation of molecular mechanisms. Thus, there is a great need for a relevant biological model to bridge the translational gap in our understanding of CTD. The generation of a comprehensive human model system, recapitulating some of the clinical features of CTD and providing translationally relevant data, would be a significant advancement in our potential to explore the molecular pathomechanism of CTD and validate treatment methodologies. The recent development of specific brain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides such a possibility.</p><p>In the present work, we have generated iPSCs from fibroblasts of three CTD patients, using previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nassor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pavoni et al., 2018</xref>). We examined the morphology, mRNA expression, and proteomic profile of the obtained brain organoids. Several pathways have been identified related to brain development that are altered in CTD-derived brain organoids. Transfecting a functional <italic>SLC6A8</italic> gene into CTD patient-derived iPSCs rescued Cr uptake and normalized much of the proteomic and other pathological features. This study establishes for the first time the use of human CTD brain organoids as a high-fidelity model for understanding the pathophysiology of this devastating disease. The use of human brain organoids from CTD patients is technically innovative and, together with the proteomic studies, provides new information on the cellular basis of cerebral Cr and the molecular mechanism underlying the onset of the CTD phenotype. Here, we also provide a database of the cell-specific alterations in CTD-related molecular pathways of translational value, relevant to treatment design.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of CTD brain organoids</title><p>To develop CTD brain organoids, we generated iPS cell lines from the fibroblasts of three CTD patients (CTD 1–4, CTD 2–3, and CTD 3–7).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>, basal Cr levels (0) were 4–8 times lower in CTD-derived iPSCs compared with control iPSCs. To confirm the reduced Cr uptake, we supplemented iPSCs with 25, 75, or 125 µM of Cr. Healthy iPSCs exhibited a dose-dependent Cr uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, the amount of Cr in CTD-derived iPSCs was similar at any concentration of Cr-supplemented media, further demonstrating the lack of a functional SLC6A8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These experiments clearly demonstrated that the CRT is necessary for Cr uptake into patient-derived iPSCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation and characterization of human creatine transporter deficiency (CTD) brain organoids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intracellular concentration of creatine in CTD iPSCs after 1 hr incubation with creatine-supplemented media.

We generated brain organoids derived from iPSCs of CTD patients. As predicted, the iPSCs and brain organoids from CTD patients were not able to transport Cr into the cells from the media. The iPSC-derived CTD brain organoids showed similar size and cell type diversity to those obtained from healthy donors, however, they showed decreased expression of neurogenesis-related markers.

The organoids derived from CTD patients show a similar composition with neural progenitor cells located in ventricle-like structures marked by SOX2 and PAX6, and immature and mature neurons marked by TBR1 and NeuN that have migrated from the ventricles. The transcription factors (SOX2 and PAX6) are critical regulators of neuronal stem cell differentiation and proliferation, ensuring the successful process of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurogenesis">neurogenesis </ext-link>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cimadamore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manuel et al., 2015</xref>).

This is in agreement with our findings in <italic>Slc6a8</italic> knockout (<italic>Slc6a8<sup>-/y</sup></italic>) mice that showed reduced mRNA expression of PSD95 and CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ullio-Gamboa et al., 2019</xref>).

Thus, our CTD brain organoid model recapitulates the altered neurogenesis seen in murine CTD models and this impaired neurogenesis may lead to the cognitive deficits in CTD. Udobi et al., showed that developmental deletion of the <italic>Slc6a8</italic> gene in mice is necessary to gain the same cognitive deficits seen in the constitutive <italic>Slc6a8<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice, providing further evidence for the importance of Cr in brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Udobi et al., 2019</xref>).

Organoids from CTD patients showed altered expression of several proteins compared with normal brain organoids. We highlighted 32 proteins with altered abundance in comparison with healthy brain organoids. Among these 32 proteins, 21 proteins have already been related to autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, neurodevelopmental disorders, and epileptic encephalopathies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). These altered, relevant protein expression patterns indicate that CTD brain organoids may appropriately reflect the molecular physiopathology of the patients. We used a stepwise regression statistical model and ENRICHR analysis to reveal that two key pathways, GSK3β and SRC, were altered in CTD brain organoids. The search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes (STRING) web tool confirmed that the two pathways were associated with the most abundant proteins involved in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p>Next, we performed a functional study on the relationship between GSK3β and neurogenesis deficit in CTD organoids. GSK3β is a constitutively active key kinase, negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>). GSK3, having a broad range of substrates, regulates a wide spectrum of cellular processes, including neurogenesis, neuronal polarization, and axon growth during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>). This regulation occurs either by direct action or through transcriptional modulations. As an example, active GSK3β directly modulates microtubule dynamics by phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rippin and Eldar-Finkelman, 2021</xref>), such as MAP1B which was highlighted in our proteomic analysis. MAP1B in turn participates in the regulation of the structure and physiology of dendritic spines in glutamatergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tortosa et al., 2011</xref>). GSK3β can also modulate gene expression by controlling the level, nuclear localization, and the DNA binding of transcription factors, thus indirectly regulating neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>). As an example, the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a substrate of GSK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>). Thus, the overactivation of GSK3β in CTD brain organoids is consistent with our observations in a CTD mouse model, where we showed that CREB was downregulated at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ullio-Gamboa et al., 2019</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that modulation of GSK3β activity can regulate neural progenitor homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dohare et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guyot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jurado-Arjona et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2009</xref>) and GSK3 is also implicated in energy homeostasis, apoptosis and autophagy, as well as in interactions with neurodegeneration-linked proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The overactivation of GSK3β in our CTD brain organoids was associated with a decreased level of neural progenitor and synaptic markers as compared to the normal organoids. We document here that this phenotype is rescued by the re-establishment of a functional SLC6A8 transporter, restoring Cr uptake in the CTD brain organoids. The introduction of a functional Cr transporter in the CTD-rescue organoids leads to a reduction of GSK3β activation, a restoration of the SOX2 progenitor marker level, as well as of the highlighted proteins linked to intellectual disabilities such as PAK1 and MAP1B. Alterations in GSK3 activity have been associated with many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rizk et al., 2021</xref>). Although, the link between creatine level and GSK3β activation needs to be further examined, modulation of GSK3β activity may represent an interesting target for the treatment of this devastating intellectual disability disease.</p><p>In summary, our iPSC-derived brain organoid model recapitulates the key features of the neurodevelopmental deficits observed in CTD patients. We examined morphological and mRNA expression alterations potentially connected to the pathology of CTD. The extensive proteomics analysis pointed out 32 proteins linked to the GSK3β and SRC cascades and 21 proteins potentially associated with the clinical features of CTD patients. Using targeted molecular methodologies, we demonstrated that the altered GSK3β pathway most likely has a significant role in the mechanisms leading to a defective neurogenesis in the CTD brain organoids. The main findings of our study in CTD brain organoids are schematically summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. We suggest that the human cellular organoid model presented here helps to understand the pathogenesis of CTD, and particularly the impact of the decreased creatine uptake into the brain on the regulation of proteins associated with the clinical features of CTD patients. Analysis of protein expression expand the knowledge about the consequences of CRT deletion and the effects of Cr replenishment, revealing new information on the molecular mechanism underlying the onset of CTD phenotype. We provide a database of the cell-specific alterations in molecular pathways of translational value relevant for treatment design. We believe that this new model of CTD patient-derived brain organoids represents an important translatable tool to examine potential treatment modalities. We generated CTD brain organoids from three families. As all patients’ mutations in this study are a deletion of one amino acid, it could be interesting to generate CTD brain organoids from cells with other types of mutations to evaluate their impact on the CTD pathophysiology.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic presentation of the main findings of the study.</title><p>The decrease in the cerebral creatine pool could favor the accumulation of the dephosphorylated form of GSK3β, making it more active. This kinase has many targets in the cell, including transcription factors whose activity it can modulate. This modulation will in turn modify the expression of genes, which can influence several cellular processes: the reorganization of microtubules with the regulation of MAP1B, synaptic function, and neurogenesis thus affecting the functionality of brain cells and consequently cognitive functions. The alteration of neurons could also be explained by a mitochondrial dysfunction due to the decrease of creatine levels and the modulation of GSK3β activity, which is known to regulate mitochondrial activity.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88459-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Derivation of patient’s fibroblasts</title><p>BJ primary fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC (CRL-2522).

Human fibroblasts from CTD patients, were obtained from skin biopsy specimens and were a gift from the Centre de Référence des Maladies Héréditaires du Métabolisme at the Necker Hospital in Paris. Three patients with cerebral creatine deficiency caused by lack of creatine transporter were studied.

The authors have provided a compelling CTD human brain organoid model using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from individuals with CTD. This model shows distinct differences in creatine uptake between organoids originating from CTD patients and their healthy counterparts. Furthermore, the researchers effectively restored creatine uptake by reintroducing the wild-type CRT in the iPSCs.</p><p>The team used advanced molecular biology techniques and sophisticated mass spectrometry to identify changes in protein regulation within these CTD brain organoids. They propose an intriguing theory linking reduced creatine uptake to abnormalities in the GSK3β kinase pathway and mitochondrial function, which might underlie intellectual disability seen in CTD patients.</p><p>This study is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear and concise explanations of the experiments. The authors present an important idea: a dysfunction in just one protein transporter (CRT) can cause significant biochemical changes in the brain. Their findings are well-presented and backed by high-quality figures and comprehensive data analysis.</p><p>There are only minor suggestions for improvement in this manuscript. The authors strongly link creatine uptake, the GSK3β pathway, and intellectual disability. Enhancing this claim with data on phosphorylation differences between organoids derived from healthy individuals and those from CTD patients could solidify this foundation and facilitate a more holistic understanding of the disease. In addition, the in vitro model based on organoids might be closer than other experimental setups; however, proving that those differences are also present in vivo would greatly benefit the story.</p><p>There is also some uncertainty around the rescue experiment using the exogenous SLC6A8 gene. Could the difference in creatine uptake between the rescue iPSCs and the healthy control be due to CRT overexpression? Higher levels of the transporter may explain the elevated levels of intracellular creatine. Thus, a comparison using Western blotting experiments could be a valuable addition to evaluating the expression levels of this protein.</p><p>Overall, this study provides valuable insights into CTD and potential therapeutic targets. It enriches our understanding of CTD and opens up new avenues for future research in this field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold></p><p>Question 1: While the CTD human brain organoids show a decrease in Cr (in absence of Cr in the culture medium) as compared to control organoids (4 times less), they are not devoid of Cr. Do these organoids express the two enzymes allowing Cr synthesis (AGAT and GAMT), and in which brain cell types? If yes, how to explain the decrease in Cr in the CTD organoids?</p></disp-quote><p>There is a lack of functional CRT in the CTD human brain organoids. The basal level of creatine in CTD human brain organoid is significantly lower than in healthy human brain organoids. The intracerebral creatine synthesis is due to different expression of the AGAT and GAMT enzymes and relies on functional CRT for the transport of the GAA intermediate. Literature pointed out that both enzymes are rarely co-expressed (Braissant et al., 2001, PMID: 11165387) meaning that GAA intermediate needs to be transported by CRT to neurons for complete creatine synthesis. Even if we evidenced a slight mRNA expression of AGAT and GAMT enzymes, the creatine synthesis is not effective since the GAA intermediate could not be transported in cell expressing GAMT due to the non-functional creatine transporter in the CTD human brain organoids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question 2. The rescue experiment, re-establishing a functional Cr transporter (CRT or SLC6A8) in the CTD human brain organoids, is very interesting, as this may help the design and development of new treatments for CTD. However, authors claim that the functional CRT expressed in the rescued CTD organoids was expressed in each cell. This may be a difficulty in the development of new CTD treatments, as CRT should be expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, but not in astrocytes. Authors may want to comment on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure S2C, the whole brain organoid in the rescue experiment shows the expression of the GFP protein, thus also the co-expressed wild-type CRT. In these experiments, we did not make a detailed cellular characterization of the rescued organoids, and this may be the aim of a separate study that will carry out experiments for an exact characterization of the cell-specific CRT expression and function in the rescued brain organoids. Accordingly, we corrected in the revised version of manuscript the statement on page 6 to the following: “SLC6A8 expressing brain organoids showed GFP fluorescence in the whole area of the organoid (Fig S2C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Authors may cite the recent review by Fernandes-Pires (2022) exposing the challenges to treat CTD (introduction, lines 57-58 for example).</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Reference has been added, lines 57-58 of the revised version</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Authors may precise in their introduction (lines 60-61) that, while creatine (Cr) supplementation is not effective to treat CTD male patients, a proportion of female CTD patients is responsive to Cr supplementation (due to the differential inactivation of one of the X chromosome depending on the cells).</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Treating CTD appears simple: transport creatine into the brain cells. In individuals with creatine synthesis disorders, increasing brain creatine levels thanks to oral supplementation of creatine monohydrate and/or precursors improves neurodevelopmental outcomes. This task has proven more daunting than expected in CTD since oral creatine supplementation does not increase brain creatine concentrations. Literature and more specially data reported by Van de Kamp “X-linked creatine transporter deficiency: clinical aspects and pathophysiology. J Inhert Metab Dis 37 (5):715-733 describes 3 females CTD patients without improvement of clinical outcomes. Bruun et al., 2018 “Treatment outcome of creatine transporter deficiency: international restrospective cohort study: Metab. Brain Dis: 33:875-884 reports 2/3 CTD females with improvement of clinical outcome. Taken together the sentence has been modified in the revised version of the manuscript as follows: “Several combinations of nutritional supplements or Cr precursors l-arginine and l-glycine, have been studied as therapeutic approaches for CTD, but they have shown limited success (Bruun et al., 2018, Valayannopoulos et al., 2013) (lines 61-63, Page 4)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>When comparing their new in vitro CTD model of human brain organoids with existing in vivo rodent models, authors may add the citation of the rat model of Duran-Trio et al (2021 &amp; 2022), in particular for its description of CNS tissue alterations (dendritic spines density for example).</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The reference Duran-Trio et al (2021) has been added (page 4, line 70). The reference Duran-Trio et al (2022) has been added (page 11) and the sentence has been modified in the revised version of the manuscript as follows: “Reduced cortical spine density and reductions in protein levels of several synaptic markers have been observed in the brains of Slc6a8-/y mice and rats (Chen et al., 2021; Duran-Trio et al., 2022)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>There are only minor suggestions for improvement in this manuscript. The authors strongly link creatine uptake, the GSK3β pathway, and intellectual disability. Enhancing this claim with data on phosphorylation differences between organoids derived from healthy individuals and those from CTD patients could solidify this foundation and facilitate a more holistic understanding of the disease. In addition, the in vitro model based on organoids might be closer than other experimental setups; however, proving that those differences are also present in vivo would greatly benefit the story.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Fig 6A-B, GSK3β is less phosphorylated on Ser9 in CTD brain organoids compared to healthy organoids, indicating that GSK3β is more active in organoids with reduced creatine levels. Studying the level of GSK3β phosphorylation in the mouse brain could be part of next experiments and another story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is also some uncertainty around the rescue experiment using the exogenous SLC6A8 gene. Could the difference in creatine uptake between the rescue iPSCs and the healthy control be due to CRT overexpression? Higher levels of the transporter may explain the elevated levels of intracellular creatine. Thus, a comparison using Western blotting experiments could be a valuable addition to evaluating the expression levels of this protein.</p></disp-quote><p>For the rescue experiment, we used a vector where SLC6A8 and eGFP were connected by an IRES2 sequence, providing simultaneous, but independent expression of the two proteins. CTD-rescue iPSC clones were selected based on high eGFP fluorescence. These clones probably have several copies of transgene in their genome, which could result in a higher abundance of SLC6A8 compared with healthy iPSCs. The difference in creatine uptake between the CTD-rescue iPSCs and the healthy control is probably due to CRT overexpression. However, there are no satisfactory anti-SLC6A8 antibodies commercially available to quantify CRT by western-blot. We would like to add that, although creatine uptake is higher in CTD-rescue iPSCs than in healthy control, the basal level of creatine (which corresponds to culture conditions for the rest of the experiments) is similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, this study provides valuable insights into CTD and potential therapeutic targets. It enriches our understanding of CTD and opens up new avenues for future research in this field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words and hope this study will be useful for other researchers in the CTD field.</p></body></sub-article></article>
