The lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) complex, consisting of seven proteins (A-G), exports LPS across the cellular envelope. LptB<sub>2</sub>FG forms an ATP-binding cassette transporter that transfers LPS to LptC. How LptB<sub>2</sub>FG couples ATP binding and hydrolysis with LPS transport to LptC remains unclear. We observed the conformational heterogeneity of LptB<sub>2</sub>FG and LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC in micelles and/or proteoliposomes using pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Additionally, we monitored LPS binding and release using laser-induced liquid bead ion desorption mass spectrometry. The β-jellyroll domain of LptF stably interacts with the LptG and LptC β-jellyrolls in both the apo and vanadate-trapped states. ATP binding at the cytoplasmic side is allosterically coupled to the selective opening of the periplasmic LptF β-jellyroll domain. In LptB<sub>2</sub>FG, ATP binding closes the nucleotide binding domains, causing a collapse of the first lateral gate as observed in structures. However, the second lateral gate, which forms the putative entry site for LPS, exhibits a heterogeneous conformation. LptC binding limits the flexibility of this gate to two conformations, likely representing the helix of LptC as either released from or inserted into the transmembrane domains. Our results reveal the regulation of the LPS entry gate through the dynamic behavior of the LptC transmembrane helix, while its β-jellyroll domain is anchored in the periplasm. This, combined with long-range ATP-dependent allosteric gating of the LptF β-jellyroll domain, may ensure efficient and unidirectional transport of LPS across the periplasm.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>molecular biophysics</kwd><kwd>biochemistry</kwd><kwd>chemical biology</kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>DEER or PELDOR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JO 1428/1−1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joseph</surname><given-names>Benesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>438280639</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joseph</surname><given-names>Benesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joseph</surname><given-names>Benesh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>426191805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgner</surname><given-names>Nina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LptC regulates the LPS entry gate in LptB<sub>2</sub>FG, likely through a dynamic behavior of its transmembrane helix, while the β-jellyroll domains are tethered in the periplasm.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibiotic resistance poses a critical threat to global health, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of bacterial defence mechanisms. The outer membrane (OM), a crucial component of Gram-negative bacteria, serves as an initial line of defence against antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nikaido, 2003</xref>). Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) constitute a major component of the OM. LPS is a glycolipid consisting of lipid A, core oligosaccharides and an O-antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Whitfield and Trent, 2014</xref>). The LPS transport (Lpt) system plays a central role in the biogenesis of OM, contributing significantly to its impermeability and resilience against environmental stress and host defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruiz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundstedt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sperandeo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2018</xref>).

Comprising of seven essential components LptA-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the system orchestrates unidirectional translocation of LPS from the inner membrane (IM) to the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundstedt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Törk et al., 2023</xref>).

The LptB subunits constitute the nucleotide-binding domains (NBD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) and interact in a head-to-tail manner to create two nucleotide binding sites (NBSs, for ATP or ADP).

Upon vanadate trapping, the NBDs dimerize causing a collapse of the LPS binding pocket, which has been suggested as a post-translocation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Presence of LptC enlarged the cavity leading to a weaker interaction with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1 A-B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In this conformation, the transmembrane (TM) helix of LptC weakly interacts with LptG, but forms extensive hydrophobic interactions with TM5 of LptF. The periplasmic β-jellyroll domains of LptF and LptG are very flexible leading to a reduced resolution. LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC structures in the AMP-PNP or vanadate-trapped state did not reveal the transmembrane helix of LptC (TM-LptC), thereby revealing a nearly identical conformation of NBDs and TMDs as with the LptB<sub>2</sub>FG structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Also, the β-jellyroll domains were barely resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1 C-D</xref>).</p><p>It was proposed that upon ATP binding, TM-LptC moves away from the LptG-TM1 – LptF-TM5 interface. This would lead to a collapse of the binding pocket and expulsion of LPS to the β-jellyroll domain of LptF. However, several details of this mechanism such as when and how TM-LptC dissociates and in what way that is transmitted to the interaction and dynamics of the β-jellyroll domains remain poorly understood. Likely, many intermediate states might exist between ATP binding and LPS translocation and the relevance of the available structures in a native-like lipid environment is unknown. Altogether, an integrated characterization of the intermediate structures and underlying dynamics is required to elucidate the functional mechanism. Here we characterized the conformational heterogeneity of LptB<sub>2</sub>FG and LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC using extensive pulsed dipolar electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy experiments, which permits observations in micelles, lipid bilayers or even in the native environments for certain cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galazzo and Bordignon, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yardeni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gopinath et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ketter et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gopinath and Joseph, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kugele et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galazzo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bountra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kapsalis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Ishay et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pierro et al., 2023</xref>).

This distance decreased below 4 nm in the vanadate-trapped state. With ATP a mixed population was observed with the major peak corresponding to the closed conformation. Thus, Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are not necessary for the closure of the NBDs. With ADP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> the NBDs do not close, though the overall flexibility is somewhat increased (as gauged from the width of the distribution). We performed additional experiments after reconstitution into PLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). Overall, the data in the apo-state revealed a similar mean distance, yet with a larger width suggesting an increased dynamics. As observed in micelles, vanadate-trapping closed the NBDs in PLS as well. Overall, the nucleotide-induced closure as observed in micelles (and the structures) is maintained in the native-like lipid bilayers for the NBDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Conformational heterogeneity of the lateral gate-1 of LptB<sub>2</sub>FG in micelles and PLS</title><p>We introduced two spin pairs to independently monitor the lateral gates of the TMDs. The lateral gate formed by LptF-TM1 – LptG-TM5 and LptG-TM1 – LptF-TM5 were monitored using F_A45R1 – G-I325R1 and F_L325R1 – G-A52R1 pairs, respectively. For the apo-state in micelles, the distances for the lateral gate-1 are similar to the corresponding simulation on the LPS-bound structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Vanadate-trapping resulted in an increase of the distances in agreement with the simulation. Though the central cavity collapses, this increased distance results from a coordinated movement of LptF-TM1 towards the cavity accompanied with an outward shift of LptG-TM5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Addition of ATP resulted in an equilibrium between the two conformations. Altogether, the PELDOR data validate a LPS binding competent conformation in the apo- and ADP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> states accompanied with a collapse of the gate in the ATP and vanadate-trapped post-hydrolytic state. Interestingly, for the apo state in PLS, this gate exhibited a broader distribution spanning the range corresponding to both structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). In the vanadate-trapped state the overall distribution got narrowed (the minor peak at a longer distance is not interpreted due to a larger uncertainty). However, the overall spread of the distribution remained similar, suggesting a more flexible conformation of this gate in PLS, which is minimally affected by ATP binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The putative lateral gate-2 for LPS entry exhibits a large conformational heterogeneity</title><p>Interestingly, the lateral gate-2 between LptG-TM1 – LptF-TM5 revealed a more dynamic behavior in micelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). In the apo state, it has a broad conformational distribution spanning the LPS bound (open) and vanadate-trapped (closed) structures (corresponding simulations are shown in orange lines). In the vanadate-trapped and ATP samples, the major population is centred at 2 nm (which is closer to the simulation on the vanadate-trapped structure). The decreased interspin distances arise from a collapse of the cavity upon vanadate-trapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). ADP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> also gave a broad distribution comparable to the apo-state. Thus, in the apo-state this gate appears to exist in an equilibrium between the two conformations as observed from the corresponding structures. ATP binding or vanadate-trapping shifts the equilibrium towards the collapsed conformation. In PLS as well, the apo state revealed a broad distribution validating the heterogeneity in the membrane environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). Vanadate-trapping somewhat narrowed the distribution with (only) a fraction of the distances overlaying with the simulation for the corresponding structure (and with a more pronounced heterogeneity as compared with the micellar sample, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Position A52 on LptG is located at the beginning of the neighboring TM2. Position L325 is located on the short loop between TM5 and TM6 in LptF. This loop is resolved with clear density and has a similar orientation in the apo and vanadate-trapped structures with minimum deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further, the observed heterogeneity is distinctly modulated upon LptC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>), suggesting that the internal flexibility around the labeled sites might have the least contribution to the broad distribution we experimentally observed. Confirming these observations, the room temperature continuous wave ESR spectra revealed the least flexibility for this spin pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Comparing this heterogeneity from the PELDOR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) with the corresponding simulations (in orange, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>), it appears that the structures captured two of the states from the broad conformational space. This gate is suggested to be the entry point for LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owens et al., 2019</xref>) and the enhanced dynamics we observed might be required for efficient interaction with LPS and LptC (please see later sections). Supporting these observations, LptG-TM1 and LptF-TM5 helices interact rather weak in the structures, in particular in the LPS-bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conformational dynamics of the β-jellyroll domains</title><p>We further investigated the interaction between the β-jellyroll domains in LptB<sub>2</sub>FG. Distances between positions F_S186R1 and G_V209R1 located on these domains revealed a major peak in agreement with simulation on the LPS-bound structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>) and a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cina and Klug, 2024</xref>). The overall spread of the distribution remained rather similar in the vanadate-trapped state revealing a stable interaction. We also probed the internal flexibility of LptF β-jellyroll using F_S156R1– I234R1 and F_S186R1 – I234R1 pairs, which are located on the putative entry gate loops for LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and E–F</xref>). The LptF β-jellyroll in the apo-state showed a broad distribution, but with a major population staying in the closed conformation as observed in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Interestingly, in the vanadate-trapped state, the overall distribution shifted towards longer distances revealing an opening of the LPS entry gate. Altogether, these observations reveal a long-range allosteric coupling between nucleotide binding at the NBDs in the cytoplasm and opening of the LPS entry gate of LptF β-jellyroll in the periplasm. Such a tight coupling might prime this domain to receive LPS once it is released from the cavity inside the TMDs. A strikingly different response was observed for the β-jellyroll domain of LptG. The equivalent spin pairs G_V209R1 – G_L234R1 and G_L152R1 – V209R1 revealed a considerably enhanced flexibility independent of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and G–H</xref>) and revealing no such allosteric coupling with the NBDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conformational heterogeneity of the the β-jellyroll domains and lateral gates in LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC</title><p>Next, we investigated how LptC modulates dynamics of the lateral gates and the β-jellyroll domains in LptB<sub>2</sub>FG. Measurements between the β-jellyroll domains of LptF and LptC (F_L219R1 – C_T104R1) revealed a narrow distance distribution and hence a stable interaction between them in both apo and vanadate-trapped states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). At the lateral gate-1 (F_A45R1 – G_I335R1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G–H</xref>), the distance in the apo state is similar to the simulation on the structure. In the vanadate trapped state, the spread of the distance distribution is increased, spanning the range of the simulations corresponding to both apo and vanadate-trapped structures (in the latter structure, TM-LptC is absent at the gate leading to a collapse of the cavity and an identical conformation with LptB<sub>2</sub>FG, though the distances increase due to an outward movement of LptG-TM5, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Distances corresponding to the apo state are present possibly due to an incomplete vanadate-trapping (or an equilibrium between the two conformations, which is rather unlikely) for this sample. Overall, the results support TM-LptC dissociation in the vanadate-trapped state as observed in the structure.</p><p>A distinct response is observed for the lateral gate-2 (F_L325R1 – G_A52R1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D–E</xref>). LptC binding reduced the overall flexibility of this gate into two defined distance peaks as compared to LptB<sub>2</sub>FG alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). LptC binding is shown to increase the separation between these helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The major distance peak (centred around 2 nm) is shorter than the simulation on the LptB<sub>2</sub>FG apo structure (in magenta, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, top panel), which therefore likely represents a conformation in which TM-LptC is released. The second peak corresponds to a larger separation between these helices, possibly representing the structure having the TM-LptC inserted at the gate (as position L325 is not resolved in the <italic>E. coli</italic> structure, corresponding simulation is not presented). The first conformation appears to be more favored under the experimental conditions. In the vanadate-trapped state, the second peak disappeared and the overall distribution centred towards the TM-LptC released (LptB<sub>2</sub>FG) conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This is in line with the lack of density for TM-LptC in the vanadate-trapped LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC structure. The experimental distribution is longer than the corresponding simulation (orange line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting a somewhat farther separation between these helices.</p><p>We further probed LPS release in LptB<sub>2</sub>FG using LILBID-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>). In the apo and vanadate-trapped states, the majority of the observed complex peaks represent LPS bound to LptB<sub>2</sub>FG, while some LPS-free LptB<sub>2</sub>FG can as well be seen (indicated in grey and red shades, respectively for both 1- and 2- charge states). Thus, LPS is co-purified with LptB<sub>2</sub>FG in micelles. Presence of LPS-bound LptB<sub>2</sub>FG in the vanadate-trapped state is not unexpected as the PELDOR data revealed a heterogenous conformation for the LPS entry gate other than the collapsed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and G</xref>). However, under the hydrolysing conditions, LPS is completely released from LptB<sub>2</sub>FG.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>LPS transport by LptB<sub>2</sub>FG has remained elusive for many reasons. LptB<sub>2</sub>FG and LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC structures revealed a similar structure in the vanadate-trapped state leaving no trace for TM-LptC and the β-jellyroll domains were not resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Available structures possess either AMP-PNP or ADP-VO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> as nucleotides (both in a closed conformation of the TMDs and NBDs), thereby limiting details on how ATP binding and hydrolysis are coupled to the conformational changes and LPS transport.</p><p>For the NBDs and the two lateral gates of LptB<sub>2</sub>FG, PELDOR data validated the conformational changes in micelles as observed from the structures. Upon ATP binding and/or vanadate-trapping, the NBDs and the two lateral gates moved in a coordinated manner to collapse the LPS binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). However, the lateral gate-2 forming the LPS entry site (TM1G -TM5F monitored by F_L325 – G_A52, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) exhibits a flexible conformation, which might facilitate interaction with LPS and or LptC. In agreement, LptC binding restricted the overall flexibility of this gate into two distinct conformations corresponding to a collapsed and an open conformation in which TM-LptC is likely inserted into the TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The minor peak at longer distances might corresponds to a conformation in which TM-LptC and LPS can enter the TMDs while the β-jellyroll domains of LptC and LptF interact. The minimal interaction between the corresponding helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) in the LptB<sub>2</sub>FG structures suggest that the flexibility is inbuilt and might have an important role for the function. The PLS environment modulates the observed conformation in LptB<sub>2</sub>FG. The lateral gate-1 has a broader distribution in PLS, which is minimally affected by vanadate-trapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). Also, the heterogeneity for the lateral gate-2 is more pronounced in PLS. The liposomes are made from <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid extract. In the polar lipid extract, phosphatidylethanolamine is the predominant lipid component with minor amounts of phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Thus, the differences in the heterogeneity we observed in proteoliposomes might not be due to the presence of LPS. Overall, the observations in PLS are qualitatively similar to the micellar sample (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for the continuous wave (cw) ESR spectra) and further experiments are required to clarify how the membrane would influence LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC conformation.</p><p>In LptB<sub>2</sub>FG, the two β-jellyroll domains stably interact in the apo and vanadate-trapped conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, binding of nucleotides is allosterically coupled to a selective opening of LptF β-jellyroll with little effect on the LptG β-jellyroll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). This opening was shown to be essential for cell growth and it was suggested that movement of LPS, but not ATP binding or hydrolysis pushes the gate open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owens et al., 2019</xref>). However, our results confirm that the gate opening is allosterically regulated through ATP binding and/or hydrolysis. This β-jellyroll start from TM3 and ends on TM4. TM3 is connected to the coupling helix and TM4 is connected to the cytoplasmic loop-2, which harbours the conserved R292 directly interacting with the nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2019</xref>). It is likely that one or both of these motifs are involved in the allosteric communication. Notably, the LptG β-jellyroll domain exhibits significant internal flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G-H</xref>). Biochemical studies showed that conserved residues in this domain are essential for cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2019</xref>). Although there is little evidence for a direct role of this domain in LPS binding, the observed dynamics might be important for efficient transport. Similarly, in LptB<sub>2</sub>FG-C, the β-jellyrolls of LptC and LptF interact both in both apo and vanadate-trapped states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>), which altogether might form a continuous pathway for LPS transfer towards LptA. The β-jellyrolls were not fully resolved in the vanadate-trapped structure of LptB<sub>2</sub>FG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2019</xref>), revealing a considerable flexibility. The exact role for this enhanced dynamics is unclear and it may somehow facilitate LPS release. The narrow distance distributions we observed reveal that these domains might move as rigid bodies while sampling a broad conformational space.</p><p>The LILBID-MS data show that LPS is released upon ATP hydrolysis by LptB<sub>2</sub>FG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> steps 1–2). Thus, LptC is required for a productive transport cycle in the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sherman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falchi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilson and Ruiz, 2022</xref>). Our observations suggest that the TM-LptC dynamically associates and dissociates at the lateral gate-2, even in the apo-state while its β-jellyroll domain is firmly bound to LptF β-jellyroll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 3). Such a dynamic behavior of TM-LptC has previously been suggested based on the <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC structure, which showed density for the short N-terminus segment of TM-LptC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). Vanadate trapping induces the TM-LptC released conformation of the lateral gates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E and G–H</xref>), in agreement with the structures, which also leads to LPS release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owens et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, ATP binding/hydrolysis might be coupled to the collapse of the TMDs and expulsion of LPS. Inferring from our observations on LptB<sub>2</sub>FG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), ATP binding might allosterically open the LptF β-jellyroll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 4), which might subsequently close after passing LPS to the LptC β-jellyroll to prevent any backflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 5). Through repeating this cycle, LptB<sub>2</sub>FG might push LPS along the trans-periplasmic bridge in a unidirectional manner according to the Pez candy dispenser model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okuda et al., 2016</xref>). The possibility to observe LptB<sub>2</sub>FG and LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC offers further opportunity to characterize the dynamics of the β-jellyroll domains, LptB<sub>2</sub>FG – TM-LptC interaction as well as other intermediate states of the transport cycle even in the native-like lipid bilayers. These experiments, which are beyond the current scope of the study are in progress in our laboratory. As the persistently interacting, yet dynamic LptB<sub>2</sub>FGC complex forms the functional LPS transport unit in the inner membrane, a detailed understanding of its dynamics would facilitate development of novel drugs against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>LPS translocation mechanism.</title><p>(1-2) The lateral gate-2 formed by LptG-TM1 and LptF-TM5 in LptB<sub>2</sub>FG, which is dynamic in the apo state (2) is shown (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). ATP binding, which leads to hydrolysis (1) collapses the cavity and releases LPS. (3,4) Interaction with LptC limits heterogeneity, creating an equilibrium between TM-LptC inserted and released conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). ATP binding opens the periplasmic gate in LptF β-jellyroll (4) and subsequent closure of the NBDs leads to the collapse of the cavity and LPS transfer. As LPS moves to LptC, LptF β-jellyroll might close accompanied with an opening of LptC β-jellyroll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2019</xref>) (5). Dissociation of ADP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> will initiate the next cycle according to the Pez mechanism.

The LPS export mechanism is a potential target for new antibiotics. Inhibiting this process can render bacteria more susceptible to the host immune system or other antibacterial agents. Given the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, novel targets are urgently needed. The seven LPS transport (Lpt) proteins, A-G, move LPS from the inner to the outer membrane. This study investigated the conformational changes in the LptB2FG-LptC complex using site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, revealing how ATP binding and hydrolysis affect the LptF β-jellyroll domain and lateral gates.

The proteoliposome study is crucial since the previous structural study (Li, Orlando &amp; Liao 2019) was done in rather small-diameter nanodiscs, which might affect the overall dynamics of the complex.

In the current study, ATPase activity in proteoliposomes is not provided. Also, the reviewer assumes cysteine-less (CL) constructs of the complex components were utilized. The ATPase assay on CL complex is not presented. Additionally, from previous structural studies and the mass spectrometry data presented here, LPS co-purifies and is already bound to the complex, thus the Apo state may represent the LPS-bound state without nucleotides.</p></disp-quote><p>The liposomes are made from <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid extract, which we added to the Materials and Methods part now. We could not yet perform the investigations in nanodiscs, which is one of our aims for future. The ATPase activity is lower in micelles and the reviewer is correct in that we did not perform/compare ATPase activity in proteoliposomes. The data denoted as wild-type (WT, Figure S4) corresponds to the cysteine-less (CL) variant, which is now corrected in the supporting information. As the reviewer commented, the mass spectrometry data reveal bound LPS in the apo-state. However, as seen from our results, ADP-Mg2+ state is similar to the apo state, thus in the cellular environment LPS may bind to this state as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The selection of sites to probe lateral gate 2, which forms the main LPS entry site, may pose an issue. Although the authors provide justification based on the available structures, one site (position 325 in LptF) is located on a flexible loop, and position 52 in LptG is on the neighboring transmembrane helix, separated by a potentially flexible loop from the gating TM1. These labeling sites could exhibit significant local dynamics, resulting in a broader distribution of distances and potentially masking the gating-related conformational changes.</p></disp-quote><p>Position 52 in LptG is located at the beginning of the neighboring transmembrane helix. As we have discussed in the manuscript, position 325 in LptF is located on a short loop connected to TM5. In the structures, this loop shows a very similar orientation (Figure S6). Further, the observed heterogeneity for the lateral gate-2 is considerably modulated into distinct conformation(s) upon LptC binding (Figure 6D-E). This would not be the case if this loop possesses any independent flexibility. Confirming these observations, the room temperature continuous wave ESR spectra revealed the least flexibility for this spin pair (Figure S5, S7). In view of the reasons and observations detailed above, we conclude that the local flexibility at the labelled sites might not make any significant contribution for the broad distribution observed at this gate in LptB2FG (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Dajka and co-workers reports the application of a biophysical approach to analyse the dynamics of the LptB2FG-C ABC transporter, involved in LPS transport across the cell envelope in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.

It has been reported that the association of LptC to LptB2FG complex inhibits its ATPase activity. However, in the ATPase assay data shown in Figure S4, the inhibitory effect of the LptC TM is not visible (please compare LptB2FG F-A45C G-I335C and F-L325C G-A52C with and without LptC). This can lead to suspect that the regulatory function of LptC is missing in the LptC-containing complexes used in this work. I suggest the authors include wt LptB2FGC in the assay to compare the ATPase activity of this complex with wt LptB2FG. The published inhibitory effect of TM LptC has been observed in proteoliposomes. Since it is not clear from the paper if the ATPase assay in Figure 4 has been conducted in DDM or proteoliposomes, the lack of inhibitory effect could be due to the assay conditions. A comparative test could answer this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not observe the inhibitory effect of LptC on the ATPase activity of LptB2FG. As the reviewer pointed out, the primary reason is that we performed the assays in detergent micelles and not in proteoliposomes. For this reason, a comparison of the activity between (cysteine-less) LptB2FG and LptB2FG-C as the reviewer suggested would not be informative. As this information is not directly relevant for our current interpretations, we plan to perform those experiments in liposomes in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 2: NBD closure upon ATP binding to LptB2FG is convincingly demonstrated both in DDM micelles and proteoliposomes, validating the experimental system. However, since under physiological conditions, ATP binding should take place before the displacement of the TM of LptC (Wilson and Ruiz, Mol microbiol 2022), I suggest the authors carry out the experiments with LptC-containing complexes to investigate conformational changes (if any) that are triggered when ATP binding occurs before the TM displacement.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. These experiments are in our to do list and would be performed in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Proteoliposomes: in the experiments shown in Figures 3 and 4, unlike those in Figure 2, measurements in proteoliposomes give different results from the experiments in DDM, showing higher heterogeneity. Could this be related to the presence (or absence) of LPS in liposomes? It is not mentioned in the materials and methods section whether LPS is present. Could the authors please discuss this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing out this interesting point. The liposomes are made from <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid extract. In the polar lipid extract, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is the predominant lipid component with minor amounts of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin. Thus, the differences in the heterogeneity we observed in proteoliposomes might not be due to the presence of LPS. We added a short description on this aspect in the ‘Discussion’ part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors show large conformational heterogeneity in gate-2 (using the spin-labelled pair F-L325R1-G-A52R1) and suggest that deviation from the corresponding simulations could be due to the need for enhanced dynamics to allow for gate interaction with LPS or LptC. The effect of LptC is probed in the experiments shown in Figure 6, but I suggest the authors add LPS to the complexes to evaluate the possible stabilizing effect of LPS on the conformations shown in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>This indeed is an important experiment, which we plan to do in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 6: the measurement of lateral gate 1 and 2 dynamics in the LptC-containing complexes clearly supports the hypothesis, proposed based on the available structures, that TM LptC dissociates from LptB2FG upon ATP binding. However, direct evidence of this movement is still missing. Would it be possible to monitor the dynamics of the TM LptC by directly labelling this protein domain? This would give a conclusive demonstration of the displacement during the ATPase cycle.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it should be possible to label LptC and monitor its position with respect to LptF or LptG. These experiments are in progress in our laboratory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) LPS release assay: Figure 6 panels H-I-J show the MS spectra relative to LPS-bound and free proteins obtained from wt LptB2FG upon ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis conditions. From these spectra the authors conclude that LPS is completely released only upon ATP hydrolysis. However, the current model predicts that LPS release into the Lpt bridge made by LptC-A-D is triggered by ATP binding. For this reason, I suggest the authors assess LPS release also from the LptB2FGC complex where, in the absence of LptA, LPS would be expected to be mostly retained by the complex under the same conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>These indeed are exciting experiments. LPS binding and release by LptB2FGC is in progress in our laboratories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Page 2 typo: apo-sate should be apo-state</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you! We corrected the typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors clarify whether LPS is co-purified with the protein? Does it remain bound throughout the liposome reconstitution process?</p></disp-quote><p>Our mass spectrometry data show that LPS is co-purified with LptB2FG in micelles. However, we cannot yet verify the presence of bound LPS after reconstitution into proteoliposomes. We added a sentence in the last paragraph before Discussion as ‘Thus, LPS is co-purified with LptB2FG in micelles.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>Several points require clarification:</p><p>(1) The reviewer would have benefited from access to the raw DEER traces. For instance, in Figure 4, the change in the raw data appears subtle. The differences between the Apo and vanadate-trapped states in b-DDM might be related to a lower signal-to-noise ratio in the Apo state.</p></disp-quote><p>We would be happy to share the raw DEER data upon request. The analysis is performed with the primary data, which also takes into account of the noise level for the calculating the confidence interval. Therefore, the distances with the 95% confidence interval are reliable to the extent as they are presented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The panel labels in Figures 2-4 do not match the legends.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you! We corrected them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 2G, the authors state, &quot;Overall, the ATP-induced closure as observed in micelles (and the structures) is maintained in the native-like lipid bilayers for the NBDs.&quot; This statement is technically incorrect since the vanadate-trapped state is not equivalent to the ATP+EDTA &quot;ATP binding&quot; state, which was not tested in proteoliposomes (PLS). The authors should have tested this condition for a few mutants in proteoliposomes. They should revise the manuscript to reflect this or provide evidence that the ATP+EDTA state is similar to the vanadate-trapped state in PLS.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected the sentence as ‘Overall, the nucleotide-induced closure as observed in micelles (and the structures) is maintained in the native-like lipid bilayers for the NBDs.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The mutant F-L325R1_G-A52R1 is not optimal for probing gate 2. Specifically, position 325 in LptF is highly flexible, as indicated by the very broad distance distributions in Figure 4, and may hinder probing the associated conformational changes in this gate. Comparing the cryo-EM structures of this loop under different conditions (Figure S6) does not provide solid evidence for the lack of flexibility.</p></disp-quote><p>Position 52 in LptG is located at the beginning of the neighboring transmembrane helix. As we have discussed in the manuscript, position 325 in LptF is located on a short loop connected to TM5. In the structures, this loop shows a very similar orientation (Figure S6). Further, the observed heterogeneity for the lateral gate-2 is considerably modulated into distinct conformation(s) upon LptC binding (Figure 6D-E). This would not be the case if this loop possesses any independent flexibility. Confirming these observations, the room temperature continuous wave ESR spectra revealed the least flexibility for this spin pair (Figure S5, S7). In view of the reasons and observations detailed above, we conclude that the local flexibility of the labelled sites might not make any significant contribution for the broad distribution observed at this gate in LptB2FG (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Regarding Figure 4B, the authors state, &quot;In the vanadate-trapped and ATP samples, the major population is centered at 2 nm (which corresponds to the simulation on the vanadate trapped structure)&quot;. While the shift to shorter distances aligns with the structures, the average distance from the simulation is around 3 nm and does not correspond closely to the DEER distances of 2 nm.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this point. We corrected the sentence as ‘In the vanadate-trapped and ATP samples, the major population is centred at 2 nm (which is closer to the simulation on the vanadate-trapped structure).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Regarding Figure 4D, the authors state, &quot;Unlike the lateral gate-1 (and the NBDs), ADP-Mg2+ also induced a similar shift in the distance distribution.&quot; The reviewer believes that even without interaction with LptC, an equilibrium exists between two states in gate-2, and ATP binding or vanadate-trapping shifts the equilibrium to a shorter-distance population. Additionally, if the signal-to-noise ratio of the Apo state were similar to that of the ADP-Mg2+ state, similar distance distributions would have been observed for the Apo state.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing out this excellent point. We thoroughly modified the corresponding section as ‘ADP-Mg2+ also gave a broad distribution comparable to the apo-state. Thus, in the apo-state this gate appears to exist in an equilibrium between the two conformations observed from the corresponding structures. ATP binding or vanadate-trapping shifts the equilibrium towards the collapsed conformation.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Defining the conformational dynamics of the b-jellyroll domains is one of the major strengths of this study. The LptF and LptG b-jellyroll domains exhibit high flexibility in detergent micelles. Unfortunately, none of the experiments were repeated in proteoliposomes to determine if this flexibility persists in a lipid environment.</p></disp-quote><p>As it is conceivable, it is truly beyond the scope of the current study to repeat all the measurements in liposomes. Currently we are extending those investigations to liposomes and would be able to provide more insights in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Regarding Figure 6G, the authors claim, &quot;Distances corresponding to the apo state are present possibly due to an incomplete vanadate trapping for this sample.&quot; It is unlikely that vanadate trapping would be incomplete for just one sample. A repeat experiment is recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>We will update on this point is due time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Regarding the structural dynamics of the lateral gates, detergent micelles, and liposomes are vastly different environments. It is challenging to reach a consensus model based on data mostly derived from detergent micelles and only a few from proteoliposomes.</p></disp-quote><p>The observations in PLS are qualitatively similar to the micellar sample for the investigated positions (please see the first paragraph in “Discussion”).
