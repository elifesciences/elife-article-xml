The retinoic acid receptor gamma agonist, palovarotene, and antibody-mediated activin A blockade have entered human clinical trials, but how these therapeutic modalities affect the behavior of pathogenic fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) is unclear. Using live-animal luminescence imaging, we show that transplanted pathogenic FAPs undergo rapid initial expansion, with peak number strongly correlating with HO severity. Palovarotene significantly reduced expansion of pathogenic FAPs, but was less effective than activin A inhibition, which restored wild-type population growth dynamics to FAPs. Palovarotene pretreatment did not reduce FAPs’ skeletogenic potential, indicating that efficacy requires chronic administration. Although palovarotene inhibited chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and reduced HO in juvenile FOP mice, daily dosing resulted in aggressive synovial joint overgrowth and long bone growth plate ablation. These results highlight the challenge of inhibiting pathological bone formation prior to skeletal maturation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</kwd><kwd>palovarotene</kwd><kwd>fibro/adipogenic progenitor</kwd><kwd>heterotopic ossification</kwd><kwd>activin A</kwd><kwd>ACVR1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR057371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldhamer</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Clementia Pharmaceuticals</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sponsored Research Agreement</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldhamer</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Clementia Pharmaceuticals collaborated on study design and interpretation of data related to palovarotene effects on heterotopic ossification.

In FOP, heterotopic ossification (HO) results from dysregulated signaling through the type one bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor ACVR1 (ALK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shore et al., 2006</xref>). Whereas several <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations have been identified in FOP patients, the most prevalent is a point mutation that results in an arginine to histidine substitution at position 206 of the ACVR1 receptor [ACVR1(R206H)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shore et al., 2006</xref>). This amino acid change, which is within the cytoplasmic glycine-serine domain, upstream of the serine/threonine kinase domain, renders the receptor hyperactive to BMP ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Billings et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haupt et al., 2018</xref>) and confers novel responsiveness to activin ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hino et al., 2015</xref>). With an appropriate physiological trigger, this altered signaling inappropriately activates the osteogenic program in tissue-resident progenitors, ultimately leading to endochondral HO. Although muscle injury and inflammation are strong triggers for ‘flares’ leading to HO, HO lesions often develop without a known trigger (commonly referred to as spontaneous HO). Progressive episodes of spontaneous HO generally begin in early childhood and increase in frequency and severity during childhood and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pignolo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pignolo et al., 2016</xref>). In individuals with FOP, significant HO-related disability occurs prior to skeletal maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pignolo et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, it is important for FOP therapeutics to exhibit an acceptable safety profile in juvenile patients.</p><p>To facilitate drug discovery efforts and to investigate the cellular and physiological basis of FOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lees-Shepard and Goldhamer, 2018</xref>), we and others have recently developed conditional mouse genetic models of FOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>), which circumvent the perinatal lethality of constitutive <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>). Using FOP mice, we identified fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), PDGFRα+ multipotent cells widely distributed in muscles and other tissues, as a key cell-of-origin of heterotopic cartilage and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>). Targeting <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> expression to FAPs results in robust injury-induced HO, and early-onset spontaneous HO in juvenile mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>). The current study more fully characterizes FAP-directed spontaneous HO, which shows marked similarities to the human condition.</p><p>FOP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>) and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hino et al., 2015</xref>) were instrumental in the discovery of the fundamental and unexpected role of activin ligands in FOP pathogenesis, and antibody-based activin inhibition has emerged as a leading candidate therapeutic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Upadhyay et al., 2017</xref>) that is now being evaluated in clinical trials. A second treatment modality, the retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARγ) agonist, palovarotene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimono et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sinha et al., 2016</xref>), has already shown some promise in clinical trials with adult FOP patients and enrollment is underway for safety and efficacy studies in children. RARγ agonists have been shown to dampen BMP signaling by reducing SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimono et al., 2011</xref>), potentially by increasing proteasome-mediated SMAD degradation, as has been shown for all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sheng et al., 2010</xref>). These effects likely explain, at least in part, the inhibitory effects of RARγ agonists on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation in BMP-induced and genetic models of HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inubushi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shimono et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimono et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sinha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wheatley et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, pretreating bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells with the RARγ agonists CD1530 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimono et al., 2011</xref>) or NRX204647 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shimono et al., 2014</xref>) blocked BMP2-induced skeletogenic differentiation, possibly by reprogramming these cells to a non-skeletal lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shimono et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimono et al., 2011</xref>). These latter results raise the possibility that short-term therapeutic intervention could have long-term efficacy, thereby minimizing the potential for retinoid-associated skeletal toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiGiovanna, 2001</xref>) in children, as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimono et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the effects of daily palovarotene treatment on juvenile FOP mice were assessed, with a focus on body-wide spontaneous HO and skeletal development. We also used a transplantation model and live-animal imaging to quantify cell population dynamics of <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic>-expressing FAPs (R206H-FAPs) prior to the formation of calcified bone. The effects of palovarotene treatment on cell engraftment and population expansion were compared to those of an anti-activin A blocking antibody (ActA-mAb).

By P28, all Pdgfrα-R206H mice exhibited HO at multiple sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–M</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). HO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and osteochondromas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) were often detected at the deltoid tuberosity (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Although it remains formally possible that osteochondromas progressed to HO in Pdgfrα-R206H mice, such an occurrence is rare in human FOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deirmengian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaplan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morales-Piga et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, we speculate that HO of the deltoid tuberosity arises from recruitment of nearby intramuscular or intratendinous R206H-FAPs. Periosteal cells are another possible HO precursor, as Pdgfrα-Cre is also expressed in the periosteum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>). Joint ankylosis was common in P28 Pdgfrα-R206H mice, which weighed an average of 19% less than wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T</xref>; n = 11; p&lt;0.01). At the P42 endpoint of the natural history study, all surviving Pdgfrα-R206H mice were heavily burdened with HO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–S</xref>) and exhibited ankylosis of multiple joints (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

For humane reasons, Pdgfrα-R206H mice were euthanized if body weight loss from peak weight exceeded 20%.

The R206H-FAP population declined between days 5 and 7, coinciding with the onset of bone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,E</xref>).

In addition to defining the time course of HO progression through 6-weeks-of-age and the effects of progressive HO on survival and morbidity, the analysis revealed the formation of osteochondromas in Pdgfrα-R206H mice, a phenotype present in FOP patients but not previously described in other FOP mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>). It is also important to note that targeting expression of <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> to FAPs did not result in regional or tissue restricted HO, as occurs when <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> is expressed by Prrx1+, Mx1+, or Scx+ cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dey et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, Pdgfrα-R206H mice represent a faithful mouse model of juvenile FOP that is well-suited for preclinical drug testing.</p><p>In two important respects, results described here differ from previous findings of palovarotene effects on juvenile <italic>Acvr1<sup>[R206H]FlEx/+</sup></italic>;Prrx1-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref>). First, palovarotene treatment of juvenile Pdgfrα-R206H mice resulted in severe skeletal toxicity, including growth plate loss and synovial joint overgrowth. In contrast, whereas both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref> and the present study documented toxic effects of palovarotene on the skeleton of wild-type mice, palovarotene treatment actually ameliorated skeletal growth deficits in <italic>Acvr1<sup>[R206H]FlEx/+</sup></italic>;Prrx1-Cre mice. Second, while palovarotene reduced severity of whole-body HO and inhibited osteochondroma formation in Pdgfrα-R206H mice, palovarotene treatment of <italic>Acvr1<sup>[R206H]FlEx/+</sup></italic>;Prrx1-Cre mice resulted in more marked reductions in HO. Phenotypic differences in palovarotene effects on these distinct FOP mouse models are likely related to study-specific dosing schedules, the developmental stage at which treatment was initiated, and the endpoints at which analyses were conducted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref> administered palovarotene by oral gavage, first, by daily dosing of lactating females at a dose of 50 μg/mouse from the day of delivery to P15, and subsequently, by alternate-day dosing of <italic>Acvr1<sup>[R206H]FlEx/+</sup></italic>;Prrx1-Cre pups with 20 μg/mouse palovarotene from P16 to P30. The present study utilized bodyweight-adjusted daily dosing from P14 to P42 by intraperitoneal injection of 0.735 mg/kg (equivalent to a starting and ending average dose of ~5 μg and ~11 μg per mouse, respectively) and 1.47 mg/kg (~10 to~22 μg/mouse). Importantly, palovarotene-induced skeletal toxicity is neither unique to the Pdgfrα-R206H mouse model nor to intraperitoneal administration, as apparently similar skeletal overgrowths occurred, but were not noted, in an independent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inubushi et al., 2018</xref>, in which mice were administered comparable daily doses of palovarotene via oral gavage from 2- to 6-weeks-of-age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inubushi et al., 2018</xref>), as in the present study. Since the palovarotene doses used in the current study and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inubushi et al., 2018</xref> were less than, or comparable to, that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref> on a per-dose basis, it is reasonable to suggest that severe skeletal toxicity was related to greater overall palovarotene exposure associated with daily dosing. The overall length of the treatment window and developmental stage of exposure also appear to be critical variables, although distinguishing the relative contribution of each parameter is difficult. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inubushi et al., 2018</xref> showed that reducing the window of palovarotene administration to 3- to 6-weeks-of-age did not result in reductions in tibia and femur length, which are characteristic of the 2- to 6 week exposure period, or in the loss of the distal femur growth plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inubushi et al., 2018</xref>). The developmental window of palovarotene exposure might also explain the comparatively lower efficacy in reducing HO reported here, despite the daily dosing regimen, as a palovarotene dosing schedule that eliminated exposure from P0 to P14 was less effective at inhibiting HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the developmental stage and duration of exposure to palovarotene, as well as dosing interval, all contribute to the extent of palovarotene efficacy and skeletal toxicity.</p><p>Pretreatment of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells with the RARγ agonists CD1530 or NRX204647 confers protection from BMP2-induced HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shimono et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimono et al., 2011</xref>). If this were generally true for RARγ agonists, the risk of palovarotene-induced skeletal toxicity would likely be mitigated by the requirement for only short-term administration. However, it is clear from the present data that pretreatment of R206H-FAPs with palovarotene for 7 days does not render them refractory to skeletogenic differentiation. It remains unclear whether these disparate experimental outcomes are attributable to differences between palovarotene and other RARγ agonists, FAPs and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, or the mechanism through which BMP2 and activin A induce HO.</p><p>Antibody-mediated activin inhibition is also being evaluated for safety and efficacy in a clinical trial for FOP. The data presented herein represents the first direct comparison of the ability of these two therapeutic modalities to modulate the behavior of FAPs, a major contributor to heterotopic skeletogenesis. By live-animal imaging we showed that treatment of SCID hosts with a blocking antibody to activin A restored wild-type population dynamics to transplanted R206H-FAPs, whereas palovarotene treatment resulted in a more modest, but statistically significant, reduction in the kinetics and extent of R206H-FAP population expansion. Consistent with this latter finding, recent studies showed that palovarotene reduces proliferation of lesional cells in injured FOP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref>) and in a rat model of blast injury and amputation-induced HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pavey et al., 2016</xref>). Although the present study did not distinguish between effects on cell proliferation and survival, it is reasonable to predict that inhibition of FAP proliferation by palovarotene represents a common mechanism of action in the present and previous studies. Our finding that total HO volume was tightly correlated with peak R206H-FAP number following transplantation predicts that therapeutic approaches that limit R206H-FAP proliferation, in addition to targeting signaling events associated with endochondral bone formation, would show greatest efficacy. More generally, targeting of FAP proliferation might have implications beyond FOP, as dysregulation of FAP population dynamics has been implicated in distinct pathological conditions. Specifically, FAP numbers rapidly increase following muscle injury, and the subsequent failure to appropriately reduce their numbers after initial expansion is associated with FAP-mediated fibrosis of muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Uezumi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uezumi et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, as inappropriate FAP survival and proliferation appear to represent a common indicator of pathogenic versus pro-regenerative FAP function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiore et al., 2016</xref>), and FAPs are widely distributed in non-muscle tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wosczyna et al., 2012</xref>), palovarotene and activin inhibition might also show efficacy in diseases or conditions characterized by fibrosis of muscles or other tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse crosses and genotyping</title><p>All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the University of Connecticut Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

A representative example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). All numerical values are presented as mean values ± the standard error of the mean or standard deviation, and one or two-way ANOVA was used to determine significance, as described in the corresponding figure legends. Survival was assessed by log-rank. Differences were considered significant at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Goldhamer lab for helpful comments throughout the course of this work, and Dr. Isabelle Lemire (Clementia Pharmaceuticals) for critical input on study design and careful critique of the manuscript.

Their work is based on the hypothesis that activation of the activin A receptor in Pdgfrα FOPs results in spontaneous HO and ultimately FOP. Recently published work by this same group introduced the mouse model which recapitulates spontaneous HO while these studies examine the efficacy of palovarotene vs. an activin A blocking antibody in the treatment of spontaneous HO. Several results highlight the significance of this work including:</p><p>1) The relationship of FAP number to disease progression and further characterization of their mouse model, both treated and untreated – i.e. natural history studies;</p><p>2) The difference in FAP expansion in treated cells between palovarotene and an activin A blocking antibody;</p><p>3) The first head to head comparison of two treatments (activin A antibody vs. palovarotene) in a spontaneous HO model;</p><p>4) The synovial overgrowth and joint disruption and long bone growth ablation noted with palovarotene treatment;</p><p>Hence the work breaks new ground and is well written. As such it should add considerably to our knowledge base when considering treatment options in this progressively fatal disease, particularly since phase II trials are ongoing with both treatments.</p><p>There are a few concerns which need further elaboration:</p><p>1) It appears the jaw overgrowth is the cause of death in the treated HO mice; were necropsies done on those mice to establish other off-target effects?</p><p>2) It would be important for the reader to know how the doses of palovarotene were established and how that compares to ongoing human trials;</p><p>3) In that same vein, it appears as if in both in vitro and in vivo studies, there is not a consistent dose response to palovarotene, particularly in respect to amount of HO over the natural history; can the authors elaborate?</p><p>4) Why did palovarotene reduce survival in juvenile WT mice? Were necropsies performed? Also, please show body weight data in treated WT mice.</p><p>5) In the transplantation study with SCID mice, why wasn’t the lower dose of palovarotene used?</p><p>6) A fundamental question underlying the paper is whether FAP treatment with palovarotene reduces cell survival or proliferation; further data would be helpful in that regard.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors employ a previously described developmental/juvenile model of FOP that uses Pdgfrα lineage-specific activation of an <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> knock-in allele, demonstrating all known HO phenotypes of FOP, including chostochondral, articular and periarticular, and intramuscular heterotopic ossification, as well as osteochondromas not previously found in mouse models. This developmental model is associated with significant morbidity attributed to poor feeding as a result of jaw HO, resulting in markedly reduced survival evident by P42. This developmental model provides the opportunity for testing various interventions during a window of development (P14 to P42) that corresponds roughly to ages during which FOP manifests in humans, and to examine the potential impact of these treatments on orthotopic skeletal growth. Two treatments are evaluated, an activin A neutralizing antibody and an RAR-gamma agonist, both approaches currently being tested in humans with FOP.</p><p>In addition to the developmental model, the authors use an FAP transplantation approach, showing importantly that HO is proportional to the numbers of transplanted and engrafted <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutant FAPs. Moreover, <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> FAPs exhibits enhanced engraftment and proliferation kinetics in comparison to wild-type FAPs, consistent with a pro-proliferative phenotype conferred by <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic>. In testing the impact of ex vivo and in vivo modulation of activin, or treatment with RAR-gamma agonist, they found that anti-activin therapy essentially normalizes the engraftment and proliferation of mutant FAPs to nearly that of wild-type FAPs. In contrast, treatment with PVO reduces the survival/proliferation of engrafted mutant FAPs, but does not normalize them to the numbers of WT FAPs.</p><p>In the developmental model, treatment with PVO appeared to improve overall HO, and was particularly effective in reducing spontaneous HO at the ankle joints. However, treatment with PVO at both doses exacerbated HO formation in the knees, and possibly the wrist, hip, shoulder joints, and cervical and lumbar spine. Treatment with PVO at both doses led to the formation of abnormal cartilaginous growths in articular cartilage, particularly within the costochondral, shoulder, wrist and knee joints. The exacerbation of HO by PVO in a developmental model of FOP raises important questions about the mechanism of PVO, previously presented as an anti-chondrogenic molecule, but enhancing articular cartilage formation in this model.</p><p>With respect to the developmental effects of <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> on orthotopic skeletal growth, expression of <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> in Pdgfrα+ lineages led to a decrease in tibial length but with generally preserved growth plate structure, representing a slight modification of observations by Chakkalakal et al. 2016 in which decreased long bone length was observed with Prrx1+ specific expression of a similar <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> knock-in allele but with altered epiphyseal and hypertrophic zone thicknesses, all of which were partially normalized by PVO treatment in that study. In the current study, treatment with PVO was associated with essentially absent growth plates or findings suggestive of growth plate trauma. Moreover, treatment with PVO was associated with further shortened body length, spine lengths, tibial lengths and skull lengths in treated versus untreated PDGFRα-Cre; <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic>/+ animals, as might be expected from a potent retinoid administered during skeletal development. This result contrasts with Chakkalakal et al. in which PVO treatment of Prrx1-Cre; <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup> </italic>mice appeared to improve long bone length with partial normalization of growth plate structure. On the other hand, the current observations are more consistent with those of Inubushi et al. (2018), in which it was found that PVO treatment of mice without <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations starting at P14 was associated with decreased long bone length and altered growth plate structure. In the Inubushi paper starting PVO at P21 was associated with less impact on skeletal development. In light of the prior observations, the authors should comment why the P14-P42 window of treatment was chosen, if it was shown to be optimal as compared to delayed treatment windows, and whether or not delaying treatment to P21 might still exhibit reasonable efficacy without causing toxicity?</p><p>These current findings have tremendous relevance for current pediatric clinical trials investigating palovarotene for the treatment of FOP. The authors clearly show that doses of PVO (0.75 - 1.5 mg/kg/d IP) required for preventing developmental HO phenotypes in this condition are associated with long bone shortening and dissolution of growth plates, yet also have the potential to create cartilage malformations at sites of articular cartilage and synovial cartilage and paradoxically exacerbate HO at these sites. The mechanism of paradoxically increased cartilage formation and HO following PVO treatment raises questions about whether or not the mechanisms of PVO's effects are matched to the pathophysiology of FOP, and whether this is an ideal therapy for FOP. Could the authors speculate on how PVO might enhance cartilage formation, and enhance HO at some sites while preventing it at others?</p><p>In addition to the observed counterproductive or toxic effects of juvenile PVO therapy observed upon long bone length and growth plate morphology/maintenance, one wonders if the relative failure of PVO to contain mutant <italic>ACVR1</italic> FAP proliferation in engraftment studies might have additional untoward effects besides the inadequate control of HO? For example, in the last paragraph of the Discussion the authors discuss that the failure to control the initial expansion of the FAPs is associated with muscle fibrosis following injury. The current data (Figure 6) demonstrates that anti-activin almost normalizes mutant <italic>ACVR1</italic> FAP proliferation and engraftment to that of wild-type, whereas the response even with the higher dose of PVO is enhanced compared to wild-type cells. Could the authors comment on the possibility that PVO might lead to excessive muscle fibrosis or fatty infiltration? Could the muscle tissues of mice from these implantation experiments in Figure 6 be used to assess this question, rather than leaving this open for speculation? The answer may be important, as satisfactory function of the residual muscle, even after successful abrogation of HO, may depend upon a normal muscle injury-healing response, and might be impaired if wound-healing functions of critical populations such as FAPs become impaired or dysregulated as a result of anti-HO therapies. The muscle crush/FAP engraftment model with or without PVO treatment might be advantageous for assessing this, while an analysis of the P42 mutants treated with or without PVO could reveal any other important effects of systemic treatment on muscle during post-natal growth.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript &quot;Palovarotene reduces heterotopic ossification in juvenile FOP mice but exhibits pronounced skeletal toxicity&quot;, expands our current understanding of the pathological progression of FOP, the role of FAPs during this progression and the therapeutic potential of 2 differing modes of intervention on dampening FOP pathogenesis. This new information is clearly and carefully presented. The manuscript also reports an unexpected and worrisome finding, that palovarotene treatment has profound negative effects on the skeleton of juvenile mice, a stark contrast to the effects of anti-activin-A treatment that appear to be beneficial to FOP carrying mice and innocuous to WT mice. While only small cohorts of mice were examined using only one specific dosing regime, data are quite convincing and suggest that the age of patients at the start of FOP therapy must be carefully considered prior to treatment as to prevent deleterious actions of palovarotene in the juvenile skeleton.</p><p>Additionally, establishing upper limits to drug administration as a function of skeletal age should also be considered. As both anti-activin-A and palovarotene are currently in use in clinical trials for FOP, this study is topical and of strong clinical significance.</p><p>My only substantive concern is the amount of variability in efficacy of treatment vs. toxicity that may occur with each individual dosing regime in patients of different ages. While it seems unlikely that the strong negative effects observed with palovarotene will only occur with this dosing schedule in mice of this age, the very compact nature of this study may not allow the authors to generalize about palovarotene treatment in juvenile patients with FOP.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40814.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There will be significant interest in this well written paper which is likely to affect further clinical trials in FOP as well solidifying the pathogenic mechanisms of this disease.

As relates to efficacy, we have now added a concluding sentence to the relevant paragraph of the Results that specifically notes the apparent limit of palovarotene efficacy in this FOP mouse model. Without a complete dose-response study, we feel it is appropriate to describe similarities and minor differences in dose effects in the Results, without elaborating further in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The cause of death of juvenile WT mice treated with palovarotene: We do not know the reason for reduced survival of WT mice (or of FOP mice that did not exhibit heterotopic ossification of the jaw) treated with palovarotene. We now explicitly state in the Results that the reason for reduced survival of palovarotene-treated mice is unknown.</p><p>3) Speculate how palovarotene might enhance cartilage growth: In the Results section, we now note the precedent for pro-proliferative effects of retinoids in certain experimental settings.</p><p>4) Placement of statistical methods in a separate section: We have now added a section on statistical methods to the Materials and methods section.</p><p>In the Materials and methods section, we now include comments concerning the rationale for the doses of palovarotene chosen. This is in response to specific reviewer comments that were not included in the summary review.</p></body></sub-article></article>
