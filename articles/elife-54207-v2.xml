fertile ground for the evolution of new metabolic pathways. Here, we systematically explore the ability of <italic>E. coli</italic> to harness underground metabolism to compensate for the deletion of an essential biosynthetic pathway. By deleting all threonine deaminases, we generated a strain in which isoleucine biosynthesis was interrupted at the level of 2-ketobutyrate. Incubation of this strain under aerobic conditions resulted in the emergence of a novel 2-ketobutyrate biosynthesis pathway based upon the promiscuous cleavage of <italic>O</italic>-succinyl-L-homoserine by cystathionine γ-synthase (MetB). Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate formate-lyase enabled 2-ketobutyrate biosynthesis from propionyl-CoA and formate. Surprisingly, we found this anaerobic route to provide a substantial fraction of isoleucine in a wild-type strain when propionate is available in the medium. This study demonstrates the selective advantage underground metabolism offers, providing metabolic redundancy and flexibility which allow for the best use of environmental carbon sources.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>underground metabolism</kwd><kwd>promiscuous enzymes</kwd><kwd>methionine biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>pyruvate formate-lyase</kwd><kwd>formate assimilation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cotton</surname><given-names>Charles AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Bernhardsgrütter</surname><given-names>Iria</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Hai</given-names></name><name><surname>Burgener</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Schulz</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name><name><surname>Paczia</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name><name><surname>Dronsella</surname><given-names>Beau</given-names></name><name><surname>Erban</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Toman</surname><given-names>Stepan</given-names></name><name><surname>Dempfle</surname><given-names>Marian</given-names></name><name><surname>De Maria</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name><name><surname>Kopka</surname><given-names>Joachim</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindner</surname><given-names>Steffen N</given-names></name><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Tobias J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bar-Even</surname><given-names>Arren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Federal Ministry of Education and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>031B0194 (FormatPlant)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cotton</surname><given-names>Charles AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Burgener</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Schulz</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name><name><surname>Toman</surname><given-names>Stepan</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindner</surname><given-names>Steffen N</given-names></name><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Tobias J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bar-Even</surname><given-names>Arren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Upon deletion of threonine deaminases, biosynthesis of isoleucine is rescued by two promiscuous reactions, one emerges under aerobic conditions and the other is naturally active under anaerobic conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The patchwork model suggests that novel metabolic pathways emerge from the promiscuous activities of enzymes participating in diverse metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lazcano and Miller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jensen, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noda-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). According to this, underground metabolism – the network of metabolic conversions which are catalyzed as side reactions of enzymes that have evolved to support other activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Ari and Casadesús, 1998</xref>) – provides fertile ground for the evolution of new pathways. A computational analysis suggested that about half of all underground reactions generate metabolites that already exist in the endogenous metabolic network, thus enabling the emergence of metabolic bypasses for the production of key cellular building blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Notebaart et al., 2014</xref>). For example, promiscuous activities of the arginine biosynthesis enzymes enabled proline production in an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain deleted in the canonical proline biosynthesis route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Itikawa et al., 1968</xref>); several pathways, each based on the promiscuous activities of different enzymes, have been shown to relieve pyridoxal phosphate auxotrophy in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oberhardt et al., 2016</xref>); and adaptive evolution of <italic>E. coli</italic> harnessed enzyme promiscuity to enable growth on the non-natural feedstock 1,2-propanediol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee and Palsson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The biosynthesis of isoleucine provides multiple examples of enzyme promiscuity and structural similarity to other pathways, suggesting underground metabolism as a likely origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jensen, 1976</xref>). Cellular production of isoleucine and valine are catalyzed by the same enzymes; in valine biosynthesis, pyruvate is self-condensed whereas in isoleucine biosynthesis, pyruvate is condensed with 2-ketobutyrate (2 KB). In most organisms, 2 KB is produced from threonine cleavage. Despite this, different biosynthetic routes, which mirror other metabolic pathways, are known to support the production of 2 KB in specific lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For example, the citramalate route mirrors the TCA cycle, where pyruvate, rather than oxaloacetate, is condensed with acetyl-CoA, and 2 KB, rather than 2-ketoglutarate, is the pathway product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charon et al., 1974</xref>). Similarly, in several anaerobic microorganisms, propionate is converted to 2 KB in a reductive pathway that mirrors acetate conversion to pyruvate via ligation with CoA and ferredoxin-dependent carboxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchanan, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monticello et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eikmanns et al., 1983</xref>). In plants, methionine γ-lyase, catalyzing a reaction similar to that of cystathionine γ-lyase, is a complementary source of cellular 2 KB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joshi and Jander, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joshi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolic routes for 2-ketobutyrate biosynthesis.</title><p>A wide variety of pathways support the production of 2-ketobutyrate, an essential intermediate in the production of isoleucine. Outlined are five known, physiologically relevant 2-ketobutyrate synthesis pathways and two additional pathways we identified in this paper (marked in blue).

Under aerobic conditions, we show that a mutation in a cysteine biosynthesis enzyme decreased its activity and lowered the steady-state concentration of this amino acid; this freed an intermediate of methionine biosynthesis, which usually reacts with cysteine, to be converted to 2 KB. Under anaerobic conditions, <italic>E. coli</italic> was able to use the enzyme pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) to generate 2 KB from propionyl-CoA and formate. Surprisingly, we found this pathway to provide a substantial fraction of the cellular 2 KB also in a wild-type (WT) strain. This study thus demonstrates the inherent ability of microorganisms to effectively exploit underground metabolism to generate patchwork pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A latent aerobic isoleucine biosynthesis pathway</title><p>Biosynthesis of isoleucine in <italic>E. coli</italic> starts with the deamination of threonine to give 2 KB, which is then condensed with pyruvate to produce 2-aceto-2-hydroxybutanoate. This intermediate is subsequently isomerized, reduced, dehydrated, and aminated to generate isoleucine. To generate an isoleucine auxotrophy, we constructed a strain in which the two genes encoding for threonine deaminase were deleted (<italic>ilvA</italic> and <italic>tdcB</italic>). When provided with isoleucine, this strain grew identically to the WT strain (dark red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Without the addition of isoleucine, we observed no growth in the first 70 hr, but within 70–120 hr, different replicates started growing with a growth rate somewhat lower than that of the WT strain (purple lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Strains lacking threonine deaminases adapt to generate isoleucine under aerobic conditions.</title><p>Strains deleted in threonine deaminases (<italic>∆ilvA ∆tdcB</italic>) or threonine deaminases and serine deaminases (<italic>∆</italic>5, i.e. ∆<italic>ilvA</italic> ∆<italic>tdcB</italic> ∆<italic>sdaA</italic> ∆<italic>sdaB</italic> ∆<italic>tdcG</italic>) grew on minimal medium with 10 mM glucose after approx. 70 hr. Strains deleted in ketol-acid reductoisomerase (∆<italic>ilvC</italic>, an enzyme downstream of 2 KB in isoleucine biosynthesis) could not grow (valine supplied to relieve a second auxotrophy), indicating a metabolic leak at the level of 2 KB. All experiments were performed in technical triplicates in a 96-well plate reader. For the <italic>∆ilvA ∆tdcB</italic> and <italic>∆</italic>5 strains, cultivated without isoleucine (purple and green lines), replicates are shown individually. In all other cases, replicates showed an identical growth profile (±5%) and hence are represented by a single curve. Experiments were repeated on three separate occasions for all growth experiments shown. Isoleucine, 2-ketobutyrate, and valine were added at 2 mM where indicated.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54207-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>One explanation of the observed growth without isoleucine is an increased activity of serine deaminases, which are known to accept threonine as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cicchillo et al., 2004</xref>). We, therefore, deleted all the genes encoding for serine deaminase (<italic>sdaA</italic>, <italic>sdaB</italic>, and <italic>tdcG</italic>). We termed the resulting strain Δ5 (Δ<italic>ilvA</italic> Δ<italic>tdcB</italic> Δ<italic>sdaA</italic> Δ<italic>sdaB</italic> Δ<italic>tdcG</italic>). However, strain Δ5 displayed similar behavior to the Δ<italic>ilvA</italic> Δ<italic>tdcB</italic> strain, that is, while growth without isoleucine was not observed in the first 70 hr, after 70 hr, the replicates started growing (green lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This strongly suggests the emergence of a latent threonine-independent isoleucine biosynthesis pathway.</p><p>To check whether this route still depends on the generation of 2 KB or rather bypasses this metabolic intermediate altogether, we constructed a strain deleted in the gene <italic>ilvC</italic>. This gene encodes a ketol-acid reductoisomerase that operates downstream of 2 KB in the isoleucine biosynthesis pathway. While cultivation of the Δ<italic>ilvC</italic> strain with valine and isoleucine enabled growth similar to that of the WT strain (pink line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; valine is required as IlvC participates also in valine biosynthesis), growth without isoleucine was not observed even after 150 hr (orange line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As a further confirmation, we observed that addition of 2 KB to the cultivation medium rescued the growth of the Δ<italic>ilvA</italic> Δ<italic>tdcB</italic> strain and the Δ5 strain but not the Δ<italic>ilvC</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This confirms that 2 KB still serves as a metabolic intermediate in the underground isoleucine biosynthesis pathway.</p><p>In some microorganisms, 2 KB is produced via the citramalate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drevland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hochuli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Risso et al., 2008</xref>). This route is a catalytic parallel to the first half of the TCA cycle – from citrate synthase to isocitrate dehydrogenase – where pyruvate replaces oxaloacetate, reacting with acetyl-CoA to give citramalate, which is subsequently metabolized to 2 KB. We wondered whether the enzymes of the TCA cycle, or their isozymes, catalyze the reactions of the citramalate pathway in <italic>E. coli</italic>. To check if this were the case, we performed a carbon labeling assay, feeding the WT strain, the Δ<italic>ilvA</italic> Δ<italic>tdcB</italic> strain, and the Δ5 strain with either glucose-1-<sup>13</sup>C or glucose-3-<sup>13</sup>C. The expected labeling pattern of isoleucine should completely change depending on the biosynthesis route of 2 KB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In the WT strain, isoleucine is expected to be roughly half labeled upon feeding with glucose-3-<sup>13</sup>C and follow a 1:2:1 pattern (unlabeled: once labeled: double labeled) with glucose-1-<sup>13</sup>C. By contrast, if 2 KB is produced via the citramalate pathway, then isoleucine would be completely unlabeled when feeding with glucose-3-<sup>13</sup>C and would roughly follow a 1:2:2:1 pattern (unlabeled: once labeled: double labeled: triple labeled) with glucose-1-<sup>13</sup>C. The labeling pattern of isoleucine in the Δ<italic>ilvA</italic> Δ<italic>tdcB</italic> and the Δ5 strains is almost identical to that of the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the small deviations from the expected labeling can be attributed to the ambient abundance of <sup>13</sup>C and the shuffling of labeled carbon by the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle). This effectively rules out the activity of the citramalate pathway and indicates that the biosynthesis of 2 KB in both gene deletion strains is closely related to the natural production pathway.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><sup>13</sup>C-labeling of isoleucine rules out the citramalate pathway.</title><p>Labeling of proteinogenic amino acids was analyzed after the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> on labeled glucose-1-<sup>13</sup>C or glucose-3-<sup>13</sup>C as a sole carbon source.

For example, in organisms in which cysteine biosynthesis depends on γ-elimination of cystathionine, 2 KB serves as a byproduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steegborn et al., 1999</xref>). Also, in plants, 2 KB can be produced from γ-elimination of methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joshi and Jander, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joshi et al., 2010</xref>).

To further confirm that MetC is not involved in 2 KB production, we deleted its encoding gene. The Δ5 Δ<italic>metC</italic> strain could grow even without the addition of methionine (which is in line with the Δ<italic>metC</italic> strain in the Keio collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baba et al., 2006</xref>]), presumably due to the existence of multiple PLP-dependent enzymes that can catalyze the MetC reaction, for example MalY, Alr, and FimE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zdych et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patrick et al., 2007</xref>). More importantly, this strain could directly grow without isoleucine and without the need for adaptation (green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Supporting previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Figge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holbrook et al., 1990</xref>), we found MetB to catalyze the cleavage of <italic>O</italic>-succinyl-L-homoserine to 2 KB (reaction one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) with <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> = 9.3 ± 0.4 s<sup>−1</sup>, <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>(<italic>O</italic>-succinyl-L-homoserine)=0.60 ± 0.08 mM, and thus <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>(<italic>O</italic>-succinyl-L-homoserine)=16 ± 2 mM<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Yet, it was previously reported that the formation of 2 KB is suppressed in the presence of cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holbrook et al., 1990</xref>). We, therefore, characterized the cleavage reaction in the presence of either cysteine or homocysteine (as an alternative substrate), at physiological concentrations of ~0.3 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wheldrake, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2013</xref>) and at artificially high concentrations of 3–6 mM. We found that formation of 2 KB was indeed suppressed at physiological concentrations of cysteine, while homocysteine suppressed 2 KB formation only at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>). Nonetheless, as the deletion of <italic>metB</italic> in the Δ5 strain completely abolishes growth without isoleucine (brown line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), it seems very likely that MetB is involved in the production of 2 KB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Disruption of MetC or a mutation in serine acetyltransferase enable steady 2-ketobutyrate production from <italic>O</italic>-succinyl-L-homoserine</title><p>Next, we aimed to understand the genetic basis underlying 2 KB biosynthesis in the Δ<italic>ilvA</italic> Δ<italic>tdcB</italic> and Δ5 strains.

As formate is naturally produced by the PFL-dependent cleavage of pyruvate, we reasoned that the addition of this compound to the medium might be redundant. Indeed, we found that propionate alone, when added to the medium, supported the growth of the Δ5 strain, albeit with longer lag time and lower growth rate than with the addition of formate (purple line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, all replicates displayed an identical growth phenotype, thus ruling out genetic mutations).

However, replacement of isoleucine with propionate, with or without further addition of formate, resulted in no growth (red and purple lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This confirms that PFL is indeed responsible for 2 KB biosynthesis.</p><p>To provide a further validation that 2 KB is produced from propionate, we followed the <sup>13</sup>C labeling of isoleucine upon addition of propionate-1-<sup>13</sup>C to the growth medium under anaerobic conditions. Surprisingly, we found that even within a WT strain, the addition of labeled propionate resulted in 30% labeled isoleucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), suggesting that the KBFL route operates naturally if propionate is present in the medium. When formate was also added to the medium, the fraction of labeled isoleucine increased to almost 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), making the KBFL-dependent pathway the dominant isoleucine biosynthesis route within a WT strain. In the Δ5 strain, in which the canonical isoleucine biosynthesis pathways are deleted, isoleucine was almost 80% labeled upon addition of formate and labeled propionate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Deletion of the <italic>metA</italic> increased this labeling to 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), indicating that the MetB-dependent route operates anaerobically although with a low flux.

This indicates that PFL is solely responsible for the production of 2 KB from propionate and formate. Still, it could be that TdcE does not contribute to 2 KB biosynthesis only because it is not expressed under the tested conditions. Hence, we explored the consequences of overexpressing <italic>tdcE</italic> on a plasmid. We found that overexpression of <italic>tdcE</italic> in a Δ5 Δ<italic>pflB</italic> strain enabled fast growth with propionate (purple line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), indicating that TdcE can replace PFL both in catalyzing pyruvate cleavage to generate formate (as noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sawers et al., 1998</xref>]) and in catalyzing 2 KB production from propionyl-CoA and formate. Moreover, overexpression of <italic>tdcE</italic> in a WT strain fed with propionate-1-<sup>13</sup>C resulted in a high proportion of labeled isoleucine: more than 70% without externally added formate and ~90% with externally added formate, both are considerably higher than without <italic>tdcE</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>tdcE</italic> in the Δ5 Δ<italic>metA</italic> strain resulted in 95% labeled isoleucine, the highest labeling we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Overall, these results confirm that TdcE can support in vivo 2 KB synthesis from propionyl-CoA in a comparable manner to that of PFL.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study serves to demonstrate the selective advantage underground metabolism may offer in nature, providing metabolic redundancy and flexibility which allows for the best use of environmental carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Notebaart et al., 2014</xref>). We demonstrated two metabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of isoleucine which are based on the activity of promiscuous enzymes. The first pathway, uncovered under aerobic conditions, is based on rerouting the metabolism of <italic>O</italic>-succinyl-L-homoserine from methionine biosynthesis toward the production of 2 KB. This represents a rather classic case of underground metabolism: a promiscuous reaction, the activity of which normally has a negligible physiological contribution, is enhanced by the rewiring of cellular metabolism under conditions which couple it to growth. Interestingly, a change in the steady-state concentration of a seemingly unrelated metabolite – cysteine – greatly enhances this promiscuous activity and enables a new biosynthetic route.</p><p>Under anaerobic conditions, we uncovered a pathway that relies on the highly expressed PFL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neidhardt et al., 1996</xref>) to condense propionyl-CoA and formate to 2 KB. This route, unlike the aerobic cleavage of <italic>O</italic>-succinyl-L-homoserine, was highly active also in a WT strain, providing a substantial fraction of cellular isoleucine when propionate was present in the medium. As short-chain fatty acids, such as propionate, are abundant in the mammalian intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McNeil et al., 1978</xref>), the native habitat of <italic>E. coli</italic>, the KBFL pathway is likely to play a key role in isoleucine biosynthesis under physiological conditions. Hence, this pathway does not actually represent underground metabolism, but rather should be regarded an auxiliary biosynthesis route based on promiscuous enzyme activities. The use of the KBFL pathway is favorable over the canonical threonine cleavage route as it better uses the carbon sources available in the environment. As PFL supports the KBFL reaction under physiological conditions, we suggest renaming it ‘pyruvate formate-lyase/2-ketobutyrate formate-lyase’, in a similar manner to TdcE, which was named as ‘2-ketobutyrate formate-lyase/pyruvate formate-lyase’.</p><p>Several previous studies have suggested that, in various microbial lineages, 2 KB is derived from propionate via the activity of 2 KB:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchanan, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monticello et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eikmanns et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sauer et al., 1975</xref>). The findings presented here indicate that, in at least some of these microorganisms, propionate might be converted to 2 KB via the KBFL route, where formate is produced internally via pyruvate cleavage, or even from the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> via formate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maia et al., 2017</xref>). Even the microorganism in which the reductive carboxylation of propionyl-CoA was first demonstrated, that is, <italic>Clostridium pasteurianum</italic>, harbors a genomic PFL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanehisa, 2000</xref>) and thus may also assimilate propionate into isoleucine via the KBFL pathway. Moreover, in several microorganisms, propionyl-CoA is produced from succinyl-CoA as part of anaerobic fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Swick and Wood, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stams et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schink et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tholozan et al., 1994</xref>); these organisms might be able to use the KBFL route without the need for an external supply of propionate. The prevalence of both the genes and the substrates involved in the KBFL pathway indicates that this route may be widespread.</p><p>Many cellular building blocks have alternative biosynthesis pathways. Nevertheless, isoleucine seems unusually rich in the sheer number of alternative routes for its bioproduction. There appear to be at least nine routes for 2 KB production: threonine cleavage (canonical pathway), the citramalate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Charon et al., 1974</xref>), the glutamate mutase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramsky et al., 1962</xref>), cystathionine cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steegborn et al., 1999</xref>), methionine cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joshi and Jander, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joshi et al., 2010</xref>), homolanthionine cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krömer et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>O</italic>-succinyl-L-homoserine cleavage (this study), propionyl-CoA reductive carboxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchanan, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monticello et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eikmanns et al., 1983</xref>), and propionyl-CoA condensation with formate (this study).

However, the presence of cysteine or homocysteine does not necessarily exclude the elimination reaction activity of the MetB enzyme (reaction one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To determine the reaction route, MetB was incubated with <italic>O</italic>-succinyl-L-homoserine and cysteine or homocysteine in separate experiments. To investigate the MetB reaction route at physiological cysteine or homocysteine concentrations, we ran an assay with 100 nM of MetB in 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 50 µM pyridoxal-5’-phosphate in the presence of 6 mM <italic>O</italic>-succinyl-L-homoserine and 300 µM of either cysteine or homocysteine. The assay mixture was incubated at 30°C and samples were quenched with 5% formic acid at specific time points.

Therefore, we used another method to assess the relative intercellular concentration of these amino acids.</p><p>To assess the relative intracellular concentration changes of cysteine, homocysteine, and 2 KB among different strains, we cultivated the strains in four independent replicates of 4 mL media in glass test tubes (n = 4) to mid-exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> approx. 0.4–0.8). About 10<sup>9</sup> cells (equivalent of 1 mL of OD<sub>600</sub> = 1 culture) were collected on 0.45 μm Durapore membrane filters (Merck Millipore, Ireland). After washing the filters with 1 mL of fresh medium in under 10 s, the filters with cells were placed in 5 mL of −20°C 40:40:20 (v/v/v) acetonitrile/methanol/water overnight. 4 mL of debris-free extract per sample was dried by vacuum centrifugation at 35°C overnight. The dried metabolites were stored at −20°C until further processing.</p><p>Metabolites were methoxyaminated and trimethylsilylated before gas chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (GC/APCI-qTOF-MS) as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kopka et al., 2017</xref>). GC/APCI-qTOF-MS analyses were performed with an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH, Germany) hyphenated to a Bruker Impact II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). The machine parameters and analysis procedures were exactly as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kopka et al., 2017</xref>. Data mining was performed with Profile Analysis Version 2.2 software (Bruker Daltonik GmbH).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by the Max Planck Society and by the German Federal Ministry of Education amd Research, Grant no. 031B0194 (project FormatPlant) .</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of identified mutations in 16 strains lacking threonine deaminases (<italic>∆ilvA ∆tdcB</italic>) or threonine and serine deaminases (<italic>∆ilvA ∆tdcB ∆sdaA ∆sdaB ∆tdcG</italic>) that were evolved to grow on 10 mM glucose after 70 hr without isoleucine or 2 KB.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-54207-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>List of all primers used in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-54207-supp2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-54207-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

It highlights flexibility and interconnectivity of main and alternative metabolic pathways. The knowledge should be useful for further development in the fields of systems biology and metabolic engineering.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Underground isoleucine biosynthesis pathways in <italic>E. coli</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yew Wen Shan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Cotton et al. presents mechanisms underlying microbial adaptation to evolve alternative rescue pathways when the main Isoleucine biosynthesis pathway in <italic>E. coli</italic> is disrupted. Cells in which threonine deaminases have been deleted are still able to grow, implying that another source of 2-ketobutyrate for synthesis of isoleucine must be available. The authors demonstrated that within the proto-typical microbe, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, isoleucine auxotrophy can be complemented/compensated by multiple pathways. As the disruption was carried out at the step of 2-ketobutyrate production, the cell uses other enzymes, MetB mainly under aerobic where the provision of the critical metabolite is done by succinyl-homoserine cleavage, and pyruvate format lyase (PflB/TdcE) to provide 2KB under anaerobic conditions by the condensation of propionyl-CoA.</p><p>Overall, the work is well written and the results are quite interesting. The authors make a good case that the enzymes responsible for rescuing growth differ when the cells are grown under aerobic vs anaerobic conditions. The suggestion that a significant amount of 2-ketobutyrate may be produced from propionate in the anaerobic conditions in the mammalian gut is particularly intriguing. The work contributes an elaboration of &quot;underground metabolism&quot; where latent metabolic pathways catalyzed by promiscuous enzymes can be activated given the right metabolic/physiological conditions.</p><p>However, there are many issues need to be addressed clearly (especially the issues mentioned in the first two comments).

Your revised article has been evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>All reviewers think that the manuscript is very much improved and presents convincing evidence for the existence of alternative pathways for synthesis of 2KB. However, one of the reviewers note that a solid explanation for how the mutations increase flux through alternative pathways for 2KB synthesis should be provided because this is an important missing piece of the puzzle.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The mechanism by which the mutation in CysE improves synthesis of 2KB is puzzling. It seems logical that decreasing the concentration of cysteine would increase the rate of cleavage of O-succinyl-L-homoserine to 2KB and succinate. However, the mutation appears to decrease the cysteine concentration by only 44%. (There is enough variability in the data that this is not a totally convincing finding; the p value for the difference between the ∆5 and the ∆5 <italic>cysE</italic>* strains is 0.16.) In other data, the authors show that, in the presence of cysteine, O-succinyl-L-homoserine is converted entirely to cystathionine and succinate (the normal intermediates in the methionine synthesis pathway). Therefore, it would not be expected that O-succinyl-L-homoserine is cleaved to 2KB and succinate in vivo in the presence of a substantial amount of cysteine. Can the authors come up with a good explanation? For example, is it possible that both the CysE mutation and the <italic>metC</italic> deletion lower methionine levels, which then would lead to increased transcription of <italic>metB</italic>? Decreasing MetC activity might also lead to an increase in the concentration of O-succinyl-L-homoserine, which could help push material toward 2KB synthesis. It would be nice if this could be verified by metabolomics.</p><p>2) Gels showing the purity of isolated enzymes should be included in the supplementary material.</p><p>3) Subsection “2-ketobutyrate biosynthesis from succinyl-homoserine” final paragraph and legend to Figure 5—figure supplement 1 – it is not correct to say that cysteine inhibits MetB. Cysteine is a substrate for MetB. It doesn't really inhibit cleavage of O-succinyl-L-homoserine to 2KB and succinate. It's just that the intermediate formed by reaction of O-succinyl-L-homoserine with the PLP cofactor at the active site of the enzyme is directed toward a different fate in the absence of cysteine.</p><p>4) In subsection “Disruption of MetC or a mutation in serine acetyltransferase enable steady 2-ketobutyrate production from succinyl-homoserine” – the text reports an apparent <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> for CysE and A33T CysE. According to the Materials and methods section, these enzymes were assayed with only a single concentration of substrates (20 mM serine and 0.2 mM acetyl CoA). In the absence of information about the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for each substrate for the wild-type and mutant enzymes, it is not obvious that the values measured are truly <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>, particularly if the Ala33Thr change has a significant effect on a <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic>. (This is mostly a concern for acetyl CoA, since the concentration of serine was quite high.) Also, for the purpose of interpreting the effect of the mutation, it is necessary to determine whether the enzyme is saturated in vivo (i.e. whether it is <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> or <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> / <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> that is the physiologically relevant parameter),</p><p>5) Subsection “Anaerobic 2KB biosynthesis from a reversible 2KB formate-lyase activity”: – activity should be given in terms of <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> rather than specific activity.</p><p>6) The KBFL pathway appears to be a major pathway for production of 2KB under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, it isn't really an underground pathway. Maybe it should be called an auxiliary pathway?</p><p>7) Proper terminology for the chemical intermediates should be used (e.g. succinyl homoserine should be O-succinyl-L-homoserine).</p><p>8) Subsection “Enzyme assays for MetB, MetC, and CysE” paragraph four: – a reference should be provided for the statement that lactate dehydrogenase can reduce 2KB.</p><p>9) Table 2 – <italic>∆ilvA ∆tdcB</italic> should be threonine deaminase deletion strain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54207.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors report that replicate cultures of ∆ilvA ∆tdcB <italic>E. coli</italic>, which lack both threonine deaminases, begin to grow at different times, yet genome sequencing reveals no mutations.

Reviewing the literature, we find consistent evidence that <italic>E. coli</italic>‘s intracellular concentration of both cysteine and homocysteine is ~0.3 mM (Wheldrake, 1967; Bennett et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2013).</p><p>Therefore, we performed additional experiments where we incubated the enzyme with Osuccinylhomoserine and physiological concentration of cysteine or homocysteine at 0.3 mM. We followed the two reactions by quantitatively determining the concentrations of succinate and 2KB over time by HPLC-MS/MS. When MetB is incubated with O-succinylhomoserine and 0.3 mM cysteine, the elimination reaction (reaction 1 in Figure 5) is completely inhibited as long as cysteine is present and only begins once all the cysteine is used up. Homocysteine (0.3 mM) seems to have a weaker inhibitory effect on the cleavage reaction. All relevant graphs are presented in Supplementary Figures 1B-E and hopefully give a clearer picture of how cysteine and homocysteine work in repressing the elimination reaction of this enzyme.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is impossible to measure K<sub>i</sub> values for cysteine and homocysteine for the inhibition of O-succinylhomoserine cleavage to succinate and 2KB by MetB (reaction 1 in Figure 5). Cysteine and homocysteine can both be used as substrates themselves in the MetB replacement reactions (the standard reaction marked by the black arrow in Figure 5 and the 2KB producing reaction labelled 2 in Figure 5 respectively) and for cysteine, it has been reported that the replacement reaction is performed with a 65fold increased turnover rate compared to the elimination reaction (Aitken, S.

Novel continuous assays for the elimination and substitution reactions, <italic>Biochemistry.</italic> 42, 11297-306). This makes it impossible to investigate the inhibitory effect of cysteine and homocysteine, particularly at low concentrations as they are converted quickly.</p><p>We have amended the text to reflect the new results:</p><p>“Supporting previous studies, we found MetB to catalyze the cleavage of succinyl-homoserine to 2KB (reaction 1 in Figure 5) with <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> = 9.3 ± 0.4 s<sup>-1</sup>, <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> (succinyl-homoserine) = 0.60 ± 0.08 mM, and thus <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>/ <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> (succinyl-homoserine) = 16 ± 2 mM<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). Yet, it was previously reported that cysteine inhibits succinyl-homoserine cleavage. We therefore characterized the cleavage reaction in the presence of either cysteine or homocysteine (as an alternative substrate), at physiological concentrations of ~ 0.3 mM and at artificially high concentrations of 3-6 mM. We found that cysteine indeed inhibits the cleavage of succinyl-homoserine at physiological concentrations, while homocysteine inhibited the reaction only at high concentrations (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B-E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “A latent aerobic isoleucine biosynthesis pathway” paragraph four: is it ok to ignore flux through the pentose phosphate pathway when considering labeling patterns after growth on 13C-labelled glucose?

The incubation of MetB with O-succinylhomoserine as sole substrate leads to succinate and 2-ketobutyrate. The latter is readily reduced by commercial lactate dehydrogenase under the consumption of NADH. Therefore, the MetB activity can be coupled to lactate dehydrogenase by following the NADH consumption at 340 nm. Spectrophotometric coupling assays are easier to perform than discontinuous HPLC-MS/MS assays and are generally used to determine enzyme kinetics in this manner.</p><p>The text for all MetB, MetC, and CysE assays is now as follows:</p><p>“The MetB elimination reaction (red arrow, reaction 1 in Figure 5) was kinetically characterized using a spectrophotometric assay.

Paragraph five says that &quot;succinate, pyruvate and 2-ketobutyrate in the enzymatic assays were quantitatively determined by LC/MS/MS. This statement is not consistent with the described use of lactate dehydrogenase.”</p></disp-quote><p>Lactate dehydrogenase readily reduces 2-ketobutyrate. We used commercially available rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase, which was reported to show a 50-fold lower catalytic efficiency with 2ketobutyrate compared to pyruvate as substrate (Kim and Whitesides, 1988). This efficiency is still sufficient for the coupling assay. We tested different concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase in the assay to ensure that the coupling enzyme activity is in excess compared to MetB activity.</p><p>Unfortunately, the statement that we measured succinate, pyruvate and 2-ketobutyrate by HPLC-MS/MS is misleading as a generality, but is technically true and has been altered for clarity. The lactate dehydrogenase coupling assay was only used for the MetB elimination reaction (reaction 1 in Figure 5) or the MetC reaction with homocysteine or methionine (reaction 5 or 6 in Figure 5). The replacement reactions of MetB with cysteine or homocysteine (black arrow reaction &amp; reaction 2 in Figure 5) were analyzed by measuring succinate generation by HPLC-MS/MS. When incubating MetC with cystathionine two reactions can take place, the cleavage to 2-ketobutyrate and cysteine or the cleavage to pyruvate and homocysteine (reaction 4 or the black arrow in Figure 5).

It seems logical that decreasing the concentration of cysteine would increase the rate of cleavage of O-succinyl-L-homoserine to 2KB and succinate. However, the mutation appears to decrease the cysteine concentration by only 44%. (There is enough variability in the data that this is not a totally convincing finding; the p value for the difference between the ∆5 and the ∆5 cysE* strains is 0.16.) In other data, the authors show that, in the presence of cysteine, O-succinyl-L-homoserine is converted entirely to cystathionine and succinate (the normal intermediates in the methionine synthesis pathway). Therefore, it would not be expected that O-succinyl-L-homoserine is cleaved to 2KB and succinate in vivo in the presence of a substantial amount of cysteine. Can the authors come up with a good explanation? For example, is it possible that both the CysE mutation and the metC deletion lower methionine levels, which then would lead to increased transcription of metB? Decreasing MetC activity might also lead to an increase in the concentration of O-succinyl-L-homoserine, which could help push material toward 2KB synthesis. It would be nice if this could be verified by metabolomics.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers have raised an excellent point here.</p><p>1) We note that the p-value for the difference between the ∆5 and the ∆5 <italic>cysE</italic>* strains is not significant mainly since throughout the paper we chose the most stringent statistical test: rank sum test, which does not assume anything regarding the distribution of values. Furthermore, the p-value for the difference between the WT and the ∆5 <italic>cysE</italic>* strains is significant. Since, the cysteine concentrations in the WT strain and ∆5 strain are very similar, overall the trend of lower cysteine concentration in the ∆5 <italic>cysE</italic>* strain seems correct.</p><p>2) We further note that while our results clearly show that cysteine suppresses the cleavage of O-succinyl-L-homoserine, we cannot easily interpret the exact concentration of cysteine at which this suppression is substantially relieved. It is more than possible that reducing cysteine concentration by a half is sufficient to enable substantial rate of O-succinyl-L-homoserine cleavage.</p><p>3) Yet, despite the above, we agree with the reviewers that the data might seems to be not conclusive. Hence we performed the experiments suggested.</p><p>4) We used HRES-LC-MS to quantify the concentrations of methionine and O-succinyl-Lhomoserine. We found that, as compared to the WT and ∆5 strains, in the ∆5 ∆<italic>metC</italic> and ∆5 <italic>cysE</italic>* strains the concentration of methionine was 2- to 3-fold lower and the concentration of O-succinyl-L-homoserine was 3-fold higher (∆5 ∆<italic>metC</italic> strain) or even &gt;30-fold higher (∆5 <italic>cysE</italic>* strain) (see new Figure 6A). [Unfortunately, we could not determine the exact concentrations of cysteine using this method as cysteine was too unstable for this particular measurement.]</p><p>5) We performed qPCR experiments that found that the transcript levels of <italic>metA</italic> and <italic>metB</italic> were indeed increased in the ∆5 <italic>cysE</italic>* strain (relative to the WT and ∆5 strains) (see new Figure 6B).</p><p>We therefore added the following sections to the manuscript:</p><p>Regarding <italic>metC</italic>:</p><p>“It therefore seems that a lower metabolic flux towards methionine biosynthesis, as expected by the deletion of <italic>metC</italic>, enhances the side reactivity of the pathway enzymes and results in a higher conversion rate of O-succinyl-L-homoserine to 2KB. Indeed, we found that, as compared to the WT and Δ5 strains, in the Δ5 Δ<italic>metC</italic> strain the concentration of methionine was ≈3-fold lower (Figure 6A), while the concentration of O-succinyl-L-homoserine was ≈3-fold higher (Figure 6A).

Cysteine is a substrate for MetB. It doesn't really inhibit cleavage of O-succinyl-L-homoserine to 2KB and succinate. It's just that the intermediate formed by reaction of O-succinyl-L-homoserine with the PLP cofactor at the active site of the enzyme is directed toward a different fate in the absence of cysteine.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and following this comment, we remove any reference of inhibition of MetB.

According to the Materials and methods section, these enzymes were assayed with only a single concentration of substrates (20 mM serine and 0.2 mM acetyl CoA). In the absence of information about the K<sub>m</sub> for each substrate for the wild-type and mutant enzymes, it is not obvious that the values measured are truly k<sub>cat</sub>, particularly if the Ala33Thr change has a significant effect on a K<sub>m</sub>. (This is mostly a concern for acetyl CoA, since the concentration of serine was quite high.) Also, for the purpose of interpreting the effect of the mutation, it is necessary to determine whether the enzyme is saturated in vivo (i.e. whether it is k<sub>cat</sub> or k<sub>cat</sub> / K<sub>m</sub> that is the physiologically relevant parameter),</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point, following which we have kinetically characterized both CysE and its mutant as a function of acetyl-CoA and L-serine concentrations. CysE was significantly impaired by the A33T mutation, affecting the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> as well as the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value for acetyl-CoA. The <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> value decreased from 350 ± 30 s<sup>-1</sup> in the WT to 170 ± 30 s<sup>-1</sup> in the CysE A33T variant. This difference is less drastic than the 10-fold reduction in catalytic turnover we described previously at a single concentration of substrates (20 mM serine and 0.2 mM acetyl-CoA). This can be explained by the significant effect of the A33T mutation on the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of acetyl-CoA (0.6 ± 0.2 for CysE WT versus 5 ± 2 for the CysE A33T variant), as correctly pointed out by the reviewer. At physiological acetyl-CoA concentrations, 0.6-0.75 mM (Bennett et al., Nat Chem Biol, 2009), the sharp increase of <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> is expected to have a strong effect on enzyme kinetics.</p><p>We amended the text accordingly:</p><p>“Despite the mutation occurring far from the active site, we found that the apparent <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> of the enzyme decreased two-fold, from 350 ± 30 s<sup>-1</sup> to 170 ± 30 s<sup>-1</sup>, while the affinity towards acetyl-CoA decreased by more than 8-fold, as the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> increased from 0.6 ± 0.2 mM to 5.0 ± 2.0 mM (interestingly, <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for serine changed only slightly from 0.8 mM in the WT to 0.5 mM in the mutant). As the concentration of acetylCoA in <italic>E. coli</italic> lies in the range 0.6-0.75 mM, the increase in <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for acetyl-CoA directly affects the reaction rate. Overall, the Ala33Thr mutation is expected to decrease the rate of the CysE reaction by more than 17-fold under physiological conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “Anaerobic 2KB biosynthesis from a reversible 2KB formate-lyase activity”: activity should be given in terms of k<sub>cat</sub> rather than specific activity</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ comments, we have added also the <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> values to Table 1, assuming 100% activation of PFL and TdcE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The KBFL pathway appears to be a major pathway for production of 2KB under anaerobic conditions.
