that cannot be targeted with specific promoters. We develop an improved genetic code expansion system in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and use it to create a photoactivatable Cre recombinase. We laser-activate Cre in single neurons within a bilaterally symmetric pair to selectively switch on expression of a loxP-controlled optogenetic channel in the targeted neuron. We use the system to dissect, in freely moving animals, the individual contributions of the mechanosensory neurons PLML/PLMR to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch response circuit, revealing distinct and synergistic roles for these neurons. We thus demonstrate how genetic code expansion and optical targeting can be combined to break the symmetry of neuron pairs and dissect behavioural outputs of individual neurons that cannot be genetically targeted.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal behaviour and movement emerges from the stimulation of nerve cells that are connected together like a circuit. Researchers use various tools to investigate these neural networks in model organisms such as roundworms, fruit flies and zebrafish. The trick is to activate some nerve cells, but not others, so as to isolate their specific role within the neural circuit.</p><p>One way to do this is to switch genes on or off in individual cells as a way to control their neuronal activity. This can be achieved by building a photocaged version of the enzyme Cre recombinase which is designed to target specific genes. The modified Cre recombinase contains an amino acid (the building blocks of proteins) that inactivates the enzyme. When the cell is illuminated with UV light, a part of the amino acid gets removed allowing Cre recombinase to turn on its target gene.</p><p>However, cells do not naturally produce these photocaged amino acids. To overcome this, researchers can use a technology called genetic code expansion which provides cells with the tools they need to build proteins containing these synthetic amino acids. Although this technique has been used in live animals, its application has been limited due to the small amount of proteins it produces. Davis et al. therefore set out to improve the efficiency of genetic code expansion so that it can be used to study single nerve cells in freely moving roundworms.</p><p>In the new system, named LaserTAC, individual cells are targeted with UV light that ‘uncages’ the Cre recombinase enzyme so it can switch on a gene for a protein that controls neuronal activity. Davis et al. used this approach to stimulate a pair of neurons sensitive to touch to see how this impacted the roundworm’s behaviour. This revealed that individual neurons within this pair contribute to the touch response in different ways. However, input from both neurons is required to produce a robust reaction.</p><p>These findings show that the LaserTAC system can be used to manipulate gene activity in single cells, such as neurons, using light. It allows researchers to precisely control in which cells and when a given gene is switched on or off. Also, with the improved efficiency of the genetic code expansion, this technology could be used to modify proteins other than Cre recombinase and be applied to other artificial amino acids that have been developed in recent years.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetic code expansion</kwd><kwd>non canonical amino acids</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>Cre recombinase</kwd><kwd>photo-caged amino acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-StG-679990</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greiss</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007155</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105181009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chin</surname><given-names>Jason W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007155</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_A024_1008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chin</surname><given-names>Jason W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome-Trust University of Edinburgh Institutional Strategic Support Fund ISS2</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greiss</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greiss</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greiss</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Louis Jeantet Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chin</surname><given-names>Jason W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Herchel Smith Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radman</surname><given-names>Inja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Global Award and Principal's Career Development PhD studentship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xi</surname><given-names>Zhiyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A method combining optimised genetic code expansion and optogenetics allows dissection of neural circuits with single-cell precision in freely moving animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic code expansion offers the ability to introduce, during translation, functionalities into proteins beyond those offered by the set of canonical, naturally occurring amino acids. This is achieved by providing orthogonal translation components: an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) paired with a cognate orthogonal tRNA, and assignment of a codon to determine the site of incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chin, 2017</xref>). The genetic code of several single and multicellular systems has been expanded to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2018a</xref>). <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> was the first multicellular organism in which genetic code expansion was established, and the incorporation of ncAA has been demonstrated in multiple <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greiss and Chin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parrish et al., 2012</xref>). Currently available orthogonal systems, however, often lack the efficiency required to fully harness the possibilities offered by genetic code expansion, especially in multicellular systems. A large variety of non-canonical amino acids are available for in vivo use, among them photocaged amino acids, which can be used to confer light-activated control over the function of proteins in a host organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courtney and Deiters, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Sequence-specific DNA recombinases, such as Cre and FLP, have become transformative for controlling gene expression in many systems, including worms, flies, and vertebrates, by irreversibly activating or deactivating target gene expression. Indeed, the photo-induced reconstitution of split recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schindler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawano et al., 2016</xref>) might be used to optically target recombinase activity to a single cell. However, the sensitivity of this technique can be hampered by high background levels of light-independent recombinase activity. Moreover, these systems are induced using blue light, rendering their use incompatible with most optogenetic and imaging applications, and requiring cells to be kept in the dark, complicating their use in transparent model systems. Recently, genetic code expansion methods were used to create photocaged versions of Cre in cultured mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2018b</xref>). In photocaged Cre, an orthogonal aaRS/tRNA<sub>CUA</sub> pair is used to replace a catalytically critical tyrosine or lysine residue in the active site of Cre with a photocaged tyrosine or lysine residue, resulting in a catalytically inactive enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2018b</xref>). The photocaging group can then be removed through a short exposure to 365 nm UV light, activating Cre recombinase, which in turn activates expression of its target genes. We set out to create an optimised photocaged Cre system that enables the optical activation of gene expression in single cells in an animal. The precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression offered by photocaged Cre would have a wide range of applications by allowing the expression of genes of interest in single cells or combinations of cells. Applied to control, for example, optogenetic channels or other neuromodulatory proteins, it could be a transformative tool in neurobiology.</p><p>Defining the molecular and cellular basis of behaviour is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. <italic>C. elegans</italic> contains 302 neurons, for which the physical connectivity has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White et al., 1986</xref>). This physical map provides a conceptual framework within which to design experiments to understand the signal processing properties of neural circuits that define behaviour. Central to this endeavour are methods for the spatiotemporal control of gene expression that enable precise perturbations to be effected in individual cells or combinations of cells and thereby advance our understanding of cellular contributions to circuit function. Two thirds of the neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> exist in bilaterally symmetric (left and right) pairs, and similar gross morphological symmetries are seen in the nervous systems of many other animals. A central question is whether and how this morphological symmetry is broken to produce functional asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Troemel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wes and Bargmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hobert et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Tissue-specific promoters (alone or in combination) can be used to target groups of cells. However, this approach offers only limited precision, and in many cases appropriate promoters are unavailable; especially in scenarios when investigators aim to limit expression to a single cell or a defined subset of cells. This is particularly limiting in neuroscience studies where the goal is to couple neuronal activity of single neurons or a defined subset of neurons with functional output. Where specific promoters for targeting individual neurons are unavailable, laser ablation can be used to remove specific neurons, but this technology is not compatible with studying intact circuits. Optogenetic approaches using targeted illumination have been applied to stimulate groups or pairs of cells, and track resulting behavioural outputs in freely moving <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leifer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stirman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kocabas et al., 2012</xref>). However, without a means of precisely defining expression of optogenetic tools, this approach is technically very challenging as it requires specialised software and hardware tools for real-time tracking and targeting and does not lend itself to isolating single cells in neuronal pairs. Similar obstacles are encountered in other systems, where the solution often also requires technically challenging approaches utilising targeted illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here we describe the optimisation of genetic code expansion for ncAA incorporation and the optimisation of a photocaged Cre recombinase variant (optPC-Cre) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The combination of these advances allows us to optically control gene expression with unprecedented precision and over 95% efficiency in a population of animals (compared to less than 1% efficiency before optimisation). By using a microscope-mounted 365 nm laser, we photo-activate Cre and thereby control gene expression in single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We name this approach <bold>Laser T</bold>argeted <bold>A</bold>ctivation of <bold>C</bold>re-Lox recombination (LaserTAC). LaserTAC is fast and within the technical capabilities of any lab currently able to perform laser ablation, allowing easy generation, in a single session, of dozens of animals with defined expression patterns for use in downstream experiments. We demonstrate the utility of LaserTAC by using it to target the expression of optogenetic channels to individual <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch sensory neurons within a left/right pair (PLML and PLMR). These individual neurons cannot be targeted by other methods, and our approach allows us to study their contribution to behaviour for the first time. Our results reveal that the PLM neurons act in synergy to produce a robust touch response requiring input from both neurons. Furthermore, the individual neurons within this pair make asymmetric contributions to the touch response, suggesting distinct roles for PLMR and PLML in the habituation to repeated stimulation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic code expansion and LaserTAC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A non-canonical amino acid, e.g. photocaged lysine (PCK), is charged onto the orthogonal tRNA<sub>CUA</sub> by the orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNAsynthetase (top left). The orthogonal components do not interact with the native cellular amino acids, tRNAs, or aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetases (bottom left). After charging, PCK is incorporated into the expanding polypeptide chain in response to an amber stop codon (UAG) during ribosomal translation. The resultant polypeptide is released following translation resulting in full-length photocaged Cre containing the PCK residue. (<bold>B</bold>) Photocaged Cre recombinase is activated cell-specifically in single <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons by uncaging the PCK in its active site using a 365 nm laser.

The charging of the ncAA onto the tRNA<sub>CUA</sub> occurs mainly in the cytoplasm, and efficient charging is therefore dependent on cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase availability.</p><p>The orthogonal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)/tRNA(Pyl) pair from archeal <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> species is the most versatile and widely used pair for genetic code expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2018a</xref>). The PylRS/tRNA(Pyl) pair is functional in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and variants exist that recognise photocaged amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greiss and Chin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gautier et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>When expressed in eukaryotic cells, PylRS is localised predominantly to the nucleus due to a stretch of positively charged amino acids in the N-terminal domain, which is interpreted as a nuclear localisation sequence by the eukaryotic nuclear import machinery. Accordingly, addition of a rationally designed strong nuclear export sequence (S-NES) to the PylRS N-terminus was reported to significantly increase the efficiency of ncAA incorporation in mammalian cells by increasing the amount of cytoplasmic PylRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikić et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To test this approach in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> we added the reported S-NES to the N-terminus of PCKRS, a PylRS variant optimised for incorporating photocaged lysine (PCK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gautier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We used the ubiquitous <italic>C. elegans</italic> promoter <italic>sur-5p</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yochem et al., 1998</xref>) to drive S-NES::PCKRS expression and <italic>rpr-1p</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Parrish et al., 2012</xref>) to drive tRNA(Pyl)<sub>CUA</sub> expression. To assay PCK incorporation efficiency, we used a dual-colour incorporation sensor; a ubiquitously expressed GFP::mCherry fusion, with the two fluorophore coding sequences separated by an amber stop codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greiss and Chin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For this reporter, translation in the absence of PCK leads to termination at the amber stop codon, resulting in production of only GFP. Conversely, in the presence of PCK, tRNA(Pyl)<sub>CUA</sub> is charged with the ncAA and acts as a nonsense suppressor, resulting in production of the full-length GFP::mCherry fusion protein, which includes a nuclear localisation sequence and an HA tag at its C-terminus. However, we did not detect any significant difference in incorporation between worms expressing unmodified PCKRS and S-NES::PCKRS. In fact, incorporation levels when using the S-NES::PCKRS construct appeared to be lower than with unmodified PCKRS (constructs ‘no NES’ and ‘S-NES’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Efficiency of genetic code expansion is enhanced in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by use of NES::PCKRS variants and tRNA(C15).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wildtype PylRS/PCKRS (top) contains an internal nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) which targets it to the nucleus.

As expected, the S-NES::PCKRS::GFP fusion localised to the cytoplasm, while unmodified PCKRS::GFP was almost entirely nuclear, reflecting that the S-NES was able to efficiently shift PCKRS localisation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (constructs ‘no NES’ and ‘S-NES’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesised that the S-NES tag itself might impinge on PCK incorporation efficiency.

These features reduce compatibility with the endogenous translational machinery, which limits ncAA incorporation in mammalian cells. However, ncAA incorporation efficiency in cultured mammalian cells can be improved by introducing mammalian tRNA elements into the archaeal tRNA(Pyl) or by using engineered mitochondrial tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serfling et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate whether the same approach might improve ncAA incorporation efficiency in other eukaryotes, we tested an improved tRNA variant in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> system. Specifically, we co-expressed the mitochondrial tRNA based variant C15, previously validated in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Serfling et al., 2018</xref>) together with the GFP::mCherry incorporation reporter, and the two most efficient synthetase variants described above (namely Smad4-NES::PCKRS or PKIα-NES::PCKRS).

All protein coding components were driven by a <italic>glr-1p</italic> promoter, an orthologue of human GRIA1 (glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 1). This promoter is active in glutamatergic neurons, including command interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maricq et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The 63% activation rate was a vast improvement relative to the 1% we observed with unmodified PCKRS and tRNA(Pyl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Improving photocaged Cre recombinase</title><p>To further improve the photoactivation method, we next turned to PC-Cre optimisation. When using amber stop codons for ncAA incorporation, the tRNA<sub>CUA</sub> competes with endogenous release factors. This competition results in a mixture of full-length polypeptides, with ncAA incorporated, as well as truncated polypeptides due to translational termination at the amber stop codon. As assessed with the GFP::mCherry incorporation reporter, we show that the percentage of full-length protein is between 4% and 5% when using the improved Smad4-NES::PCKRS/tRNA(C15) incorporation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). It is likely that, similar to the fluorescent reporter, the majority of translation events of the PC-Cre mRNA will also terminate at the internal amber stop codon, even in the presence of PCK. A Cre protein truncated at the amber stop codon in position 201 is missing the majority of its active site, but the parts of Cre responsible for the protein-protein interaction required for active Cre tetramer formation are still present, as are large parts of the DNA binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 1997</xref>). We initially based PC-Cre on previously reported Cre constructs, which contain an N-terminal SV40 NLS in addition to the internal NLS native to Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>), thus ensuring localisation of the enzyme to the nucleus. We cannot exclude the possibility that truncated Cre, which locates to the nucleus due to the NLSs upstream of position 201, may interfere with tetramer formation or DNA binding.</p><p>We aimed to utilise the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nuclear import machinery to enrich for full-length product in the nucleus. Since Cre acts on nuclear DNA, we reasoned that we could boost PC-Cre activity by lowering the fraction of truncated PC-Cre while increasing the fraction of full-length PC-Cre present in the nucleus. To this end, we removed both NLSs upstream of position 201 by introducing a R119A mutation disabling the internal NLS sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le et al., 1999</xref>) and by removing the N-terminal SV40 NLS. To restore nuclear import for full-length PC-Cre only, we attached the strong <italic>C. elegans</italic> EGL-13 NLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lyssenko et al., 2007</xref>) to the Cre C-terminus to create optimised PC-Cre (optPC-Cre) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). When we compared optPC-Cre to PC-Cre, we indeed found that target gene activation was significantly improved: from 63% for PC-Cre to 97% for optPC-Cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We saw no expression of the ChR2::mKate2 target gene without PCK or UV activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>).</p><p>We next performed behavioural assays to assess whether our system allowed optical control of neurons. After activation of optPC-Cre, we waited 24 hr to achieve sufficient expression of ChR2::mKate2, which we confirmed by visual inspection under a dissecting fluorescence microscope. When we exposed worms to 470 nm blue light to activate ChR2, we observed clear reversals in worms expressing ChR2::mKate2 in the presence of the ChR2 cofactor all-trans-retinal (ATR). In animals expressing ChR2::mKate2 in the absence of ATR, we did not observe such reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

When we compared strains expressing PC-Cre and optPC-Cre, respectively, we saw the strongest and most robust responses in the strains where optPC-Cre was used to control expression of ChR2::mKate2, followed by strains using non-optimised PC-Cre, but using the efficient Smad4-NES::PCKRS/tRNA(C15) incorporation system.

The members of the PLM neuron pair, PLML and PLMR, show a striking asymmetry in their connections within the worm connectome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>). PLMR forms chemical synapses connecting it to 10 downstream neurons including the AVA and AVD interneuron pairs, which are involved in driving backward locomotion. In addition to chemical synapses, PLMR also forms gap junctions to PVCR, PHCR, and LUAR. PLML, on the other hand, is connected to the touch response circuit exclusively through gap junctions, formed with the interneurons PVCL, PHCL, and LUAL. In fact, PLML does not form any chemical synapses, with the exception of a single connection to HSNL, a neuron involved in the control of egg laying. Asymmetric wiring of PLML and PLMR has been proposed to influence the <italic>C. elegans</italic> tap response, a withdrawal reflex that integrates information from the anterior and posterior mechanosensory neurons. In worms with ablation of both PLM neurons and the single PLMR neuron, a tap stimulus increased backward movement. In contrast, ablating PLML had no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wicks and Rankin, 1995</xref>).</p><p>As we saw no difference between PLML and PLMR in the response to strong stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), we decided to test the animals' responses to weaker stimulation of the PLM neurons. For this, we reduced the duration of the 617 nm light pulse from 1 s to 0.1 s and delivered varying low intensities, starting at 3 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, the lowest setting that was possible with our setup. While the 0.1 s, 3 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> stimulus was sufficient to elicit a response in animals expressing Chrimson in both PLMs, neither PLML nor PLMR animals reacted, indicating a synergistic effect of PLML and PLMR and the requirement for activation of both neurons to elicit a reaction in response to weak stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>When we increased illumination intensity, we saw a striking difference appear between the responses to PLML and PLMR stimulation, respectively. Animals expressing Chrimson in PLMR showed a robust reaction to stimulation at 14 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and higher. In contrast, the response of PLML animals was consistently below that of PLMR or 2PLM animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Only at the highest intensity setting of 74 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> did we observe animals of all three expression patterns responding robustly to the stimulus. The observed differences in response for PLML and PLMR are not due to differential expression of Chrimson::mKate2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), therefore they are likely due to the asymmetric connectivity of the two neurons within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrate a robust, improved method for highly efficient ncAA incorporation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our optimised ncAA incorporation system will provide the means to introduce a wide range of new chemical functionalities into proteins, such as crosslinkers, bioorthogonal groups, and post-translational modifications, and serve as a catalyst for new approaches to manipulate and understand cellular biology in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis and Chin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lang and Chin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Young and Schultz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker and Deiters, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, since our optimisation approach is based on components that are not specific to <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we expect that it will be easily exportable to other organisms.</p><p>The genetic code expansion approach relies on the use of an amber stop codon to direct incorporation of ncAA, which means that endogenous TAG codons may be inadvertently suppressed by the orthogonal system, albeit likely at low levels. Interestingly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other organisms have evolved natural surveillance mechanisms to mitigate against the read-through of stop codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arribere et al., 2016</xref>), which will also mitigate against any potential effects caused by our system. Indeed, we find that the function of the mechanosensory neurons we assay is unaffected by the presence of the orthogonal ncAA incorporation machinery.</p><p>We demonstrate the utility of our system by creating LaserTAC, which is based on an optimised photoactivatable Cre recombinase and offers several unique advantages for optical control of gene expression. First, the recombinase activity is tightly controlled; the presence of the photocaging group completely blocks activity and upon photoactivation, highly efficient wildtype Cre is generated. Second, following photoactivation, the photocaged amino acid required for amber stop codon suppression can be removed. Thus translation of full-length Cre ceases, leaving worms devoid of photocaged Cre for subsequent biological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maywood et al., 2018</xref>). Third, due to the stability of the photocaging group at longer wavelengths, our photoactivatable Cre is fully compatible with imaging and optogenetic methods that use visible light.</p><p>We used LaserTAC to switch on optogenetic channel expression in individual neurons within a bilaterally symmetric pair that cannot be targeted by genetic means. Switching on gene expression using LaserTAC is fast and easily enables the preparation of dozens of animals for downstream experiments. Light activation requires only a microscope-mounted laser, generally used for ablation in most <italic>C. elegans</italic> laboratories, modified to emit light at 365 nm. Generating the required transgenic strains is straightforward and at present involves the introduction of the genetic constructs, followed by genomic integration. The power of the method we present here lies in the versatility it offers, not only in respect to the ability to investigate single neurons. Once a transgenic strain is made, any combination of neurons targeted by the promoter that was used can in principle be investigated. This removes the requirement for the creation of a potentially large numbers of lines by allowing multiple conditions to be investigated using a single strain. A further advantage offered by our approach is the ability of precise temporal control, which is generally not available using promoter-based systems.</p><p>We demonstrate the capabilities of LaserTAC by targeting expression of the optogenetic channel Chrimson to the mechanosensory PLM neurons. This enables us to analyse the individual contributions of the neurons PLML and PLMR to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> tail touch circuit response. Since we target expression of the optogenetic channel, we can perform behavioural assays by globally illuminating a plate of freely moving animals.</p><p>We found that PLML and PLMR show some redundancy in triggering the tail touch response after strong stimulation. However, using weaker stimuli, we found that only stimulation of both neurons elicits a response, indicative of a synergistic rather than a simply redundant role for PLML and PLMR. Interestingly, our results demonstrate asymmetric contributions of PLML and PLMR to the touch response. Considering the electrical and chemical connectome of this circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), our results are consistent with a model where the touch response is controlled by two parallel pathways that rely on gap junctions or chemical synapses, respectively. The first pathway involves direct connections of both PLM neurons to the PVC interneurons via gap junctions. Activation of the PVCs through these gap junctions triggers forward motion. The PVCs form connections with forward command interneuron AVB as well as inhibitory connections with backward command interneurons AVA/AVD. The second pathway involves chemical synaptic transmission from PLMR onto AVA and AVD, inhibiting backward locomotion. Thus, when only PLMR is stimulated, both pathways are activated, resulting in a stronger response, whereas when PLML alone is stimulated only the gap junction pathway is activated, resulting in a weaker response. Unlike the PLMs, the PVCs are connected to each other by gap junctions and may thus act as electrical sinks for signals from the PLMs. This could help to explain the requirement for stronger stimulation of the single neurons, especially for PLML, to trigger a response as compared to the stimulation of both PLMs simultaneously. Stimulation of both PLM neurons together results in full activation of the gap junction pathway by activating both PVC neurons, which, together with the direct inhibition of AVA/AVD by PLMR, results in full activation of the tail touch motor response. The strong synergistic effect we observe with the simultaneous stimulation of PLML and PLMR indicates a requirement for the stimulation of both PVC neurons.</p><p>While we focused here on expression of optogenetic channels in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, simple extensions of our method will enable the cell-specific expression of other desired transgenes of interest. By inserting loxP sites into genomic loci using CRISPR/Cas9, it should be possible to control, at single-cell resolution, the expression of any endogenous protein, such as neuropeptides, receptors, innexins, proteins involved in synaptic transmission, etc. Since the components we employ are functional in other <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greiss and Chin, 2011</xref>) and indeed in other model systems such as zebrafish, fruit fly, mouse, cultured cells, and ex vivo tissues, we anticipate that our method will have broad applicability beyond the nervous system and beyond <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

After uncaging, worms were transferred to seeded NGM plates and scored for expression of the target gene 24 hr later by counting the animals showing expression of the red fluorescent marker. 400 μM FUDR was added to plates after uncaging to prevent hatching of F1 progeny and thus aid scoring of animals expressing the target gene. All plates were scored twice, independently by two people. Scoring was performed blind. Experiments were performed three times, each with two independent transgenic lines. Significance tests were carried out using Welch’s t test as a pairwise comparison between each condition at each concentration using GraphPad Prism 8 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Uncaging for Cre activation in single neurons</title><p>Worms were grown on 4 mM PCK from the L1 stage. For uncaging, worms were mounted on a 3% agar and immobilised with 25 mM NaN<sub>3</sub> in M9 buffer. Targeting was performed on a Zeiss M2 Imager using a Micropoint Galvo module (Andor Technology/Oxford Instruments), fitted with a 365 nm dye cell. Neurons were identified using GFP as a guide, which was co-expressed with photocaged Cre, and the nucleus targeted with the laser. Each region was swept thrice using 10 repeat firing. The manual attenuator was set to full power and the Andor software attenuator to a power of 34 (we chose the power setting so that partial bleaching of GFP could be observed during Micropoint firing). After uncaging, the coverslip was removed and worms were washed off the pad onto seeded 6 cm plates using M9 + 0.001% Triton-X. Mock laser treatment control worms were mounted and recovered similar to experimental worms but without exposure to the Micropoint laser.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavioural assays</title><p>Immediately after uncaging, worms were transferred to NGM plates supplemented with ATR (30 μl 5 mM ATR dissolved in ethanol were added to the lawn of a seeded 6 cm NGM plate) or control NGM-only plates. Worms were left to recover on plates for 24 hr after uncaging.</p><p>Plates for behavioural assays were made approximately 1 hr before use. Fresh 6 cm NGM plates were seeded with a 20 μl drop of dilute OP50, prepared from freeze-dried OP50 (LabTIE). For this, the freeze-dried bacteria were reconstituted according to the manufacturer’s instructions and a 40× dilution of the reconstituted bacteria was used to spot the plates. The lawn was then surrounded by a copper ring (inner diameter 17 mm) to prevent worms from leaving the camera field of view. For experiments on PLM, expression of the target gene after optPC-Cre laser activation was visually confirmed using a Leica M165FC fluorescence microscope fitted with a 2.0× objective and animals showing the correct pattern (either both neurons or individual neurons, depending on the uncaging experiment) were picked onto the behaviour plates. For experiments using the <italic>glr-1p</italic> promoter, animals were randomly picked. After transfer, worms were left to acclimatise on behaviour plates for at least 10 min. Behavioural assays were carried out using a WormLab system (MBF Bioscience). Chrimson or Channelrhodopsin2 were activated using either the integrated 617 nm LED or 470 nm LED of the WormLab platform at full power (74 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> or 150 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively), unless otherwise stated.</p><p>Tracking of worm behaviour was carried out using WormLab software (MBF Bioscience). For each worm, tracks detected by the WormLab software were consolidated into a single track. Data points where individual animals were not clearly identified by the software were discarded.</p><p>For all behavioural experiments, worms were grouped into cohorts. A cohort consisted of 4–10 animals undergoing the same treatment simultaneously on the same plate.</p><p>Behavioural experiments on worms expressing ChR2 from the <italic>glr-1p</italic> promoter were carried out by exposing worms to 1 s of 470 nm illumination at 150 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Reversals were counted manually. The reversal percentages were determined for each replicate. Significance between conditions was tested using a Mann–Whitney U test.</p><p>Experiments using repeated stimulation of animals expressing Chrimson::mKate2 in the PLM neurons were carried out by exposing worms to repeated 1 s long stimulations with 617 nm light (74 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) at 30 s intervals. Raw speed data was binned and averaged at 1 s intervals for each animal. Worms were grouped by cohort. To determine the fraction of animals responding to a stimulus, worms with an average speed ≥100 μm s<sup>–1</sup> in the 2 s following stimulation were scored as responders. The 100 μm s<sup>–1</sup> threshold was selected as it constitutes the standard deviation of the mean speed of unstimulated worms. For each timepoint, the percentage of worms responding was determined for each cohort, constituting one replicate. Comparison between conditions was carried out by two-way ANOVA across all stimuli.</p><p>Experiments comparing conditions across different power levels for animals expressing Chrimson::mKate2 in the PLM neurons were carried out by subjecting each cohort of worms to 0.1 s stimulation with 617 nm at the indicated power levels. The percentage of worms responding for each cohort was calculated after first normalising the data by subtracting the mean speed for each individual worm in the 0.5 s immediately prior to stimulation. Then the mean velocity for each individual worm was determined for the response peak between 0.2 s and 1.2 s after stimulation. Worms were scored as responders if the mean normalised velocity was ≥ 100 μm s<sup>–1</sup>.</p><p>When calculating the mean normalised velocity across experiments, the mean velocity among all animals within a cohort was determined first, followed by calculating the average of the mean velocities across cohorts. Significance for both analyses (fraction responding/intensity and mean velocity/intensity) was determined by two-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis and statistics</title><p>All statistical analysis of data was carried out in GraphPad Prism 8.

expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors express a photocaged Cre recombinase via incorporation of a photoactivatable amino acid through genetic code expansion, followed by uncaging in defined cells via optical targeting. They use this method to demonstrate distinct contributions of the left/right members of a bilateral neuron pair to mechanosensory behavior. With suitable validation in multiple tissue types, and confirmation that the endogenous physiology of the expressing cells remains unaffected as a consequence of the genetic code manipulation, this method could be broadly applicable.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Precise optical control of gene expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using genetic code expansion and Cre recombinase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Henrik Bringmann (Reviewer #2).</p><p>As you can see in the detailed reviews below, both reviewers are very appreciative of your findings, but also identified a number of shortcomings that will need to be addressed. Apart from some easily addressable editorial issues, there is a lack of quantification of the some of the results that we ask you to address. These suggestions are doable within the scope of a revision at <italic>eLife</italic> but the reviewers agree to give you some degree of freedom as to how you would like to incorporate these quantifications into your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Even though some cells are genetically indistinguishable, many of them are visually distinguishable; thus, optical labeling and/or modulation of these cells are effective methods to distinguish individual cells. The authors have used two light-dependent techniques for the precise spatio-temporal regulation of single-cell activity: the light-dependent activation of the Cre transcription factor in a single neuron (spatial regulation) to express the light-dependent cation channel Chrimson and the light-dependent activation of Chrimson in the neurons of behaving worms at specific times (temporal regulation). Moreover, to achieve the clear activation of Cre, which had been difficult to achieve in the past, they have used the genetic code expansion technique in transgenic strains of an animal species for the first time (if I have understood correctly).</p><p>In my opinion, this method would be ideal for the precise spatio-temporal regulation of protein activity (and as a result, cell activity) if it works as designed. The biggest potential barrier would be the equal and effective incorporation of non-conventional amino acids (ncAAs) into all the cells in the animal as well as into the targeted protein. The authors have made a number of efforts and have reasonably evaluated the incorporation of ncAAs into the protein, although the evaluation of the incorporation of ncAAs into different types of cells is, unfortunately, far from satisfactory.</p><p>In addition, the data presentation is, in many cases, not quantitative; for example, sample numbers are not properly described, and only one picture per condition is provided for gene expression analysis. These need to be addresses to ensure reproducibility and general application of the results.</p><p>1) For the system to work, PCKRS, mt tRNA (C15), and Cre (TAG amber) need to be properly expressed in the cells. In addition, ncAAs should also be incorporated into the cells. I would like to see if this was actually observed in most, if not all, of the cells. Examples have been shown in Figure 2d and 2e, but these photos depict only a single worm per condition. Please analyze many more worms (I would recommend {greater than or equal to}10 worms per condition in total, including those from multiple transgenic lines grown on different days) and show the results in the form of a bar graph or a table. Additionally, it will be greatly appreciated if the authors are able to show whether the system works equally in different tissues, such as neurons, intestines, muscles, and hypodermis.</p><p>2) Related to above: Does the expression of these genes, in addition to ncAA incorporation, affect worm behavior? I think that addressing this question is important because truncated Cre is likely to be expressed in an amount {greater than or equal to}20 times higher than that of full-length PC-Cre (lines 250-256, Figure 2f). I would appreciate it if the authors could compare some basic aspects of worm locomotion, such as velocity and turning frequency, between the wild-type and the transgenic strains.</p><p>3) In this study, the clear-cut regulation of the activity of the gene product is critical. Nevertheless, the results have not been provided in a quantitative form. For example, the western blot shown in Figure 2c is, again, just one representative result. It should be repeated several times and the band intensities should be quantified and expressed as mean {plus minus} SEM, as shown in Figure 2f and 2g. (For Figure 2f, please describe the number of replicates).</p><p>4) Similarly, some data are shown only in the video. As mentioned previously, they should be reported using graphs showing the results for a certain number of samples (e.g., lines 277-279, Sup. video 1, 2).</p><p>5) lines 383-385 &quot;We saw strong, easily visible expression&quot;: It was not clear which data support this statement. Further, describe how many worms were analyzed and how many worms were fluorescence-positive.</p><p>6) &quot;more than 50 fold&quot; and &quot;close to 100%&quot; (line 442): Again, these statements were not supported by evidence. At least, the link with specific data was not clear at all. These non-quantitative statements should be reworded to be more quantitative.</p><p>7) As mentioned above, in the figure legends, please describe how many worms were studied and how many were fluorescence-positive, instead of the number of replicates. The description provided in lines 637-640 is insufficient.</p><p>8) Sup. Table 2 (strains): Please specify the figure panels in which each strain was used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Greiss and Chin labs developed a system for optically activating Cre recombinase specifically in neurons that are exposed to UV-laser light, providing a tool to control gene expression in individual neurons for which there is currently no specific genetic targeting possible. They use a clever combination of incorporation of a photoactivatable artificial amino acid through genetic code expansion with photoactivation of Cre recombinase through precise optical targeting. They demonstrate the feasibility of their approach by targeting command interneurons and individually each neuron of a left-right pair of mechanosensory neurons for optogenetic activation. They demonstrate that the two mechanosensory PLM neurons have synergistic roles in the response to mechanical sensation but that each neuron plays a distinct role in the processing of the mechanical stimulus.</p><p>The method apparently is more complicated to carry out than just using a transgenic strain directly off the plate, with the expression of several components, feeding an unnatural amino acid, and the need to optically target each individual cell manually to achieve expression. Despite this extra effort that is required to perform a genetic targeting experiment, however, this method will be useful when each of a pair of two individual neurons needs to be investigated. Future developments of the method might help simplify the procedure. The effects of the complex manipulations on the neurons and their physiology should be investigated by control experiments.</p><p>Overall, the method of targeting individual neurons in a model organism is of substantial use for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> community. Likely there will be much to be learned from targeting individual neurons. Also, the method should be transferable to other genetically accessible and transparent systems such as zebrafish, and could thus become of broader use.</p><p>In summary, this is a very elaborate and smart approach to address an important technical problem in neuroscience and I support publication. I have the following comments:</p><p>1. To help other labs getting started with this method there should be a supplementary detailed step-by-step protocol for how to carry out the procedure.</p><p>2. It is not quite clear why the PLM neurons show different responses to stimulation. Is this caused by gene expression or connectivity? This could be discussed more deeply. It might help to draw a circuit diagram for the PLM and motor circuit that shows the differences of the two neurons.</p><p>3. The authors should discuss the effects that potential read-through of endogenous termination signals might have. How would this affect the physiology of the cell, especially during development? Would it theoretically be necessary and if yes feasible that some or all of the amber codons are replaced by TAA codons in future studies? This could be discussed.</p><p>4. The expression of the orthogonal translation system and the potential read-through of amber stop codons in endogenous genes poses a concern as to the effects on the physiology of the neurons. To mitigate such concerns regarding a new method it would be important to test whether after the complex manipulations the neurons have retained most of their physiological characteristics. Both the glr-1 command interneurons and mechanosensitive neurons are well characterized in terms of behavior and calcium activity. Thus, control experiments should be performed that test for the functionality of these cells. For example, do the worms still respond normally to anterior and posterior touch based on behavioral and calcium activity readout?</p><p>5. At present, the text is quite complicated to read, in particular for readers that want to only use the method and might not be interested in how the many technical challenges were overcome. Thus, some of the description of the optimization in the results part could go into the methods section and in the main text only a short summary of what was optimized could be described. This would help make this piece more accessible to a broad readership.</p><p>6. The authors establish the photoactivatable Cre system for glr-1-expressing neurons. They do not test, however, whether this strain allows cell-type specific activation. The glr-1 promoter expresses in both forward (such as PVC) and reverse command interneurons (Such as AVA) (Brockie et al. 2001). But a specific promoter for PVC that expresses only in this neuron is still not reported in the literature. It should be easy for the authors to activate only PVC and demonstrate a forward escape response when illuminating the entire animal. This would provide a proof of principle that their method can allow expression in a type of neurons that has been previously refractory to specific genetic control and would underscore the importance of the method.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67075.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) For the system to work, PCKRS, mt tRNA (C15), and Cre (TAG amber) need to be properly expressed in the cells.

Furthermore, all western blots were done using lysates from randomly selected animals. The quantitative western blots in Figure 2F were done using the lines shown in 2E, as well as a further independent line for each genotype. The western blot shown in Figure 2G was also done using the same lines shown in 2E. The incorporation experiments in 2F were performed in triplicate (performed on different days) and each sample was blotted and measured twice. This information is now included in the figure legend. We have added as a supplement to Figure 2 an enlarged version of the &quot;PKIa-NES/tRNA(C15)&quot; and &quot;Smad4-NES/tRNA(C15)&quot; panels in figure 2E to make it more apparent that we show multiple animals in the image.</p><p>We and others have previously published papers describing genetic code expansion in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Greiss and Chin, JACS 2011; Parrish et al., ACS Chemical Biology 2012), showing that ncAA incorporation works in different tissues. We now refer to this in the discussion and reference the previous work. In the enlarged panels from Figure 2E, which we have added as a supplement (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1C), it is clearly visible that incorporation occurs globally, in multiple cell types. Furthermore, genetic code expansion has, since we first demonstrated it in C. elegans, been established for several multicellular organisms including fruit fly, zebrafish, mouse, Arabidopsis, where incorporation of ncAA has also been demonstrated in different tissues for these organisms. Our manuscript presents modifications to the pyrrolysyl-tRNA-synthetase / tRNA pair, which is central to the genetic code expansion method, and we show that we thereby improve efficiency of the pair within the context of the C. elegans translational machinery. We expect this basic machinery to be the same in all C. elegans cells, albeit factors such as ncAA availability and expression levels of the genetic components may vary between cell types. We quantify the improvements to the system directly, using a fluorescent GFP::mCherry reporter that is expressed using a ubiquitous promoter, and by assessing its efficacy as a biological tool in different neuronal cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to above: Does the expression of these genes, in addition to ncAA incorporation, affect worm behavior? I think that addressing this question is important because truncated Cre is likely to be expressed in an amount {greater than or equal to}20 times higher than that of full-length PC-Cre (lines 250-256, Figure 2f). I would appreciate it if the authors could compare some basic aspects of worm locomotion, such as velocity and turning frequency, between the wild-type and the transgenic strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a soft touch assay performed on the lines used for the behavioural assays shown in Figure 5, which express the genetic code expansion machinery and photocaged Cre in the touch receptor neurons. The touch assays were performed in the presence and in the absence of PCK, showing that neuronal function is not affected by the expression of truncated Cre, nor by any effect of PCK incorporation. We also performed touch assays 24h after uncaging of animals grown on PCK. We include these data in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1. With our assays we show that it is clearly possible to express the genetic code expansion machinery and photocaged Cre recombinase at sufficient levels for the system to work efficiently without inhibiting cellular function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In this study, the clear-cut regulation of the activity of the gene product is critical. Nevertheless, the results have not been provided in a quantitative form. For example, the western blot shown in Figure 2c is, again, just one representative result. It should be repeated several times and the band intensities should be quantified and expressed as mean {plus minus} SEM, as shown in Figure 2f and 2g. (For Figure 2f, please describe the number of replicates).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included quantification of incorporation efficiency for the genotypes in Figure 2C, which we present in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1A.</p><p>Our rationale for originally not quantifying incorporation of all genotypes shown in 2C is as follows:</p><p>The first 5 genotypes in Figure 2C show the first step of our optimisation, namely finding the optimal NES sequence. Since two of the four nuclear export sequences tested appeared to reduce efficiency based on the western blot, we focused on the two best candidates for the quantification and further combined them with the optimised tRNAs.</p><p>We now also include the numbers of replicates for Figure 2C (each line was quantified in two independent experiments on different days) and Figure 2F (each line was quantified in three independent experiments on different days, and each lysate was measured twice on different blots). For Figure 2F we assayed two independent lines for each condition shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Similarly, some data are shown only in the video. As mentioned previously, they should be reported using graphs showing the results for a certain number of samples (e.g., lines 277-279, Sup. video 1, 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a quantification of the behavioural response shown in Videos 1 and 2 in Figure 3G and in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C. In addition to the line shown in the videos we have included lines expressing the non-optimised incorporation system and non-optimised PC-Cre. We assayed two independent lines for each condition in two independent experiments each. We have added a reference to the figures when we reference the videos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) lines 383-385 &quot;We saw strong, easily visible expression&quot;: It was not clear which data support this statement.

It is not quite clear why the PLM neurons show different responses to stimulation. Is this caused by gene expression or connectivity? This could be discussed more deeply. It might help to draw a circuit diagram for the PLM and motor circuit that shows the differences of the two neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a circuit diagram in Figure 5C. While the diagram does not include all synaptic connections between the neurons depicted, we focused on the main connections and the differences between PLML and PLMR. We believe that including all connections would make the diagram very difficult to interpret. We include a paragraph in the discussion (page 14) about the different responses we observe for PLML and PMR, which we indeed believe to be due to differences in connectivity.</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the responses may be due to differences in expression levels, we have added Figure 5 —figure supplement 3 showing quantification of expression in PLML and PLMR, determined by quantifying the mKate2 fluorescence of the Chrimson::mKate2 fusion protein. We see no differential expression of the optogenetic channel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should discuss the effects that potential read-through of endogenous termination signals might have. How would this affect the physiology of the cell, especially during development? Would it theoretically be necessary and if yes feasible that some or all of the amber codons are replaced by TAA codons in future studies? This could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the possibility of read-through of endogenous stop codons in the discussion (2nd paragraph in the discussion, page 13) and we have added a reference to a paper by the Fire lab, describing a natural mechanism employed by <italic>C. elegans</italic> to mitigate against stop codon read-through: Arribere, J. A. et al., (2016) ‘Translation readthrough mitigation’, Nature. Nature Publishing Group, pp. 1–17.

The expression of the orthogonal translation system and the potential read-through of amber stop codons in endogenous genes poses a concern as to the effects on the physiology of the neurons. To mitigate such concerns regarding a new method it would be important to test whether after the complex manipulations the neurons have retained most of their physiological characteristics. Both the glr-1 command interneurons and mechanosensitive neurons are well characterized in terms of behavior and calcium activity. Thus, control experiments should be performed that test for the functionality of these cells. For example, do the worms still respond normally to anterior and posterior touch based on behavioral and calcium activity readout?</p></disp-quote><p>We opted to address this point by quantifying behavioral readouts: we have performed soft touch assays to test for the functionality of the cells and we find that the touch receptor neurons still function normally, both in the absence and in the presence of PCK. We have also included animals grown on PCK and assayed 24h after uncaging, i.e. the exact treatment and timepoint we use to conduct the behavioural assays. The data are included in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1C.</p><p>In both neuronal classes, the TRN and glr-1, we can elicit the behaviour expected from the literature when optogenetically stimulating them. Calcium imaging would not be feasible in the strains we describe as we have the optPC-Cre in an operon with GFP and we express the optogenetic channel as an mKate2 fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. At present, the text is quite complicated to read, in particular for readers that want to only use the method and might not be interested in how the many technical challenges were overcome. Thus, some of the description of the optimization in the results part could go into the methods section and in the main text only a short summary of what was optimized could be described. This would help make this piece more accessible to a broad readership.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the manuscript is quite technical at times, and in the resubmitted version we have tried to edit it for clarity.</p><p>The readership of the paper will consist of researchers looking to use photocaged Cre as a tool in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but also researchers working in the genetic code expansion field or looking to use genetic code expansion in other applications. While we agree that for <italic>C. elegans</italic> groups wishing to use photocaged Cre, the first part of the paper may be of less interest, for those working in the genetic code expansion field, the first part may be more interesting than the second part. We would therefore prefer to keep a more detailed description of our optimisation approach in the main paper as it constitutes a major advance in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors establish the photoactivatable Cre system for glr-1-expressing neurons. They do not test, however, whether this strain allows cell-type specific activation. The glr-1 promoter expresses in both forward (such as PVC) and reverse command interneurons (Such as AVA) (Brockie et al. 2001). But a specific promoter for PVC that expresses only in this neuron is still not reported in the literature. It should be easy for the authors to activate only PVC and demonstrate a forward escape response when illuminating the entire animal. This would provide a proof of principle that their method can allow expression in a type of neurons that has been previously refractory to specific genetic control and would underscore the importance of the method.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose the PLM neurons as our proof-of-principle since they also cannot be targeted using a specific promoter. Using the PLMs, we have clearly demonstrated that we are able to target a neuronal pair, as well as the individual members of the pair.</p><p>Furthermore, we believe that due to the asymmetric downstream connectivity of PLML and PLMR, they represent an attractive first target for single cell optogenetics. We fully agree however, that the PVCs will indeed be interesting targets in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
