We aimed to investigate the structural rearrangements of rat P2X2 during ATP- and voltage-dependent gating, using a voltage-clamp fluorometry technique. We observed fast and linearly voltage-dependent fluorescence intensity (F) changes at Ala337 and Ile341 in the TM2 domain, which could be due to the electrochromic effect, reflecting the presence of a converged electric field. We also observed slow and voltage-dependent F changes at Ala337, which reflect structural rearrangements. Furthermore, we determined that the interaction between Ala337 in TM2 and Phe44 in TM1, which are in close proximity in the ATP-bound open state, is critical for activation. Taking these results together, we propose that the voltage dependence of the interaction within the converged electric field underlies the voltage-dependent gating.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>P2X2</kwd><kwd>voltage-clamp fluorometry</kwd><kwd>fluorescent unnatural amino acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 17H04021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kubo</surname><given-names>Yoshihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 20H03424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kubo</surname><given-names>Yoshihiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015120</institution-id><institution>Daiko Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andriani</surname><given-names>Rizki Tsari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A fluorometric analysis under voltage clamp shows the presence of a converged electric field in P2X2 channel with no canonical voltage-sensor and identifies the structural determinants for the voltage-dependent gating.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>P2X2 is a member of the P2X receptor family, a ligand-gated cation channel that opens upon the binding of extracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brake et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valera et al., 1994</xref>). P2X receptors consist of seven sub-classes (P2X1–P2X7) that assemble to form trimeric homomers or heteromers (e.g., P2X2/P2X3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Radford et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">North, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2003a</xref>). Based on known crystal structures, P2X receptors have two transmembrane (TM) domains (TM1 and TM2), a large extracellular ligand binding loop (ECD), which is the location of the ATP binding site, and intracellular N- and C- termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawate et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCarthy et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>P2X2 is mainly distributed in smooth muscle, the central nervous system (CNS), the retina, chromaffin cells, and autonomic and sensory ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burnstock, 2003</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the P2X2 receptor in hair cells and supporting cells has an important role in auditory transduction. A dominant negative polymorphism in human results in progressive hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, P2X2 in the cochlea is involved in adaptation to elevated sound levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Housley et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The P2X2 receptor has complex gating properties that consist of (1) [ATP]-dependent gating and (2) voltage-dependent gating. The latter is despite the absence of a canonical voltage sensor domain, in clear contrast to typical voltage-gated ion channels. In the presence of ATP, there is a gradual increase of inward current upon hyperpolarization. ATP shifts the conductance–voltage relationship toward depolarized potentials. Thus, activation of the P2X2 channel is voltage-dependent as well as [ATP]-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakazawa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou and Hume, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakazawa and Ohno, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujiwara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keceli and Kubo, 2009</xref>).

Previous studies have extensively investigated the roles of amino acid residues in TM1 and TM2 during ATP-dependent gating and permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haines et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khakh and Egan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Samways et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, there is limited information about the roles of amino acid residues, particularly those within TM domains, in voltage-dependent gating. A previous study identified positively charged amino acid residues in the ATP binding pocket (K69, K71, R290, and K308; <italic>r</italic>P2X2 numbering) and aromatic amino acid residues in TM1 (Y43, F44, and Y47; <italic>r</italic>P2X2 numbering), which are critical for ATP- and voltage-dependent gating of the P2X2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keceli and Kubo, 2009</xref>). However, those residues were not the only determinants of [ATP]- and voltage-dependent gating of the P2X2 receptor. The interpretation as to the mechanism is not yet straightforward and, thus, the key amino acid residue in the voltage sensing mechanism of the P2X2 receptor is yet to be discovered.</p><p>Moreover, the details of the structural rearrangements upon ATP binding in the pore region remain controversial.

Second, there are discrepancies between the crystal structures of the TM domains of <italic>zf</italic>P2X4 and <italic>h</italic>P2X3; <italic>h</italic>P2X3 has longer TM domains.

Thus, the present study aims at analyzing the structural rearrangements of the P2X2 receptor in (1) ATP- and (2) voltage-dependent gating, by voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF), using a fluorescent unnatural amino acid (fUAA) as a probe.</p><p>The combination of fluorometry and voltage-clamp recording offers a powerful method for analyzing real-time conformational changes within the ion channel structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mannuzzu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cha and Bezanilla, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pless and Lynch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakajo and Kubo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Talwar and Lynch, 2015</xref>). The use of an fUAA as a probe makes it possible to label any residue within the protein, including those in the lower TM and intracellular regions, which are not accessible by conventional VCF fluorophores, such as Alexa-488 maleimide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klippenstein et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, direct incorporation of the fUAA increases the labeling efficiency and also prevents non-specific labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakata et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The fUAA used here, <italic>3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)−2-aminopropionic acid</italic> (Anap), was incorporated into the <italic>r</italic>P2X2 protein by using a nonsense suppression method, in which the tRNA Anap-CUA and tRNA-synthetase pair is used to introduce Anap at an amber nonsense codon mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klippenstein et al., 2018</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

The electrochromic effect in some voltage-sensitive dyes is used to directly detect the change of membrane potential by attaching the dye to the cell membrane. If the fluorophore is directly attached in a site-specific manner within ion channels/receptors as shown by studies in the <italic>Shaker</italic> B K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asamoah et al., 2003</xref>) and M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dekel et al., 2012</xref>), the detection of electrochromic effect implies that there is a convergence of the electric field at the position where the fluorophore is attached. Thus, the observed fluorescence change at the position of A337 in the P2X2 receptor was explained to be due to the electrochromic effect, indicating that there is a focused electric field at A337 in the TM2 domain.</p><p>We noted that the G-V relationship for this mutant showed that a large fraction of the channel is already open, even at depolarized potentials, in 10 μM ATP, compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), because of the high density of the expressed channel, shown by a rather large current amplitude (&gt;20 μA). A previous study showed that P2X2 channel properties are correlated with expression density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujiwara and Kubo, 2004</xref>). In the case of lower expression levels, A337Anap showed a wildtype-like phenotype. For the purpose of VCF experiments, however, a high expression level is needed to observe a detectable fluorescence change, and thus we needed to use oocytes with high expression, resulting in a lesser fraction of voltage-dependent activation. Nonetheless, we could still observe a weak voltage-dependent relaxation during hyperpolarization, and thus this fluorescence change still reflects an event occurring at or around the position of A337 when the receptor senses the change in membrane voltage.</p><p>Similarly, the application of 300 nM SIK inhibitor to I341Anap resulted in a clearer (∆F/F = 0.6% ± 0.2 at 440 nm [n = 3], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and more frequent Anap ∆F/F (38.1 ± 9.2%; n = 5–9), compared to that without SIK inhibitor application (16.02 ± 0.6%; n = 6–13) upon voltage step application in 10 µM ATP. The fluorescence intensity changes also occurred almost instantaneously, in less than 5 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The ∆F/F–V relationship of I341Anap upon voltage step pulses in the presence of 10 μM of ATP, from +40 mV to −160 mV with a holding potential at −40 mV, also showed a linear voltage dependence (y = 0.007x + 0.03; R² = 0.99; n = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Thus, ∆F observed at the position of I341 in the TM2 domain also did not correlate with hyperpolarization-induced conformational change. The changes are likely to be due to a phenomenon similar to that observed at the position of A337, which is related to the electrochromic effect. The G-V relationship of this mutant in the presence of 10 μM ATP was not different from that of A337Anap, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>. Taking these results together, the observed fluorescence intensity changes at I341 and A337 in the TM2 domain are best explained by an electric field convergence close to both positions, which could be critical for the complex gating of the P2X2 receptor.</p><p>Since the Anap mutant scanning experiments were initially performed in the absence of an SIK inhibitor, there was a possibility that there were fluorescence changes which went undetected. Thus, we performed VCF recordings with SIK inhibitor treatment in some Anap mutants which had been screened before. The focus was on residues surrounding A337 and I341 in the TM1 and TM2 domains. In the re-screening experiments, we observed small ∆F at L334 and L338: L334Anap: ∆F/F = 0.38% ± 0.2 at 440 nm (n = 2), and L338Anap: ∆F/F = 0.26% ± 0.03 at 440 nm (n = 4), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Moreover, the incidence of fluorescence change detection for L338Anap in three batches (20 cells in total) was 2/5, 0/5, and 2/10. For L334Anap it was 0/5, 0/10, and 2/6 in three batches (21 cells in total). These results suggest that the focused electric field might lie at TM2 from L334 down to I341, and that it is more strongly converged at A337 and I341, because the electrochromic signal at A337 and I341 was observed more frequently.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Fluorescence change of Anap at A337 upon voltage change was also observed in the absence of ATP and was [ATP]-dependent</title><p>To ensure that the fluorescence changes observed at A337 upon voltage change were not due to a change of ion flux, as in the case of the K2P K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schewe et al., 2016</xref>), recording was performed in the absence of ATP.

VCF recording in the absence of ATP for A337Anap/R313F showed a remarkable ∆F/F with mostly closed channels when voltage step pulses were applied (∆F/F = 2.6% ± 0.3 at 440 nm; n = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>). 30 μM ATP application resulted in smaller ∆F/F than in 0 ATP (∆F/F = 1.7% ± 0.2 at 440 nm; n = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>). These results confirmed that ∆F/F at the position of A337 is larger in the absence of ATP than in the presence of ATP. It was of interest to know whether or not the concentration of ATP affects ∆F/F at A337. Therefore, a higher concentration of ATP (100 μM) was used in a similar series of experiments.

There is a possibility that the P2X2 receptor could undergo relatively minor but important structural rearrangements in response to hyperpolarization of the membrane voltage, after the major structural rearrangements caused by the binding of ATP. A fraction of a slow ∆F and non-linear ∆F/F–V has not been detected so far. This might be due to suppression of voltage-dependent activation in high-expression oocytes, in which there is significant activity even at depolarized potentials (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,H</xref>).

Taken together, these results further show that the slow component of the fluorescence intensity changes reflects structural rearrangements of the P2X2 receptor, which depend on both [ATP] and voltage.</p><p>Additionally, results consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F,H, and I</xref> were also obtained in terms of the fluorescence intensity change of the fast component. ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F in the absence of ATP was larger than in the presence of ATP (∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F = 4.4% ± 0.5 at 440 nm [n = 6] and ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F = 1.7% ± 0.3 at 440 nm [n = 6]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, there was a concern that F itself significantly changed due to a difference in the environment surrounding A337Anap in the closed and open states. We performed experiments to address this by measuring the absolute F (output of the photomultiplier tube) in the absence and in the presence of ATP. Using the K308R/A337Anap construct, each recording was repeated five times, for averaging, in the same cell as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. There was a slight reduction, not increase, in the F in the presence of ATP, which could be due to fluorescence bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Thus, a larger ∆F/F in the absence of ATP is thought not to be due to less F, and we concluded that ∆F/F was larger in the absence of ATP. The noise level is similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), showing that the apparent larger noise level in 0 ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, F, and I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H,K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) is not due to smaller F but due to a lower number of averaged traces.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>A337 in TM2 might interact with F44 in TM1 to stabilize the open state of the P2X2 receptor</title><p>The electric field convergence at A337 and I341 and the voltage-dependent conformational changes at or around A337 could provide us with a clue to understand the mechanism of the complex gating of the P2X2 receptor.

The most striking changes were observed in A337Y and A337F. The activation evoked by a voltage step was clearly different from wildtype, whereas the A337E mutation had a less severe effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). G-V relationships in 30 μM ATP for mutants and wildtype were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Normalization was based on the maximum conductance at the highest ATP concentration (300 μM) for each construct. Here we could also see that A337Y and A337F preferred to stay in the closed state. Thus, the alteration of activation kinetics and voltage dependence by mutation of A337 showed that this position is critical for the P2X2 receptor complex gating.</p><p>Next, we aimed to identify the counterpart in the TM1 domain with which A337 might have an interaction during complex gating.

Various single amino acid mutations were then introduced at F44, and the [ATP]- and voltage-dependent gating was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>).</p><p>The F44A mutation strikingly changed the gating. It showed a relatively high basal current in the absence of ATP and further responded to ATP application. Voltage-dependent gating was also changed, as seen in the lack of tail current, showing that this mutant might have constitutive activity with rectified permeation properties. Mutation to positively charged residues (F44R, F44K) resulted in a non-functional channel and/or a very low expression level, as the recording on day four did not evoke any response to the highest concentration of ATP used in this study (300 μM). Mutation to negatively charged residues (F44E, F44D) and aromatic residues (F44Y, F44W) remarkably changed the ATP-evoked response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). All four mutants still opened upon the application of ATP, but current decay in the continuous presence of ATP appeared to be faster than wildtype.</p><p>F44 is conserved only in P2X2 and P2X3, within the P2X family. Other subtypes of P2X receptor, such as P2X1, P2X4, P2X6, and P2X7, except P2X5, have valine at the corresponding position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawate et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the F44V mutation was also introduced. 10 μM of ATP could activate F44V but resulted in faster current decay than wildtype.</p><p>Voltage step pulses were applied during the course of current decay, because there was no clear steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Nonetheless, the effect of the mutation at F44V on the voltage-dependent gating could still be observed. The G-V relationship of F44V in 10 μM ATP showed that this mutant was far less sensitive to voltage than wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Taken together, the results of the mutations introduced at position F44 showed that this residue is critical for the proper ATP- and voltage-dependent gating of the P2X2 receptor.</p><p>Additionally, as the single amino acid mutations at both A337 and F44 altered the gating of P2X2, it was of interest to determine whether the introduction of swapped mutations into A337/F44 would rescue the wildtype phenotype. The phenotype of F44A/A337F was similar to F44A, and the wildtype phenotype was not rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible that an interaction between A337 and F44 could not be properly formed in the swapped mutant.</p><p>Next, an artificial electrostatic bridge was introduced between A337 and F44 to prove that the interaction between the two residues is critical in the ATP-bound open state. Various paired electrostatically charged residues were introduced into A337 and F44, in order to see if the artificial electrostatic bridge could be formed. The F44E/A337R pair showed constitutive activity. This double mutant was already open before ATP application and did not show any response to ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). When voltage step pulses were applied, this mutant lacked sensitivity to voltage, with a rectified permeation property, as seen by the total lack of tail currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Additionally, comparison of the current amplitude before and after ATP application showed that F44E/A337R was already open before ATP application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).

In the presence of ATP, voltage-dependent conformational changes occur, possibly at or around the position of A337 and F44, giving influence to the interaction between A337 and F44, which is critical for stabilizing the open state. Results of this study show that the origin of the voltage-dependent gating of P2X2 in the presence of ATP is possibly the voltage dependence of the interaction between A337 and F44 within the converged electric field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed initiation mechanisms of P2X2 receptor complex gating.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Top view structure of the P2X2 receptor in the closed (<bold>A</bold>) and ATP-bound open state (<bold>B</bold>).

It was very fast and showed a linear voltage dependence within the voltage range under study. The change could be well interpreted to be due to an electrochromic effect, indicating that there is an electric field convergence at both positions, which are located adjacent to each other.</p><p>An electrochromic signal is an intrinsic property exhibited by voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes or electrochromic probes to directly detect transmembrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Loew, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). By standard use of electrochromic probes in a lipid bilayer, it is difficult to detect the electrical potential that directly acts on the voltage-sensing machinery of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asamoah et al., 2003</xref>). This is because the local electric field at a certain position in the lipid bilayer is not steep enough. On the other hand, previous VCF studies on the <italic>Shaker</italic> K<sup>+</sup> channel, using modified electrochromic probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asamoah et al., 2003</xref>), and on the M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptor, using TMRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dekel et al., 2012</xref>), showed that an electrochromic signal could be observed when the fluorophore is directly attached to a specific position within the ion channel/receptor. These studies stated that this phenomenon did not report conformational changes of the protein at the site of fluorophore attachment, but rather implied that there is an electric field convergence if the electrochromic signal is observed only at positions adjacent to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asamoah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dekel et al., 2012</xref>). This observed electrochromic signal might indicate the possible location of a voltage sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asamoah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dekel et al., 2012</xref>). Further studies are certainly required to test this possibility.</p><p>An almost linear F-V relationship which might originate from the electrochromic signal was also reported from VCF studies in a canonical VSD-containing membrane protein called hTMEM266, labeled with MTS-TAMRA. The observed ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F was, however, explained rather differently. Even though the ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F was observed at most of the substituted positions located in the S3-S4 linker and the top of the S4 segment, it was stated that ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F was not due to a direct electrochromic effect but instead was associated with rapid voltage-dependent conformational changes on a µs time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Papp et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of hTMEM266, it is difficult to surmise that the fast change detected at many positions is due to electrochromic effect, because it suggests an unlikely possibility that the electric field is converged at various positions. Conversely, in the P2X2 receptor, there were only two adjacent positions which exclusively showed clear ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F and a linear F-V relationship.</p><p>In the hTMEM266 study, it was also a concern whether TAMRA-MTS could report an electrochromic signal, because there were not any previous findings to support this case. There were also no reports of electrochromic signals recorded using Anap as fluorophore. Anap has only been reported as an environmental sensitive fluorophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>). There are no reports that Anap is an electrochromic fluorophore, unlike the case of the modified fluorophore used in <italic>Shaker</italic> Kv studies, which has been reported to have electrochromic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asamoah et al., 2003</xref>). On the other hand, studies on the M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptor did not discuss TMRM fluorophore properties, but still concluded that the observed fast F change with linear F-V originated from the electrochromic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dekel et al., 2012</xref>). Even though other possibilities still remain, the most straightforward explanation to interpret the results observed in this study is that the very fast and linearly voltage-dependent fluorescence changes of Anap at A337 and I341 are associated not with the conformational changes of the P2X2 protein but presumably with the electrochromic signal. Consequently, the results show that there is an electric field convergence at these positions, which could give us a clue about the possible location of the voltage sensor in the P2X2 receptor.</p><p>We observed that ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F changed with voltage in both the closed and ATP bound-open states, implying the presence of the focused electric field in both states at the position of A337. ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F was larger in the absence than in the presence of ATP. One simple interpretation is that the focused electric field is stronger in the absence of ATP. However, as the environment of the fluorophore is different in the absence and presence of ATP, due to the difference in the crevice shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>), it is not possible to directly compare the strength of the focused electric field in the two states.</p><p>Some Cys accessibility studies were performed on the P2X2 receptor in the TM2 domain, to analyze the ATP-evoked gating mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kracun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2010</xref>). A337 Cys mutants were first reported to be not modified by MTSET both in the presence or absence of ATP, indicating that this residue is not involved either in the pore lining region in the open state or in the gate of P2X2, unlike I341 Cys mutants, which were modified by MTSET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Meanwhile in another study using Ag<sup>+</sup>, a smaller thiol-reactive ion with higher accessibility, A337C was modified both in the absence and presence of ATP, as well as I341C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2010</xref>). These results suggest that a narrow water phase penetrates down to these positions, which is consistent with the results in this study that there is a focused electric field at the position of A337 and I341.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Detection of slow F change with non-linear voltage dependence at A337 of K308R mutant</title><p>We obtained data supporting voltage-dependent conformational rearrangements occurring at or around the position of A337, by analyzing the mixed Anap fluorescence signal changes, which contain both ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F and ∆F<sub>Slow</sub>/F, in the presence of an additional mutation of K308R in A337Anap. K308 is located in the ATP binding site and was reported to be important not only for ATP binding but also for the gating of the P2X2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ennion et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2007</xref>). In VCF analysis, a high expression level is needed to detect ∆F successfully, because of the background fluorescence. However, high expression makes the P2X2 channel activate even in the absence of ATP and also even at depolarized potentials, that is, the G-V relationship is shifted to a depolarized potential, which makes the voltage-dependent activation upon hyperpolarization unclear. To overcome this problem, we introduced the K308R mutation, which shifts the G-V relationship in the hyperpolarized direction, with much reduced activity at depolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keceli and Kubo, 2009</xref>). By introducing the K308R mutation, we could observe voltage-dependent gating better and succeeded in recording the slow and voltage-dependent ∆F at A337 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the ∆F<sub>Slow</sub> component was observed only at hyperpolarized potentials and in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F-J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Also, the F<sub>Slow</sub>-V and G-V overlapped well, showing that ∆F<sub>Slow</sub> reflects the hyperpolarization-induced structural rearrangements around the position of A337 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). A337 in TM2 is indeed in the converged electric field, as shown by the linear F-V relationship of the ∆F<sub>Fast</sub> component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). It is possible that the voltage-dependent ∆F<sub>Slow</sub> observed at A337 might not directly reflect the presumably very fast movement of the ‘voltage-sensor’ in response to the change in membrane voltage but might report the secondary structural rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>The electric field convergence takes place at residues located in TM2, as shown by the observed Anap fluorescence changes at A337 and I341 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Minor changes were also observed at L334 and L338 by follow-up experiments with SIK inhibitor, after the initial screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on these results, the most frequently observed and the largest electrochromic signal was from A337. Voltage-dependent structural changes were also detected at or around A337. Although a possibility still remains that other residues are also involved but the changes were undetected due to technical limitations, all the results so far support the interpretation that the main focus for the voltage-sensing mechanism in the P2X2 receptor lies at or around A337.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Interaction between A337 in TM2 and F44 in TM1 in the converged electric field</title><p>The specific function of each transmembrane domain of the P2X receptor had been defined before the crystal structure was solved but the information as to the role of each TM in P2X2 voltage-dependent gating is limited.

In contrast, TM2 plays an essential role in permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakazawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khakh and Egan, 2005</xref>) and gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Mutations of A337 in the present study suggested that this position is critical for complex gating, as mutation to A337F and A337Y altered the channel gating as well as the activation kinetics upon the application of ATP and voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). The counterpart for A337 is most likely the F44 residue in TM1. Based on the homology modeling of P2X2, in the ATP-bound open state, F44 rotates and moves toward TM2, specifically into the proximity of A337 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Mutagenesis at the position of F44 showed the importance of F44 to maintaining the open state in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). Taken together, the results raised the possibility that F44 serves as a voltage sensor which has quadrupole moment due to its benzene ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dougherty, 1996</xref>). The aromatic side chain of F44 could have a permanent and non-spherical charge distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dougherty, 1996</xref>) that is expected to respond to voltage changes in the converged electric field.</p><p>The artificial electrostatic bridge in the F44E/A337R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G-I</xref>) induced constitutive activity in the absence of ATP and at all recorded voltages, confirming the importance of the interaction for the maintenance of the activated state. As F44 possibly serves as the voltage sensor, this interaction, which takes place in the converged electric field, may be influenced by the change in membrane voltage. The structural rearrangement at F44 is of very high interest, but F44Anap was not functional, further showing the critical role of F44.</p><p>There are several types of voltage-sensing mechanism in membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bezanilla, 2008</xref>): (1) charged residues, as in the case of canonical voltage-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swartz, 2008</xref>), (2) side-chains that have an intrinsic dipole moment, such as Tyr, as in the case of the M<sub>2</sub> muscarinic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Chaim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Navarro-Polanco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dekel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barchad-Avitzur et al., 2016</xref>), (3) the α-helix, with its intrinsic dipole moment, and (4) cavities within the protein structure, filled with free ions.</p><p>Based on our results, the interaction between A337 and F44 in the ATP-bound open state is under the influence of the converged electric field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-E</xref>), and the results of mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>) suggest that F44 might serve as a voltage-sensor due to its intrinsic quadrupole. The results also clearly demonstrate that there are voltage-dependent structural rearrangements in the proximity of A337 in TM2.</p><p>Our interpretation, based on this study, is that F44 possibly has a two-step voltage-dependent rearrangement, after moving into the proximity of A337 upon ATP application. (1) F44 quickly orients to A337 in the open state, which is stabilized better upon hyperpolarization. (2) The stabilization upon hyperpolarization, as the consequence of F44 voltage sensing, results in secondary structural rearrangements. The slow kinetics of fluorescence signal change at A337 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) might be the result of the second step of the voltage sensing mechanism by F44. Further analysis of the structural dynamics at the position of F44 will help to elucidate the detailed mechanism of the complex gating of the P2X2 receptor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> P2X2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brake et al., 1994</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>)</td><td><italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> voltage-sensing phosphatase (<italic>Ci-</italic>VSP)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakata et al., 2016</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>XL1-Blue</td><td>Agilent Technologies</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>TG1</td><td>Clontech</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pAnap (plasmid)</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Plasmid #48696</td><td>cDNA encoding the tRNA synthetase/Anap-CUA</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis</td><td>Agilent Technologies</td><td>200524</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>mMESSAGE T7 RNA transcription kit</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>AM1344</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>mMESSAGE SP6 RNA transcription kit</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>AM1340</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>0.15% tricaine</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Collagenase type 1</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>ATP disodium salt</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>34369-07-8</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Anap sodium salt</td><td>FutureChem Chemicals</td><td>FC-8101</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>HG 9-91−01/SIK inhibitor</td><td>MedChem Express</td><td>1456858-58-4</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Suramin sodium salt</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>129-46-4</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>PPADS tetrasodium salt</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>P178</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Igor Pro 5.01</td><td>Wavemetrics</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>PyMOL Molecular Graphics System ver. 2.3.0</td><td>Schrodinger LLC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000305">SCR_000305</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>OriginPro</td><td>OriginLab</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014212">SCR_014212</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism 9</td><td>GraphPad Software, Inc.</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SWISS-MODEL</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biasini et al., 2014</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_018123">SCR_018123</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Protter protein visualization</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Omasits et al., 2014</xref></td><td/><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wlab.ethz.ch/protter/start/">https://wlab.ethz.ch/protter/start/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>BioRender</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biorender.com/">BioRender.com</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_018361">SCR_018361</ext-link></td><td><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> created with BioRender</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS, Japan) and performed obeying its guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>Wild type (WT) <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> P2X2 (<italic>r</italic>P2X2) receptor cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brake et al., 1994</xref>) was subcloned into the BamH1 site of pGEMHE.

Two related issues raised by two reviewers which should be addressed textually.</p><p>The non-canonical voltage sensor in P2X2 channels is an intriguing question. This study suggests a voltage dependent conformational rearrangement in TM2, which is a significant finding. Nevertheless, the voltage sensor for this to happen is not identified. F44 could serve as the voltage sensor with its aromatic dipole moment. However, if F44 is the voltage sensor the fluorescence changes at A337 should measure the movement of F44 in response of voltage directly. How fast should this movement be? Isn't the time course of the fluorescence decrease in Figure 5 and 6 too slow for this process? If the fluorescence decrease, in Figure 5 and 6, is due to a slow overall structural rearrangement as the consequence of F44 sensing voltage, what is the expected voltage dependence of the changes in dipole moment?</p><p>I am not convinced that &quot;the main focus for the voltage-sensing mechanism in the P2X2 receptor lies at or around A337.&quot; (line 491-492) As the authors mentioned, the florescence changes at A337 and I341 are small and only occur in some oocytes tested, so it is possible that the changes at other residues went undetected. There is no flaw in the experimental design, but there are limitations imposed by the method and the behavior of the protein. P2X receptors are trimers, which means they have less fluorophores per channel compared to the tetramers or pentamers. In order to obtain decent fluorescence signal, channels were expressed at very high density in those experiments. Unfortunately, high channel density is known to diminish the voltage dependence of P2X receptor channels, making it difficult to detect voltage-dependent changes.</p><p>6. Another related issue raised by both reviewers.</p><p>Fluorescence changes at A337 were reduced by ATP (Figure 4). Since a higher ATP concentration is correlated with a larger current (Figure 4), fluorescence changes might be reduced by increases of currents. In Figure 5 and 6 the time dependent and non-linear fluorescence changes were accompanied by a time dependent current increase. In these experiments was the time dependent fluorescence decrease induced by the time dependent current increase, or the current increase was a result of the conformational change that was measured by the time dependent fluorescence decrease?</p><p>After a careful examination of the represented traces shown in figure 4 and figure 6, I am not sure one should directly compare the ΔF/F in the absence and presence of ATP to make the conclusion that &quot;the focused electric field at the position of A337 is stronger in the absence of ATP than in the presence of ATP.&quot; (Line 491-492) The noise of the fluorescence signal is always noticeably smaller in the presence of ATP suggesting a possible change in the F. In the hP2X3 receptor closed state structure, residue equivalent to A337 is more than 5Å from that equivalent to F44 in TM1. This part of TM2 is separated from TM1 and Anap incorporated at A337might be surrounded by some lipids in the closed state. In the presence of ATP, when channel opens, this part of TM2 gets close to TM1, where A337 and F44 can interact. Anap incorporated at A337 could be shielded by TM1 in the open state. As one can imagine, those structural rearrangements during channel opening could very likely change the environment for Anap at A337. It would not be meaningful to directly compare ΔF/F recorded in different environment where the fluorophores have inconsistent behavior. I do understand VCF recording was repeated 20 times for each sample in the presence of ATP and only 5 times in the absence of ATP. The difference of noise could also result from the average of different number of traces. Either way, I would suggest the authors to address the difference.</p><p>7. The small size of the slow ΔF shown in figure 5 could potentially lead to inaccurate data analysis. It would be better if there are more evidence to support that the slow ΔF results from voltage dependent conformational change in the protein. As previously reported by the Kubo lab, the voltage dependent activation time constant varies with different ATP concentrations. It will be a great supporting evidence if the time constant of the slow fluorescence change vary with ATP concentration.</p><p>8. Why was I341 not studied further? If it is because of technical difficulties with small signals, then we cannot rule out its role in voltage sensing and it should be discussed. Additionally, previous findings from Kubo's lab have demonstrated that mutations at T339 and G342 can completely abolish the voltage dependence, suggesting possible involvement of those residues as well.</p><p>9. Please provide numbers for the readers to understand how many oocytes were tested and how many showed the change for the statement: &quot;the incidence of fluorescence change detection is also low&quot; (Line 120). The numbers should also be provided later when the authors talk about increase in the incidence of detectable ΔF/F after SIK inhibitor treatment.</p><p>10. Is there any correlation between the current size and the detectable ΔF/F? Is it because the channel density is too high for some oocytes to show any voltage dependent change?</p><p>11. There is no information about the dose-response of ATP activation for any of the construct tested. What is the rationale for choosing the concentrations used in the experiments?</p><p>12. It's shown on Supplementary Table I that no voltage-dependent F change was detected for any residue in TM1 but &quot;n.d.&quot; was used to indicate the ATP evoked F change for six residues. What does &quot;n.d.&quot; mean exactly and why couldn't it be determined?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65822.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We agree with the reviewers that it is important to demonstrate that the currents evoked by ATP in this study are P2X2 channel specific currents. We have added data showing that ATP-evoked currents of the three most important constructs in this study, namely A337Anap, I341Anap and K308R/A337Anap, could be blocked by non-specific blockers of P2X2 receptor, Suramin and PPADS (Figure 1—figure supplement 1; Figure 5—figure supplement 1). The data confirmed that the ATP-evoked currents of these constructs were indeed P2X2 channel specific currents. We could not use a specific blocker of P2X2 (e.g., NF770 or PSB-10211), since they are not commercially available and it takes time to synthesize the specific blocker on demand.</p><p>We added sentences to the result section in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>“ATP-evoked currents of both constructs were inhibited by the P2X2 receptor non-specific blockers, Suramin and PPADS (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), confirming that the currents are indeed P2X2 receptor currents.”</p><p>“ATP-evoked current of K308/A337Anap was inhibited by both Suramin and PPADS, the P2X2 non-specific blockers, confirming that the current is indeed a P2X2 receptor current (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The current and fluorescence of all the positions listed in table 1 should be shown.

The current and the fluorescence traces of the positions where we were able to observe voltage-dependent fluorescence response are previously shown in Figure 1 E, F in the manuscript (for A337Anap and I341Anap, respectively). We agree with the reviewers that it is important to show the readers recordings of current and fluorescence of Anap mutant scanning experiments. In the revised version of the manuscript, we added current and fluorescence recordings of some important positions listed in table 1. We covered all the transmembrane regions, as these regions are thought to be potentially important for the non-canonical voltage-sensing mechanism. The new figures are added as Figure 1—figure supplement 2 (for transmembrane 1 region) and Figure 1—figure supplement 3 (for transmembrane 2 region).</p><p>We added a sentence to the result section in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>“Voltage-dependent F changes could not be detected at other scanned positions in TM1, TM2 or other regions (Figure 1—figure supplement 2, 3; Supplementary file 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The interaction between A337 and Phe 44 as a primary determinant of voltage-sensing is a bit confounding. None of them are charged and it is not clear what makes this interaction voltage-sensitive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comments. We agree that the way we explained about the interaction between A337 and F44 was rather vague. From the results of the artificial bridge formation experiments, we showed that the interaction between the A337 position and the F44 position stabilizes the open state of P2X2 receptor (Figure 7G-I). The way of writing that the interaction between A337 and F44 is the primary determinant for voltage-sensing was too strong. Thus, we revised the discussion to re-phrase our interpretation.</p><p>First, we previously assumed that this interaction could be voltage sensitive because F44 interacts with A337 in the focused electric field (Figure 3; Figure 7C, D; Figure 7G-I; Figure 8A, B). Second, the interpretation for the interaction between A337 and F44 is that the interaction might be a CH-π interaction which had been found to play an important role in the protein structure stability (Brandl et al., 2001). This correlates well with our experimental data showing that the interaction of A337 and F44 is important for stabilizing the open state of P2X2 receptor.</p><p>Voltage sensitivity itself is thought to come from F44 as phenylalanine has quadrupole moment from its aromatic (benzene) ring which resulted in a permanent and non-spherical charge distribution (Dougherty, 1996). Thus, we interpreted the results as follows. ATP binding makes F44 rotates and interacts with A337 in the focused electric field. And, as F44 possibility serves as the voltage sensor, this interaction may be influenced by the change in the membrane voltage.</p><p>We revised the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“Taken together, the results raised the possibility that F44 serves as a voltage sensor which has quadrupole moment due to its benzene ring (Dougherty, 1996). The aromatic side chain of F44 could have a permanent and non-spherical charge distribution (Dougherty, 1996) that is expected to respond to voltage changes in the converged electric field.</p><p>The artificial electrostatic bridge in the F44E/A337R mutant (Figure 7G – I) induced constitutive activity in the absence of ATP and at all recorded voltages, confirming the importance of the interaction for the maintenance of the activated state. As F44 possibility serves as the voltage sensor, this interaction, which takes place in the converged electric field, may be influenced by the change in membrane voltage. The structural rearrangement at F44 is of very high interest, but F44Anap was not functional, further showing the critical role of F44.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For electrochromic response, the strength of the local electric field can be estimated using the slope of linear Fluorescence voltage relationship. Is this slope dependent on the expression level?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the strength of the local electric field can be estimated using the slope of linear F-V relationship. However, to convert the electrochromic slope into an electric field strength, a calibration to determine the relative sensitivity between two dyes is needed in in-vitro reconstitution system (e.g., the first one is Anap which is incorporated at a specific site in the protein of interest, and the second one is electrochromic fluorescence dye located freely in the cell membrane). Therefore, it was not possible to solely use the slope of linear F-V relationship without the calibration which gives a correction factor. There is also another factor to be considered. It is the background fluorescence of the oocytes which differs from batch to batch. In the high protein expression case, the slope of VCF recording could look steeper, but this does not necessarily imply that the local electric field is stronger. The steeper slope could be due to a relatively lower level of background fluorescence. Even if the expression level is similarly high, if the background fluorescence is different, the observed slope of linear F-V relationship could appear to be different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Based on our main findings, there are voltage-dependent structural rearrangements in the proximity of A337 in TM2 (Figure 5). We understand that F44 could serve as the voltage sensor. As F44 rotates into the vicinity of A337 in the presence of ATP, this raised a possibility that F44 serves as voltage sensor by its quadrupole moment due to its benzene ring (Dougherty, 1996). Consequently, this makes the aromatic side chain of F44 to have a permanent and non-spherical charge distribution that is expected to respond to voltage changes in the converged electric field (Dougherty, 1996).</p><p>However, as the reviewers pointed out, we also noted that the voltage-dependent fluorescence changes observed at A337 might not necessarily report the presumably fast movement of F44 in response to the change in membrane voltage. As shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2F, the activation speed of fluorescence in 300 µM was, similar to, not faster than that of the current. Please note that due to the large noise and small fluorescence signal, the trustable fitting for fluorescence traces could only be achieved in -160 mV.</p><p>Our interpretation is that F44 possibly has two-step voltage-dependent rearrangements after it underwent a conformational change to the proximity of A337 upon ATP application: (1) F44 quickly orients to A337 in the open state which is stabilized better upon hyperpolarization (2) The stabilization upon hyperpolarization as the consequence of F44 voltage sensing results in secondary structural rearrangements. The relatively slow kinetics of fluorescence signal change at A337 (Figure 5 and 6 in the manuscript) might be the result of the second step of voltage sensing mechanism by F44.</p><p>We therefore revised the discussion as follows.</p><p>“In addition, the ∆F<sub>Slow</sub> component was observed only at hyperpolarized potentials and in the presence of ATP (Figure 5F – J; Figure 6). Also, the F<sub>Slow</sub> – V and G-V overlapped well, showing that ∆F<sub>Slow</sub> reflects the hyperpolarization-induced structural rearrangements around the position of A337 (Figure 5E; Figure 5J). A337 in TM2 is indeed in the converged electric field, as shown by the linear F – V relationship of the ∆F<sub>Fast</sub> component (Figure 5D). It is possible that the voltage-dependent ∆F<sub>Slow</sub> observed at A337 might not directly reflect the presumably very fast movement of the “voltage-sensor” in response to the change in membrane voltage but might report the secondary structural rearrangements (Figure 5A, F, Figure 5—figure supplement 2, Figure 6A).”</p><p>“Based on our results, the interaction between A337 and F44 in the ATP-bound open state is under the influence of the converged electric field (Figure 8A – E), and the results of mutagenesis studies (Figure 7E, F) suggest that F44 might serve as a voltage-sensor due to its intrinsic quadrupole. The results also clearly demonstrate that there are voltage-dependent structural rearrangements in the proximity of A337 in TM2.</p><p>Our interpretation, based on this study, is that F44 possibly has a two-step voltage-dependent rearrangement, after moving into the proximity of A337 upon ATP application. (1) F44 quickly orients to A337 in the open state, which is stabilized better upon hyperpolarization (2) The stabilization upon hyperpolarization, as the consequence of F44 voltage sensing, results in secondary structural rearrangements. The slow kinetics of fluorescence signal change at A337 (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 2, Figure 6) might be the result of the second step of the voltage sensing mechanism by F44. Further analysis of the structural dynamics at the position of F44 will help to elucidate the detailed mechanism of the complex gating of the P2X2 receptor.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am not convinced that &quot;the main focus for the voltage-sensing mechanism in the P2X2 receptor lies at or around A337.&quot; (line 491-492) As the authors mentioned, the florescence changes at A337 and I341 are small and only occur in some oocytes tested, so it is possible that the changes at other residues went undetected.

We realized that simply stating “the main focus for the voltage-sensing mechanism in the P2X2 receptor lies at or around A337.” in line 491-492 was too strong. It is necessary to mention the possibility that there might be other contributing residues whose fluorescent changes were undetected due to the limitation of the experimental technique we performed. i.e., we agree that there might be undetected electrochromic signals or slow component of fluorescence changes at other residues, and thus we revised the discussion as follows:</p><p>“The electric field convergence takes place at residues located in TM2, as shown by the observed Anap fluorescence changes at A337 and I341 (Figure 3). Minor changes were also observed at L334 and L338 by follow up experiments with SIK inhibitor, after the initial screening (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Based on these results, the most frequently observed and the largest electrochromic signal was from A337. Voltage-dependent structural changes were also detected at or around A337. Although a possibility still remains that other residues are also involved but the changes were undetected due to technical limitations, all the results so far support the interpretation that the main focus for the voltage-sensing mechanism in the P2X2 receptor lies at or around A337.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Another related issue raised by both reviewers.</p><p>Fluorescence changes at A337 were reduced by ATP (Figure 4). Since a higher ATP concentration is correlated with a larger current (Figure 4), fluorescence changes might be reduced by increases of currents. In Figure 5 and 6 the time dependent and non-linear fluorescence changes were accompanied by a time dependent current increase. In these experiments was the time dependent fluorescence decrease induced by the time dependent current increase, or the current increase was a result of the conformational change that was measured by the time dependent fluorescence decrease?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out another vital point in this study. To address this issue, we performed additional experiments by using NMDG-based solution in which current amplitude is reduced. By applying 300 µM ATP to an NMDG-based solution, we performed VCF experiment of K308R/A337Anap construct. After the application of 300 µM ATP, we observed Anap fluorescence signal changes when there was very small current, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>. The results suggests that fluorescence (F) change was not the result of the current. However, in this set of experiment we could not observe a clear non-linear F change. This could probably due to the variation from batch to batch of the oocyte, i.e. if the background fluorescence is high it is hard to observe the non-linear F change.</p><p>Next, we performed a series of experiments in the same cell by using different bath solutions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>. The first one is ND98 and we then changed the solution to NMDG-based bath solution. Since the experiment was done in the same cell, to avoid an excessive fluorescence bleaching we repeated the recordings for averaging only 5 times for each of the condition. We applied 300µM ATP to the oocyte in ND98 solution. The non-linear F changes were observed with a significant ATP-evoked current. Then we changed the solution to NMDG-based solution while maintaining the ATP concentration and see if the non-linear F changes would still be observed even though there was less current flow. After changing the bath solution to NMDG, there was a significant reduction of the current, albeit the total reduction of the current could not be achieved. Although the current was significantly reduced, a non-linear F change could still be observed at a similar level. These results suggest that the non-linear F change is not the result of the current flow, but that the current flow is a result of the conformational changes shown by the presence of non-linear F change in NMDG solution.</p><p>We also performed the same series of experiments by using mannitol-based bath solution, instead of NMDG, to minimize the ionic current as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>. The non-linear F changes were observed with a significant ATP-evoked current in ND98 solution. Then we changed the solution to mannitol-based solution while maintaining the ATP concentration. Although there was a significant reduction of the current, a non-linear F change could still be observed. These results further confirmed that the non-linear F change is not the result of the current flow.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65822-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After a careful examination of the represented traces shown in figure 4 and figure 6, I am not sure one should directly compare the ΔF/F in the absence and presence of ATP to make the conclusion that &quot;the focused electric field at the position of A337 is stronger in the absence of ATP than in the presence of ATP.&quot; (Line 491-492) The noise of the fluorescence signal is always noticeably smaller in the presence of ATP suggesting a possible change in the F.

This recording was performed in the same cell and each recording for averaging was repeated equally 5 times. The noise level is similar, showing that the apparent difference of the noise level in Figures 4 and 6 is due to the difference of the averaged numbers, as the reviewers pointed out. There was a slight reduction, not increase, in the F intensity in the presence of ATP, which could be due to the fluorescence bleaching, as shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. Thus, a larger ∆F/F in the absence of ATP is thought not to be due to smaller F intensity, showing fluorescence change is actually larger in the absence of ATP.</p><p>On the other hand, we agree with the reviewers that there is a possibility that the environment surrounding the fluorophore at A337 is different in the closed and open state. A homology structure model of P2X2 also supports that the crevices are different in the closed and open states. It is natural to assume that the environment of the fluorophore is different in the closed and open state (Figure 8C, D). Thus, we agree with the reviewers that we can’t simply conclude that larger fluorescence change means stronger focus electric field. The interpretation of this part is that the focused electric field is present both in the absence and presence of the ATP.</p><p>We have now added Figure 6—figure supplement 1 to the revised manuscript and revised the result and Discussion section as follows:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“The changes exhibited fast kinetics and a linear voltage-dependence. ∆F/F in the absence of ATP was larger than that in the presence of 10 µM ATP (∆F/F = 0.7%±0.1 at 440 nm (n=4) Figure 4A – C).” We omitted the sentence (line 228-230 in the previous version of the manuscript): “Thus, the focused electric field at the position of A337 is stronger in the absence of ATP than in the presence of 10 μM ATP.”</p><p>“Thus, the ∆F in 0 ATP observed in the above experiments might just represent the ∆F in the open state.”</p><p>“This mutation was introduced into A337Anap (A337Anap/R313F or A337Anap/R313W) to determine whether the ∆F related to the focused electric field is present at A337, even when the channel is mostly closed in 0 ATP.”</p><p>“These results confirmed that ∆F/F at the position of A337 is larger in the absence of ATP than in the presence of ATP. It was of interest to know whether or not the concentration of ATP affects ∆F/F at A337</p><p>We revised sentences in Line 260-263 in the previous version of the manuscript:</p><p>From (original): “Taken together, these results show that the focused electric field at A337 is [ATP]-dependent and stronger in the absence of ATP, suggesting that the rotation of TM1 upon ATP binding (Figure 8) would tighten the space surrounding A337 making the electric field more converged.”</p><p>To: (Line 278-283)</p><p>“Taken together, these results show that the ∆F/F at A337 is [ATP]-dependent and larger in the absence of ATP. The higher ∆F/F implies stronger focused electric field in 0 ATP, but it is also possible that the difference comes from the difference of the environment of the fluorophore, as discussed later (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). In any case, it was shown that a ∆F/F and thus a focused electric field are present both in the absence and the presence of ATP.”</p><p>Line 374-388:</p><p>“Additionally, results consistent with Figure 4E, F, H, and I were also obtained in terms of the fluorescence intensity change of the fast component. ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F in the absence of ATP was larger than in the presence of ATP (∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F=4.4%±0.5 at 440 nm, n=6 and ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F=1.7%±0.3 at 440 nm, n=6; Figure 6B). However, there was a concern that F itself significantly changed due to a difference in the environment surrounding A337Anap in the closed and open states. We performed experiments to address this by measuring the absolute F (output of the photomultiplier tube) in the absence and in the presence of ATP. Using the K308R/A337Anap construct, each recording was repeated 5 times, for averaging, in the same cell as shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. There was a slight reduction, not increase, in the F in the presence of ATP, which could be due to fluorescence bleaching (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B). Thus, a larger ∆F/F in the absence of ATP is thought not to be due to less F, and we concluded that ∆F/F was larger in the absence of ATP. The noise level is similar (Figure 6—figure supplement 2C), showing that the apparent larger noise level in 0 ATP (Figure 4C, 4F, 4I; Figure 4—figure supplement 1H, K; Figure 6B) is not due to smaller F but due to a lower number of averaged traces.”</p><p>And the discussion was revised as follows:</p><p>Line 460 in the previous version of the manuscript, this sentence was omitted: “The focused electric field was more prominent in the absence of ATP”</p><p>Line 512-518 (in the previous manuscript started at Line 458-460):</p><p>“We observed that ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F changed with voltage in both the closed and ATP bound-open states, implying the presence of the focused electric field in both states at the position of A337. ∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F was larger in the absence than in the presence of ATP. One simple interpretation is that the focused electric field is stronger in the absence of ATP.

The small size of the slow ΔF shown in figure 5 could potentially lead to inaccurate data analysis. It would be better if there are more evidence to support that the slow ΔF results from voltage dependent conformational change in the protein. As previously reported by the Kubo lab, the voltage dependent activation time constant varies with different ATP concentrations. It will be a great supporting evidence if the time constant of the slow fluorescence change vary with ATP concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. It is also our interest to see the correlation between [ATP] concentration and F change in this study. We have performed VCF recordings of K308R/A337Anap in different [ATP] previously (30 µM; 100 µM; and 300 µM; data for 30 µM and 100 µM ATP was not shown in the manuscript). However, as the reviewer expressed a concern, the data analysis to compare the activation time constant of the slow F change could not be performed reliably, due to a small slow component F change and noise which made it difficult to fit an exponential function.</p><p>Nevertheless, the results of the analysis are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2E-2G. Current traces could be well-fitted with a single exponential function (Figure 5—figure supplement 2E-F). However, as to the fluorescence traces, as shown in the Figure 5—figure supplement 2E-F, the slow fraction of F change could be fitted at -160 mV but not reliably at -140 mV or -120 mV. The analysis for -160 mV showed that the time constant of the voltage-dependent F change varied with [ATP]. The time constant of voltage dependent F change was larger in the lower [ATP], as depicted in Figure 5—figure supplement 2G. Statistical analysis (unpaired student t-test) showed that the time constant was significantly larger in 30 µM ATP. The larger τ of ∆F/F that than of current at -160 mV in 30 µM ATP (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2E) is puzzling, but we didn’t pursue this point further because of the uncertainty of the fitting.</p><p>We have now added Figure 5—figure supplement 2 to the revised manuscript. And revised the result section as follows:</p><p>Results:</p><p>Line 324-345:</p><p>“It was of interest to see the correlation between [ATP] and the ∆F<sub>Slow</sub>/F in this study. We performed additional VCF recordings of K308R/A337Anap in the presence of 30 µM ATP (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). In the presence of 30 µM ATP, hyperpolarization again elicited fluorescence signals which consist of two components, a very fast decrease (∆F<sub>Fast</sub>/F) and a slow increase (∆F<sub>Slow</sub>/F) to steady-state (∆F<sub>Steady-state</sub>/F) (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A).

Why was I341 not studied further? If it is because of technical difficulties with small signals, then we cannot rule out its role in voltage sensing and it should be discussed. Additionally, previous findings from Kubo's lab have demonstrated that mutations at T339 and G342 can completely abolish the voltage dependence, suggesting possible involvement of those residues as well.</p></disp-quote><p>[I341] Thank you for addressing this concern. As the reviewer commented, I341 was indeed not studied further due to the technical difficulties with small signals. The ∆F/F was only 0.6%±0.2 at 440 nm with n=3 in Figure 3E even after the application of SIK inhibitor. We also performed the VCF recording in the additional mutation of K308R into I341Anap but the data was not shown in the manuscript due to the small signal which hindered the detailed analysis. Here we show the representative traces of the current and fluorescence from K308R/I341Anap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. F change at the steady-state was smaller compared to K308R/A337Anap (1.7±0.1 at 440nm (n=12) compared to 3.4%±0.3 at 440 nm (n=8)). The F<sub>slow</sub> component was smaller than that in K308R/A337Anap making it hard to separate the two components. Nevertheless, the addition of K308R mutation also showed there is a minor F slow component detected at I341Anap. Since the component was very minor, we concluded that the main reporter for the voltage-dependent rearrangements of P2X2 receptor is at A337 and the main focus for the voltage-sensing mechanism could lie at the surrounding environment of A337.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65822-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Secondly, we have also introduced several single amino acid mutations at I341 position. The results of mutations were not as dramatic as those at F44 or A337; as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65822-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Nevertheless, we certainly agree with the reviewers’ comment that we cannot rule out the role of I341 in voltage-sensing since it also showed detectable but smaller F change. I341 was also shown to be modified by both MTSET and Ag<sup>+</sup> (Li et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010), suggesting that a narrow water-phase penetrates down to I341. I341 might contribute to voltage-sensing mechanism as one of the focused electric fields where the voltage sensing by F44 takes place.We have now revised the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“A337 Cys mutants were first reported to be not modified by MTSET both in the presence or absence of ATP, indicating that this residue is not involved either in the pore lining region in the open state or in the gate of P2X2, unlike I341 Cys mutants, which were modified by MTSET (Li et al., 2008). Meanwhile in another study using Ag<sup>+</sup>, a smaller thiol-reactive ion with higher accessibility, A337C was modified both in the absence and presence of ATP, as well as I341C (Li et al., 2010). These results suggest that a narrow water-phase penetrates down to these positions, which is consistent with the results in this study that there is a focused electric field at the position of A337 and I341.”</p><p>[T339] In addition to that, for the previous findings from Kubo-Lab regarding the possible involvement of T339. We observed a very small upward fluorescence change (∆F/F=0.4%) in response to hyperpolarization at the time of the mutant screening but the change was only observed at -140mV, in 1 oocyte out of 5 oocytes tested (The incidence of fluorescence change detection in one batch = 20%). The two traces from different batch are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65822-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We performed further extensive VCF recordings of T339Anap in total 12 batches of oocytes, but was not able to reproduce the result (The incidence of fluorescence change detection between batches was 16.7%). Therefore, it was stated that there was no observed ∆F in response to hyperpolarization in Supplementary Table 1 (Supplementary file 1 in the revised manuscript).Even though we were not able to reproduce the result, we cannot rule out the possible role of T339 in voltage sensing as the mutation to Anap could abolish the voltage-dependent current as well. On the other hand, if we look from the structural point of view, the side chain of T339 is facing to the pore of P2X2 since this is one of the pore lining residues. Therefore, even if T339 contributes to voltage sensing mechanism, we think that the contribution would be indirect.</p><p>We also introduced the mutation T339S which had been reported to make the channel constitutively active into K308R/A337Anap to see whether or not the slow component would be diminished. The phenotype of T339S/K308R/A337Anap didn’t resulted in a constitutively active mutant, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>, consistent with what had been reported before that K308R mutation diminished the spontaneous activity of T339S (Cao et al., 2007). By comparing with K308R/A337Anap mutant in the same batch, we found that the fluorescence change was significantly reduced by the addition of T339S in the similarly high expression density cells in the same batch. We also found that T339S might reduce the slow fraction of F change at K308R/A337Anap.</p><fig id="sa2fig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65822-resp-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>[G342 and G344] The expression level of G342Anap was very low and F changes could not be detected as shown in the manuscript Figure 1—figure supplement 3O. It has been reported that the activation phase evoked by hyperpolarization would be mediated by the flexible G344 located in the middle of TM2 (Fujiwara et al., 2009). G344Anap still showed voltage dependence phenotype (Figure 1—figure supplement 3Q in the manuscript) but F change could not be observed even after the application of SIK inhibitor (data not shown).We also introduced the mutation of G344A on top of K308R/A337Anap. G344 is an important hinge which mediates the voltage-dependent activation phase, as reported in the previous study (Fujiwara et al., 2009) that the G344A mutation makes the channel constitutively active. We expected that G344A/K308R/A337Anap will show constitutive activity but the triple mutant responded normally upon ATP application, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>. Interestingly, in this construct the fluorescence change was observed even in the case of lower current density.

Is there any correlation between the current size and the detectable ΔF/F? Is it because the channel density is too high for some oocytes to show any voltage dependent change?</p></disp-quote><p>There is no clear-cut answer for addressing this matter because detected ΔF/F depends on many aspects. In principle, the smaller the current would be resulted in better ΔF/F because low density means better voltage-dependence at hyperpolarized potentials. However, ΔF/F also strongly depends on the endogenous background fluorescence. If the background fluorescence is relatively high, the ΔF/F could be masked. This is the reason why high expression is needed for successful detection. How high expression level is needed depends on how high the background fluorescence is. It varies from batch to batch and we cannot explicitly state the correlation of the current amplitude and ΔF/F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. There is no information about the dose-response of ATP activation for any of the construct tested. What is the rationale for choosing the concentrations used in the experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>For the Anap mutant screening experiments, low concentration of ATP (10 µM) was used since G-V will shift to the right as the [ATP] goes higher (Fujiwara et al., 2009). In some cases, the IC50 of P2X2 WT (30 µM) was also used. In special cases the saturating concentration of ATP for WT (100 µM or 300 µM) was used depending on the mutant’s phenotype.</p><p>In the case of K308R/A337Anap mutant, it was reported that K308R has a lower ATP sensitivity (Jiang et al., 2000; Cao et al., 2007; Keceli and Kubo, 2009). Therefore 300 µM ATP was used for this mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12.

It is our mistake to mix up the meaning of n.d. for the indication of the ATP-evoked F change for six residues in TM1 as well as 10 residues in the extracellular linker with other n.d. indications on the table.
