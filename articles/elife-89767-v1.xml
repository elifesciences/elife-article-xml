Glutamatergic signaling via AMPA receptors is fundamentally important to the neural circuits controlling bladder voiding. Ampakines are positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors that can enhance the function of glutamatergic neural circuits after SCI. We hypothesized that ampakines can acutely stimulate bladder voiding that has been impaired due to thoracic contusion SCI. Adult female Sprague–Dawley rats received a unilateral contusion of the T9 spinal cord (n = 10). Bladder function (cystometry) and coordination with the external urethral sphincter (EUS) were assessed 5 d post-SCI under urethane anesthesia. Data were compared to responses in spinal-intact rats (n = 8). The ‘low-impact’ ampakine CX1739 (5, 10, or 15 mg/kg) or vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin [HPCD]) was administered intravenously. The HPCD vehicle had no discernible impact on voiding. In contrast, following CX1739, the pressure threshold for inducing bladder contraction, voided volume, and the interval between bladder contractions were significantly reduced. These responses occurred in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that modulating AMPA receptor function using ampakines can rapidly improve bladder-voiding capability at subacute time points following contusion SCI. These results may provide a new and translatable method for therapeutic targeting of bladder dysfunction acutely after SCI.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>spinal plasticity</kwd><kwd>motor recovery</kwd><kwd>bladder dysfunction</kwd><kwd>ampakines</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01HL139708-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuller</surname><given-names>David D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 EB031249</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mickle</surname><given-names>Aaron D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005191</institution-id><institution>Craig H.

Indeed, restoration of bladder function is ranked as one of the highest priorities by individuals with SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourbeau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">French et al., 2010</xref>). The fundamental problem is uncoordinated voiding due to damage to sensory and motor circuits that control bladder coordination. The symptoms can include urinary retention (hypoactive) or incontinence (hyperactive) depending on the injury and time after recovery, leading to urodynamic complications such as urinary infection, kidney damage, bladder cancer, urethral strictures, and bladder stones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taweel and Seyam, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The synaptic pathways that serve to coordinate the activation of bladder detrusor and external urethral sphincter (EUS) muscles rely on glutamatergic neurotransmission, and in SCI, these circuits can be disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fowler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshiyama, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoshiyama et al., 1999</xref>). The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor plays a significant role in mediating drive in the intact micturition reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshiyama and de Groat, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshiyama et al., 1997</xref>). After SCI, the bladder is initially in an areflexive state, and as spinal circuits are reorganized, the bladder transitions to neurogenic detrusor overactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Groat and Yoshimura, 2006</xref>). Glutamatergic signaling and AMPA receptors are altered during these states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitsui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pikov and Wrathall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pikov and Wrathall, 2002</xref>). In general, there are decreases in AMPA receptor subunits initially after an injury during the hypoactive bladder state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossman et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>The AMPA receptor can be allosterically modulated using pharmacological compounds called ampakines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arai and Kessler, 2007</xref>), and recent work suggests that these compounds have therapeutic value after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wollman et al., 2020</xref>). For example, when given after acute or chronic SCI in rats, ampakines have a powerful, beneficial impact on the glutamatergic synaptic pathways, which control breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wollman et al., 2020</xref>). After high-cervical SCI, diaphragm output is diminished, but systemically providing a low dose of ampakine can cause a rapid and sustained increase in diaphragm electromyogram output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rana et al., 2021</xref>). Since depolarization of the phrenic motoneurons that innervate the diaphragm critically depends on AMPA receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chitravanshi and Sapru, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuller et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rana et al., 2020</xref>), ampakines are likely acting at least in part on spinal circuits to stimulate diaphragm output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thakre et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Building on the foundation of prior work in ampakine treatment for respiratory insufficiency, we studied the impact of ampakines on voiding reflexes after SCI. An adult rat model of subacute (5 d) thoracic contusion SCI was used to test the hypothesis that intravenous delivery of ampakine CX1739 would have a dose-dependent ability to restore bladder and EUS functions and their coordinated voiding. Bladder function was evaluated by continuous flow cystometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>). The results demonstrate a remarkable ability of ampakine treatment to restore voiding reflexes following SCI. Ampakines' rapid and powerful impact on bladder function provides a foundation for a new and translatable method for therapeutic targeting of bladder dysfunction after SCI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>T9 contusion injury</title><p>A T9 midline contusion injury was effectively delivered in 10 rats, with a distinct hematoma visually evident under the surgical microscope.

Bladders were manually expressed 2–3 times daily for the first 3 d post injury. Urodynamic recordings were performed 5 d post contusion in injured rats and compared to spinal-intact rats. Representative urodynamic recordings are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Coordinated bladder contractions and associated EUS electromyography (EMG) activity were readily demonstrated in all eight naïve animals. Cystometrogram recordings were characterized by a low baseline bladder volume during the saline-filling phase. As saline infusion reached the threshold volume, a bladder contraction occurred that was demonstrated by a pronounced rapid and brief increase in intravesical pressure and subsequently followed by voiding. Tonic EUS EMG activity was observed before the onset of voiding, followed by coordinated EUS bursting activity during the voiding phase. Distinct active and silent periods could be identified during the coordinated EUS ‘bursting’ phase, which coincided with intravesical pressure oscillations in the cystometrogram. By this time point, 7 out of 10 injured rats exhibited impaired but spontaneous voiding during the urodynamic recordings under anesthesia after a large threshold pressure had been achieved. In addition to cystometric deficits in the injured rats, three animals displayed uncoordinated EUS EMG activity during the voiding phase where a large increase in tonic EUS EMG activity was observed as the bladder reached its maximum capacity and distension.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Impact of T9 contusion on cystometric bladder function and external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG) activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example bladder pressure and EUS EMG trace of coordinated voiding in spinal intact animals (left column) and rats with spinal cord injury (SCI), 5 d following SCI (right column).

A decrease in voided volume was also observed with the ampakine treatment, which would reduce the potential for kidney damage in rats with SCI.

In vitro studies confirm that ampakines are not AMPA receptor agonists but are allosteric modulators of their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arai et al., 2004</xref>). Ampakines do not impact NMDA or kainite receptors directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lynch, 2006</xref>). Importantly, ampakines exist in two distinct classes: high- and low-impact ampakines. High-impact ampakines act mainly by changing AMPA receptor desensitization or changing the affinity of an agonist binding to the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2002</xref>). There have been concerns with the use of high-impact ampakines, which can cause hyper-excitability of neuronal circuits and might be limited by a narrow therapeutic window. The mode of action of low-impact ampakines is primarily via changing the rate at which channels open, resulting in a small increase in current amplitude without prolonging channel deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2002</xref>). The positive effects of low-impact ampakines in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arai and Kessler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lynch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lynch and Gall, 2006</xref>), without the convulsant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaffer et al., 2013</xref>) of high-impact ampakines, make them a better therapeutic candidate. For this reason, our group’s current and prior studies have focused on low-dose, low-impact ampakines following SCI.</p><p>We have recently demonstrated that low-impact ampakines can enhance respiratory drive following SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wollman et al., 2020</xref>). High- and mid-cervical SCIs result in respiratory compromise due to disrupted glutamatergic pathways that activate motor neurons controlling the diaphragm muscle. AMPA receptors play a large role in mediating this respiratory drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thakre et al., 2023</xref>). In acute and subacute stages following a high-cervical SCI, systemic delivery of a low-dose ampakines (CX1739 and CX717, 5 mg/kg) was sufficient to enhance diaphragm EMG activity and overall ventilation in freely behaving rats. Further, systemic delivery of CX1739 or CX717 at 5 mg/kg resulted in no detectable off-target effects, such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or overall animal activity. In addition to its efficacy in improving respiratory function in rodent models of SCI, CX1739 was safely administered with no adverse events as part of phase 2 clinical trials to alleviate opioid-induced respiratory depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">RespireRx University D, 2016</xref>).</p><p>While pharmacokinetic studies were not conducted in the present study, the mean plasma half-life of a single CX1739 intravenous bolus in Sprague–Dawley rats is 1.25 ± 0.03 hr, with a T<sub>max</sub> (time to maximum plasma) concentration of 30 min (information provided through personal communication with RespireRx). The mean range of CX1739 half-life in humans has been reported to be in the range of 6.6–9.3 hr. In our studies, we continued to observe an effect of ampakines for the duration of 45 min post-drug administration. Although the current acute preparations were constrained by time to reduce variability in cystometry recordings and keep the total duration of the preparation under 6 hr, future studies will aim to test the long-term impact of an acute and optimal ampakine dose in awake rats, a critical step along the translational pathway.</p><p>Lastly, in the present study, only female rats were studied due to the lower incidence of bladder complications following a thoracic contusion injury. Future studies will need to be completed in both male and female rats to compare potential sex differences in ampakine effects. While we have not observed any sex effects of ampakines in our respiratory studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rana et al., 2021</xref>), there are known differences in recovery and injury manifestation between male and females that need to be further studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Myers et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of AMPA receptors in micturition circuits</title><p>Glutamate signaling through the AMPA-type receptors plays a critical role in several micturition circuits under normal conditions and after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fowler et al., 2008</xref>). In general, glutamate is excitatory in bladder circuits, and AMPA receptors play a major role in mediating glutamatergic drive. Indeed, AMPA receptor antagonists can decrease bladder contraction frequency and reduce EUS EMG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshiyama et al., 1997</xref>). These actions occur via the descending input from the pontine micturition center to the pre-ganglionic detrusor and urethral sphincter motor neurons. AMPA receptors are also expressed in bladder sensory circuits, where inhibition of AMPA receptors reduces sensory input to the brain stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kakizaki et al., 1998</xref>). They are presumably present on the first-order spinal cord neurons responding to glutamate released by sensory neurons, but this has yet to be proven definitively.</p><p>Based on data from the current study, the increased incidence of coordinated bladder voiding in injured rats following systemic ampakine administration would support a centrally mediated pathway involving both the sensory and motor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kakizaki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsumoto et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsumoto et al., 1995b</xref>). The ascending and descending pathways express different AMPA receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shibata et al., 1999</xref>). Specifically, dorsal laminae in the L6-S1 rat spinal cord constitute a high abundance of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shibata et al., 1999</xref>). Whereas neurons located in the ventral horn have a high abundance of GluR3 and GluR4 subunits. In pontine micturition centers, high levels of GluR1 and GluR2 subunits have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shibata et al., 1999</xref>). Positive allosteric modulators have been shown to bind at the interface between two adjacent subunits at the D1 lobe of the ligand-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2005</xref>). Alternative splicing of amino acids at the ligand-binding domain of various receptor subunits can change the domain interface, thereby changing the interaction of allosteric modulators and how they impact channel kinetics and their sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Golubeva et al., 2022</xref>). Based on current data, we presume that ampakines act similarly on various AMPA receptor subunits. However, future studies will need to determine the location of ampakines’ action to modulate bladder function following incomplete SCI.</p><p>Unlike previous studies using AMPA receptor antagonists, we did not observe any statistically significant effects of CX1739 on bladder contraction or EUS EMG activity in spinal-intact rats. Previous studies in naïve rats have shown that AMPA receptor antagonism with LY215490 inhibits detrusor and EUS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshiyama et al., 1997</xref>). It is important to note that in our study we used CX1739, which is not an AMPA receptor agonist but an allosteric modulator of the receptor that can enhance endogenous signaling. The AMPA antagonist used in the previous study, LY215490, antagonizes glutamate to bind with postsynaptic AMPA receptors and, thereby, completely inhibits the glutamatergic synaptic transmission of micturition circuits, resulting in complete inhibition of bladder and EUS activity. In comparison, CX1739 is an allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors and does not directly activate the receptor. Thus, our results indicate that allosterically modulating the receptor with a low-impact ampakine does not enhance normal glutamatergic synaptic transmission in spinal-intact rats, while it can enhance activity following SCI. Future research is needed to determine why this is the case, but it could be due to downregulation of AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossman et al., 1999</xref>) and increased release of glutamate in SCI models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demediuk et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Panter et al., 1990</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of AMPA receptors in micturition circuits after SCI</title><p>After SCI, the bladder is initially in an ‘areflexive state’ and micturition is impaired. As spinal circuits undergo post-SCI neuroplastic changes, the bladder transitions to a neurogenic detrusor overactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Groat and Yoshimura, 2006</xref>). This results in a hyper-reflexive state and causes sphincter dyssynergia, reflex incontinence, and increased residual urine in the bladder following a void. It is well established that glutamatergic signaling and expression of AMPA receptors are profoundly altered after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pikov and Wrathall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rana et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoshiyama et al., 1999</xref>). In the thoracic spinal cord, there is a decrease in the expression of AMPA receptor subunits acutely (e.g., 24 hr) after thoracic SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossman et al., 1999</xref>). However, AMPA receptor expression increases at more chronic post-SCI time points (e.g., 1 mo) following the injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossman et al., 1999</xref>). Similar dynamic changes in AMPA receptors have been described in other spinal segments after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rana et al., 2022</xref>). An upregulation of AMPA receptors in the chronic stages of injury may, at least in part, be responsible for the hyperactive bladder phenotype that can occur after chronic SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pikov and Wrathall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pikov and Wrathall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoshiyama et al., 1999</xref>). It is unclear why these receptors are upregulated, although this could occur due to homeostatic upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>) secondary to decreased activity in denervated motoneurons due to the SCI-induced interruption of descending tracts.</p><p>Our data indicate that ampakine-mediated modulation of AMPA receptors can rescue the areflexive bladder phenotype 5 d after SCI. At this acute stage post-contusion injury, glutamatergic neurotransmission is partially impaired due to disrupted descending spinal pathways. Specifically, excitatory glutamatergic pathways originating from the pontine micturition centers would be partially disrupted following a T9 contusion injury. Indeed, histological assessment of the spinal cord tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) shows partial disruption of white matter regions that would contain descending lateral corticospinal tracts from the pontine micturition centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fowler et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, ascending sensory tracts contributing to the sensation of bladder filling would also be disrupted. Thus, in this state of reduced neural drive, ampakines are likely potentiating residual drive to activate the glutamatergic pathways responsible for the areflexive bladder. These effects of ampakines in the acute phase of injury are particularly exciting. In the chronic phase of injury, it is well documented that detrusor overactivity resulting from hyperactivity glutamatergic circuits tends to develop at the 3- to 4-week post-injury time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sartori et al., 2022</xref>). While ampakines appear to alleviate bladder dysfunction at this acute time point post injury, it is likely that there is a time-dependent efficacy of ampakine therapy that changes from acute to chronic stages of injury, and these aspects remain to be studied.</p><p>Globally more than 500,000 people experience an SCI every year, of which 70–84% of patients showed neurogenic bladder dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Groat et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Current therapeutic options for improving bladder dysfunction in SCI patients are not effective and rely primarily on intermittent catheterizations to prevent bladder overfilling and kidney damage.

Cystometry is an excellent tool to evaluate bladder filling and emptying conditions for drug dose responses as data can be collected from multiple voids during a relatively short drug activation period. This technique does have its limitations as it is conducted under anesthetized conditions and using non-physiological filling rates. A critical step in future studies, before translation into the clinical population, will be to evaluate overall bladder voiding in freely moving animals and how bladder function changes in the acute to chronic stages post-injury in ampakine-treated rats.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that intravenous delivery of a low-impact ampakine, CX1739, can improve bladder voiding after thoracic SCI.

The posterior portion of thoracic vertebrae was exposed at T8–T10, and a laminectomy was performed at T9 while preserving the facet joints and leaving the dura intact. Rats were suspended by clamps secured laterally at the T8 and T10 vertebrae. A 2.5 mm impactor tip was aligned at the midline. Subsequently, rats were subjected to a single contusion injury. A desired force of 100 kDy with 0 s dwell time was delivered using the Infinite Horizon Impactor (Precision Systems and Instrumentation, Lexington, KY). Animals were de-clamped and the overlying muscles were sutured with sterile 4-0 webcryl. The overlying skin was closed using 9 mm wound clips. Animals were maintained on a heating pad until alert and awake. Animals received one dose of the extended-release buprenorphine SR LAB (1 mg/kg, ZooPharm), followed by carprofen (5 mg/kg, q.d.), baytril (5 mg/kg, q.d.), and lactated Ringer’s solution (10 ml/d, q.d.) for the initial 48 hr post injury. Animals were monitored daily for signs of distress, dehydration, and weight loss, with appropriate veterinary care given as needed. No animals needed to be excluded from the study based on predetermined exclusionary factors of bone-hit or slip tip during contusion, &gt;10% difference in actual delivered force, limb autophagia, or weight loss &gt;20% of a pre-injury time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>In vivo bladder cystometry recordings</title><p>Five days following SCI or in intact rats, a 24 G i.v. catheter (SR#FF2419, Terumo Corporation) was placed on the distal end of the tail vein on the day of recording under 2% isoflurane. Rats were slowly infused with urethane (0.84 g/kg; 102452447, Sigma; diluted in saline at 150 mg/ml) through the tail vein. Later 0.12–0.24 g/kg of urethane was given if required during cystometry, depending on the animal’s response. An injection of saline was given subcutaneously (1 ml/100 g of rat) to keep the rat hydrated during the recording time of cystometry under urethane. The abdominal area and the area around the base of the tail were shaved. The rat was then transferred to a closed-loop heating pad to control the body temperature at 37°C (2221962P, CWE, Inc). The rat was placed under 1–2% isoflurane (J121008, Akron, Inc) through a nose cone. An incision was made in the abdominal wall, and a purse-string suture was made using a 5-0 nylon suture (07-809-8813, Patterson Veterinary) around the apex of the bladder. The apex of the bladder inside the purse-string suture was cut, and a flared catheter (BB31695-PE/3, Scientific Commodities, Inc) was inserted into the bladder lumen. The purse-string suture was secured tightly around the catheter, and the bladder was checked for leaks with a brief saline infusion. The polyethylene catheter was connected with a syringe pump (GT1976 Genie Touch, Kent Scientific Corporation) to infuse the saline into the bladder at 6 ml per hour. The intraluminal pressure measurements were acquired by using an inline pressure transducer (503067, World Precision Instruments) connected to a Transbridge amplifier (TBM4-D, World Precision Instruments) and processed at a 1000 Hz sampling rate using the Micro 1401 (Cambridge Electronic Design) data acquisition system and Spike2 Software (V10; Cambridge Electronic Design). The muscle of the abdominal cavity and skin incisions were sutured with nylon suture, and the isoflurane was then lowered to zero.</p><p>Next, two Teflon-insulated silver wires (570742, A-M Systems) were placed into the EUS muscle (5 mm of bare wire exposed) to measure sphincter EMG. Two 25 G needles containing the EMG wires were inserted into the skin and muscle at a distance of 3–5 mm from the urethral opening, and the other end of the wire was connected with the pre-amplifier (HZP, Grass, Astro-Med. Inc) and then amplifier (RPS107E, Grass, Astro-Med Inc). A third wire was inserted into the skin of the abdominal area of the body by using a 18 G needle and connected to the pre-amplifier as a ground. The EUS EMG data from the amplifier was processed at 20,000  Hz using the Micro 1401 data acquisition system and Spike 2 software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Then, 30 min after stopping isoflurane, we started the saline infusion and cystometric pressure recording. The voids were collected in a weigh boat by placing the weigh boat under the urethral opening to collect the voided volume. These volumes were weighed on a balance and recorded after each cystometric void.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup and design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experimental urodynamic recordings in anesthetized rats.

The drug was diluted in HPCD (Cat# H107-100G, Sigma) solution (10%) at a soluble concentration of 5 mg/ml. Aliquots were stored at −20°C for up to 6 mo. Aliquots were thawed to room temperature on the day of each experiment. CX1739 was infused at concentrations of 5, 10, and 15  mg/kg intravenously slowly (~2 min). We then assessed the effects of those doses of CX1739 over the next 45 min. Cystometry parameters were recorded as baseline, vehicle, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 15 mg/kg CX1739 in the same order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Pharmacokinetic parameters for CX1739 in Sprague–Dawley rats have previously been determined following an intravenous administration of CX1739. The mean plasma half-life of CX1739 was 1.25 ± 0.03 hr, with a T<sub>max</sub> of 30 min (information provided through personal communication with RespireRx). Although the 45 min interval between doses would not be within the time frame of <italic>complete</italic> post-administration clearance of the first CX1739 dose from the system, the plasma levels would be predicted to be considerably lower by 45 min post administration. A limitation of terminal cystometry preparations is that the duration which an experiment in an anesthetized rat can be sustained is limited. In our experience, recordings beyond 6 hr will dramatically increase variability in the data. The 45 min window allowed for the procedure to remain under ~6 hr. Further, in our published studies investigating the impact of ampakines on breathing in rats following an SCI, the acute impact of intravenous ampakine administration wanes after approximately 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rana et al., 2021</xref>) Thus, the dosing schedule was based on three factors: (1) the drug half-life, (2) the duration of which the experimental preparation was viable, and (3) the data from the respiratory response of ampakines after SCI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry and imaging</title><p>Following the cystometry experiments, animals were injected intraperitoneally with ketamine/xylazine cocktail (0.05 ml/100 g) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). T8–T10 spinal segments were resected, post-fixed for 24 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde, and cryopreserved in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) for 3 d at 4°C. A 5 mm spinal cord segment centered at the injury epicenter was embedded in OCT and subsequently sectioned at 20 μm thickness in the transverse plane. Rehydrated sections were stained with 0.1% cresyl violet in glacial acetic acid. After 3 min, slides were rinsed in water and dehydrated through graded alcohol steps followed by xylene. Tissue sections were imaged and stitched using a ×10 objective on a Keyence microscope (BZ-X700, Keyence Corporation of America, Itasca, IL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Animals that did not develop a regular voiding pattern were not included in the group analysis as cystometric properties could not be measured. Of 10 rats with SCI, 3 did not develop a normal pattern, all intact rats exhibited a regular pattern (8 out of 8). These data were analyzed separately by making comparisons within animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Cystometric data (intercontraction interval, threshold pressure, peak pressure, and baseline pressure as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>) was first analyzed using cystometry analyzer software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heitmeier and Samineni, 2022</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Samineni-Lab/cystometry_analyzer">https://github.com/Samineni-Lab/cystometry_analyzer</ext-link>). Threshold pressures were verified manually to ensure accuracy. The cystometric voided saline was collected in a weigh boat and weighed on a balance to determine the volume of the voids. The total calculated volume of voids over a period of 30 min after the application of HPCD/CX1739 was divided by the total number of voids to determine the average voided volume. EUS EMG data was analyzed on Spike2 software (CED). The EMG signal was rectified, moving-median filtered using a 50 ms time constant, and finally smoothed using a 50 ms time constant to obtain the RMS EMG signal. The peak RMS EMG signal averaged over the duration of the burst to obtain RMS<sub>peak</sub> EMG. The threshold activation pressure for EUS EMG was defined as the bladder pressure at which EUS EMG burst was evoked (intersection of red dotted lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical evaluations were performed using JMP statistical software (version 14.0, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Power calculations for each cohort of animals in the study were determined before the initiation of the study and based on pilot experiments not included in this article. The study statistical design (n = 8 rats/group) was powered to consider the expected standard deviation in cystometrogram threshold pressure at 5 d post-contusion (22%) and in order to detect a 25% difference at a power of 0.8 and an α of 0.05. Using the mixed linear model, statistical significance was established at the 0.05 level and adjusted for any violation of the assumption of sphericity in repeated measures using the Greenhouse–Geisser correction. Group (intact or injured) and treatment (baseline, HPCD, CX1739 5 mg/kg, CX1739 10 mg/kg, and CX1739 15 mg/kg) were included as model variables using animals as a random effect. When appropriate, post hoc analyses were conducted using Tukey–Kramer honestly significant difference. Normality of the distribution was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test within each animal. Outliers were identified for each animal using an outlier box plot. No data were excluded from the analysis to highlight the responders versus the non-responders in each treatment group. Each data point on the graphs represents mean ± SEM. Figures were designed and produced using JMP and Adobe Illustrator.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida and are in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines (Protocol # 202107438).

Is the 45-minute interval between doses appropriate for the drug's kinetics?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: While blood levels of ampakine were not tested in this study, pharmacokinetic parameters for CX1739 in Sprague Dawley rats have previously been determined following an intravenous administration of CX1739. The mean plasma half-life of CX1739 was 1.25 ± 0.03 hrs, with a Tmax of 30 minutes (information provided through personal communication with RespireRx). Although the 45 minutes interval between doses would not be within the time frame of post administration clearance of the first CX1739 dose from the system, the plasma levels would be considerably lower by 45 mins post administration. A limitation of terminal cystometry preparations is the duration you can maintain a single animal, and this was also included in our rationale for dosing every 45 mins. In our experience longer recordings can increase variability. A 45 min window allowed for the anesthetized procedure to remain under ~6 hours. Further, in our studies investigating the impact of ampakines in rats following an SCI, acute impacts of intravenous ampakine administration were observed for up to 30 minutes. (Rana et al., 2021) Along with the half-life and data from the respiratory system informed our decision here. We have added this rationale to the methods section and in part to the discussion section (Page 11, 2930).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: Since a major plus of these studies is their potential applicability to humans with SCI, it would be helpful to know whether the drug levels achieved here resemble those that were achieved in human trials to date.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Since blood/plasma levels were not tested in the current study, we cannot comment on the comparison of blood plasma levels achieved in human trials. However, we have expanded upon this point in the discussion section (page 29-30).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: The authors could also provide us with a bit more description of the different classes of ampakines, and why they chose the one they used.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for this suggestion. We would like to highlight a section in our discussion (Page 28-29) where we have an in-depth description of the two classes of ampakines in the discussion and the rationale for selecting the low-impact CX1739 drug.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: Lastly, the first reference is cited twice in the bibliography.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The duplicate reference has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Comment: Overall, the findings support the potential for ampakine administration in the setting of neurogenic bladder dysfunction following SCI. The manuscript was well written, the experimental design was rigorous, the data were of excellent quality, and the conclusions were adequately supported by the findings. Weaknesses are considered minor and can be addressed mostly by clarification as noted below.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: Since CX1789 was provided in the context of cystometry and EUS EMG, a brief discussion of how ampakines could be used in a therapeutic context in humans would help to understand the translational significance of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for this important comment to include a discussion about translational significance of CX1739. We have included a discussion (Page 34) about the translational significance of this work in the discussion section of the last paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: No information is provided on the half-life of CX1789 and how might this impact the implementation of CX1789 for clinical use. The inclusion of this information would help the reader to appreciate the potential for and limitations of clinical implementation.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Although pharmacokinetic analyses were not conducted as part of this study, we have included details of CX1739 plasma pharmacokinetics examined in Sprague-Dawley rats (Page 11, 29-30). This information has been provided through personal communication with RespireRx.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: The study was limited to female rats. Would the authors anticipate different efficacy of CX1789 in male rats? A comment on the choice of animal sex and implications for interpretation of the findings would strengthen the discussion and potential clinical implementation given the male bias of traumatic SCI in humans.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your important comment. In this study, females were chosen primarily due to the fact they have better recovery outcomes from spinal cord injury. During initial preliminary data gathering, we used both male and female rats and found that the male rats often did not recover cytometric voiding at this time point. So we chose to continue only with the female rats in this current study. It is well established that female rats have better urogenic recovery from SCI effects, perhaps due to the easier postoperative care. It is critical that we complete future studies in both male and female rats, however, we will have to change our experimental paradigm (time after injury, and or severity of injury) to make comparisons between SCI and intact male rats. We have now included this important topic of our sex selection in the methods section (Page 6) of the manuscript and have also expanded this point in the discussion section (page 30).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Comment: The impact of ampakine treatment on EUS EMG activity is not obvious from the data presented in Fig. 5C-F. I do see in the magnified area of the SCI rat tracing some clear EUS activity with 15 mg/kg of CX1739. However, statistically, there is not a significant improvement in bladder-urethral sphincter coordination in rats treated with ampakine. Authors should discuss how or why ampakine treatment improves bladder function without affecting bladder-urethral sphincter coordination. The background noise of the EUS EMG in Fig. 5B changes dramatically between conditions. Are these tracings from the same experiment? If yes, please explain why the background noise changes during the course of the experiment. Was this change in background noise observed only in SCI rats?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for such an interesting comment. Although our data analysis shows no statistically significant difference in the duration or amplitude of EUS EMG bursting when comparing vehicle to ampakine treatment. However, we did see a difference in the threshold at which bursting occurred (Fig 5C-F). Rats that lost complete coordination (Figure 6) due to injury, ampakines provide further confirmation about producing EUS EMS bursting and coordinated voiding.</p><p>Therefore, these results suggest that ampakines have some positive modulatory effects on EUS EMG bursting events. Overall, we did not see any significant differences of the background noise of EUS EMG between conditions during experiments both in spinal intact and SCI. The background noise of the EUS EMG in Fig. 5B decreases after baseline and HPCD due to changes in experimental conditions (needed to use slightly more urethane due to showing up of animal’s consciousness). We would also like to confirm that these tracings are from the same experiment. Accordingly, we have made further clarifications in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: Tables 1 and 2 show the same data as figures 3 and 4. I suggest removing the tables. In addition, table 2 includes letters (A, B, C, D) to indicate statistical significance. However, no indication of the meaning of these letters is provided. What does &quot;levels not connected by same letter are significantly different&quot; mean? Please clarify. I suggest including the statistical comparisons in Fig. 4</p></disp-quote><p>Response: While we did consider adding statistical bars in the graphs themselves, the number of comparisons being conducted reduced the readability of the graphs. Thus, we would like preserve the current format of the table and provide the readers with all statistical comparisons being made. The statement “levels not connected by the same letter are significantly different” indicates that only treatment groups for an outcome that do not have an overlapping letter, such as baseline (A) and HPCD (A) values for threshold pressures are different from the 5 mg/kg (B,C,D), 10 mg/kg (C,D) and 15 mg/kg (D) group in the SCI rats. Further, threshold pressures in the 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/Kg and 15 mg/kg groups are not significantly different from each other. These results have also been described in detail in the results section. Lastly, we acknowledge the redundancy of data presented in Tables 1 and 2. These two tables have been moved to the supplemental section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: A study by Yoshiyama and colleagues previously showed that the AMPA antagonists LY215490 completely abolished the reflex bladder contractions and EMG activity of the EUS muscle during a continuous filling in naïve rats (JPET 1997). Surprisingly, CX1739, a low-impact AMPA receptor activator, does not affect bladder contractions or EMG activity in naïve rats. Authors should discuss the reason for this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for this comment. We believe the different pharmacokinetics of the drugs can explain these effects. We have included this critical point in the discussion (page 31-32).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: The conclusion that CX1739 is acting on sensory pathways is highly speculative and needs additional support. The functional status of the afferent pathways is uncertain following SCI. Please revise.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for this comment. We agree, in retrospect, that this speculative comment is an overassumption, and we have removed it from the discussion. We have modified the discussion to remove focus from the sensory nervous system and, more generally, discuss the location of AMPA receptors in the voiding neurocircuitry (page 31).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: Figure 3. It's difficult to see the asterisks that indicate statistical significance. Please use a line or a bigger symbol to indicate statistical differences between groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the suggestion we have modified the figure to make the asterisks bigger and added a line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: Data for peak pressure should be included in Figures 3 and 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for pointing out one of the important parameters of cystometry which is peak pressure. As we did not see significant changes in bladder peak contraction pressure between spinal intact and SCI rats, we prefer not to show a graph of peak pressure (in Fig 3) to highlight other parameters that showed significant injury effects, such as baseline pressure, ICI, threshold, and voided volume. However, peak pressure reduced similarly both in spinal intact and SCI rats, suggesting that ampakine has some treatment effects on peak pressure that we prefer to include in Fig 4. We modified our results section and have included a description on peak pressures in the result section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: The peak pressure was reduced in both naïve and SCI rats treated with ampakine. Therefore, the peak pressure is not one of the parameters that improves by ampakine in SCI rats.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Yes, we agree that peak pressures between spinal intact and SCI rats were comparable. Some treatment effects of ampakine on peak pressure were observed both between spinal intact and SCI rats. We have amended the manuscript to make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: The reference from Yoshiyama et al (1999) is duplicated.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for catching this error. The references have been combined in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment: Page 15, the authors state that &quot;Coordinated bladder contractions and associated EUS EMG activity were readily demonstrated in all 7 naïve animals&quot;. In other sections, they referred to 8 naïve rats. What is the actual number of naïve rats?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for pointing out this error. The actual number of naïve rats is 8. We have rectified this error.</p></body></sub-article></article>
