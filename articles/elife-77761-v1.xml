Current research moves epidermal keratinocytes into focus as sensors and transmitters of nociceptive and non-nociceptive sensations, tightly interacting with intraepidermal nerve fibers at the neuro-cutaneous unit. In animal models, epidermal cells establish close contacts and ensheath sensory neurites. However, ultrastructural morphological and mechanistic data examining the human keratinocyte-nerve fiber interface are sparse. We investigated this exact interface in human skin applying super-resolution array tomography, expansion microscopy, and structured illumination microscopy. We show keratinocyte ensheathment of afferents and adjacent connexin 43 contacts in native skin and have applied a pipeline based on expansion microscopy to quantify these parameter in skin sections of healthy participants versus patients with small fiber neuropathy. We further derived a fully human co-culture system, visualizing ensheathment and connexin 43 plaques in vitro. Unraveling human intraepidermal nerve fiber ensheathment and potential interaction sites advances research at the neuro-cutaneous unit. These findings are crucial on the way to decipher the mechanisms of cutaneous nociception.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuro-cutaneous unit</kwd><kwd>neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>keratinocyte</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>sensory neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG UE171/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Üçeyler</surname><given-names>Nurcan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UE171/15-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Üçeyler</surname><given-names>Nurcan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ULTRARESOLUTION</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sauer</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sensory nerve fiber ending ensheathment and connexin 43 contacts by keratinocytes at the neuro-cutaneous unit can be visualized and quantified at super-resolution in human skin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Impairment of the thinly-melinated A-delta and unmyelinated C-nerve fibers may underlie small nerve fiber pathology observed in patients with peripheral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birklein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lacomis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Üçeyler et al., 2013</xref>) and central nervous system diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nolano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weis et al., 2011</xref>). Cutaneous nerve fiber degeneration and sensitization are hallmarks of small fiber pathology; however, the underlying pathomechanisms are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Üçeyler, 2016</xref>). The impact of skin cells on nociceptive and non-nociceptive stimulus detection is increasingly recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lumpkin and Caterina, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stucky and Mikesell, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Physiologically, keratinocytes are the predominant cell type in the epidermis and actively participate in sensory signal transduction and nociception at the neuro-cutaneous unit (NCU). In animal in vitro cell culture models, selective thermal, chemical, or mechanical keratinocyte stimulation led to activation of co-cultured peripheral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klusch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mandadi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sondersorg et al., 2014</xref>). Using animal models, nociceptive behavior was induced in mice selectively expressing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in keratinocytes after capsaicin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pang et al., 2015</xref>). Mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in keratinocytes also displayed pain behavior and intraepidermal nerve fiber (IENF) derived evoked nerve fiber action potentials during laser stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>). Further, knockout of the mechanoreceptor PIEZO1 in keratinocytes attenuated both innocuous and noxious touch sensation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mikesell et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>For underlying functional stimulus transduction of keratinocytes and IENF, signaling molecules such as ATP are increasingly recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mandadi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moehring et al., 2018</xref>). Hemichannels or gap junctions formed by connexins and pannexins, or vesicular transport may conduct ATP signaling toward afferent nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maruyama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sondersorg et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Connexin 43 (Cx43) pores are well established as a major signaling route for keratinocyte-keratinocyte communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>) and potentially transduce external stimuli likewise toward afferents. Signaling might also happen via specialized synapse-like connections to IENF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talagas et al., 2020a</xref>). In <italic>Danio rerio</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> models, nerve endings are frequently ensheathed by epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>) and tunneling of fibers through keratinocytes in human skin has recently been shown via confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Talagas et al., 2020b</xref>). However, the exact mechanisms and mode of signal transduction at the NCU remain elusive.</p><p>In an embryonic stem-cell-derived 2D human cell culture model, physical contacts between sensory neurons and keratinocytes were observed hinting to close coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishnan-Kutty et al., 2017</xref>). Still, direct and systematic information on ensheathment of human IENF is scarce and ultrastructural architecture or molecular processes remain obscure. Deciphering these contact zones in the human system may profoundly change the understanding of somatosensory processing in health and disease. Ultimately, altered keratinocyte signal molecule release or dysfunctional signaling sites may contribute to cutaneous pain perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talagas et al., 2018</xref>), which could open novel avenues for neuroprotective, regenerative, and analgesic treatment of patients with small fiber pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keppel Hesselink et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We aimed at studying exactly these contact zones between keratinocytes and IENF at the NCU in the human system to gain insights on ultrastructure and potential crosstalk in the epidermis. A correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) approach via super-resolution array tomography (srAT) in high-pressure frozen, freeze substituted samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markert et al., 2017</xref>) and expansion microscopy (ExM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>) in diagnostic paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue sections revealed ensheathment and pore protein Cx43 plaques in native human skin. Both phenomena were also present in vitro at the NCU in a fully human keratinocyte and sensory neuron co-culture system which we succeeded to establish. We propose a crucial role of nerve fiber ensheathment and Cx43-based keratinocyte-nerve fiber contacts in small fiber pathology and neuropathic pain pathophysiology widening the scope of somatosensory processing to non-neuronal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human intraepidermal nerve fiber segments are engulfed by keratinocytes</title><p>While many IENF were passing between neighboring keratinocytes, srAT revealed IENF ensheathed by keratinocytes in skin samples of all three healthy subjects. This tunneling of fibers was observed both in the basal and upper epidermal layers for several consecutive 100-nm-thin sections indicated via PGP9.5 labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). IENF intersected closely to either the lateral, posterior, or anterior boundary of the respective keratinocyte and was engulfed by the respective cell for several µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>).

These findings may profoundly change the view on the role neuronal and non-neuronal cells play in the development and maintenance of neuropathy and neuropathic pain.</p><p>Ensheathment was previously described in model organisms with mono- or double-layered epidermis such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">O’Brien et al., 2012</xref>). In multi-layered mammalian and human skin, only sparse data exist from early EM studies reporting conflicting observations. Given the small diameter of IENF (≤1 µm) within the dense tissue of the epidermis, application of super-resolution microscopy techniques is inevitably necessary to resolve the exact course of these neurites. Recently, ‘tunneling’ of IENF within keratinocytes was proposed via confocal microscopy in human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Talagas et al., 2020b</xref>) and via SEM in an heterologous rat-human co-culture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talagas et al., 2020a</xref>). srAT and ExM techniques used in our study fortify these findings at ultrastructural level and ExM opens the avenue for detailed assessment in diagnostically relevant tissue sections. We further identified Cx43 plaques of keratinocytes in close proximity to IENF as potential components of the NCU exactly size-matching similar connexin and innexin plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agullo-Pascual et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Markert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taki et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Keratinocyte-keratinocyte communication via calcium wave propagation and ATP release are canonical functions of Cx43, orchestrating proliferation, wound healing, and inflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>). It is of note that ATP was also found to be a direct signal transducer from keratinocytes to sensory neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook and McCleskey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sondersorg et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Interactions at the NCU may have unprecedented implications for a wide range of somatosensory functions in health and disease.

Still, our imaging pipeline provides a valuable starting point for quantitative analysis of morphological parameters at super-resolution. It is applicable for clinical frozen skin sections, for virtually all markers with validated antibodies, and is also applicable in large experimental groups. Intriguingly, new markers for nociceptor sub-classification are emerging via transcriptomic profiling of human DRG neurons, which will enable profiling keratinocyte-IENF interactions based on fiber subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhuiyan et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>These data may help understand the pathophysiology of diseases of the peripheral and central nervous system including dystrophic changes typically found in skin of patients with neuropathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hovaguimian and Gibbons, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Handling of large super-resolution data, variability of fluorescence signals across expanded sections, and complex segmentation challenges account for the small cohort sizes as a major limitation of our study. Our multi-stepwise segmentation pipeline may enable more standardized and unbiased extraction of morphology-based parameters, while highly processed images also inherit risks for systematic errors like over- or underestimation. These limitations may be overcome by software guided image acquisition of only skin ROIs containing IENF and more sophisticated deep learning algorithms for downstream 3D segmentation guided by artificial intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D’Antuono and Pisignano, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>It is pivotal to recognize and further investigate the active role of keratinocytes within the NCU.

Vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maruyama et al., 2018</xref>), pannexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sondersorg et al., 2014</xref>), and connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2013</xref>) are potential mediators of this ATP release and might be dependent on the evoking stimulus. Our observation of Cx43 plaques along the course of IENF in native skin and a human co-culture model substantiates a morphological basis and suggests keratinocyte hemichannels or gap junctions as one potential signaling pathway toward IENF. A single-cell RNA-sequencing approach of human epidermal cells determined ‘channel keratinocytes’ with upregulated pore and intercellular communication transcripts, for example Cx26 and Cx30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Hemichannel or even gap junctional communication between keratinocytes and IENF might hence not be restricted to Cx43 and differentially organized in varying specialized keratinocytes.</p><p>We successfully established a fully human co-culture model of sensory neurons and keratinocytes maintaining viability for at least 6 days and neurites growing toward and interacting with keratinocytes. The 2D culture system reduced the multilayered complexity of native skin, yet conserved ensheathment and Cx43 plaques as hallmarks of the NCU. Embryonic stem-cell-derived human sensory neurons and human keratinocytes were successfully co-cultured before resulting in direct contacts and engulfed neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishnan-Kutty et al., 2017</xref>). However, our model uses fibroblast-derived iPSC which can be generated from virtually any relevant group of patients. Recently, a heterologous model of rat DRG neurons and human keratinocytes showed neurites passing along a keratinocyte gutter or being ensheathed by keratinocytes, which matches our observations. Additionally, SYP, synaptotagmin, and syntaxin 1 A were successfully labeled together with cytokeratin 6 as a keratinocyte marker and pan-neurofilament as a neurite marker, suggesting en passant synapse-like contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talagas et al., 2020a</xref>). Further, this study described tunneling fibers and ‘gutters’ in their heterologous co-culture system, being congruent to our observations in the human keratinocyte- sensory neuron system. However, neurofilaments represent intermediate filaments within the cytoplasm and may not encompass the whole neuronal outline compared to membrane labeling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In accordance with findings from native DRG neurons, our sensory iPSC neurons contained SYP accumulations within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2019</xref>), deeming a membranous labeling necessary to clearly localize SYP in keratinocytes and rule out a neuronal localization within a co-culture approach. In our study, we did not observe specific SYP-positive clusters or vesicles in the cytosol of primary human keratinocytes associated with passing neurites.</p><p>Still, electrophysiological activity of neurons in contact with keratinocytes has shown to be attenuated after blockage vesicular secretion of keratinocytes via botulinum neurotoxin type C, hinting toward a physiological role of synaptic release in signal transduction at the NCU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talagas et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>As proof-of-concept for signal transduction between keratinocytes and neurons in our fully human co-culture, we detected spontaneous, time-coupled Ca<sup>2+</sup> peaks in keratinocytes and neurites. However, our ibidi well system is not ideal for stimulation experiments. Specialized microfluidic chambers with directional neurite outgrowth, coupled with perfusion systems are needed to validate and quantify various modes of keratinocyte-neurite interactions at higher throughput combined with keratinocyte-specific stimulation or antagonists like the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone.</p><p>Our data further show that diagnostic interpretation of IENF density in skin punch biopsies solely based on PGP9.5 labeling deserves some caution. PGP9.5 is a cytoplasmic marker that may not be distributed homogenously along the whole fiber and omits the neurites membrane, which will be important for localization and co-localization of involved proteins at super-resolution. Regarding in vitro approaches, our homologous model should minimize variability and potential artifacts of heterologous co-cultures, especially since profound differences in neuronal DRG subpopulations can be observed across mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kupari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shiers et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Sophisticated cell culture and animal models along with super-resolution microscopy are barely beginning to unveil the complexity of the NCU. Epidermal keratinocytes show an astonishing set of interactions with sensory IENF including ensheathment and potential electrical and chemical synapse-like contacts to nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) which may have substantial implications for the pathophysiological understanding of neuropathic pain and neuropathies. Our morphological findings underline the significance of keratinocytes in somatosensory and cutaneous nociception and add to the increasing change of textbook knowledge viewing sensory fibers as the sole transducers of environmental stimuli. Expanding investigations toward skin cell impairment in small fiber pathology will help to better understand the underlying mechanisms and open new avenues for targeted treatment.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Keratinocyte-nerve fiber interactions in human epidermis and 2D model.</title><p>Proposed connexin contacts are potential transducers of sensory and nociceptive keratinocyte adenosine triphosphate signaling toward intraepidermal nerve fibers.

The object glass area containing the ribbon was cut out with a diamond pen (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). A 2.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in ethanol solution was dropped onto the sections and incubated for 15 min at RT. Sections were briefly washed in 100% ethanol, 50% (v/v) ethanol in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, and 100% ddH<sub>2</sub>0, followed by 10 min incubation at RT with 50% (v/v) lead citrate solution in decocted H<sub>2</sub>O containing 80 mM lead citrate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 0.12 M trisodium citrate (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reynolds, 1963</xref>). After washing in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, sections were dried and attached to specimen pin mounts via carbon conductive tape (Plano, Wetzlar, Germany). Conductive silver (Plano) was applied, connecting the glass with the edges of the holder. A 5 nm carbon coat was applied, using a CCU-010 carbon coating machine (Safematic, Bad Ragaz, Switzerland). Serial sections were imaged in a JSM-7500F field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV, a probe current of 0.3 nA, and a working distance of 6.0 mm. At each region of interest (ROI), several images with increasing magnification were acquired.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>srAT image processing, correlation, and modelling</title><p>Montage and alignment of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were achieved via the ImageJ plugin TrakEM2 (version 1.0 a, 04.07.2012)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Images corresponding to the same section at different magnifications were merged within one layer with least squares montage in similarity mode and an alignment error of 10–20 pixel. After each z-layer was positioned, serial 100 nm sections were orientated via align layers, using similarity as transformation mode and 20–100 pixel alignment error. The ROI in each layer was exported in a tagged image file (tif) format. To correlate immunofluorescence (IF) and SEM information, associated IF channel images and montaged SEM images were loaded into the vector graphics editor program Inkscape (version 0.92.3, 11.03.2018) and processed according to a standardized protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markert et al., 2017</xref>). IF channel images were overlaid and linked, leaving only the DAPI channel visible as first image layer. Opacity of IF images was reduced and DAPI-labeled heterochromatin was used as an independent and unbiased landmark for correlation. Linked IF images were linearly transformed (rotation and resizing, but no distortions) to fit the cell nuclei orientation of the EM image. When adequate overlay was achieved, a rectangular area containing the ROI was extracted and each layer exported as a png file. Corresponding IF and EM images were then imported into the image editor GIMP2 (Version 2.10.0, 02.05.2018) for appropriate overlay and exported as png files. For tracing IENF in 3D, the open source software package IMOD was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). Alternating 100 nm sections were imaged via IF and correlated with their corresponding EM images. Within the 100 nm stepwise srAT stack, the trajectory of an IENF was volumetrically reconstructed as extrapolated tubular structure. Its position was determined based on PGP9.5 localization available for every second section.</p><p>Furthermore, distinguishable electron density compared to keratinocyte cytoplasm and absence of desmosomes between adjacent keratinocytes were considered to identify the IENF in the EM context.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Expansion microscopy of thin skin sections</title><p>PFA fixed 10 µm skin cryosections were blocked in 10% BSA(w/v) in PBS for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies against 1:100 PGP9.5 (AbD serotec, Puchheim, Germany) and Cx43 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in 0.1% (w/v) saponin and 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS over night at 4 °C.

Ten µg/ml wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) coupled with CF633 was applied with 10% BSA (w/v) in PBS for 1 hr at RT prior to antibody labeling of skin sections to visualize membranes and extracellular space. Further, PGP9.5 (Zytomed, Berlin, Germany) and Cx43 (alomone labs, Jerusalem, Israel) antibodies were applied with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) instead of saponin. Anchoring was performed with 0.1 mg/ml acryloyl-X in carbonate buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Truckenbrodt et al., 2019</xref>). Gelation was carried out at 4 °C over night prior to 2 hr incubation at 37 °C. Digestion was extended to twice 24 hr at 60 °C to prevent partial expansion and tissue rupture. Non expanded nuclei were imaged via a 20 x objective either prior to expansion or from adjacent 20 µm sections of the same biopsy. For post expansion nuclei, 20 µm z-stacks from ROIs were used as maximum projection. ImageJ and CellProfiler pipelines were applied for size extraction (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Whole epidermal scans post-expansion were acquired with a ThunderImager equipped with a K5 monochrome camera using a ×63 magnification objective (HC PL APO 63 x/1.20 W CORR CS2) at 2x2 binning and 1 µm z-spacing and processed via Thunder Software for digital clearing and mosaic merge at 10% overlap (all Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).

At day 6, i.e. day after insert removal, medium was replaced by fresh keratinocyte medium containing 2 µM Fluo-8 AM (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 1 hr at 37 °C. Medium was changed to a live imaging solution consisting of pre-warmed FluoroBrite DMEM with 25 mM HEPES (both Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cells were mounted on a ThunderImager, and imaged with a K5 monochrome camera at 2x2 binning with a HC PL FLUOTAR 40 x/0.80 PH2 (all Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) after 15 min of acclimatization. One ROI per well of neurites in contact with keratinocytes was imaged at 4 Hz for 4 min at naïve state and relative fluorescence values were extracted via ImageJ and calculated as Δ<italic>F</italic>=F/F0, with F0 as intensity at the first time point. Keratinocytes or neurites with at least 10% increase of ΔF compared to F0 were referred to as spontaneously active.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Ensheathment and Cx43 plaques in clinical tissue sections of SFN patients versus healthy controls were compared via Mann-Whitney-U test.

structures of human epidermis. Human skin is less studied than rodent skin because it presents challenges in obtaining samples and finding excellent immunohistological labels. Here, the authors have employed expansion microscopy and super-resolution array tomography for histological studies and have developed a human keratinocyte and human iPSC-derived sensory neuron co-culture to provide in vitro data from live cells. Together, the data are compelling, and demonstrate that human axons tunnel through keratinocytes where they form gap junctions that allow for direct cellular communication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77761.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Chesler</surname><given-names>Alexander Theodore</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Albers</surname><given-names>Kathryn M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01an3r305</institution-id><institution>University of Pittsburgh</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Price</surname><given-names>Theodore J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/049emcs32</institution-id><institution>UT Dallas</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.23.481592">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.23.481592v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kathryn M Albers (Reviewer #1); Theodore J J Price (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Generally the reviewers we positive about the technical approach and potential impact. The major experimental points raised that should be addressed are (1) use specific antibodies to distinguish between sensory and skin cell types, (2) quantify the histological data that is currently just described and, (3) provide direct evidence for the gap junctions beyond Cx43 expression and plaques in keratinocytes (which was previously known). The last point was deemed critical since clarifying the presence of gap junctions would be a significant advance</p><p>I have attached the reviewer's specific comments. Please provide a point-by-point response to each when resubmitting the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Very nice study – the video files were a real treat!</p><p>The term nociceptor is used to describe nerve fibers.

It is unclear how frequently the IENF are embedded in keratinocytes, or whether there is any particular enrichment of Cx43 near IENF in the skin samples or co-culture. This could be quantified.</p><p>Using orange, red and pink all in one image makes it difficult to distinguish colors, and I imagine this is worse for color blind individuals. More contrasting colors should be chosen for direct comparisons.</p><p>The continuity of a given labeled IENF through multiple sections is not very obvious- in video 1, for example, the PGP9.5 staining does not look continuous at all between frames. It casts some doubt as to how reliable this staining is.</p><p>The authors claim to distinguish Langerhans cells and dermal schwann cells using the same marker. While LCs might not be as common in the dermis, additional markers would be required to confidently identify these two cell types. Moreover, the labeled schwann cell shows very low immunoreactivity to S100B, but human SC's are robustly labeled with S100B antibodies (Stratton et al., 2017, eNeuro).</p><p>The authors do make some claims that their co-culture techniques would allow them to answer, such as &quot;Ensheathment of fibers by keratinocytes may orchestrate nerve fiber outgrowth and stabilization.&quot; (Figure 9 legend). This is mere speculation as it stands, but their imaging system would allow them to quantify this potential stabilization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I think this is a strong paper. I do think there are some weaknesses that should be addressed, and some questions that are outstanding that the authors might want to discuss:</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1) I recognize that the methods used here are challenging, and only sample small areas of the skin, but it would be useful to understand to what extent these arrangements are seen in the skin. Do the authors have the ability to quantify whether most sensory axons form these arrangements or if they are only seen with a particular subset of neuron (because they are relatively rare)?</p><p>2) Along the same lines, PGP9.5 is not specific for a particular type of sensory neuron and is also found in sympathetics and other neurons. The in vitro experiment supports the idea that these are sensory neurons, but have the authors considered looking at a more specific marker of nociceptors, for instance, like TRPV1? This could be quite informative.</p><p>Outstanding questions:</p><p>1) The impact of the paper is good, as it stands, but it could be improved by demonstrating that the gap junction connections are functional. I expected that the in vitro experiments would include such a finding, and was surprised that this was not tested. I think that evidence along these lines would really improve the paper. Having said that, the paper is already strong so this is a matter of preference I suppose. I do feel like readers will be expecting that data.</p><p>2) It would really be nice to better understand the phenotype of these neurons that are tunneling keratinocytes. We have good data on markers for neuronal subsets in humans from the 2 sequencing papers that have now come out. I realize these papers are new, so it is likely too much to ask to do this now, but there should be some discussion.</p><p>3) The burning question, in my mind, is what happens in small fiber neuropathy. Given the rich history of this lab's work in that area, I am sure that is coming in future papers, but I felt the discussion did not go into much detail on this.</p><p>4) I do not think that the authors really discussed their findings versus those of Talagas et al. 2020 sufficiently. My impression is that the Talagas paper is claiming synaptic contacts, but the expansion microscopy shows that these are more like en passant axons that form gap junctions. Are the ensheathments really devoid of gap junctions as shown in the summary figure?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77761.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Very nice study – the video files were a real treat!</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The term nociceptor is used to describe nerve fibers.

After evaluation of several other commercially available antibodies, we found a suitable replacement (ACC-201-GP; alomone labs, Jerusalem, Israel) working well in skin sections, however, showing a higher degree of unspecific labeling in cultures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77761-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Second, deriving co-cultures (2 weeks iPSC preparation and differentiation, 6 weeks maturation, and 1 week co-cultivation) currently represents a time consuming bottleneck.Third, related to the cell culture, many variables from differentiation efficiency (variation between iPSC passages, media and supplement lots, matrigel lots, etc.), success in neuronal split (variable cluster sizes, neuronal density, adhesion strength of neurons), keratinocyte growth (passage- and density-dependent), and other unknown factors influence the outcome of the later co-culture regarding number of outgrowing neurites and contact to keratinocytes. An infeasible amount of co-cultures would be needed to compensate this variability. Alternatively, a highly standardized co-culture format would be necessary as indicated in the ‘Discussion section’ of our revised manuscript (please see page 28):</p><p>“Specialized microfluidic chambers with directional neurite outgrowth, coupled with perfusion systems are needed to validate and quantify various modes of keratinocyte-neurite interactions at higher-throughput combined with keratinocyte-specific stimulation or antagonists like the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be very interesting to know the type of nerve fiber being analyzed, e.g., peptide-rich (TrpV1+) or peptide-poor (TrpV1-), for both in vivo and culture analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>As a pilot experiment, we have evaluated the use of TRPV1 labeling (see Figure Supplement 3), however, we refrain from integration into the main experiments (see page 9).</p><p>“To discriminate IENF subtypes, we applied immunoreaction against TRPV1, however, we could not extract IENF-specific co-localization, also after expansion (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Despite being a commonly reported marker in immune-labeling experiments, the current opinion in the field is that specific antibodies for TRPV1 for human samples are not available. The use of any commercial antibody might result in uncertain or even erroneous data. With this caveat in mind, TRPV1 punctae appeared to be localized mainly within keratinocyte cytoplasm and close to keratinocyte membrane.</p><p>Co-localization with nerve fibers was observable in the dermis, however, due to keratinocyte signal, our achieved imaging resolution did not permit any conclusion on IENF. The observed labeling pattern may indicate specific labeling together with additional unspecific binding. For precise analysis a validated TRPV1 antibody, e.g. via previous evaluation of labeling of iPSC-derived human nociceptors with TRPV1 and TRPV1 knockout line, would be necessary.

I realize these papers are new, so it is likely too much to ask to do this now, but there should be some discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed tried to include TRPV1 (ACC-030, alomone labs) as a known and GPX2 (HPA003545, Σ-Aldrich) as a potential novel marker of sensory neuron subsets (assumed A-LTMR low-threshold mechanosensory neurons) extracted from literature (Tavares-Ferreira <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). TRPV1 signal was challenging to obtain from fibers after penetrating towards the epidermis (see comments above) and we did not detect a specific labeling of any GPX2 fibers co-localizing with PGP9.5 signal. A thorough evaluation of suitable antibodies against described potential markers, e.g. including Oncostatin M receptor and Somatostatin (assumed silent nociceptors) proposed in the mentioned published sequencing data should be applied in human skin samples. However, this is out of the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The burning question, in my mind, is what happens in small fiber neuropathy. Given the rich history of this lab's work in that area, I am sure that is coming in future papers, but I felt the discussion did not go into much detail on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that quantification of morphological features at the neuro-cutaneous unit will give invaluable new insights in diseases affecting small fibers.</p><p>We faced several challenges to advance our proof of principle data towards clinical application. First, inclusion of thicker skin sections used in routine (usually 20-40 µm) did not properly expand with the current ExM protocol, since tissue sections are more complex than cultured cells and skin is an especially challenging tissue. We overcame this in the end with an adapted ExM protocol (see page 43-44).</p><p>Second, the imaging of expanded tissue sections leads to an exponential increase in imaging data up to terabytes. In our lab, we currently do not have a SOP for automated big data integration and image segmentation.</p><p>Still, as a pilot experiment, we aimed to compare a small group of small fiber neuropathy patients (n = 4) versus healthy controls (n = 5). We incorporated these data in Figure 5 (see also page 15-17). In our small cohort we did not observe differences in patients, yet of note these ensheathment and contact ratios seem to be relatively homogenous for controls and may be more variable in small fiber neuropathy patients. With the rise of cloud data storage and AI tools we are optimistic that skin sections from larger cohorts can be analyzed and interpreted at super-resolution in future, however this is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I do not think that the authors really discussed their findings versus those of Talagas et al. 2020 sufficiently. My impression is that the Talagas paper is claiming synaptic contacts, but the expansion microscopy shows that these are more like en passant axons that form gap junctions.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised and extended our discussion on discrepancies and similarities of our findings and that of the Talagas group (Talagas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020) in more detail in our revised manuscript. Please see page 27-28:</p><p>“Additionally, SYP, synaptotagmin, and syntax in 1A were successfully labeled together with cytokeratin 6 as a keratinocyte marker and pan-neurofilament as a neurite marker, suggesting en passant synapse-like contacts (Talagas et al., 2020b). Further, this study described tunneling fibers and “gutters” in their heterologous co-culture system, being congruent to our observations in the human keratinocyte- sensory neuron system. However, neurofilaments represent intermediate filaments within the cytoplasm and may not encompass the whole neuronal outline compared to membrane labeling (see Figure supplement 5). In accordance with findings from native DRG neurons, our sensory iPSC neurons contained SYP accumulations within the cytoplasm (Chou et al., 2002; Chung et al., 2019), deeming a membranous labeling necessary to clearly localize SYP in keratinocytes and rule out a neuronal localization within a co-culture approach. In our study, we did not observe specific SYP-positive clusters or vesicles in the cytosol of primary human keratinocytes associated with passing neurites. Still, electrophysiological activity of neurons in contact with keratinocytes has shown to be attenuated after blockage vesicular secretion of keratinocytes via botulinum neurotoxin type C, hinting towards a physiological role of synaptic release in signal transduction at the NCU (Talagas et al., 2020b).”</p><p>We believe that an even more extensive discussion solely on Talagas et al., 2020b would overburden the ‘Discussion’ section. In general, these colleagues also hypothesize an en-passant synapses, however, via chemical/vesicular release of signaling molecules. The groups shows presence of the mentioned vesicular proteins via Western blot and immunolabeling, connected to electrophysiology with and without vesicular blockage via botulinum toxin, which showed an effect on neuronal currents and conductance. Still our colleagues did not show or compare action potentials in this setup. From available sequencing data, a low expression of the investigated synaptic genes in keratinocytes is known (https://www.proteinatlas.org/). Taken together, en-passant vesicle release may represent one of several signaling routes. We caution on imaging/antibody-based conclusions on localization/structure in general and specifically in this case. Conversely, we focused on multiple imaging modalities (srAT, ExM, skin, co-culture) and selected markers (e.g. for membrane) to validate morphological findings in the human system, yet addressing the physiological axis less detailed, also due to already established literature regarding connexins (e.g. communication between keratinocytes and trigeminal neurons in co-culture attenuated by gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (Sondersorg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the ensheathments really devoid of gap junctions as shown in the summary figure?</p></disp-quote><p>Both in srAT and ExM, we did not observe Cx43 plaques at ensheathment sites.</p><p>References</p><p>Jiang, N., Rasmussen, J.P., Clanton, J.A., Rosenberg, M.F., Luedke, K.P., Cronan, M.R., Parker, E.D., Kim, H.-J., Vaughan, J.C., Sagasti, A., 2019.
