Human mutations in the small GTPase Arl3 cause both autosomal recessive and dominant inherited retinal dystrophies. We discovered that dominant mutations result in increased active G-protein—Arl3-D67V has constitutive activity and Arl3-Y90C is fast cycling—and their expression in mouse rods resulted in a displaced nuclear phenotype due to an aberrant Arl3-GTP gradient. Using multiple strategies, we go on to show that removing or restoring the Arl3-GTP gradient within the cilium is sufficient to rescue the nuclear migration defect. Together, our results reveal that an Arl3 ciliary gradient is involved in proper positioning of photoreceptor nuclei during retinal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Arl3</kwd><kwd>photoreceptors</kwd><kwd>neuronal migration</kwd><kwd>Arl13B</kwd><kwd>RP2</kwd><kwd>retinal dystrophy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearring</surname><given-names>Jillian N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>E.

Arl3 is ubiquitously expressed in ciliated cells where it regulates the ciliary enrichment of lipidated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fansa and Wittinghofer, 2016</xref>). Many prenylated and myristoylated proteins are shuttled by the Arl3 effectors PDEδ and UNC119A/B, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fansa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). PDEδ and UNC119A/B are chaperones that sequester the lipid anchor moiety of proteins within an intramolecular cavity to enable detachment of these proteins from membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanzal-Bayer et al., 2002</xref>). Arl3 is specifically activated in the cilium by its guanine exchange factor (GEF) Arl13B and co-GEF BART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">ElMaghloob et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>). Active GTP-bound Arl3 then binds to the chaperones allowing them to unload their lipidated cargo at the cilium. Arl3 is inactive outside the cilium as it is inactivated by RP2, its GTPase activating protein (GAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Veltel et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veltel et al., 2008b</xref>) that is found enriched at the base of the cilium, although it is also present at other locations in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holopainen et al., 2010</xref>). Germline Arl3 knockout mice have phenotypes generally associated with human ciliopathies, including polycystic kidneys and photoreceptor degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schrick et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In photoreceptors, Arl3 regulates enrichment of many lipidated proteins essential for eliciting the visual response within the outer segment, a modified primary cilium (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frederick et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, human mutations in Arl3 have been linked to various forms of retinal degeneration: R99I causes autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sheikh et al., 2019</xref>), R149H or R149C cause recessive Joubert syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkanderi et al., 2018</xref>), compound heterozygous T31A/C118F causes rod-cone dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2021</xref>), Y90C causes autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holtan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Strom et al., 2016</xref>), and D67V causes autosomal dominant retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ratnapriya et al., 2021</xref>). The R149H/C mutation is present at the Arl3–Arl13B interface and was shown to prevent Arl3 activation by Arl13B, which causes reduced enrichment of lipidated proteins in the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkanderi et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the Arl3 mutations C118F, Y90C, and D67V have also been predicted to impair its interactions with binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ratnapriya et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Strom et al., 2016</xref>); while the R991, T31A, C118F, and Y90C mutations are predicted to destabilize Arl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holtan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sheikh et al., 2019</xref>). These studies predict that human disease is linked to a loss of Arl3 function; however, the fact that Arl3 mutations can present as dominant retinal dystrophy suggests that some of these variants result in excessive Arl3 activity.</p><p>Studies from mice support this idea. Both a rod-specific Arl3 knockout mouse or a transgenic mouse overexpressing constitutively active Arl3-Q71L in rods show severe retinal degeneration by 2 months and result in measurable effects on lipidated protein delivery to the outer segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanke-Gogokhia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wright et al., 2016</xref>). However, only mice with Arl3-Q71L transgenic expression in rods had a subset of rod nuclei displaced from the outer nuclear layer (ONL) into the inner nuclear layer (INL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wright et al., 2016</xref>). Improper rod nuclear displacement into the INL has also been observed in a RP2 knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mookherjee et al., 2015</xref>), further suggesting that disrupting Arl3 activity in rods could lead to a nuclear migration phenotype.</p><p>Retinal neurons are organized into three distinct nuclear layers (listed from apical to basal): the ONL, the INL, and the ganglion cell layer (GCL). During development, all retinal neurons are born apically and then migrate to their final retinal layer where they elaborate and make connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baye and Link, 2008</xref>). For cones, whose nuclei are arranged at the apical side of the ONL, it is known that their nuclear position can be influenced by either knocking out RASGRF2 the GEF for the Ras/Rho/Rac family of small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jimeno et al., 2016</xref>), altering dopamine signaling through the D4 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tufford et al., 2018</xref>), or uncoupling the nucleus from microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Razafsky et al., 2012</xref>). Less is known about how rod nuclear position is determined, but microtubule coupling to the nucleus is important. Mouse models disrupting this connection have found rod nuclei mislocalized to the INL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2011</xref>) and, more recently, a study found that rods undergo rapid, dynein-dependent apical nuclear translocations during the formation of the retinal nuclear layers between P0 and P8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghaizu et al., 2021</xref>). Exactly how constitutively active Arl3 might impair the migration of rod nuclei has not been investigated.</p><p>We hypothesized that the autosomal dominant human Arl3 mutations are causing constitutively active Arl3 and might result in a nuclear migration defect. Using in vitro biochemistry and cell-based experiments, we found that dominant Arl3 mutations, D67V and Y90C, result in increased cellular activity through distinct changes to their GTPase function. D67V is constitutively active and Y90C is fast cycling. Using in vivo mouse experiments, we further show that this aberrant activity disrupts the Arl3-GTP gradient in the cilium causing defects in rod nuclear migration. Importantly, we can rescue the Arl3-Y90C migration phenotype by either removing the Arl3-GTP gradient entirely or restoring active Arl3-GTP to the cilium highlighting that the cilium is important for proper photoreceptor migration during retinal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of dominant Arl3 mutants in rod photoreceptors causes nuclear mislocalization</title><p>We investigated whether the dominantly inherited human mutations of Arl3 caused a nuclear migration phenotype by expressing exogenous FLAG-tagged human Arl3-D67V and Arl3-Y90C in mouse rods using in vivo electroporation. FLAG immunostaining of retinal cross-sections showed wild-type Arl3-FLAG present throughout the rod photoreceptor including, notably, within the outer segment at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both Arl3-D67V-FLAG and Arl3-Y90C-FLAG expression and localization were similar to wild-type Arl3-FLAG, with perhaps a trend toward less Arl3-D67V within the outer segments although this was not quantified. Strikingly, though, many of the Arl3-D67V and Arl3-Y90C nuclei were mislocalized to the INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>), 7.4% and 2.9% of nuclei, respectively. This nuclear displacement is similar to transgenic expression of the GTP-locked mutant Arl3-Q71L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wright et al., 2016</xref>) and our own electroporation of Arl3-Q71L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), in which 5.4% of nuclei were mislocalized to the INL. Additionally, even the Arl3-D67V and Arl3-Y90C nuclei localized within the ONL are predominantly displaced basally, while the nuclei of wild-type Arl3-FLAG rods are distributed more evenly throughout the ONL. To quantify this shift, the skewness of the Gaussian distribution of FLAG-expressing nuclei within the ONL was compared between Arl3 mutants and wild-type Arl3. A skewness of zero describes a normal symmetrical distribution, while negative or positive skewness values describe a shift in the distribution apically or basally within the ONL, respectively. All the mutants that had rod nuclei mislocalized to the INL—D67V, Q71L, and Y90C—were positively skewed and statistically significant from wild-type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This shift in rod nuclear position was not seen with overexpression of a GDP-bound inactive mimetic, Arl3-T31N-FLAG, suggesting that increased Arl3 activity during development causes a defect in rod nuclear migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Linari et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of dominant Arl3 mutants in rod photoreceptors causes nuclear mislocalization.</title><p>Representative images showing cross-sections through wild-type mouse retinas electroporated with Arl3-3XFLAG (<bold>A</bold>), Arl3-D67V-FLAG (<bold>B</bold>), Arl3-Y90C-FLAG (<bold>C</bold>), Arl3-Q71L-FLAG (<bold>D</bold>), or Arl3-T31N-FLAG (<bold>E</bold>) and immunostained with anti-FLAG antibodies (green).

rod nuclei, we hypothesized that these mutations would also result in constitutively active Arl3. We first tested whether the Arl3 mutations are GTPase impaired by assessing their ability to interact with the Arl3 effector PDEδ. A GST-PDEδ pulldown was performed from AD-293 cell lysates expressing FLAG-tagged Arl3 mutants. As expected, inactive Arl3-T31N did not bind to GST-PDEδ while the constitutively active Arl3-Q71L is bound. Arl3-D67V was also pulled down by GST-PDEδ, indicating that it is constitutively active.

We attempted to load Arl3-Y90C with GTP by incubating Arl3-Y90C-FLAG-expressing AD-293 cell lysates with EDTA (to imitate the function of the GEF by chelating out the nucleotide coordinating Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and found that, if there is excess GTP in the buffer, Arl3-Y90C can bind GTP as measured by GST-PDEδ binding, similar to both endogenous Arl3 (as seen below in the same blot) and Arl3-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In fact, Arl3-Y90C binds GTP under these nucleotide exchange promoting conditions more efficiently than the endogenous Arl3 expressed by these cells. Interestingly, when excess GTP was added Arl3-Y90C also underwent nucleotide exchange in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which blocks nucleotide exchange for endogenous Arl3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and Arl3-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result indicates possible GEF-independent nucleotide exchange in Arl3-Y90C, a behavior that is often described as fast cycling of a small GTPase. To confirm, we tested the behavior of Arl3-D129N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>), a homologous mutant of the fast cycling Ras-D119N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cool et al., 1999</xref>), in this assay and found it behaved biochemically identical to Arl3-Y90C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To confirm that this biochemical result reveals small GTPase behavior relevant to the migration phenotype, we electroporated Arl3-D129N-FLAG in mouse rod photoreceptors and found that the fast cycling Arl3-D129N replicated the Arl3-Y90C migration phenotype with 3.7% of Arl3-D129N-FLAG-expressing cells mislocalized to the INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, our data suggest that the Arl3-Y90C mutation results in fast cycling behavior that causes excess Arl3 activation in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Arl3-Y90C behaves as a dominant negative</title><p>Another key component of fast cycling GTPase behavior is increased binding to the GEF due to an increased nucleotide-free state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cool et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>). We tested whether the Arl3-Y90C mutation also caused increased binding to Arl13B, the ciliary Arl3 GEF, by analyzing the ability of FLAG-tagged Arl3 mutants to co-immunoprecipitate GFP-tagged Arl13B from cell culture lysates. As controls we used the fast cycling D129N mutation previously shown to bind Arl13B in yeast-2-hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>) and the Arl3-R149H mutant previously shown to disrupt interaction with Arl13B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkanderi et al., 2018</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, western blot analysis of the FLAG eluates using an anti-GFP antibody shows Arl3-Y90C binds Arl13B. When we introduced the R149H mutation to the Arl3-Y90C mutant, Arl13B binding was disrupted similarly to the Arl3-R149H single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), confirming that Arl3-Y90C binding to Arl13B is at the same interface as wild-type binding. This result suggests that increased Arl13B binding to the Arl3-Y90C mutant is due to an increased nucleotide-free state of Arl3-Y90C rather than fundamental alterations within its Arl13B-binding site, a conclusion supported by the continued binding of Arl3-Y90C to Arl13B after an additional T31N mutation, which decouples GTP-binding state from Arl13B-binding behavior of Arl3-Y90C.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Arl3-Y90C acts as a dominant negative.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FLAG immunoprecipitation from AD-293 lysates expressing Arl13B-GFP and Arl3-FLAG mutants.

Further, electroporation of Arl13B-myc in rods results in myc staining primarily in the outer segment with some present in the cell body and synapse. The same Arl13B localization pattern was observed when Arl13B-myc was co-expressed with Arl3-Y90C confirming that Arl3-Y90C binding does not alter Arl13B ciliary localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Although expression of Arl3-Y90C does not cause mislocalization of Arl13B, Arl3-Y90C could have profound effects as a dominant negative by binding to Arl13B—Arl13B sequestered by Arl3-Y90C would no longer activate endogenous Arl3. If Arl3-Y90C is causing the migration defect because it is acting as a dominant negative, migration should be rescued if enough Arl13B is present in the outer segment to activate endogenous Arl3 and therefore overcome the dominant negative consequences of Arl3-Y90C expression. To test this, the localization of rod nuclei of cells expressing both Arl3-Y90C-FLAG and Arl13B-MYC was examined. This cell population no longer has the migration defect observed with only Arl3-Y90C-FLAG expression indicating that the migration defect is caused at least in part by Arl3-Y90C acting as a dominant negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Arl3-Y90C undergoes GEF-independent activation in cell culture</title><p>The fact that Arl3-Q71L and Arl3-D67V, which are both constitutively active, also cause the migration defect while it is not seen in Arl3-KO mice argues that the dominant negative role of Arl3-Y90C is not a sufficient explanation for this phenotype, so we next examined the nucleotide status of Arl3-Y90C in the cell. Since the fast cycling nature of Arl3-Y90C precludes any measurement of the biological nucleotide-binding state using GST-PDEδ pulldowns, we incubated AD-293 cells expressing wild-type or mutant FLAG-tagged Arl3 constructs with the permeable crosslinker DSS and then performed FLAG immunoprecipitations to identify Arl3 effector complexes by western blot using an anti-Arl3 antibody. As proof of concept, we performed this in vivo crosslinking for the inactive Arl3-T31N and constitutively active Arl3-Q71L mutants. When DSS crosslinker was added, three major Arl3 complexes were visible in the presence of active Arl3-Q71L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

To confirm that RP2 is forming the ~65 kDa complex with Arl3-Q71L in the in vivo crosslinking experiments, we generated and tested a Arl3-Q71L/E164A/D168A triple mutant (Q71L[noRP2]) that maintains active Arl3 binding to effectors but not RP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 1). Western blot using antibodies against RP2 confirmed that the ~65 kDa band is indeed a complex between RP2 and Arl3-Q71L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 2). We took a similar approach to confirm that UNC119 is forming the ~55 kDa complex with Arl3-Q71L by using Arl3-D67V. This mutant has constitutive activity in our GST-PDEδ in vitro pulldowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) but is unable to interact with UNC119A-myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, the ~55 kDa band is strongly reduced in the presence of Arl3-D67V, confirming that this complex is between Arl3 and UNC119A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 3). We believe the final complex at ~45 kDa in each constitutively active condition is between Arl3-GTP and BART but were unable to directly verify. Overall, we show that the in vivo crosslinking experiments measure the presence of Arl3-GTP in a transfected populations of cells via effector binding. As an aside, we also found that in vivo crosslinking can reveal differences in how Arl3 mutants bind effectors since covalent crosslinking of secondary structures can result in proteins running faster in the gel (e.g., the Arl3 band runs faster than 25 kDa after exposure to the crosslinker, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the red arrowhead highlights a FLAG- and RP2-positive band in the presence of Arl3-D67V that runs faster than the same complex found in the Arl3-Q71L lane. This likely indicates differences in RP2 binding between the two constitutively active mutants that result in different crosslinking-site availability.</p><p>We then performed the in vivo crosslinking on cells expressing Arl3-Y90C-FLAG and found that Arl3-Y90C formed complexes with UNC119 and BART but did not make a stable complex with RP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This result suggests that Arl3-Y90C is active in AD-293 cells and binding effectors but, unlike Arl3-Q71L, is inactivated by RP2 and therefore does not form a stable complex with RP2. The fast cycling mutant Arl3-D129N showed the same pattern of Arl3 complex formation. To understand the relative level of active Arl3-Y90C in cells, we measured the band intensity of each Arl3 in complex with UNC119 or BART and normalized to the same bands in Arl3-Q71L. We found that both fast cycling mutants, Arl3-D129N and Arl3-Y90C, had significantly higher levels than wild-type Arl3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The relative amounts of effector complex formation correlate to migration phenotype: wild-type has normal migration and is not significantly different than Arl3-T31N while the amount of Arl3-Y90C and Arl3-D129N activation is closer to Arl3-Q71L, resulting in defective migration.</p><p>We also performed the in vivo crosslinking on cells expressing the Arl3-Y90C/R149H-FLAG double mutant construct to verify whether the aberrant activity of the fast cycling Y90C mutation is maintained in the absence of GEF binding. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, we see increased expression of the Arl3-UNC119 and Arl3-BART complexes in the Y90C/R149H double mutant compared to the R149H control. Importantly, the Y90C mutation no longer forms effector complexes in the presence of the T31N mutation, so binding of GTP is indeed still necessary for activity in the presence of the Y90C mutation. Together, these results confirm that GEF-independent nucleotide exchange to GTP is activating the Arl3-Y90C mutant in cells.</p><p>Our previous FLAG immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Arl3-Y90C has tight binding to Arl13B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but to test whether this is occurring in the cell we performed in vivo crosslinking experiments in the presence of Arl13B-GFP. As a control, we used Arl3-R149H-FLAG and found that it was unable to form complexes with expressed Arl13B-GFP as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In contrast, in vivo crosslinking captured complexes between Arl13B-GFP and Arl3-Y90C showing that GEF binding is a feature of Arl3-Y90C in cells. We also found Arl13B-GFP complexes with Arl3-T31N/Y90C, but not with Arl3-T31N, suggesting that the Arl3-Y90C ability to tightly bind the GEF does not depend on its nucleotide status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Together our biochemical data show that Arl3-Y90C and Arl3-Q71L/Arl3-D67V both have aberrant activity and form stable complexes with important members of the Arl3 GTPase cycle, Arl13B and RP2, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> shows a cartoon model of a developing ‘immature’ rod photoreceptor and how Arl3 activity effector binding is altered in the presence of different dominant mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Aberrant Arl3 activity drives the rod nuclear migration phenotype</title><p>We hypothesized that the nuclear migration defect requires aberrant activation of Arl3 within rods.

These studies highlighted the necessity of Arl3 for photoreceptor health and raised the possibly that different biochemical alterations in Arl3 might produce divergent pathobiological underpinnings. In this study, we focused on the biochemical and cellular consequences of dominant mutations in Arl3 and found that aberrant activity in rods causes a developmental nuclear migration defect. The two dominant Arl3 variants, D67V and Y90C, phenocopied the constitutively active Q71L, previously shown to result in mislocalization of rod nuclei into the INL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wright et al., 2016</xref>). However, these dominant mutations had very different GTPase behaviors: the D67V behaved as a constitutively active GTPase and the Y90C functioned as a fast cycling GTPase.</p><p>Previous in silico analyses predicted that the D67V mutation would decrease affinity to the Arl3-binding partners RP2, UNC119a, and Arl13B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ratnapriya et al., 2021</xref>). In fact, we found that Arl3-D67V forms a stable complex with RP2, similar to the constitutively active Q71L variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>); but appears to subtly change the binding properties toward the effectors PDEδ and UNC119. Even though Arl3-D67V can bind PDEδ and RP2, it does not bind them both at the same time, a Arl3-Q71L feature shown both here and previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veltel et al., 2008b</xref>). We also found that Arl3-D67V disrupted UNC119 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This effector specificity is surprising considering how similar the binding interfaces are in the UNC119a-Arl2/3 and PDEδ-Arl2 crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanzal-Bayer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ismail et al., 2012</xref>). Further study of the Arl3-D67V variant could provide insight into both the structural and functional differences between PDEδ and UNC119.</p><p>Tyrosine 90 is located right in the center of the G-domain, and this site is not strictly conserved throughout the small GTPase family. Previous predictions were that Y90C would result in haploinsufficiency due to destabilized binding to effectors or protein instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holtan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Strom et al., 2016</xref>). Instead, we discover that the Arl3-Y90C variant is behaving like a fast cycling GTPase as it has GEF-independent GTP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our results highlight that fast cycling mutations are also dominant negative—normal activation of the endogenous GTPase is altered by Arl3-Y90C binding to Arl13B in the cilia. Interestingly, while the dominant negative feature of Arl3-Y90C was necessary it was not sufficient to produce a migration defect suggesting that aberrant activity outside the cilia plays a role.</p><p>We developed an easy and useful in vivo crosslinking assay to determine nucleotide-binding state of small GTPase proteins within cells. This technique allows for a snapshot of activity that cannot be perturbed during lysis and pulldown and provides quantitative information about effector-binding ratios. We showed that Arl3-Y90C has aberrant activity in the cells, although not as robust as Q71L, and is able to hydrolyze GTP as it does not make a stable complex with RP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Despite the higher levels of Arl3-Y90C activity in the cell, we actually find that reactivating endogenous Arl3 in the presence of this activity prevents the nuclear migration defect in rods. This suggests that the defect is not caused by an increase in overall Arl3 activity, but a disruption of proper Arl3-GTP localization within the cell. We found only co-expression of ciliary lipidated cargos could restore the migration defect as they deliver Arl3 effectors directly to the cilia reactivating endogenous Arl3 at that site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate that more active Arl3 must be present in the cilium than the cell body for proper migration of rod nuclei during retinal development. This requirement for a ciliary Arl3-GTP gradient seems very similar to the Ran-GTP gradient important for nuclear transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sorokin et al., 2007</xref>). Movement down this gradient acts as a driving force behind cargo delivery into the cilium, so altering rather than removing the Arl3 gradient would have a distinct impact on cargo behavior. When Arl3 activity levels are increased in the cell body relative to the cilium, the driving force reverses, and cargo is no longer delivered. It is possible that disrupting delivery results in downregulation of the cargo. This might explain why absence of Arl3 activity does not cause a migration defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), as there would be no driving force on the cargo and its widespread delivery could result in sufficient accumulation at the cilium.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neuronal migration</title><p>We found that mutations in Arl3 can cause a mislocalization of rod photoreceptor nuclei toward the basal ONL and into the INL. Our results show a satisfying alignment between biochemical behavior, genetic presentation, and migration phenotype; however, our studies did not address whether the migration defect caused by the aberrant Arl3 activity is sufficient to cause degeneration. The knockout of RP2, resulting in increased Arl3 activity, causes progressive photoreceptor degeneration and has a population of rods mislocalized to the INL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>). However, RP2 gene therapy in adult mice slowed degeneration, suggesting that the rod nuclear mislocalization may not be pathogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mookherjee et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, it was previously shown that basal displacement of rod nuclei coincides with retinal disfunction including defects in synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghaizu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2011</xref>), so even if the rod migration defect does not directly cause cell autonomous degeneration it could affect the physiological function of rods and therefore retinal health. The exact pathobiological outcomes of displaced photoreceptor nuclei remain to be fully understood.</p><p>A related question is why the two dominant mutations cause retinal degeneration but not ciliopathies. Arl3 is expressed in all ciliated cells, and some recessive Arl3 mutations do cause syndromic disease. In fact, mutations in Arl13B, the Arl3 GEF, cause the syndromic ciliopathy Joubert syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cantagrel et al., 2008</xref>) and can cause a reduction of Arl3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>). The Arl3 GAP RP2, on the other hand, causes non-syndromic retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breuer et al., 2002</xref>), providing more evidence that the impact of excess active Arl3 on cells is more detrimental for retinal photoreceptors than other ciliated cells throughout the body. Further studies are needed to determine if the migration phenotype is present in other neurons or if the mechanism linking Arl3 function to nuclear translocation is photoreceptor specific.</p><p>Finally, while our data demonstrate that the cilium is involved in apical nuclear translocation of rod photoreceptors, the precise ciliary signal remains unknown. Arl3 is known to traffic many lipidated signaling proteins to the ciliary outer segment in mature mouse rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanke-Gogokhia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wright et al., 2016</xref>). Most of these candidates are involved in mediating the light response and not known to be involved in nuclear migration, which is a developmental process that ends at P10 for mouse rod photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghaizu et al., 2021</xref>). ‘Immature’ migrating rods are ciliated, but the developmental function as well as whether any Arl3-dependent ciliary cargos are enriched within the cilia remains unknown. In the brain, primary cilia have previously been shown to play a role in neuronal nuclear migration, with studies implicating both Arl13B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higginbotham et al., 2012</xref>) and cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stoufflet et al., 2020</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see that all the reviewers agree that the paper is of interest to cell biologists studying ciliogenesis and specifically vertebrate photoreceptors. Overall, they mention that the experiments are properly controlled, executed, and analyzed. The development of a method to analyze snapshots of the interaction between ARL3 and its interactors is also a strength of the paper. However, significant concerns have been raised by all the reviewers. We highlight two major concerns at the heart of the paper's current message that need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1. How does nuclear migration failure impact ciliogenesis in the outer segment? The reviewers suggest that further analysis of the trafficking defects of effectors and cilium length for electroporated variants could better link cilium/trafficking defects with the nuclei migration phenotypes.</p><p>2. Testing alternative hypotheses for the Y90C mutant with regards to (a) sequestration of the GEF ARL13B in preventing activation of the endogenous ARL3, and (b) effects on subcellular localization. The reviewers suggest that these alternative models might be tested by the rescue of ARL3 Y90C driven phenotype upon co-expression of ARL13B and detailed imaging and analysis for the ARL3 variants/potential effectors in photoreceptor subcellular segments.</p><p>Please also provide a point-by-point response to the remaining critiques of the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Figure 1: It would be better to have a description of what the value means on the left side as well as the bottom side of the scatter plot.

However, the quantification shown in Figure 3E indicated that the signal intensity of the bands in D129N cells is much stronger than those of Y90C cells. Is this because the authors normalized the intensity by the intensity of the FLAG-band?</p><p>4) Figure 3F, Figure 3G, and Figure 4A: It would be great if the authors could have quantification just like the authors did in Figure 3E.</p><p>5) Line59: R991 should be R99I.</p><p>6) Line 189: &quot;It was unable to form complexes with expressed with ARL13B-GFP&quot;.</p><p>Should this be &quot;It was unable to form complexes when expressed with ARL13B-GFP&quot;?</p><p>7) Line 283-284: &quot;but appears to subtly change the binding properties toward the effectors PDEδ and UNC119.&quot; What is this sentence referring to?

The authors never examine actual ciliogenesis in their retinal model – nuclear migration is the only readout. First, some description of how nuclear migration impacts retinal development should be included in the introduction. More importantly, however, the authors should specifically show the morphology of the cilia in cells expressing the various Arl3 mutants. This is particularly important for experiments in which the expression of effectors or cargo relieves the nuclear migration phenotype induced by the mutants. Do effectors and/or cargo reach the cilia, and are they distributed normally, even if nuclear migration is rescued? Immunostaining for PDEd, UNC199A, INPP5E, and NPHP3 would be essential for this purpose.</p><p>2. The authors should expand their discussion of the Y90C mutant to include its action as a dominant-negative, and the complex nature of its features. It is clearly not simply a rapid cycling mutant.</p><p>3. Do any of these mutants have phenotypes in non-retinal ciliated cells? If this is known it could simply be described, but if not they could be tested simply in cell culture models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The word &quot;gradient&quot; is stated throughout the text, including in the title. However, none of the experiments ever directly assess this. And is it really a gradient? Or just subcellular compartmentalization segregating the specialized cilium of photoreceptors and the cell body?</p><p>– Since spatial localization of Arl3, Arl13B, RP2, and Arl3 effectors PDEd and UNC119, seem to be key in the overall model of differential subcellular activation of Arl3, it should be better highlighted in the introduction where these proteins are localized in photoreceptors specifically, with the corresponding original references.</p><p>– Line 69 (introduction): it is stated that &quot;rod nuclear displacement has also been observed in RP2 KO mouse&quot; with direct references to &quot;Li et al., 2013 and Mookherjee et al., 2015&quot;. However, rod nuclei displacement was never directly assessed on these papers. Indeed, there seems to be a phenotype in ONL/OPL/INL of RP2 KO mice, which could potentially be displacement of rod nuclei. This is interesting and should be actually evaluated. I suggest an experiment to directly assess this in this mice KO line or by knocking-down RP2 using in a similar strategy to the one the authors use to deliver transgenes to P0 mice retinas by means of electroporation.</p><p>– Line 75 (intro): &quot;using in vivo mouse models…&quot;. The word &quot;models&quot; should be substituted by &quot;experiments&quot;.</p><p>– Line 76 (intro): &quot;show that this aberrant activity disrupts the Arl3-GTP gradient in the cilium&quot;. This is actually never directly shown in the manuscript. Combination of multiple experiments together with differential subcellular protein localization, suggest, and suggest only, that this is the case. The wording should be adjusted.</p><p>– Line 77 (intro): the rescue experiments were only performed for the Y90C variant, not for the D67V. This should be clear during the text. The way it's written implies that rescue experiments were done for both of the mutations.</p><p>– Line 84 (intro): &quot;…in rods using…&quot; modify to &quot;…in mice rods using…&quot;</p><p>– More detailed imaging and analysis should be performed for the specialized cilium of photoreceptors (inner segment, connecting cilium and outer segment). Specifically show in more detail the FLAG-staining for each variant. Even though it is stated in the text that &quot;while both Arl3-D67V-FLAG and Arl3-Y90C-FLAG expression and localization were indistinguishable from wild-type Arl3-FLAG&quot;, some images do not represent this. For instance, Y90C-FLAG signal seems to be mostly staining outer segments, while D67V seems to mostly stain inner segments, at least in the representative images shown. Is this always the case?</p><p>– Analysis should be done to measure cilium length for each condition and also between INL-displaced, basally-displaced and non-displaced rods electroporated with the different variants. In addition, it should be evaluated if there is a correlation between cilium length and rod displacement. This is important in linking both cilium and nuclei, the main point of the manuscript.</p><p>– &quot;skew&quot; values are a valuable and sophisticated quantification measure of the phenotype and should be added to Figure 1 (and to all other figures, when applicable) to highlight the phenotype.</p><p>– In addition to the skewness analysis, the number of displaced rods normalized to total number of electroporated ones should also be quantified for each condition to better compare and evaluate the phenotype (this is somewhat already shown by the histogram, but adding a percent count will solidify the phenotype finding). This should be done for Figure 1 and all other figures, when applicable. In addition, these percentages should be discussed in the paper. A related question that should be discussed is, since these are dominant variants why isn't the phenotype more dramatic?</p><p>– Variant D67V is not as well characterized as Y90C, even though it is introduced with the same significance as the Y90C. What's the model for how D67V is leading to rod displacement, since it does not bind RP2 like the Q71L? Can you add a schematic for this variant to Figure 3H.</p><p>– According to your model, Q71L variant is responsible for rod nuclei displacement due to constant binding to RP2, sequestering it and preventing it to inactivate endogenous Arl3 at the base of the cilium. A straight-forward experiment to test this model is to perform a rescue experiment by co-expression of the variant together with RP2, similar to what was done with co-overexpression of UNC119 or PDE δ. In addition, the Q71L [noRP2] triple mutant should also rescue the rod nuclei phenotype, according to your model.</p><p>– Perform another rescue experiment of Arl3Y90C driven phenotype by co-overexpression of Arl13B. Increasing the levels of Arl13B should also rescue the rod displacement if there is enough Arl13B to activate endogenous Arl3, according to your proposed model.</p><p>– To meet the human relevance justifying your studies (that is, Arl3 variants associated with dominant inherited retinal degeneration), assess potential degenerative phenotype in older mice, such as 2-months old (when severe retinal degeneration is observed in other mouse models, such as Arl3-Q71L transgenic mouse). This experiment would also address a simple potential delay in rod migration, although very unlikely.</p><p>– Discuss why the Q71L variant has not been associated with human disease, either retina-specific or more generic ciliopathies.</p><p>– Figure 3C: there is an extra band , highlighted by a red arrowhead. This band is mentioned in the figure legend but never in the Results section. Please comment on it.</p><p>– Figure 4B: in the rescue experiment of Arl3 T31N/Y90C: do you see a degeneration phenotype if you look at older mice, similar to Arl3KO?</p><p>– Consider reorganizing your table by listing the variants by the order they appear in the main text. Consider adding an extra column for &quot;binding effectors: PDEd and UNC119&quot; and state if they bind the specific variant. This table is a great reference.</p><p>– Comment should be made as to inconsistencies regarding using human or mouse sequences (for instance, human PDEd, but mouse UNC119). An explanation should be given, such as high level of protein conservation.</p><p>– State the ratio of each plasmid when co-expressing multiple proteins.</p><p>Figure 5: the beginning of the figure legend &quot;Arl3 driven nuclear…&quot; should be &quot;Arl3-Y90C driven nuclear…&quot;.</p><p>Figure 5 SpFigure 1: describe red asterisks.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Disrupting the ciliary gradient of active Arl3 affects rod photoreceptor nuclear migration&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Piali Sengupta (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved with the addition of new data and analysis further exploring ARL3-Y90C's action as a dominant negative through strong Arl13b binding. These new experiments show that sequestration of ARL13B by this mutant contributes to the nuclear migration defects. Thus, ARL13B-90C is clearly not simply a rapid cycling mutant and the nuclear migration phenotype is contributed by multiple factors. However, the manuscript in its present form does not reflect the nuanced nature of this mutant. Please note that other important issues remain in the current manuscript that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>First, it would help to orient the readers on the role of ARL-trafficked ciliary proteins with respect to neuronal migration, a relatively new phenotype that you study. The current addition on nuclear migration in the introduction is helpful, but please mention the limitations of our current knowledge in this regard, and why you are unable to test for defects in ciliary enrichment of lipidated proteins in your mutants that contribute to the final disease.</p><p>Second, the new experiments using co-expression of ARL13B partially restoring the ARL3-Y90C phenotype suggest that the &quot;the migration defect is caused at least in part by Arl3-Y90C acting as a dominant negative (Line 175)&quot;. Going by comments from all the reviewers, and our reading of the manuscript, it is likely that this experiment along with the data from the Y90C/R149H active mutant (which does not strongly bind to ARl13B) suggest that the ARL13B sequestering activity of ARL3-Y90C mutant does contribute to the examined phenotype. The dual nature of this mutant should be reflected in the text and abstract.</p><p>Third, multiple sections of the manuscript including the title and abstract posit a functional role for a &quot;ciliary gradient&quot; for ARL3. However, the argument for such a gradient needs clarity (eg in lines 350 and 355) and without sufficient explanation, are open to other interpretations.</p><p>Finally, please also provide quantification of IPs in Figure 3A and number of experiments performed in biochemical experiments throughout the text. Figure 6-Supp 1: please define asterisks. Please explain the prominent band in middle lane of the Flag IB.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80533.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see that all the reviewers agree that the paper is of interest to cell biologists studying ciliogenesis and specifically vertebrate photoreceptors.

Electroporation of Arl3 mutant constructs appeared to have no effect on outer segment formation or lipidated protein trafficking to the outer segment in adult rods (more details provided in comments below). We agree that this result seems counterintuitive to our hypothesis that the nuclear migration defect observed in rods expressing Arl3 mutants is likely caused by a ciliary trafficking defect. The problem is that we performed all our analysis in mature retinas, but nuclear migration is a developmental process. An in-depth analysis would need to be done to identify how Arl3 mutants affect ciliary trafficking in developing rods at peak migration, which is beyond the scope of this paper. Since the developmental timing of nuclear migration is important for our manuscript, we have added additional introduction to clarify. In mature retinas the rod cilium, aka the outer segment, is fully formed and filled with ~800-1000 flattened ‘disc’ membranes, so cilium length is a product of ongoing disc turnover: new discs are built at the base and old discs shed from the tip. Outer segment lengths can vary across the retina (central to peripheral) and can be affected by retinal detachment during collection or by timing of when eyes were collected (especially at P21 when outer segment are still growing), so we do not feel the electroporation method provides for accurate measurements. Using semi-thin retinal cross-sections, a previous study showed that outer segment length was unaffected in a transgenic model of Arl3-Q71L that has a pronounced nuclear migration defect, so we do not expect any alterations in outer segment length in our electroporated models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Our new experimental data shows that co-expressing Arl3-Y90C-FLAG and Arl13B-myc rescues the nuclear migration defect. This suggests that increasing the available pool of Arl13B restores activation of Arl3, which further supports our hypothesis that Arl3-Y90C acts as a dominant negative by blocking activation of endogenous Arl3. We also include supplemental data showing that endogenous Arl13B and overexpressed Arl13B-myc localization is not altered by Arl3-Y90C expression (Figure 3-SupFigure 1-2), confirming that Arl3-Y90C blocks Arl13B activity at the cilium and not through sequestering Arl13B away from the cilium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Figure 1: It would be better to have a description of what the value means on the left side as well as the bottom side of the scatter plot.

The bands analyzed were a part of 7 separate experiments; every experiment included one T31N lane and one Q71L lane, but some experiments included multiple lanes of other mutants. Each lane is the result of a separate transfection of a 10cm plate of 293 cells.</p><p>Arl3-D129N-FLAG expression in AD293T cells was consistently lower regardless of the amount of plasmid DNA that was transfected. This resulted in less uncrosslinked Arl3-D129N-FLAG, around the same amount of absolute Arl3-D129N-FLAG crosslinked to UNC119 and BART as Arl3-Y90C-FLAG, and overall less background in the lane. Due to the confounding variable of lower expression, we did not perform statistics comparing D129N to Q71L and Y90C.

A previous papers showed that Arl3-Q71L overexpressing rods did not cause major changes in lipidated protein mislocalization, as originally reported in Arl3 knockout mice. Instead, transgenic Q71L mice only showed mislocalization of PDE. We attempted to investigate lipidated protein localization in our electroporated models; however, we never observed mislocalization of ciliary or outer segment lipidated cargos (i.e. GRK1, transducin, Rab28, and PDE) in wild type mature rods that were overexpressing Arl3 mutants, even with Q71L. Since our method did not replicate the previous findings using transgenic mice, we were left to move forward with the most reproducible phenotype… defects in nuclear migration. We are now interested in identifying alterations in ciliary transport during this developmental process and hope to uncover the mechanism in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Although our experiments do not directly measure the magnitude or relative steepness of the Arl3-GTP difference across the ciliary entrance, they do indirectly show this phenomenon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Since spatial localization of Arl3, Arl13B, RP2, and Arl3 effectors PDEd and UNC119, seem to be key in the overall model of differential subcellular activation of Arl3, it should be better highlighted in the introduction where these proteins are localized in photoreceptors specifically, with the corresponding original references.</p></disp-quote><p>Introduction has been edited to include more details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 69 (introduction): it is stated that &quot;rod nuclear displacement has also been observed in RP2 KO mouse&quot; with direct references to &quot;Li et al., 2013 and Mookherjee et al., 2015&quot;. However, rod nuclei displacement was never directly assessed on these papers. Indeed, there seems to be a phenotype in ONL/OPL/INL of RP2 KO mice, which could potentially be displacement of rod nuclei. This is interesting and should be actually evaluated. I suggest an experiment to directly assess this in this mice KO line or by knocking-down RP2 using in a similar strategy to the one the authors use to deliver transgenes to P0 mice retinas by means of electroporation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great experimental aim that we plan to follow up on in the future, but it is outside the current scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 75 (intro): &quot;using in vivo mouse models…&quot;.

This is actually never directly shown in the manuscript. Combination of multiple experiments together with differential subcellular protein localization, suggest, and suggest only, that this is the case. The wording should be adjusted.</p></disp-quote><p>We kindly disagree. We show that dominant mutations alter the levels of Arl3-GTP independent of Arl13B, thereby, increasing activity outside the cilium. Further, we perform multiple experiments showing that increasing Arl3-GTP in the cilium or reducing Arl3-GTP outside the cilium rescues the phenotype. Together, it is fair to say that aberrant activity disrupts the Arl3-GTP ciliary gradient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 77 (intro): the rescue experiments were only performed for the Y90C variant, not for the D67V. This should be clear during the text. The way it's written implies that rescue experiments were done for both of the mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 84 (intro): &quot;…in rods using…&quot; modify to &quot;…in mice rods using…&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– More detailed imaging and analysis should be performed for the specialized cilium of photoreceptors (inner segment, connecting cilium and outer segment). Specifically show in more detail the FLAG-staining for each variant. Even though it is stated in the text that &quot;while both Arl3-D67V-FLAG and Arl3-Y90C-FLAG expression and localization were indistinguishable from wild-type Arl3-FLAG&quot;, some images do not represent this. For instance, Y90C-FLAG signal seems to be mostly staining outer segments, while D67V seems to mostly stain inner segments, at least in the representative images shown. Is this always the case?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text to better represent the images shown. We appreciate the thorough analysis the reviewer made regarding subtle differences in the FLAG pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Analysis should be done to measure cilium length for each condition and also between INL-displaced, basally-displaced and non-displaced rods electroporated with the different variants. In addition, it should be evaluated if there is a correlation between cilium length and rod displacement. This is important in linking both cilium and nuclei, the main point of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned, rod nuclear migration occurs prior to outer segment formation. All our images are taken at the P21 timepoint when the outer segment is mature and we feel it is outside the scope of this paper to study developmental aspects of this process. Further, variabilities between each electroporated patch (location, timing, retinal detachment, etc) prevents accurate measurement of outer segment length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;skew&quot; values are a valuable and sophisticated quantification measure of the phenotype and should be added to Figure 1 (and to all other figures, when applicable) to highlight the phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that we are showing the phenotype multiple ways in each figure: representative images, histogram, scatter plots. We prefer to keep it simple and leave the skew value to Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In addition to the skewness analysis, the number of displaced rods normalized to total number of electroporated ones should also be quantified for each condition to better compare and evaluate the phenotype (this is somewhat already shown by the histogram, but adding a percent count will solidify the phenotype finding). This should be done for Figure 1 and all other figures, when applicable. In addition, these percentages should be discussed in the paper. A related question that should be discussed is, since these are dominant variants why isn't the phenotype more dramatic?</p></disp-quote><p>The percent of nuclei displaced to the INL has now been included in the manuscript and table. We feel that the migration phenotype is very dramatic and nicely appreciated by our electroporation method that allows for mutant rods to be easily distinguished within the wild type ONL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Variant D67V is not as well characterized as Y90C, even though it is introduced with the same significance as the Y90C. What's the model for how D67V is leading to rod displacement, since it does not bind RP2 like the Q71L? Can you add a schematic for this variant to Figure 3H.</p></disp-quote><p>The D67V human mutation was published in 2021, after many of our experiments testing Y90C and Q71L were completed. Since this was the second dominant human mutation identified in Arl3, we felt it was important to see if it also produced a nuclear migration defect – and it did! So, we tested Arl3-D67V GTP binding and found it behaves as a constitutively active mutant, like Q71L. But as the reviewer points out has minor differences in its effector binding.</p><p>We found that D67V DOES bind to RP2 (see Figure 4C), but not when in a complex with PDEδ. We also found that D67V does not appear to bind to UNC119A. These differences in effector binding are likely due the D67V mutation being in the switch 2 region of ARL3, which will directly impact its binding to PDEδ and UNC119. We have added D67V to the cartoon in Figure 4H as well as added text in the manuscript clarifying this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– According to your model, Q71L variant is responsible for rod nuclei displacement due to constant binding to RP2, sequestering it and preventing it to inactivate endogenous Arl3 at the base of the cilium. A straight-forward experiment to test this model is to perform a rescue experiment by co-expression of the variant together with RP2, similar to what was done with co-overexpression of UNC119 or PDE δ. In addition, the Q71L [noRP2] triple mutant should also rescue the rod nuclei phenotype, according to your model.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is a great idea and we attempted to express both Arl3-E164A/D168A double mutant that does not bind RP2 and Arl3-Q71L/E164A/D168A triple mutant; however, we never saw FLAG expression in the rods at P21. Interestingly, by using the soluble transfection marker to identify transfected rods we did see a migration defect with the Arl3-E164A/D168A mutant when driven by the high-expression pRho promoter but not the lower-expression pRK promoter—the same pattern seen when we attempted to rescue Arl3-Q71L with the chaperones. This suggests that disrupting binding of active Arl3 to RP2 to allow for wildtype inactivation can rescue the phenotype as long as the amount of Arl3-E164A/D168A is not above a certain threshold, but since we could not definitively show FLAG expression in these rods, we felt we could not include the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Perform another rescue experiment of Arl3Y90C driven phenotype by co-overexpression of Arl13B. Increasing the levels of Arl13B should also rescue the rod displacement if there is enough Arl13B to activate endogenous Arl3, according to your proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>This was an excellent idea. We have completed the rescue experiments where we co-electroporated Arl3-Y90C-FLAG with Arl13B-myc and found that increasing the available pool of Arl13B rescued the migration defect. We also show that Arl13B-myc expression remains predominantly in outer segment compartment, even with Arl3-Y90C, further suggesting that Arl3-Y90C’s dominant negative function is to bind onto Arl13B blocking activation of endogenous Arl3 and not through removing Arl13B from the cilium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To meet the human relevance justifying your studies (that is, Arl3 variants associated with dominant inherited retinal degeneration), assess potential degenerative phenotype in older mice, such as 2-months old (when severe retinal degeneration is observed in other mouse models, such as Arl3-Q71L transgenic mouse). This experiment would also address a simple potential delay in rod migration, although very unlikely.</p></disp-quote><p>The electroporation technique we use has expression only in a subset of rod photoreceptors, so is not a good method for assessing retinal degeneration outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discuss why the Q71L variant has not been associated with human disease, either retina-specific or more generic ciliopathies.</p></disp-quote><p>While an interesting question, we honestly have no idea and would need to defer to a human geneticist to explain the rate at which spontaneous human mutations arise in the population. We are not comfortable adding any discussion about this, as we are not experts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3C: there is an extra band , highlighted by a red arrowhead.

These new experiments show that sequestration of ARL13B by this mutant contributes to the nuclear migration defects. Thus, ARL13B-90C is clearly not simply a rapid cycling mutant and the nuclear migration phenotype is contributed by multiple factors. However, the manuscript in its present form does not reflect the nuanced nature of this mutant. Please note that other important issues remain in the current manuscript that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>First, it would help to orient the readers on the role of ARL-trafficked ciliary proteins with respect to neuronal migration, a relatively new phenotype that you study. The current addition on nuclear migration in the introduction is helpful, but please mention the limitations of our current knowledge in this regard, and why you are unable to test for defects in ciliary enrichment of lipidated proteins in your mutants that contribute to the final disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional information to throughout our manuscript to clarify that the defect occurs during development, when rods are “immature”. We also added more to discussion to explaining limitations and future experiments to identify the Arl3 cargo responsible for nuclear migration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the new experiments using co-expression of ARL13B partially restoring the ARL3-Y90C phenotype suggest that the &quot;the migration defect is caused at least in part by Arl3-Y90C acting as a dominant negative (Line 175)&quot;. Going by comments from all the reviewers, and our reading of the manuscript, it is likely that this experiment along with the data from the Y90C/R149H active mutant (which does not strongly bind to ARl13B) suggest that the ARL13B sequestering activity of ARL3-Y90C mutant does contribute to the examined phenotype. The dual nature of this mutant should be reflected in the text and abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes! We are also very excited by the new data showing Arl13B overexpression can rescue the Arl3-Y90C migration phenotype. Considering this data, we altered the text to emphasize the dominant negative feature of this mutation. However, we feel strongly that introducing the Y90C mutation as fast cycling is very important as one outcome of reduced nucleotide binding is increased Arl13B binding (shown in Figure 3A). In the small GTPase field, it is well known that fast cycling mutations increase GEF affinity, and these mutations are often used to identify the GEF for a particular small GTPase (Gotthardt et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2015; Berken et al., 2005; Cool et al., 1999). Furthermore, we show in Figure 5 that the Arl3-Y90C/T31N mutation, which maintains Arl13B binding (Figure 3A) rescues the migration phenotype. This means that dominant negative Arl3 binding to Arl13B is not sufficient to cause the defect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, multiple sections of the manuscript including the title and abstract posit a functional role for a &quot;ciliary gradient&quot; for ARL3. However, the argument for such a gradient needs clarity (eg in lines 350 and 355) and without sufficient explanation, are open to other interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional information is provided in the discussion to help clarify experiments showing that an reactivating Arl3-GTP in the cilia is required for proper nuclear migration in rods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, please also provide quantification of IPs in Figure 3A and number of experiments performed in biochemical experiments throughout the text. Figure 6-Supp 1: please define asterisks. Please explain the prominent band in middle lane of the Flag IB.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3A shows representative IPs between Arl3-FLAG constructs and Arl13B-GFP. In the text, we interpret this data as either binding or not binding, since IPs do not assess affinity. We have now added a graph showing amount of Arl13B-GFP bound to Arl3-FLAG in Figure 3-SupFigure 3 for all the replicates for each construct. Additional information has been added to methods describing number of replicates and statistics.</p><p>For Figure 6-SupFigure 1, we have now added labels for each lane of the Western blot as well as additional information in the figure legend to help clarify. The red asterisks mark crosslinked Arl3-Y90C complexes that are consistently identified in the in vivo crosslinking experiments initially shown in Figure 4. The top asterisk indicates the Arl3-Y90C/UNC119 complex and overexpression of UNC119-myc increases the presence of this band (center lane). Importantly, we see that the other crosslinked Arl3-Y90C complex (presumably with BART) is reduced when Arl3-Y90C is bound to UNC119c. The same reduction occurs for both Arl3-Y90C effector complexes when Arl13B-GFP is expressed. This assay was used to see how overexpression of Arl3 effectors (UNC119 and Arl13B) affects the level of active Arl3-Y90C in the cell. We found activity was reduced.</p></body></sub-article></article>
