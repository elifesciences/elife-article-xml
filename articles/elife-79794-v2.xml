Innate immune signaling by both fetal-derived placental trophoblasts and the maternal decidua must provide antimicrobial defenses at this critical interface without compromising its integrity. Here, we developed matched trophoblast (TO) and decidua organoids (DO) from human placentas to define the relative contributions of these cells to antiviral defenses at the maternal-fetal interface. We demonstrate that TO and DO basally secrete distinct immunomodulatory factors, including the constitutive release of the antiviral type III interferon IFN-λ2 from TOs, and differentially respond to viral infections through the induction of organoid-specific factors. Finally, we define the differential susceptibility and innate immune signaling of TO and DO to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and develop a co-culture model of TO and DO which showed that trophoblast-derived factors protect decidual cells from HCMV infection. Our findings establish matched TO and DO as ex vivo models to study vertically transmitted infections and highlight differences in innate immune signaling by fetal-derived trophoblasts and the maternal decidua.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>organoid</kwd><kwd>CMV</kwd><kwd>interferon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIHAI145828</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coyne</surname><given-names>Carolyn B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Organoids developed from matched human placental tissue define differences in antiviral signaling between cell types comprising the maternal-fetal interface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The maternal-fetal interface is comprised of both the maternal-derived decidua and the fetal-derived placenta, which together support fetal growth, maintain maternal-fetal immunotolerance, and provide immunologic defenses to protect the fetus from infections. The relative contributions of maternal- and fetal-derived cells to these critical functions remain largely undefined given the limitations of models that recapitulate the complex nature of the human maternal-fetal interface.</p><p>The fetal-derived placenta contains distinct trophoblast subsets throughout gestation. Trophoblast stem cells located in chorionic villi, the branch-like projections that directly contact maternal blood, give rise to cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), the proliferative mononuclear cells of the placenta, the syncytiotrophoblast (STB), a multinucleated contiguous cell layer that covers the villous surfaces, and extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs). EVTs remodel the maternal microvasculature to form spiral arteries, which ultimately deliver maternal blood to the surface of chorionic villi. On the maternal side, decidualization of the endometrium is required for implantation and appropriate placentation. Taken together, the decidua and placenta maintain immunotolerance throughout gestation and provide the fetus with essential hormones and nutrients to support its growth.</p><p>While the placenta and decidua play complementary roles in fetal development, their contributions to antimicrobial defenses are less defined (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Megli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Semmes and Coyne, 2022</xref>). The placenta forms a powerful barrier to infections, yet certain congenital pathogens (e.g., <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, Zika virus (ZIKV), HIV, Rubella, and human cytomegalovirus [HCMV]) can be vertically transmitted to infect the fetus and in some cases, cause disease and/or pregnancy loss. Studies of tissue explants and histopathologic analysis of the placenta suggest that the decidua and chorionic villi have differing roles in the pathogenesis of vertically transmitted infections. The decidua may be a primary site of replication for several microorganisms associated with congenital disease, including HCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McDonagh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pereira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weisblum et al., 2015</xref>), ZIKV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guzeloglu-Kayisli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Platt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weisblum et al., 2017</xref>), and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rizzuto et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting it may serve as a reservoir for these infections. By contrast, the placenta is largely resistant to infections and possesses intrinsic mechanisms of innate immune defense. For example, human trophoblasts constitutively release antiviral interferons (IFNs) that restrict infection in both autocrine and paracrine manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corry et al., 2017</xref>). These IFNs are of the type III class, which include IFNs-λ1–3 in humans (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lazear et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wells and Coyne, 2018</xref>). Constitutive release of IFNs is a unique feature of trophoblasts as IFNs are tightly regulated in most cell types and induced only after detection of the products of viral replication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lazear et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that maternal- and fetal-derived tissue differentially respond to and control viral infections; however, the lack of available models to fully interrogate the differences between maternal- and fetal-derived cells have limited a complete understanding of their respective roles in antiviral defense.</p><p>The paucity of tractable models to study the human maternal-fetal interface and the limitation of accessing this interface in vivo without disrupting pregnancy has limited our understanding of the pathogenesis of and immune responses against many congenital pathogens, including HCMV. HCMV is a species-specific β-herpesvirus that can only infect humans, and animal models using guinea pig (GPCMV) or rhesus macaque (RhCMV) cytomegaloviruses rely on viruses that are genetically disparate from HCMV and do not fully recapitulate the human maternal-fetal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roark et al., 2020</xref>). Prior studies on placental HCMV infection have used trophoblast progenitor cells, EVT cell lines, and primary trophoblasts; however, these cell lines and isolated primary cells do not model the cellular complexity of the human placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Njue et al., 2020</xref>). Placental and decidual explants have also been employed to model HCMV infection, yet these human explants have high inter-individual variability, which hinders reproducibility, moreover, there is a limited window of viability in cultured ex vivo tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weisblum et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weisblum et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, novel models of the human maternal-fetal interface are needed to understand the contributions of maternal decidual cells and fetal-derived placental cells to immune defense against and pathogenesis of placental HCMV infection.</p><p>The recent development of trophoblast (TO) and decidua organoids (DO) from first trimester placental tissue has greatly expanded the models available to study the human maternal-fetal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turco et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turco et al., 2018</xref>). Previous work has shown that isolation and propagation of trophoblast stem cells from first trimester placental chorionic villi lead to the development of three-dimensional organoids that differentiate to contain all lineages of trophoblast cells present in the human placenta and release well-known pregnancy hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turco et al., 2018</xref>). Two-dimensional and organoid-based models of first trimester stem cells derived from villous tissue have also been reported and recapitulate key aspects of trophoblast biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karvas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okae et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shannon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheridan et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, DOs isolated from uterine glands recapitulate the transcriptional profile of their tissue of origin and respond to hormonal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turco et al., 2017a</xref>). These organoid models are ideal to interrogate differences between maternal- and fetal-derived cells, but matched DO and TOs have not yet been used to model congenital infections.</p><p>To directly compare antiviral signaling pathways between the human placenta and decidua, we generated TO and DO from matched mid-to-late gestation (26–41 weeks of gestation) human placentas and profiled their release of cytokines, chemokines, and other factors at baseline and under virally infected conditions. These studies revealed that TOs basally secrete IFN-λ2, which does not occur in matched DOs. To determine whether maternal- and fetal-derived cells respond differently to viral infections, we compared the transcriptional profiles and immunological secretomes from organoids treated with a ligand to stimulate toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling. TO and DO differentially responded to TLR3 activation through the secretion of organoid-specific cytokines and chemokines. Additionally, we defined the differential susceptibility of trophoblast and decidua organoids to HCMV infection and identified key differences in the innate immune responses of these organoids to HCMV infection. Finally, to simulate the communication between trophoblasts and the decidua epithelium in vivo, we established a co-culture system between matched TO and DO, which showed that fetal-derived trophoblasts protect the decidual epithelium from HCMV infection. Taken together, these studies highlight the differential responses of decidual and placental cells at the maternal-fetal interface to viral infections and provide new models to understand innate immune responses against placental infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment and characterization of human trophoblast and decidual organoids from mid-to-late gestation tissue</title><p>To generate matched human TOs and decidual organoids (DOs), we used human placental tissue isolated from the second and third trimesters of human pregnancy (26–41 weeks gestation) and cultured progenitor cells isolated from chorionic villi or uterine glands of the decidua (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given that previous work developed TOs utilizing tissue isolated from the first trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haider et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marinić et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okae et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheridan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turco et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turco et al., 2018</xref>), we optimized the isolation and propagation procedures for isolation of cells from mid-to-late gestation chorionic villi. This optimization included extended mechanical disruption of tissue and the addition of supplements including nicotinamide to promote progenitor cell differentiation. Although the abundance of trophoblast stem/progenitor cells decreases after the first trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turco et al., 2018</xref>), we successfully isolated progenitor cells and generated organoids from all placental tissue harvested (15 unique placentas). Consistent with the presence of progenitor cells in full-term chorionic villi, we identified cells positive for the proliferation marker Ki67 in villi isolated from two late gestation placental villi used to generate TOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Isolated progenitor cells were embedded in Matrigel to allow for self-organization and propagated for ~2–3 weeks to generate organoid structures that were morphologically like those previously isolated from first trimester placentas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turco et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Once established, organoids could be continuously expanded and passaged every 3–5 days for DOs and 5–7 days for TOs and were highly proliferative based on Ki67 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Confocal microscopy for cytoskeletal and adhesion markers including cytokeratin-19, actin, E-cadherin, and the Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EpCAM) confirmed the three-dimensional architecture of established organoids and verified that TOs and DOs expressed markers consistently with their tissues of origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This also included the expression of the trophoblast-specific marker Sialic Acid Binding Ig Like Lectin 6 (SIGLEC6) in TOs but not DOs and the expression of the mucin MUC5AC in DOs but not TOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). TOs also expressed high levels of Syndecan-1 (SDC-1), a specific marker of the fused STB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The localization of SDC-1 in TOs shows that like organoids derived from first trimester placental tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turco et al., 2018</xref>), the apical surface of the STB is inward facing (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). We also found that TOs, but not DOs, secreted the trophoblast-specific hormone hCG as assessed by Luminex assays and over the counter (OTC) test strips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The levels of hCG were stable in TOs propagated for extended periods of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In addition, we confirmed that DOs released high levels of the secreted mucin MUC16 as determined by Luminex assays, which was not present in TOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Long-term three-dimensional organoids cultures can be established from human mid- and late-gestation placental tissue.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the derivation of trophoblast organoids (TOs) and decidual organoids (DOs) from mid-to-late gestation placental tissue.

To test this, we used the JAK-specific inhibitor ruxolitinib, which inhibits signaling downstream of type III IFN receptor activation. DOs and TOs were treated with ruxolitinib for 1 hr prior to infection with the AD169r strain of HCMV for 48 hr in the presence of ruxolitinib.

In contrast, although DOs did not basally secrete IFNs, they are immunologically more active under resting conditions and basally secrete cytokines and chemokines not detectable in TOs. In addition, we show that TOs and DOs respond to TLR3 activation via the induction of distinct immune regulatory networks, which includes the specific release of select chemokines such as CCL22 in TOs. Finally, we used matched TOs and DOs to explore differences in susceptibility to HCMV and to define the differential responses of the maternal decidua and fetal-derived organoids to HCMV infection. Taken together, our work suggests that cells that comprise the maternal-fetal interface defend from viral infections in a cell-type-specific manner and further highlight the unique contributions of fetal-derived trophoblasts in antiviral immunity.</p><p>The previous establishment of trophoblast and decidua-derived organoids has significantly expanded the in vitro systems that can model the complexity of the maternal-fetal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turco et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turco et al., 2018</xref>). These previous studies utilized tissue isolated from the first trimester of pregnancy (6–9 weeks of gestation for TOs and 8–12 weeks of gestation for DOs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turco et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turco et al., 2018</xref>), although another study successfully established DOs from full-term tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marinić et al., 2020</xref>). Two-dimensional cultures of stem cell-derived primary trophoblasts were also obtained from the first trimester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okae et al., 2018</xref>). The placenta is a dynamic organ that changes throughout gestation. Here, we show that TOs can also be generated from later stages of gestation, including from progenitor cells isolated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and full-term placental tissue, which required optimization from conditions required for first trimester tissue. Although the abundance of progenitor cells, as defined by the presence of Ki67 positive nuclei, declines throughout gestation, we show that full-term chorionic villi contain Ki67 positive cells at low levels and that these cells can be isolated to generate self-propagating organoids. Given that obtaining first trimester tissue can be complicated by access and/or regulatory restrictions, our study provides an additional source for the development of placental organoids from tissue obtained later in gestation. In addition, given that many congenital infections occur in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, organoids isolated from later stages of pregnancy may better reflect clinically relevant models of congenital infections. For instance, the risk of transplacental transmission of HCMV infection from mother to fetus is only 20% in the first trimester but can reach up to 75% in the third trimester, highlighting the relevance of our organoid model for studying placental HCMV infection across gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pass and Anderson, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Unlike many other barrier cell types such as the epithelium, human trophoblasts have the unique capacity to robustly secrete cytokines and other immunological factors without stimulation. PHTs from full-term placentas and mid-gestation chorionic villi secrete cytokines that mediate innate immune defenses against bacteria, parasites, and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ander et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Megli et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with this concept, serum isolated from pregnant women often contains elevated levels of these cytokines, indicating that at least some have reached the systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benyo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Megli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vassiliadis et al., 1998</xref>). Similarly, the decidua releases specific cytokines and alterations in these profiles may be associated with pregnancy complications including miscarriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denison et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Laham et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lash and Ernerudh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pitman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">von Rango et al., 2003</xref>). The decidua also responds to microbial infections via the release of additional cytokines that function in innate defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guzeloglu-Kayisli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qiu et al., 2009</xref>). However, in many cases, these studies were performed on tissue explants that were multicellular in nature, thus preventing an assessment of the contributions of cytokine release from distinct cell types. Similarly, previous work utilizing tissue explants that were treated with recombinant cytokines, synthetic ligands of various innate immune pathways, or infected with pathogens are also unable to define the contributions of distinct cell types in these responses. The use of organoids allows for analyses of cellular responses to infection or innate immune activation from trophoblasts and decidual glands in primary cell models that contain isolated cell types enriched at the maternal-fetal interface. An additional strength of the TO model is that trophoblast stem cells can differentiate into all three distinct trophoblast cell types comprising the human placenta, which is not possible in many other existing models including isolation of CTBs from full-term placentas, which do not differentiate to contain EVTs.</p><p>The constitutive release of IFN-λs from human trophoblasts is a unique phenomenon that runs counter to much of what is known about antiviral IFN signaling, which is centered on a requirement for viral sensing as a prerequisite to induce this pathway. Similar to our previous studies in PHT cells and mid-gestation chorionic villous explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corry et al., 2017</xref>), our data show that progenitor cell-derived TOs also constitutively release IFN-λs and protect the epithelium of the decidua from viral infections. Our studies also show that type III IFNs are further induced by activation of antiviral innate immune signaling in both TOs and DOs, with IFN-λs being amongst the most induced cytokines detected in both organoid types. Although IFNs are released from TOs constitutively and upon induction of antiviral signaling, our studies also point to select chemokines as key components in the responses of the human placenta to viral infections. We show that the regulatory T cell (Treg) chemoattractant CCL22 is selectively released from TOs in response to TLR3 activation. We have shown previously that human PHTs and mid-gestation chorionic villi also respond to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection through the selective release of CCL22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ander et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rudzki et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that this chemokine may be key mediator of the response of the human placenta to microbial infections. Given that Treg infiltration into the decidua has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freier et al., 2015</xref>), CCL22 induction may directly impact maternal-fetal tolerance in the context of congenital infection.</p><p>Significant work over many decades using first trimester placental explants and isolated human trophoblasts have revealed important insights into placental HCMV transmission and antiviral immunity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Njue et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, a full understanding of the distinct roles of decidual versus trophoblast cells in HCMV infection has been hindered by a lack of tractable model systems of the human maternal-fetal interface. In this study, we leveraged HCMV as a model microorganism to demonstrate the utility of organoid models for studying infections at the maternal-fetal interface. Using TO and DO, we found that DOs had heightened susceptibility to HCMV infection compared to matched TOs, which is consistent with prior work in first trimester decidua explants showing that HCMV productively infects the maternal decidua (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weisblum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weisblum et al., 2015</xref>). Our transcriptional and immune secretome profiling further highlights that TOs and DOs differentially respond to HCMV infection and recapitulates prior findings using isolated human placental cells and explants. CXCL10 was highly upregulated in HCMV-infected DOs, consistent with prior findings of increased CXCL10 secretion in decidua explants infected with HCMV ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weisblum et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weisblum et al., 2015</xref>). IL-8 was also highly induced in HCMV-infected TOs, mirroring the increased IL-8 secretion that has been observed in response to ex vivo HCMV infection of isolated trophoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kovács et al., 2007</xref>) and placental explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weisblum et al., 2017</xref>). That our in vitro TO and DO infections recapitulate innate immune responses previously observed in vivo and ex vivo validates our model of matched decidua and trophoblast organoids for studying HCMV and other congenital pathogens. Moreover, our data demonstrate that type III IFNs control HCMV infection in the maternal decidua but suggest that additional factors or pathways beyond IFN signaling may restrict HCMV infection of trophoblasts. The constitutive release of type III IFNs from fetal trophoblasts has been proposed to play a direct role in the protection of maternal-derived cells from viral infections. Indeed, ablation of type III IFN signaling in the murine placenta enhances infection of ZIKV in maternal decidua tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jagger et al., 2017</xref>). The co-culture model presented here also supports a model in which trophoblast-derived effectors, including IFN-λ, work in paracrine to suppress HCMV infection in cells comprising the maternal decidua. Altogether, these data highlight the utility of organoid models for understanding HCMV transmission and immune defense at the maternal-fetal interface and underscore the need for more research using organoid models to disentangle the roles of decidual versus placental cells in congenital viral infections.</p><p>Our work presented here develops TOs and DOs from mid-to-late gestation placental tissue and demonstrates that these organoids can be used to study mechanisms of microbial vertical transmission and antiviral innate immune signaling. We show that TOs and DOs constitutively secrete unique cytokines and chemokines and respond to viral infections through the release of organoid-specific immunomodulatory factors. Our work also highlights the prominent role of type III IFNs in antiviral immunity at the maternal-fetal interface and demonstrates that TOs constitutively release IFN-λs and that DOs can be induced to release IFN-λs following viral infection. Collectively, these studies define the differential responses of decidual and placental cells comprising the maternal-fetal interface to viral infections and suggest that organoid-based models can be used to define innate immune signaling at this interface.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human samples</title><p>Human tissue used in this study was obtained through the UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital Obstetric Maternal &amp; Infant Database and Biobank or from Duke University after approval was received from the University of Pittsburgh or Duke University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and in accordance with the guidelines of the University of Pittsburgh and Duke University human tissue procurement.

To passage, TOs were released from domes with ice-cold cell recovery solution (Corning, 354253) and then were digested in prewarmed TrypLE Express (Life Technologies, 12605-028) or Stem Pro Accutase (Life Technologies, A11105-01) at 37<sup>o</sup>C for 5–7 min. Further mechanical dissociation was achieved with an Eppendorf Explorer Plus electronic pipettes at its ‘mix’ function setting by pipetting up and down around 400 times through small-bore pipette tips. Dissociated TOs fragment were collected and washed by centrifuge, then resuspended in fresh ice-cold Matrigel and replated as domes at the desired density for continuous culture. For freezing TOs, overlaid TOM was aspirated, TOs with Matrigel were resuspended in CryoStor CS10 stem cell freezing medium (STEMCell Technologies, 07930) frozen at –80 <sup>o</sup>C and then transferred to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. For thawing cryopreserved TOs, organoids were thawed as quickly as possible, diluted with five times volume of basic TOM containing Advanced DMEM/F12, 2 mM GlutaMAX supplement, 10 mM HEPES (Gibco, 15630-106), 1× Penicillin/Streptomycin (Lonza, 17-602E) and centrifuged to pellet. Afterward, TOs were resuspended in new ice-cold Matrigel and replated for recovery culture and passaged as described below. Trophoblast organoids used in this study were derived from 15 independent placentas (7 male and 8 female). Detailed protocols for the isolation and passaging of trophoblast organoids derived from full-term placental tissue have been posted and are available for download (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang and Coyne, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang and Coyne, 2022b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Derivation and culture of DOs cultures from human decidua samples</title><p>Decidual gland-enriched cell suspension was acquired from fresh decidual tissue as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turco et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turco et al., 2017a</xref>).

For TO CM, media were collected starting at ~4 days after passaging, or when the majority of organoids were 100–200 µm in size. The levels of hCG in collected CM were measured by Luminex assays or rapid hCG test strips prior to use. CM with low levels of hCG were not included in subsequent experiments. For DO CM, media were collected ~2 days after passaging, or when most organoids had formed obvious cystic structure of at least 200 µm. In most experiments, the use of TO and DO CM from matched tissue was used, although there did not appear to be any significant differences in CM from unmatched donor tissue. Non-conditioned medium (NCM) was TOM or ExM (described above) that had not been exposed to TOs or DOs, respectively.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sara Sawyer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Rowan Karvas (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is a strong and impactful manuscript describing the establishment and characterization of mid-to-late gestation trophoblast and decidual organoids and their use in studying viral infection. Several points need to be addressed to support conclusions of which the essential revisions are pointed out below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) There is only a single readout for viral infection with quantification being % infected organoid (which could include organoids with only a single cell or hundreds of cells infected). A more fine-tuned quantification seems necessary given the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>(2) More convincing experimental data that EVTs contained in TOs are not susceptible should be included. The reviewer suggests: &quot;The authors should differentiate their organoids into EVT organoids as described in Sheridan et al., Nature Protocols 2020 and try infection with their fluorophore-tagged hCMV viruses. Spontaneously formed pre-EVT within TOM-treated organoids are not very mature compared to EVTs within properly differentiated EVT organoids. They could try infection and whole mount image, OR dissociate the organoids and run a flow cytometry experiment to quantify the proportion of infected cells within their EVT organoids and TOM (cytotrophoblastic and syncytiotrophoblastic) organoids. “</p><p>(3) A weakness in this work is that there was no characterization of the resulting organoids proving that they indeed transcriptionally or epigenetically model a second-third trimester timepoint” or really any experimental comparison with first trimester to see how gestation age is reflected/odellin.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The introduction should include a description of trophoblasts organoid orientation and what the decidual organoids are odelling (glandular versus stroma/endometrial subtypes).</p><p>– Does the gestational age of TO and DO derivation correlate with the variability of expression of other cytokines? Or on any other readout?</p><p>– How was CM standardized across organoids (#, size, length after split, etc.)? Could hcg be used to standardize?</p><p>– For ease of interpretation, for Figure 6, please indicate what antigen is stained for directly under each image with words/colors as done in other figures.</p><p>– The current quantification of HCMV infection does not give a sense for the number of cells infected in each organoid. Consider an additional quantification that would better capture infection dynamics.</p><p>– Are these productive infections?</p><p>– Is the lack of cytokine and transcriptional response to HCMV infection simply due to the Tos not being infected? This should be included in discussion.</p><p>– Despite commonly indicating TO and DO are matched, the use of this matched specificity is not utilized either experimentally or in data interpretation. Does matched matter?</p><p>– Does TO CM prevent infection of DO? Does it act in paracrine to relevant cell types as concluded?</p><p>– Can TO CM prevent HCMV infection? This seems quite relevant given the focus on HCMV infection dynamics and the stark differences between Zika (an emerging RNA virus) and HCMV (DNA virus that has coevolved with host).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Listed below are my questions:</p><p>(1) The Tos shown in Figure 1C seem largely epithelial with few syncytium. Typically there are sporadically formed portions of STB (syncytiotrophoblast) that form internally. This could be due to their mid-late gestation source. I would like to see some staining for SDC1, hCG, etc. Something to indicate the location and abundance of spontaneously formed STB. I think this piece of data would be important to the trophoblast field to show similarities and differences of the structure of 2<sup>nd</sup>-3<sup>rd</sup> trimester Tos compared to first which show abundant STB formation.</p><p>(2) The TO medium from your methods is very similar to Turco’s TOM medium, but you do state that nicotinomide was added for improved proliferation. That is reasonable, but I also noticed that 10% FBS is also added but there is no rationale for this addition to the medium.</p><p>Listed below are my critiques:</p><p>(1) As stated in my public review, I am concerned about the “attracting forces” of cell culture medias and in vitro culture generally. It is stated that first trimester timepoints are not as susceptible to HCMV infection as later stages and it is shown that your Tos are not susceptible to HCMV. The productions of IFN-lambda2 could be responsible for this protection, but it is not proven to me that these organoids, while derived from mid-late gestation, continue to resemble those timepoints in vitro and this requires transcriptional or maybe epigenetic comparisons to other first and second trimester placental datasets.</p><p>2) Also stated in the public review- I would really like for the authors to differentiate Tos into EVT organoids and repeat HCMV infections to prove that EVTs are or are not susceptible to HCMV infection. Please provide whole staining/confocal analysis OR infect with the fluorescent HCMVs, dissociate, and perform flow cytometry analysis to demonstrate susceptibility of EVT Tos to HCMV compared to Tos in TOM.</p><p>(3) An additional experiment that would really improve the impact of this paper is to attempt a co-culture model with both Tos and Dos together and repeat HCMV infection. Could Tos protect Dos from infection?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79794.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) There is only a single readout for viral infection with quantification being % infected organoid (which could include organoids with only a single cell or hundreds of cells infected).

Nonetheless, to address this concern, we now include bulk RNASeq data mapping HCMV-associated reads to two genes important for HCMV replication in infected Tos and Dos (Figure 6E in the revised manuscript), which supports the low levels of replication in Tos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) More convincing experimental data that EVTs contained in Tos are not susceptible should be included.

Because this protocol has not previously been applied to TOs from full-term tissue, we also include key data to support the success of this protocol. We now show that TOs isolated from full-term tissue respond to the EVT differentiation protocol as described in Sheridan et al., which correlated with an increase in HLA-G positive cells from ~18% to ~96% in undifferentiated versus differentiated conditions (Figure 1H in the revised manuscript). This differentiation also correlated with a significant increase in MMP-2, which is released at high levels from first trimester EVTs (Figure 1I in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Because we successfully applied the EVT differentiation to TOs, we compared the levels of HCMV infection between undifferentiated and differentiated TOs. This showed that TOs differentiated to contain &gt;95% HLA-G positive cells remained highly resistant to HCMV infection (Figure 6F and 6G of the revised manuscript), supporting our conclusion that EVTs are not the primary targets of HCMV in TOs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A weakness in this work is that there was no characterization of the resulting organoids proving that they indeed transcriptionally or epigenetically model a second-third trimester timepoint&quot; or really any experimental comparison with first trimester to see how gestation age is reflected/modeled.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we used publicly available bulk RNASeq datasets generated by our own group and others to perform comparative expression analysis between TOs and placental tissue generated from the first or second trimesters, or from full-term tissue. Hierarchical clustering analysis using key hormones and other factors associated with trophoblast structure and function revealed that TOs were most closely related to tissue explants from the first trimester (Figure 2C of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The introduction should include a description of trophoblasts organoid orientation and what the decidual organoids are modeling (glandular versus stroma/endometrial subtypes).</p></disp-quote><p>Lines 86-87 of the original manuscript read as follows: “Similarly, decidua organoids isolated from uterine glands recapitulate the transcriptional profile of their tissue of origin and respond to hormonal cues..”. However, to make this clearer, we now include the following statement on lines 124-125 “…cultured progenitor cells isolated from chorionic villi or uterine glands of the decidua…”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Does the gestational age of TO and DO derivation correlate with the variability of expression of other cytokines? Or on any other readout?</p></disp-quote><p>There were no apparent differences in cytokine levels or other readouts of TOs used in this study, regardless of the gestational stage in which they were isolated. We have included individual datapoints from unique organoid preparation throughout the manuscript to demonstrate the variability that we observe between organoids lines, which is expected given that they are from human tissue. Of note, we now include a comparison of the transcriptional profiles of the TOs used in our study to placental tissue from the first and second trimesters, and from full-term tissue, and these studies indicated that TOs are most closely associated transcriptionally with first trimester tissue (Figure 2C of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How was CM standardized across organoids (#, size, length after split, etc.)? Could hcg be used to standardize?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a clearer explanation of the quality control measures we take for CM, which are based on hCG levels and overall organoid numbers and morphology. This description can be found on lines 809-815 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For ease of interpretation, for Figure 6, please indicate what antigen is stained for directly under each image with words/colors as done in other figures.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added, as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The current quantification of HCMV infection does not give a sense for the number of cells infected in each organoid. Consider an additional quantification that would better capture infection dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show infection data as a percent of CMV+ cells over total nuclei taken from two dimensional images, and as now described on the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Are these productive infections?</p></disp-quote><p>It is unclear whether the reviewer refers to productive infections in DOs or TOs. In the case of DOs, the reporters of both AD159r and TB40E strains of HCMV are fused to transcripts associated with late replication of HCMV, suggesting that these are in fact productive infections. In the case of TOs, the lack of signal for either reporter, coupled with the low levels of production of key virally-encoded transcripts required for HCMV replication (Figure 6E in revised manuscript), suggests that the infection is not productive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is the lack of cytokine and transcriptional response to HCMV infection simply due to the TOs not being infected? This should be included in discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Despite the low level of overall productive infection, there are more transcripts induced in TOs infected with HCMV than in DOs (282 transcripts (AD169r strain) or 173 transcripts (TB40E strain) in TOs and 95 (AD169r strain) or 117 (TB40E strain) in DOs). Thus, the differences observed do not seem to result from differences in overall infection levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Despite commonly indicating TO and DO are matched, the use of this matched specificity is not utilized either experimentally or in data interpretation. Does matched matter?</p></disp-quote><p>There does not appear to be a requirement for the use of matched organoid cultures. In fact, we have successfully generated co-cultures of unmatched TOs and DOs, which appears to work equivalently well regardless of whether they were derived from unmatched tissue (it should be noted that the co-cultures used in this study are from matched tissue). We have made this clearer in the text (lines 814-815).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Does TO CM prevent infection of DO? Does it act in paracrine to relevant cell types as concluded?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we show that CM isolated from TOs reduces ZIKV infection in DOs (Figure 4F, 4G in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can TO CM prevent HCMV infection? This seems quite relevant given the focus on HCMV infection dynamics and the stark differences between Zika (an emerging RNA virus) and HCMV (DNA virus that has coevolved with host).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by reviewer 2, and to address this question, we now provide data from co-cultures of TOs and DOs, which shows that the presence of TOs confers protection of DOs from HCMV infection (Figure 8I and 8J of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Listed below are my questions:</p><p>(1) The TOs shown in Figure 1C seem largely epithelial with few syncytium.

I think this piece of data would be important to the trophoblast field to show similarities and differences of the structure of 2nd-3rd trimester TOs compared to first which show abundant STB formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include SDC-1 immunostaining from TOs, which shows that there are large numbers of SDC-1 positive cells in TOs (Figure 1C of the revised manuscript). We also note that TOs express high levels of many STB markers (e.g., CGBs, PSGs) as assessed by bulk RNASeq (Figure 2B and 2C of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The TO medium from your methods is very similar to Turco's TOM medium, but you do state that nicotinomide was added for improved proliferation. That is reasonable, but I also noticed that 10% FBS is also added but there is no rationale for this addition to the medium.</p></disp-quote><p>Our optimization revealed that 10% enhanced the growth rate of TOs. This has been added to the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Listed below are my critiques:</p><p>(1) As stated in my public review, I am concerned about the &quot;attracting forces&quot; of cell culture medias and in vitro culture generally.

Please provide whole staining/confocal analysis OR infect with the fluorescent HCMVs, dissociate, and perform flow cytometry analysis to demonstrate susceptibility of EVT TOs to HCMV compared to TOs in TOM.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above, we have performed EVT differentiation, which we fully characterized (Figure 1H and II in the revised manuscript) and show that this does not impact the levels of HCMV infections (Figure 6F and 6G of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) An additional experiment that would really improve the impact of this paper is to attempt a co-culture model with both TOs and DOs together and repeat HCMV infection. Could TOs protect DOs from infection?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we established co-cultures of TOs and DOs and found that presence of TOs in these co-cultures significantly decreased the susceptibility of DOs to HCMV infection (Figure 8I and 8J in the revised manuscript)</p></body></sub-article></article>
