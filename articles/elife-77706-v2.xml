the bulk of the proteins is facing the cytosol. These proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA, translated on cytosolic ribosomes, and are then targeted to the organelle and inserted into its OM by import factors. Recently, research on the insertion mechanisms of these proteins into the mitochondrial OM have gained a lot of attention. In contrast, the early cytosolic steps of their biogenesis are unresolved. Using various proteins from this category and a broad set of in vivo, <italic>in organello</italic>, and in vitro assays, we reconstituted the early steps of their biogenesis. We identified a subset of molecular (co)chaperones that interact with newly synthesized SA proteins, namely, Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones and co-chaperones from the Hsp40 family like Ydj1 and Sis1. These interactions were mediated by the hydrophobic transmembrane segments of the SA proteins. We further demonstrate that interfering with these interactions inhibits the biogenesis of SA proteins to a various extent. Finally, we could demonstrate direct interaction of peptides corresponding to the transmembrane segments of SA proteins with the (co)chaperones and reconstitute in vitro the transfer of such peptides from the Hsp70 chaperone to the mitochondrial Tom70 receptor. Collectively, this study unravels an array of cytosolic chaperones and mitochondrial import factors that facilitates the targeting and membrane integration of mitochondrial SA proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>chaperones</kwd><kwd>outer membrane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RA 1028/7-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rapaport</surname><given-names>Doron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RA 1028/10-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rapaport</surname><given-names>Doron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001658</institution-id><institution>Minerva Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drwesh</surname><given-names>Layla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An array of cytosolic co-chaperones and chaperones helps to maintain newly synthesized mitochondrial outer membrane proteins in an import competent state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Even though mitochondria have their own genome, the vast majority of their proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes, and then imported into the organelle. The early stages of these pathways are believed to be mediated by cytosolic factors and chaperones, whereas the later ones are facilitated by protein import machineries that have evolved in the different mitochondrial compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiedemann and Pfanner, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The mitochondrial outer membrane harbors proteins with variable topologies that can span the membrane once, twice, or as multi-span proteins. Proteins that span the membrane once can have their single transmembrane segment (TMS) in the center of the protein or at the N- or C- terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drwesh and Rapaport, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta and Becker, 2021</xref>). The latter group is called the tail-anchored proteins whereas those anchored via an N-terminal segment are known as signal-anchored (SA) proteins. Some known SA proteins are the TOM receptors Tom70 and Tom20, the quality control protein Msp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), and the mitochondrial outer membrane isoform of Mcr1 (Mcr1<sub>mom</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lamb et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Despite sharing similar protein topology, SA proteins do not appear to follow the same insertion route. While insertion of Tom70 and Tom20 was previously reported to be dependent on the MIM complex and elements of the TOM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Popov-Celeketić et al., 2008</xref>), Msp1 mitochondrial insertion was shown to require only the MIM complex. The biogenesis of another member of the group Mcr1<sub>mom</sub> has been proposed to be independent of the TOM complex, although it is yet unclear whether the MIM complex is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meineke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vitali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Like the rest of the mitochondrial OM proteins, SA proteins, are initially synthesized in the cytosol before being targeted to mitochondria. Such proteins contain an exposed hydrophobic transmembrane segment, which makes them vulnerable to aberrant folding and aggregation. This situation can potentially result in cytotoxic protein species, which might contribute to the pathomechanism of various neurodegenerative and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohush et al., 2019</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaari, 2019</xref>). Hence, it is widely thought that cytosolic factors bind such newly synthesized proteins, thereby maintaining their import-competent conformation by counteracting aggregation, degradation, and misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neupert and Pfanner, 1993</xref>).</p><p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a large repertoire of molecular chaperones was identified that regulate protein quality control. These elements are classified into different families according to their molecular masses and the way they interact with their substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mokry et al., 2015</xref>). Chaperones from the Hsp100 family have high-binding affinity to aggregated proteins and function as disaggregases by both reactivating and resolubilizing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zolkiewski et al., 2012</xref>). Chaperones from the Hsp70 family (like Ssa1-4 in yeast) function in a wide range of biological processes, such as modulating folding and preventing aggregation. Chaperones from this family associate with a broad spectrum of client proteins in an ATP-regulated cycle. Client protein recognition is regulated mainly by J-proteins (co-chaperones like Ydj1 and Sis1 in yeast) from the Hsp40 family that stimulate ATP hydrolysis, thereby facilitating client capture by Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cyr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wyszkowski et al., 2021</xref>). Beside their crucial role in modulating the ATPase cycle of Hsp70 through their J-domain, Hsp40 chaperones can also bind unfolded protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson and Craig, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, cells harbor small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) that bind non-native proteins and are crucial for preventing irreversible aggregation processes. Such sHSPs were recently found to be involved also in protecting proteins from mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haslbeck et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collier and Benesch, 2020</xref>). In yeast, Hsp26 and Hsp42 are chaperones from this family that have been reported to associate with cytosolic aggregates allowing the Ssa1-Hsp104 chaperone system to efficiently disassemble and refold them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haslbeck et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haslbeck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cashikar et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Chaperones of the Hsp70 family as well as some of their co-chaperones were implicated in the import of mitochondrial presequence-containing substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoseini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Endo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deshaies et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caplan et al., 1992</xref>) and carrier proteins of the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Young et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhangoo et al., 2007</xref>). For example, the co-chaperone Djp1 plays a key role in the ER-SURF pathway which involves a de-tour of mitochondrial substrates to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). Such (co)chaperones were also reported to facilitate the import of mitochondrial OM proteins like Mim1 and Tom22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Papić et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Opaliński et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, we previously reported that cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp40 chaperones enable the biogenesis of mitochondrial β-barrel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jores et al., 2018</xref>). Pex19, which is a cytosolic chaperone associated with the peroxisomal import of membrane proteins, has also been found, along with Ssa1 and its co-chaperone Sti1, to assist the biogenesis of mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins namely, Fis1 and Gem1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cichocki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jansen and van der Klei, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite this advancement in our understanding of the contribution of cytosolic chaperones to mitochondrial biogenesis, no cytosolic factors have been reported so far as mediators of the biogenesis of mitochondrial SA proteins. Currently, there is scarce information regarding the early cytosolic events that assure their safe passage through the cytosol. To fill this gap, we have employed a combined experimental strategy consisting of assays with yeast cells extract, isolated organelles, and in vitro experiments with purified proteins. We could identify a subset of Hsp70 and Hsp40 (co)chaperones that interacts with SA proteins. These (co)chaperones were further shown to be crucial for the mitochondrial import of SA proteins. Furthermore, we suggest a novel offsetting role of the import receptors Tom20 and Tom70 in promoting the insertion of SA proteins with the latter serving as a docking site for the Hsp70 chaperones.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cytosolic chaperones interact with newly synthesized signal-anchored proteins</title><p>Signal-anchored proteins are, due to their hydrophobic segments, at a high risk of aggregation and misfolding following their translation in the cytosol. We aimed to search for factors that can prevent such a scenario and maintain the SA substrates in an import-competent conformation. We chose four SA model proteins to study the potential involvement of such cytosolic components: the two receptor subunits of the TOM complex, Tom20 and Tom70, and two additional proteins namely, Msp1 and the OM isoform of Mcr1 (Mcr1<sub>mom</sub>). Initially, we wanted to determine which factors can interact with newly synthesized SA proteins. To this end, we used yeast extract to translate in vitro signal-anchored proteins with a C-terminally 3HA-tag. Since the yeast extract does not contain organelles to where the freshly translated proteins can be targeted, we anticipated that such SA proteins should associate in the hydrophilic environment of the extract with factors, which will maintain them in an import-competent conformation. The tail-anchored protein Fis1 and the β-barrel protein Porin were included for comparison and the unrelated protein dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was used as a control. After their synthesis, all proteins were pulled-down with anti-HA beads and co-purified proteins in the elution fraction were analyzed by western blot followed by immunodecoration with antibodies against different cytosolic elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cytosolic chaperones interact with newly synthesized signal-anchored proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) In vitro translation reactions included yeast extracts without mRNA (Ø) or programmed with mRNA encoding HA-tagged variants of signal-anchored proteins (Msp1, Mcr1, Tom20, and Tom70), the tail-anchored protein Fis1, the β-barrel protein Porin, or, as a control, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The reactions were subjected to a pull-down with anti-HA beads. Samples from the input (1%) and the eluates (100%) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunodecoration with the indicated antibodies.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><label>Figure 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="elife-77706-fig1-data1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata2"><label>Figure 1—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Source data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="elife-77706-fig1-data2-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77706-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>All four signal-anchored proteins co-eluted with the Hsp70 chaperones Ssa1/2, and the Hsp40 co-chaperones Ydj1, Sis1 and Djp1. Weaker interactions were observed with the Hsp90 chaperones Hsc82/Hsp82 and their co-chaperones Aha1 and Sti1. The eluates contained also Hsp104 chaperone and marginal amounts of Hsp42 chaperone, suggesting that a minor portion of the newly synthesized proteins got aggregated. The co-chaperone Hch1 and the cytosolic protein Bmh1 were not co-eluted with any of the tested proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Control elution fraction containing newly synthesized DHFR had neglectable amounts of co-purified (co)chaperones, indicating the binding specificity of chaperone-substrate. As we observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jores et al., 2018</xref>), the β-barrel protein Porin also associated with the various (co)chaperones.</p><p>To validate the western blot results and to search for additional (co)chaperones co-purified with the newly translated SA proteins, the elution fractions from such pull-down assays were analyzed also by mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry analysis of the eluates from pull-downs with Msp1, Mcr1, or (as a control) with mock pull-down where no synthesized protein was present are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Several chaperones, which are not included in the western blot due to lack of antibodies, were additionally detected in the eluate of both proteins Msp1 and Mcr1. The detected proteins are presented in two groups. The first contained those proteins that were not found at all in the mock eluate, hence their enrichment ratio in Msp1 and Mcr1 eluates could not be calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Among these, chaperones from the Hsp70 family, namely, Ssa4, Snl1, and Lhs1 were found. The second group is the set of proteins that were found in minor amounts also in the mock elution, and thus their relative enrichment as compared to the mock pull-down could be determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Amongst them, the Hsp70 chaperones Ssc1, Sse1, and Ssb1/2, in addition to the ribosome-associated complex (RAC) chaperone Zuo1 were detected. Taken together, the combined analysis of the pull-down assays shows multifaceted interactions between newly synthesized SA proteins and cytosolic chaperones and co-chaperones.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The hydrophobic transmembrane segment of SA proteins mediates their interactions with cytosolic (co)chaperones</title><p>The detected interactions of a subset of cytosolic (co)chaperones with SA proteins led us to ask which part of these latter proteins mediate such association. A likely candidate for this task is the proteins’ hydrophobic TMS. To test this assumption, we constructed two additional C-terminally HA-tagged versions of each SA protein – one construct encodes the cytosolic part of the protein (indicated by protein name-C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the second encodes only the hydrophobic TMS (indicated by protein name-T, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These two constructs together with the full-length (-FL) variant were used for in vitro translation in yeast extract followed by pull-down assay. As expected for small proteins, all three constructs encoding the hydrophobic TMSs were synthesized to a lower extent as compared to the constructs representing the cytosolic moieties or the full-length proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, input panels). Yet, similar levels of bound (co)chaperones were observed in the eluates of the hydrophobic TMSs and the full-length versions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). In contrast, only marginal binding of (co)chaperones to the soluble cytosolic parts of the SA proteins or to the control protein DHFR was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).

To exclude any indirect effect that might be caused by a general dysfunction of the mitochondria or by defective assembly of the known import machineries due to low expression levels of Ydj1 and Sis1, we monitored the steady state levels and the assembly of additional mitochondrial proteins from different sub-compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, B). Some of these proteins are subunits of the respiratory chain complexes, such as Cox2 of complex IV and Cor1 of complex III, others are components of the OM import machineries: Mim1, Tom40, and Tom22, or subunit of the IM import machinery like Oxa1.</p><p>Interestingly, mitochondrial levels of the α-helical OM proteins Tom22 and Om14 and the IM protein Oxa1 were also reduced in the depletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that this reduction, and especially that of Tom22, might be a result of lower levels of the TOM receptors Tom20 and Tom70, since both receptors were shown to play a role in the membranal insertion of Tom22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keil and Pfanner, 1993</xref>).

We choose to utilize a strain that is depleted of both co-chaperones since their mutual function allows them to compensate for each other’s loss. To this end, we translated HA-tagged variants of the four signal-anchored proteins in extract of either WT or Ydj1 and Sis1 depleted cells (YS↓) and then performed pull down with anti-HA beads. Interestingly, we found that the interaction between the newly synthesized proteins and some of the chaperones was altered in cells depleted for both co-chaperones while other chaperones did not show any considerable change. The co-purified levels of Hsp104 and Hsp26 chaperones were increased in the eluates of all SA proteins translated in the extract of the depletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Both Hsp104 and Hsp26 are involved in disaggregation of substrate proteins. Hence the co-purification of these chaperones with newly synthesized SA proteins, in the absence of Sis1 and Ydj1, suggests that the cytosol of such strain offers less stabilization for the newly synthesized substrates, and as a result, these substrates are more prone to aggregation under these conditions.

Then, we monitored the anisotropy changes of these fluorescently labeled peptides upon their interaction with recombinantly expressed and purified (co)chaperones. The fluorescence anisotropy of the TAMRA-labeled Tom70 and Mcr1 peptides increased upon addition of recombinant Ssa1 indicating the formation of a peptide-Ssa1 complex. As a control, such an increase was not observed when bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added, underlining the specificity of the chaperone-substrate interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).

This approach enabled us to monitor the binding parameters and compare the binding affinity between substrate and different (co)chaperones. Based on these experiments, dissociation constants (Kd) were determined according to hyperbolic regression curves fitted to the data. These Kds were calculated to be 2.42 µM for Ssa1-Tom70(TMS) complex and 3.27 µM for Ssa1-Mcr1(TMS) complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

Collectively, these results show that the affinity between the substrates and the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1 is several folds higher than their affinity to the co-chaperone, Sis1.

To substantiate this assumption, we wished to examine whether inhibiting this chaperone can interfere with the import of SA proteins. Thus, we performed in vitro import assays in which the yeast extract used for protein translation was supplemented with the Hsp70 inhibitor, CBag (C-terminal Bag domain of human Bag-1M) prior to import into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jores et al., 2018</xref>).

To this end, we performed additional set of fluorescence anisotropy experiments in which Ssa1, ATP and Sis1, each a few minutes apart and in a different order were added to the Mcr1-TAMRA-labeled peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). Since Ssa1 has ATPase activity that is modulated by Hsp40 co-chaperones, we tested whether the binding of Hsp40 or Hsp70 to the substrate is ATP dependent. Higher anisotropy values were observed when Ssa1 was supplemented first, indicating complex formation between Ssa1 and Mcr1 peptide. After adding ATP, the anisotropy was reduced indicating that the complex started to disassociate as a result of ADP exchange for ATP, which promotes chaperone-substrate release. However, addition of Sis1 increased the anisotropy again suggesting either a complex formation between Sis1 and the substrate or that Sis1 restored the complex formation between Ssa1 to Mcr1 peptide by tuning the ATPase-driven chaperone cycle of Ssa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>In another experiment, we added first Sis1 to the Mcr1 peptide and, as expected, complex formation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Only a slight decrease in the anisotropy was detected once Ssa1 was added to the mixture. This behavior could be attributed to a transfer of the substrate from Sis1 to Ssa1 due to higher affinity of the substrate to the latter protein. Interestingly, when ATP was supplied to the mixture at last, no further decrease in the anisotropy was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This lack of effect could be explained by one of the two possibilities – (i) since there is still Sis1 in the mixture, following the Ssa1-substrate disassociation due to ATP, the substrate re-associated with Sis1, or (ii) due to the presence of Sis1, the ATP hydrolysis is accelerated which retains Hsp70 chaperone conformation in favor of substrate binding, making the Ssa1-subsatre complex no longer sensitive to ATP.</p><p>In the last experiment, Sis1 was supplemented after Ssa1 and an additional increase in anisotropy was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Since the total change in anisotropy is even larger than the increase observed in the presence of either Ssa1 or Sis1 alone, this observation might suggest the formation of a ternary complex composed of Ssa1-Sis1-substrate. Importantly, this rise was not long-lasting, and the complex appears to dissociate over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). As before, the addition of ATP at this stage did not change the level of anisotropy. Overall, these findings support a complex formation between Hsp70 and its SA substrate. In addition, they suggest a regulatory effect of ATP on this complex, which is no longer observed when Sis1 is in the mixture, suggesting a role of Sis1 in stabilizing this complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Tom20 and Tom70 receptors might play an offsetting role in the biogenesis of the SA proteins Msp1 and Mcr1</title><p>Next, we wanted to decipher the late cytosolic events involving the recognition of newly synthesized proteins at the mitochondrial surface.

Hence, we aimed to examine the potential interaction between the TOM receptors and different chaperones using the same approach, namely, pull-down from yeast extract. Notably, Ydj1 showed similar binding levels to both receptors while Ssa1/2, Sti1 and Hsp104 exhibited stronger binding to the cytosolic domain of Tom70. On the other hand, Aha1 displayed a stronger interaction with the Tom20 receptor. Other chaperones, like Hsp26 and Hch1 did not bind to either receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Since the cooperation between Hsp70 chaperone and Tom70/Tom20 receptors in facilitating productive delivery of a subset of preproteins to the receptor for subsequent membrane translocation has been reported in multiple publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mills et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Komiya et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Young et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wegele et al., 2006</xref>), we decided to further investigate the implications of such interactions for the biogenesis of SA proteins. Given that Tom70 contains docking site for Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones, along with our observation that Ssa1/2 is probably involved in the insertion process of Msp1 and Mcr1, we asked whether Tom70 receptor recognizes the polypeptide substrate while in complex with Ssa1 and whether Hsp70 docking is required for the formation of a productive substrate/Tom70 complex. For this purpose, we analyzed Mcr1-peptide binding to GST-Tom70 receptor in the presence of Ssa1, Sis1, and ATP supplemented in different orders and monitored the change in the anisotropy. As shown in the previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), we observed complex formation after adding Ssa1 to Mcr1-peptide, which was detached upon ATP addition. However, once GST-Tom70 was added, a complex that caused an even higher anisotropy shift was formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), suggesting that Mcr1 peptide, after being released from Ssa1, formed a complex with Tom70 with higher affinity. To exclude unspecific binding that might form between the GST moiety and the substrate, GST alone or GST-Tom70 were added to Mcr1-peptide. Whereas no change in anisotropy was observed when GST alone was used, high anisotropy values were detected following addition of GST-Tom70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, a complex between Mcr1-peptide and Tom70, as indicated by a large increase in the measured anisotropy, was also formed when GST-Tom70 was supplemented first while Ssa1 was still absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Once Ssa1 and ATP were supplemented to this Tom70-Mcr1(TMS) complex, only a slight reduction shift was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), suggesting that the complex between Mcr1 substrate and Tom70 receptor remained mostly stable. This observation supports the assumption that the substrate interacts with the receptor with higher binding affinity than to the chaperone. Such an increased affinity can promote transfer of the substrate from the chaperone to the receptor.</p><p>To test if the substrate-receptor interaction can occur even when the substrate is compounded with the Ssa1 chaperone, we enabled substrate-chaperone complex to form by supplementing Ssa1 first, followed by the addition of GST-Tom70. Surprisingly, higher anisotropy shift was detected right after addition of GST-Tom70, indicating that the Tom70 receptor can bind the substrate while the latter is in complex with the chaperone. Addition of ATP, which aids the release of the substrate from the chaperone, resulted in an even higher increase in anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), suggesting that the Tom70 receptor might bind the substrate with enhanced efficiency upon its release from the chaperone. To ensure that the receptor can indeed bind the substrate-chaperone complex, we stabilized the complex formed by Ssa1-Mcr1(TMS) by co-addition of Sis1 to the mixture. Even in this case, the receptor Tom70 still interacted with the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that the substrate has higher affinity for the receptor than to the chaperone. Furthermore, Tom70 is capable of binding substrates irrespective of the presence or absence of the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1.</p><p>Having demonstrated that Tom20 and Tom70 can bind newly translated SA proteins to a different degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), we aimed to assess whether these interactions are required for their mitochondrial insertion. Previous studies have shown that the absence of either one of the TOM receptors does not cause a reduction in the mitochondrial steady state levels of Msp1 or Mcr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vitali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meineke et al., 2008</xref>). In line with these previous findings, the insertion efficiency of radiolabeled Msp1 or Mcr1, as observed in in vitro import assays, was not significantly reduced when isolated mitochondria lacking Tom70/71 were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>, B). Since both receptors, Tom20 and Tom70 can interact with Msp1 and Mcr1, we assume that both might play a role in vivo in their recognition, hence, when one receptor is absent, the other one can compensate due to their partial overlapping function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Young et al., 2003</xref>). In support of this inference, a slight increase in the steady state levels of either Tom20 or Tom70 was detected in cells deleted of the other receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To further test the involvement of these import receptors, we wanted to examine the direct effect of the loss of both receptors on the mitochondrial insertion of Msp1 and Mcr1. Since the double deletion of both receptors is lethal, we searched for other means how to deactivate both receptors at once. To this end, we conducted in vitro import assays of radiolabeled proteins (Msp1 and Mcr1) under two different conditions. In the first set of experiments, mitochondria were pre-treated with proteases (trypsin or proteinase K) to remove exposed domains of import receptors. In the other set of assays we employed mitochondria lacking the Tom20 receptor (isolated from <italic>tom20Δ</italic> strain) and treated with the C-terminal domain of human Hsp90 (C90) which is known to block the Hsp70 chaperone binding site on the mitochondrial import receptor Tom70, thus inhibiting its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Young et al., 2003</xref>). Following protease treatment of control isolated mitochondria, the cytosolic domains of both Tom20 and Tom70 were degraded, and the native proteins could not be detected by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). While membranal insertion of both Msp1 and Mcr1 was drastically reduced upon using trypsin-treated mitochondria, only much milder reduction was observed following PK-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). This observation can be explained by the different cleavage sites specificity of both proteases. Since the cytosolic domains of import receptors are tightly folded, we assume that while the positive charged Lys and Arg, which are recognized by trypsin, are available on exposed segments, the hydrophobic residues, that are preferentially recognized by PK, are buried within the folded structure. Hence, trypsin might cleave larger parts of these proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Tom70 and Tom20 may have offsetting function in mediating the biogenesis of Msp1 and Mcr1.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Left panels: Radiolabeled Msp1 (<bold>A</bold>) and Mcr1 (<bold>B</bold>) were translated in yeast extract from WT cells and subjected to in vitro import assay using isolated mitochondria.

However, this difference can be explained by the fact that in the previous study, the cells lacking Tom70 could adapt for its loss, while the effect of inhibition by C90 is immediate and not reversible. Interestingly, insertion efficiency of Msp1 into mitochondria lacking Tom20 was around 25% higher as compared to control WT mitochondria, maybe because of the slightly elevated levels of Tom70 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Such factors have been identified for some of the mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, such as the β-barrel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jores et al., 2018</xref>), and some single-span proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cichocki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Papić et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Opaliński et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we employed four different model proteins from the SA family and identified several cytosolic chaperones that can interact with such newly synthesized proteins through their hydrophobic transmembrane domain. Of note, the cytosolic domains of these SA proteins were not associated with chaperones indicating that they are less prone to forming aggregates or to misfold in the cytosol. These observations are in line with the widely accepted concept that chaperones recognize mainly hydrophobic patches to bind their substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clerico et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We identify chaperones from the Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp40 families to interact with SA proteins. When we tested the role of the Hsp40 co-chaperones, Ydj1 and Sis1, which are two major J-domain proteins in the yeast cytosol, we observed that mitochondrial steady state levels of Tom20 and Tom70 were largely reduced upon depletion of both chaperones and this effect was less pronounced when only one of the co-chaperones was depleted. This observation indicates, in agreement with an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson and Craig, 2001</xref>), that Ydj1 and Sis1 share overlapping functions. In contrast, the steady-state levels of Msp1 and Mcr1, despite exhibiting interaction with Ydj1 and Sis1, were unaffected or only slightly affected, respectively , by the co-depletion of the co-chaperones. This suggests that other Hsp40 co-chaperones play most likely a more central role in the biogenesis of these SA proteins. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that upon co-depletion of both Ydj1 and Sis1, the newly synthesized SA proteins showed enhanced binding to Hsp26 and Hsp104 chaperones that are implicated in binding aggregated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zolkiewski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franzmann et al., 2005</xref>). These findings emphasize the involvement of Ydj1 and Sis1 in preventing cytotoxic protein aggregation and agree with other proposed functions of both co-chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cyr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klaips et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we have shown that both the in vitro import efficiency and the steady-state levels of Tom20 are reduced upon depletion of Ydj1 and Sis1. In the case of Tom70, in vitro insertion was unaffected despite reduced mitochondrial steady state levels, suggesting that such chaperones might play a role that is upstream of Tom70 membranal insertion. These combined observations suggest that Ydj1 and Sis1 are involved in the biogenesis of SA proteins to varying degrees. The cis characteristics of the substrate proteins that dictates the variable dependency will be the topic of future studies.</p><p>We also validated via fluorescence anisotropy the interactions between a peptide corresponding to the transmembrane of Mcr1 and the two (co)chaperones Ssa1 and Sis1. Interestingly, the binding affinity of the substrate to the co-chaperone (Sis1) was 10-fold lower than the binding to the Hsp70 chaperone (Ssa1). These observations support the hypothesis that the substrate transfer from the co-chaperone to the main Hsp70 chaperones is driven by increased affinity to the latter. Similar results were also previously observed for a peptide representing the mitochondrial targeting element of the β-barrel protein Porin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jores et al., 2018</xref>). According to our findings, the complex formed by Ssa1/substrate is regulated by the J-protein Sis1. Although we could show that a potential substrate is able to bind Hsp70 chaperone also in the absence of Sis1, this interaction was susceptible to ATP. In contrast, in the presence of Sis1 the complex was no longer responsive to ATP, pointing out the regulatory function of Sis1 on the Hsp70 ATPase activity. In agreement with our findings, previous studies have shown that both Sis1 and Ydj1 facilitate binding between substrate and Hsp70 chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our current findings show that inhibiting Ssa1 activity significantly reduces the integration of Msp1 and Mcr1 into the OM. This implies that in addition to its well-known function in facilitating protein folding, Ssa1 also directly supports the mitochondrial insertion of Msp1 and Mcr1. Of note, we could show that SA proteins can interact with the TOM receptors Tom70 and Tom20, suggesting that TOM receptors may play a role in recognizing newly synthesized SA proteins on the mitochondrial surface. At least for Mcr1, such a recognition by the import receptors might be related to the presence of MTS-like stretch in residues 1–10 of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hahne et al., 1994</xref>). Furthermore, in accordance with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kreimendahl and Rassow, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Young et al., 2003</xref>), this recognition may involve an interplay between the Hsp70 chaperone and the Tom70 receptor. Based on our findings, we propose that Ssa1/substrate complex is initially identified by Tom70 receptor, most likely using the docking site in Tom70, which may be crucial for correct targeting.</p><p>However, it is important to note that based on crystal structure, the cytosolic segment of Tom70 receptor contains two distinctive domains, the C-terminal domain which acts as substrate binding pocket and N-terminal domain (clamp domain) consisting of three TPR motifs, which is most likely responsible for binding the EEVD motif of Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu and Sha, 2006</xref>). Consonant with that, we assume that in our in vitro assays, Tom70 was capable of binding both, the Ssa1/substrate complex, likely via the N-terminal chaperone docking domain and the substrate alone following its release from the chaperone through its C-terminal substrate binding pocket. The substrate is then released from the chaperone-complex and relayed to Tom70 to which it has a higher affinity. These findings support a previously published study which proposed that the monomeric form of Tom70 is responsible for mediating initial chaperone docking and precursor recognition via its clamp domain followed by substrate release. This recognition is assumed to be facilitated by the exchange of ATP for ADP at the chaperone ATPase domain and results in the dimerization of Tom70 which favors interactions solely with the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mills et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>When we analyzed the direct involvement of the TOM receptors in the biogenesis of Msp1 and Mcr1, we found that their insertion was drastically reduced upon either trypsin-mediated removal of the exposed domains of surface proteins or inhibition of Tom70 by C90. Of note, the membrane integration of these substrates was enhanced upon <italic>TOM20</italic> deletion. This finding is in line with previous study showing higher steady state levels of Msp1 in mitochondria devoid of Tom20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vitali et al., 2020</xref>). This enhancement could be attributed to higher expression of Tom70 to compensate for the deletion of Tom20. Moreover, inhibition of Tom70 in a deletion strain of Tom20 led to further reduction in the insertion of SA proteins, supporting the assumption that each receptor can compensate for the absence of the other one. Hence, it seems that both receptors might be involved in the biogenesis of the SA proteins Msp1 and Mcr1. Yet, it is still unclear whether such proteins might follow different insertion pathways based on the receptor available for their recognition, specially that Tom20 does not have a chaperone docking site but was rather suggested to have a chaperone-like activity to prevent protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yano et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our current findings, when combined with prior information, provide new insights into the cytosolic chain of events from the synthesis of SA proteins until their recognition at the mitochondrial surface allowing us to suggest a working model for their biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Following their synthesis, SA proteins interact with molecular chaperones via their hydrophobic patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, stage 1). This productive binding protects the newly synthesized proteins from aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, stage 2). Hsp40 cochaperone initially bind such proteins and facilitate their transfer to the Hsp70 chaperone by promoting ATP hydrolysis resulting in Hsp70-ADP bound state that has higher affinity to the substrate. Such interactions are not only crucial for keeping the substrate protein in an import-competent conformation by preventing aggregation and misfolding events, but also for their proper mitochondrial targeting which involves the TOM complex receptors Tom20 and Tom70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, stage 3). Binding of the chaperone/substrate complex to Tom70 receptor might result in disassociation of the substrate from the Hsp70 chaperone leading to its ultimate insertion into the OM that is usually facilitated by the MIM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, stage 4). Although both receptors may not be vividly crucial for the actual membrane integration process, we propose that they are required for facilitating efficient delivery in the crowded environment of the cell.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Working model for the biogenesis of SA proteins.</title><p>After SA proteins get synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes, they can associate with Hsp40 chaperones (like Ydj1 and Sis1)(1). Upon depletion of Hsp40 chaperones, newly synthesized SA proteins might tend to form aggregates, which can then associate with disaggregases chaperones such as Hsp104 and Hsp26 (2). Hsp40 chaperones drive the transfer of the newly synthesized protein to Hsp70 chaperone (Ssa1/2) by facilitating the conversion of Hsp70 from its ATP form to the ADP one that has a higher affinity for polypeptides. Next, the protein-chaperone complex is recognized by Tom70 receptor (3), followed by disassociation of the chaperone. Subsequently to the recognition by Tom70, which may involve also Tom20, the substrate is then inserted into the OM, either through an unassisted route (4 a), or via a pathway which is facilitated by the MIM complex (4b).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77706-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth methods</title><p>Yeast strains used in the study were isogenic to <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains W303α or JSY7452.

Yeast strains expressing Ydj1 and Sis1 under tetracycline promotor were grown in YP-Sucrose media (for mitochondria isolation) or in glucose-containing rich medium, YPD (for isolation of cell extract). For mitochondria isolation, cells were grown for 2 hr on medium lacking doxycycline before supplementing them with 2 μg/ml of doxycycline. Then, cells were cultured for different time periods before their harvest. All strains used in this study are listed in key resources table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Recombinant DNA techniques</title><p>The plasmids pRS426-TPI-Tom20 and pRS426-TPI-Tom70 were used as templates for the PCR-amplification of the <italic>TOM20</italic> and <italic>TOM70</italic> genes, respectively.

These are crucial events in order to assist proper protein biogenesis while preventing aggregation and its downstream consequences. The study is an important contribution to the understanding of cytosolic events in the biogenesis of mitochondrial proteins and will be of relevance for researchers in the fields of chaperone and mitochondrial biology as well as for cell biologists studying the biogenesis of membrane proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77706.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Pfanner</surname><given-names>Nikolaus</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0245cg223</institution-id><institution>University of Freiburg</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/041nas322</institution-id><institution>University of Bonn</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Wiedemann</surname><given-names>Nils</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0245cg223</institution-id><institution>Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Tokatlidis</surname><given-names>Kostas</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00vtgdb53</institution-id><institution>University of Glasgow</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.15.480587">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.480587v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The results of these import assays, which are presented in revised Figure S2A (for Msp1) and Figure S2B (for Mcr1), show that the import of both signal anchored proteins is hardly affected. We suggest that the apparent contradiction to the reduction in the import of these substrates observed upon addition of C90 is due to potential compensation processes in the deletion strain whereas the addition of C90 does allow adaptation time. This point is further discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The interesting in vivo experiments assessing the phenotype of Sis1 and/or Ydj1 downregulation (Figure 3) are among the crucial experiments of the manuscript, revealing a reduction of Tom20 and Tom70 receptor levels upon Sis1 downregulation.

The outcome of these immunodecorations, as presented in revised Figure S1A, demonstrate that, as we reported before (Jores et al., 2018), the double depletion of both co-chaperones results in major reduction in the levels of the β-barrel proteins Tom40 and porin. Interestingly, the levels of the inner membrane protein Oxa1 are also compromised whereas other inner membrane proteins like Cor1 or Cox2 appear unaffected. Importantly, the amounts of Mim1 as analyzed by SDS-PAGE or BN-PAGE are not influenced by the reduced levels of both co-chaperones (Figure S1A and B) suggesting that the observed reduction in the levels of Tom20 and Tom70 cannot be explained by compromised activity of the MIM insertase. These new results are discussed in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should label the Mcr1 MOM and MIM isoforms (Figure 3). It looks like that in contrast to the Mcr1 MOM isoform, which does not seem to be affected by Sis1/Yid1 depletion, the Mcr1 MIM isoform seems to be affected.

It seems that various proteins depend to a variable extent on both co-chaperones. Whereas the OM proteins Om14, Tom22, Tom20, and Tom70 are affected upon the dual depletion of Ydj1 and Sis1, the levels of other OM proteins like Fis1, Msp1, or Mcr1(OM form) were not altered. Similar variability was observed also for inner membrane or IMS proteins. Cor1, Cox2, and Pic2 were not affected while Oxa1 and Mcr1(IMS form) were detected in reduced amounts (revised Figure 3D). Analyzing the respiratory complexes III and IV by BN-PAGE did not reveal major differences upon depletion of the co-chaperones (Figure S1B). Hence, it seems that the biogenesis of some (like Tom20, Tom70, Oxa1 or Mcr1<sub>IMS</sub>) but not all membranal mitochondrial proteins are supported by Ydj1 and Sis1. These new observations are presented and discussed in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) End of p 13, they describe trypsin shaving of the surface of mitochondria.

To address this issue, we performed many experiments where we compare the import behavior of mitochondria pre-treated before the import reactions with either PK or trypsin. Surprisingly, we observed a stronger effect upon treatment with trypsin although in both cases the import receptors Tom20 and Tom70 were removed (revised Figure 9A and B). The effect of trypsin in the new assays was much higher than in the original submission probably due to the usage in the new experiments of a digestion buffer lacking BSA. We suspect that in the original experiments a large portion of the trypsin proteolytic capacity was toward BSA instead of efficient digestion of the mitochondrial proteins. Although we cannot explain completely the difference between trypsin and PK, we included in the revised text some suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As this is a very complex topic, particularly for non-experts, it might be worthwhile having a model cartoon at the end to bring all the info together in a summary model.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good suggestion and accordingly we included in the revised version (as revised Figure 10) a scheme that depicts our working model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The interesting in vivo experiments assessing the phenotype of Sis1 and/or Ydj1 downregulation (Figure 3) are among the most crucial experiments of the manuscript, revealing a reduction of Tom20 and Tom70 receptor levels upon Sis1 downregulation.
