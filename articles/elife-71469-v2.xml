Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play important roles in all of these processes. CAMs can initiate cell–cell contact and recruit pre- and postsynaptic proteins to direct synapse formation and maturation. They usually have an extracellular domain (ECD) that interacts with other CAMs, either homophilically or heterophilically, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that transduces signals.</p><p>Receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are transmembrane signaling receptors with CAM-like ECDs and cytoplasmic regions containing one or two PTP domains. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has six RPTPs, four of which are primarily expressed in the nervous system. Type IIa RPTPs (also known as LAR or R2A RPTPs) have large ECDs containing immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domains and fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats. They bind heterophilically to ligands and coreceptors (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukai and Yoshida, 2021</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> Lar is a Type IIa RPTP with IgSF and FNIII domains that is orthologous to three mammalian Type IIa RPTPs: PTPRF (LAR), PTPRD (PTPδ, R-PTP-δ), and PTPRS (PTPσ, R-PTP-σ). <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has a single Type IIa RPTP, PTP-3.</p><p>Lar is selectively expressed in neurons during development. It regulates motor axon guidance in embryos and determines the numbers of synaptic boutons in neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaufmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krueger et al., 1996</xref>). Lar is required for R7 photoreceptor axon targeting in the optic lobe (OL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clandinin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurel-Zaffran et al., 2001</xref>) and for development of the lobes of the larval mushroom body (MB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kurusu and Zinn, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) Syndecan (Sdc) and Dally-like (Dlp) are the only known ligands for <italic>Drosophila</italic> Lar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox and Zinn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>). Lar interacts directly with heparan sulfate, as do mammalian Type IIa RPTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aricescu et al., 2002</xref>). Sdc and Dlp are involved in Lar’s regulation of embryonic axon guidance and larval NMJ development, but <italic>Sdc</italic> and <italic>Dlp</italic> phenotypes are much weaker than <italic>Lar</italic> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox and Zinn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that other ligands must also participate. HSPGs are not involved in R7 photoreceptor axon targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hofmeyer and Treisman, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Mouse mutants lacking each of the Type IIa RPTPs have complex phenotypes affecting neurogenesis, axon guidance, synaptogenesis, and behavior (reviewed for PTPRD by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Uhl and Martinez, 2019</xref>). Loss of these RPTPs also produces many phenotypes outside the nervous system. Human Type IIa RPTP polymorphisms are associated with cancer and other diseases. Analysis of Type IIa RPTP function is complicated by redundancy among the three proteins, which are very similar to each other and are expressed in overlapping patterns. Redundancy among RPTPs has been well characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where <italic>Lar Ptp69D</italic>, <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D</italic>, and <italic>Ptp10D Ptp4E</italic> double mutants have unique phenotypes that are not present in single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jeon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeon and Zinn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In differentiated neurons, mammalian Type IIa RPTPs are thought to function in presynaptic terminals. They can act as “synaptic organizers”, facilitating formation of synapses in cell culture models via their interactions with a diverse set of postsynaptic ligands. These include Netrin-G ligand 3 (NGL-3), Tropomyosin kinase C (TrkC), Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1), Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), Slit- and Trk-like family protein (Slitrk) 1-Slitrk6, synaptic adhesion-like molecule (SALM) 3, and SALM5 (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukai and Yoshida, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi and Craig, 2013</xref>). None of these ligands has a <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog, although there are <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins with similar domain structures.</p><p>It has been suggested that Type IIa RPTPs function in a similar manner to neurexins, which are presynaptic proteins that interact with neuroligins and other postsynaptic ligands to induce synapse formation and/or determine synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Südhof, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi and Craig, 2013</xref>). Type IIa RPTPs and neurexins were recently shown to directly interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2020a</xref>). Two recent studies addressed the synaptic functions of Type IIa RPTPs by examining hippocampal neurons from knockout (KO) animals. One study found that cultured hippocampal triple mutant neurons lacking all three Type IIa RPTPs form synapses in a normal manner, although there was a reduction in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency. The only major change observed in CA3→CA1 synapses was a reduction in NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sclip and Südhof, 2020</xref>). The other study examined a conditional <italic>PTPRS</italic> KO, and found a decrease in the number of excitatory synapses, as well as a reduction in mEPSC frequency, but did not observe a change in AMPA vs. NMDA-receptor mediated EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2020b</xref>). The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear; it is possible that two of the Type IIa RPTPs act in opposition to each other, as has been observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for <italic>Lar</italic> and <italic>Ptp99A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desai et al., 1997</xref>). Both studies examined only hippocampal synapses, so it remains possible that Type IIa RPTPs are essential for synapse formation or function in other parts of the brain.</p><p>Here we identify the IgSF CAM Sticks and Stones (Sns) as a new Lar ligand and show that the Lar-Sns interaction is conserved between flies and mammals. Sns has orthologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (SYG-2) and mammals (Nephrin). The human gene encoding Nephrin, NPHS1, is mutated in congenital nephrotic syndrome, a lethal kidney disease. Nephrin is the core component of the extracellular kidney slit diaphragm filtration network (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin and Jones, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Sns, SYG-2, and Nephrin belong to an IgSF subfamily called Irre cell recognition module (IRM) proteins, which has four members in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: Sns, Kirre, Roughest (Rst), and Hibris (Hbs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischbach et al., 2009</xref>). The Sns and Hbs ECDs contain nine IgSF domains and a single FNIII repeat, while the Kirre and Rst ECDs contain five IgSF domains. Sns and Hbs are paralogs that bind to Kirre and Rst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bour et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galletta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ozkan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shelton et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of Sns and Kirre, SYG-2 and SYG-1, also bind to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>). In humans and mice, there is one Sns/Hbs ortholog, Nephrin, and three Kirre/Rst orthologs (Nephs or Kirrels). Nephrins and Nephs interact heterophilically and homophilically. IRM proteins in different species have almost identical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>), and SYG-2 and SYG-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be replaced in vivo by human Nephrin and Neph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartleben et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wanner et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>All four <italic>Drosophila</italic> IRM proteins function together as ligand-receptor pairs on the surface of founder cells and fusion competent myoblasts to regulate myoblast fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bour et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shelton et al., 2009</xref>). The four proteins also function together in nephrocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhuang et al., 2009</xref>) and in ommatidium patterning in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bao et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> SYG-2 and SYG-1 regulate the formation of synapses by HSNL neurons onto vulval muscles. SYG-1 acts presynaptically, while SYG-2 acts in guidepost epithelial cells to direct presynaptic component assembly at the site of their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Mouse Nephrin and Neph1 are required for the formation and function of the kidney slit diaphragm (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin and Jones, 2018</xref>), and Nephrin is also involved in myoblast fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sohn et al., 2009</xref>). Nephrin and the Nephs are expressed in the developing and adult nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Putaala et al., 2001</xref>). Neph2/Kirrel2 and Neph3/Kirrel3 are involved in sorting of olfactory receptor neuron axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Serizawa et al., 2006</xref>), but Nephrin’s functions in the nervous system are unknown. However, since Sns and Nephrin are both involved in the development of the excretory system and in muscle fusion, it is reasonable to speculate that these orthologs might also have similar roles during nervous system development.</p><p>In this article, we show that Sns is a ligand that controls Lar’s functions in R7 photoreceptor axon targeting and MB lobe development. Lar and Sns interact in <italic>trans</italic> in these systems because they are expressed in different sets of neurons. Sns is also required for Lar function in larval NMJ development, but in that system the two proteins are expressed in the same neurons and likely interact in <italic>cis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Sns as a Lar binding partner</title><p>Cell-surface protein (CSP) interactions mediated by ECDs are often of low affinity, having K<sub>d</sub>s in the micromolar range and fast dissociation rates. Our group developed the live-dissected embryo staining screen as a way to identify low-affinity binding partners for neural CSPs expressed in a normal cellular context. It takes maximum advantage of avidity effects and has revealed low-affinity interactions that were not detected in the global in vitro ‘interactome’ screen, which used an ELISA-like method (the Extracellular Interactome Assay (ECIA)) to assess interactions among 200 <italic>Drosophila</italic> CAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bali et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bali and Zinn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox and Zinn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ozkan et al., 2013</xref>). Multimeric ECD fusion proteins are incubated with live-dissected embryos, allowing complexes of fusion proteins with CSPs on muscles or neurons to coalesce (‘cap’) into dense patches. The embryos are then washed directly with paraformaldehyde, which crosslinks the patches and freezes complexes into place, and the complexes are visualized with fluorescent secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox and Zinn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We first used this method to identify Sdc as a Lar ligand using a deficiency (<italic>Df</italic>) screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox and Zinn, 2005</xref>). We later developed a gain-of-function (GOF) version of the screen in which we crossed 300 lines bearing ‘EP-like’ (UAS-containing) <italic>P</italic> elements upstream of CSP genes to a strong pancellular driver, tubulin (Tub)-GAL4, and stained the embryonic progeny of the cross with RPTP fusion proteins. We identified Stranded at Second (Sas), a large CSP expressed in epidermal cells, as a ligand for Ptp10D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). To conduct the GOF screen with Lar ECD fusion proteins, we used a mutant protein, Lar<sup>HS2</sup>, that does not bind to HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox and Zinn, 2005</xref>). We stained live-dissected stage 16 embryos from crosses of 300 EP lines to Tub-GAL4 with a dimeric Lar<sup>HS2</sup>-alkaline phosphatase (henceforth called Lar-AP) fusion protein.</p><p>Lar-AP faintly stains central nervous system (CNS) axons in wild-type (WT) embryos. However, it brightly stained both the CNS axon ladder and the periphery in embryos from a cross between Tub-GAL4 and a line that has an insertion of an EP-like element ~200 bp 5′ to the transcription start of <italic>sns</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Quantification of Lar-AP staining intensity in the periphery showed more than a 10-fold increase in Lar-AP staining in Tub&gt;Sns embryos vs. WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result shows that ectopic expression of Sns in neural, ectodermal, and muscle cells confers binding to the Lar ECD. However, it does not prove that Lar and Sns bind directly to each other since such results could also be obtained if Sns ectopic expression induced expression or stabilization of another protein that actually binds to Lar.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Binding of Lar and its orthologs to Sns and Nephrin.</title><p>All images show live-dissected late-stage 16 embryos.

Staining was also increased in the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E’ and F’</xref>). Some of this staining colocalizes with ectopic Lar, such as at the VNC exit points. This reverse binding experiment provides evidence that Lar and Sns bind to each other. We do not know why CNS longitudinal tracts, which stain brightly with anti-Lar, do not exhibit strong staining with Sns-AP<sub>5</sub>. Perhaps there are access issues due to glial sheathing or there may be proteins expressed on glia and motor axons that facilitate Lar-Sns binding.</p><p>To confirm direct binding between Lar and Sns, we conducted ECIA experiments with multimerized Lar-Fc and Sns-AP<sub>5</sub> proteins made in human Expi293 cells.

A single optical slice of the MB lobes shows no Sns&gt;GFP expression in the MB neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and F’</xref>). In order to determine if Sns is expressed in neurons postsynaptic to MB axons, we used a dendrite-specific marker (UAS-Drep2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andlauer et al., 2014</xref>) to label Sns-expressing neurons. We observed Drep2-expressing neurons enveloping the dorsal lobes of the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that Sns-expressing neurons are postsynaptic to Lar-expressing KCs. We also performed immunostaining using Sns&gt;GFP and anti-Repo to label glial cells, but did not see any co-localization between GFP and Repo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Lar</italic> mutants have two distinct phenotypes in the larval MB. First, the medial lobe axons fail to stop at the midline, instead crossing over to the contralateral side and forming a fused medial lobe. Second, KC axons do not branch properly (or dorsal branches do not extend after branching), resulting in reduced or absent dorsal lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kurusu and Zinn, 2008</xref>). We investigated whether Sns is required for Lar’s roles in the development of the larval MB by phenotypic analysis of the medial and dorsal lobes in <italic>Lar/sns</italic> transhets. FasII antibody staining specifically labels both medial and dorsal lobes. We analyzed 3D reconstructions of FasII-stained larval MBs to visualize the lobes in their entirety. Each optical section of confocal <italic>z</italic>-stacks through the MBs was analyzed for the medial lobe fusion phenotype. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> shows single optical slices with medial lobe axons either intact or crossing the midline.</p><p>Heterozygous control animals did not show any abnormal phenotypes in the larval MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, Sns apparently functions as a Lar ligand in this system. Dendrites of Sns-expressing neurons encircle the dorsal lobes of the MB, indicating that Sns is in neurons (MBONs) that are postsynaptic to Lar-expressing KC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Lar RNAi knockdown in all MB neurons resulted in medial lobe fusion in the larval MB, confirming that Lar acts in MB neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). MB-specific Sns RNAi knockdown, however, did not cause any abnormalities in the larval MB.

Adult KCs are classified into three types, based on the lobes they innervate. γ neurons are born before the third-instar larval stage and form the adult γ lobe, which projects medially. α′/β′ neurons are born during the late third-instar larval stage and form the α′ and β′ lobes, which project dorsally and medially, respectively. α/β neurons are born during early pupal stages and form the α/β lobes, which project dorsally and medially, parallel to the α′ and β′ lobes. α/β lobes stain with FasII antibody staining, while γ and α′/β′ lobes are visualized using Trio antibody staining.</p><p>We performed immunostaining for either FasII or Trio combined with anti-GFP to label Lar&gt;GFP and Sns&gt;GFP in pupal and adult brains.

The Sns reporter is not expressed in larval KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). During the pupal phase, the Sns reporter is not expressed in α′/β′ KCs at any time and exhibits weak α/β KC expression only after lobe development has taken place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). MB-specific RNAi for <italic>Lar</italic> and <italic>sns</italic> showed that Lar acts in KC neurons, while Sns does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data show that Sns is likely to interact in <italic>trans</italic> with Lar in the MB system. Sns is expressed in larval neurons (MBONs) that have postsynaptic elements apposed to KC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Perhaps Sns expressed on these and/or other neurons contacted by KC axons acts as a guidance cue.</p><p>Lar binding to Sns may generate a stop signal for medial and β′ axons that prevents them from crossing the midline. β axons may cross the midline in <italic>Lar</italic> mutants or <italic>Lar/sns</italic> transhets because they follow β′ axons or they may independently require Sns for midline stopping. Pupal γ axons do not rely on Lar and Sns for midline stopping.</p><p>Interactions of Lar with Sns mediate a different response in dorsal lobe and α′ axons. In the absence of Lar and/or Sns, these axons fail to extend normally, and the larval dorsal and adult α/α′ lobes do not form. Neurons expressing Sns may act as guideposts that are required for normal extension of these axons. The α and α′ axons might respond separately to these cues or the α axons may exhibit phenotypes because they follow the α′ axons. Since some α′/β′ neurons are already present in larvae, adult MB phenotypes may derive from defects that occur during larval development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Sns is required in <italic>trans</italic> for Lar’s roles in R7 photoreceptor axon targeting</title><p>Lar is required for R7 photoreceptor axon targeting to the M6 layer of the medulla. In <italic>Lar</italic> mutants, most R7 axons extend to the correct target layer, but then retract, so that the final position of the R7 terminal is usually in the M3 layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clandinin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hofmeyer and Treisman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurel-Zaffran et al., 2001</xref>). Lar acts cell-autonomously in R7 photoreceptors to regulate targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurel-Zaffran et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with this, our Lar&gt;GFP reporter is expressed in photoreceptors during early pupal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The ligand(s) responsible for Lar’s actions in R7 axon targeting have not been identified. The IgSF domains of Lar are not required for R7 targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hofmeyer and Treisman, 2009</xref>). Syndecan binds to the IgSF domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox and Zinn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>), so it can be ruled out as the Lar ligand responsible for mediating R7 targeting. Furthermore, <italic>Sdc</italic> mutants have no R7 retraction phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rawson et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>More than 70% of R7 terminals in <italic>Lar/sns</italic> transhets show retraction to the M3 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We also observed a small number of R7 axon abnormalities upon pan-neuronal Sns RNAi knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not detect Sns&gt;GFP reporter expression in R7, and RNA sequencing studies showed that R7 does not express <italic>sns</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, Lar in R7s is likely to bind to Sns in <italic>trans</italic>, and our data suggest that Sns is the Lar ligand that controls R7 targeting. Sns-expressing neurons arborize in layer M5, but not in M6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sns expression in neurons projecting to M5 may provide cues that R7 terminals employ to remain in the M6 layer. R7 terminals are bulbous structures that begin in M5 and end in M6. Thus, Sns in M5-projecting neurons might adhere to R7 terminals and prevent R7 axons from retracting. C2 neurons, which project to layers M1 and M5, appear to express Sns&gt;GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). C2 could be the neuron, or one of the neurons, whose expression of Sns prevents R7 axons from retracting. C2 and R7 do not form synapses with each other.</p><p>C2 receives more synapses from the L1 lamina neuron than from any other neuron and also makes many synapses onto L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takemura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takemura et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Lar</italic> mRNA is expressed at some level in most neurons. However, RNA sequencing studies have shown that L1 neurons express <italic>Lar</italic> at particularly high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), and the Lar&gt;GFP reporter strongly labels L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). It is attractive to speculate that Lar-Sns interactions might be important for the formation of L1-C2 synaptic connections. <italic>kirre</italic> and <italic>rst</italic> are also expressed in L1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurmangaliyev et al., 2020</xref>). Sns in C2 could thus bind in <italic>trans</italic> to both Lar and Kirre/Rst in L1 neurons. <italic>kirre</italic> RNAi in all neurons did not result in any R7 axon phenotypes, suggesting that the Sns-Kirre interaction is not important for R7 innervation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolutionary conservation of the Lar–Sns interaction</title><p>Sns is a highly conserved CAM that has orthologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen, 2004</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of Sns, SYG-2, is expressed on guidepost epithelial cells, and its interactions with SYG-1 on the HSNL neuron initiate the process of synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>SYG-2</italic> and <italic>SYG-1</italic> mutants, components of the presynaptic active zone assembly do not localize properly. This phenotype is similar to that seen in <italic>SYD-2</italic> mutants. SYD-2 is the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of Liprin-α, which binds to Lar’s cytoplasmic domain. SYG-1/SYG-2 interactions recruit SYD-2 to the site of active zone assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patel et al., 2006</xref>), and SYD-2 is mislocalized in mutants for PTP-3, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Lar ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackley et al., 2005</xref>). These observations suggest a model of synapse formation in which SYG-1, SYG-2, PTP-3, and SYD-2 all act together at the site of synapse assembly.</p><p>The three mammalian Type IIa RPTPs (PTPRF, PTPRD, PTPRS) bind to an overlapping set of postsynaptic binding partners that are described in the ‘Introduction’ section.

Phenotypes caused by loss of Nephrin in the nervous system have not been defined since standard KOs are lethal due to kidney failure and conditional KOs have not been published. We speculate that Nephrin is a ligand for Type IIa RPTPs that is required for developmental processes controlled by these signaling receptors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

S2 cell expression vectors containing the ECDs of Sns, Hbs, Kirre, and Lar linked to AP<sub>5</sub> or Fc were obtained from the Özkan collection. These ECDs were also transferred into mammalian Fc and AP<sub>5</sub> expression vectors. To make Lar-mi3 and Kirre-mi3 particles, we produced versions of Lar-Fc and Kirre-Fc with C-terminal SpyTag3 sequences. These were expressed in Expi293 cells and purified using Ni-NTA chromatography (the proteins also have His tags). Each protein was coupled to mi3-SpyCatcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruun et al., 2018</xref>) at ratios such that most of the 60 SpyCatcher sites were coupled to a Lar-Fc-SpyTag3 chain. To make Nephrin, PTPRD, PTPRF, and PTPRS AP<sub>5</sub> and Fc fusion proteins, ECD regions of each were amplified by PCR from full-length cDNAs and moved into pCE2 and pCE14 expression vectors using Gateway Cloning. S2 cells were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ozkan et al., 2013</xref>. Expression was induced using 100 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> 24 hr after transfection, and supernatants (sups) containing fusion proteins were collected 3 days after induction. Sups were directly used at 1× concentration for ECIA assays and were concentrated 2–5× using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (30 kDa molecular weight cutoff) for use in embryo staining experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>ECIA</title><p>Each well of Nunc MaxiSorp 96-well plate was incubated with 50 μl of mouse anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) antibody (5 μg/ml in bicarbonate coupling buffer, pH 8.4) overnight at 4°C. Wells were washed in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) three times for 5 min each, followed by blocking in 2% BSA (in PBS) for 2 hr at room temperature. 50 μl Fc fusion proteins were added at 1× concentration for 3 hr at room temperature, followed by washes and blocking for 30 min. 50 μl AP<sub>5</sub> fusion proteins were added at 1× concentration, pre-clustered with mouse anti-human AP:biotin conjugated antibody (1:500, eBioscience) and incubated overnight at room temperature. Wells were washed in PBST, followed by incubation with streptavidin:HRP (1:500, 50 μl per well) for 30 min. Wells were washed and incubated with 1-Step Ultra TMB HRP substrate (50 μl per well, Thermo Fisher) for 30 min protected from light. The HRP reaction was stopped by adding 2 M phosphoric acid (50 μl per well), and absorbance was measured at 450 nM. For ECIA assays with mi3 particles, each well of Nunc MaxiSorp 96-well plate was incubated with 50 μl of 100 μg/ml streptavidin overnight at 4°C, followed by addition of 50 μl of AP<sub>5</sub> bait proteins (10 ng/μl) overnight at 4°C. Wells were blocked in 2% BSA (in PBS) for 2 hr at room temperature, followed by additional blocking in biotinylated BSA for 30 min and S2 cell conditioned medium for 30 min. mi3 particles or Fc fusion proteins (50 μl) were added at 10 ng/μl or 1× concentration (for S2 cell sups) and incubated overnight at room temperature. Wells were washed in PBST, followed by incubation with either mouse anti-LAR or mouse anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) antibodies. Wells were washed and incubated with goat anti-mouse: AP antibody, followed by incubation with BluePhos AP substrate reagent (50 μl) for 30 min protected from light. Absorbance was measured at 650 nM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Confocal imaging and image analysis</title><p>All images were captured using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope with either ×20 or ×40 objectives. NMJs were analyzed using a semi-automated macro in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nijhof et al., 2016</xref>). 1b and 1s boutons were separately outlined in confocal projections and separate analyses were performed on both kinds of boutons. Dlg immunostaining was used to separate 1b and 1s boutons as 1b boutons stain brightly with Dlg and 1s boutons have very weak Dlg signals. Brp punctae were also counted using the Fiji macro. For MB medial lobe, β and β′ lobe phenotypes, every confocal slice was individually analyzed for FasII-positive axons crossing the midline. For dorsal, α and α′ lobe phenotypes, confocal projections of the entire MB were analyzed for the presence or absence of lobes. For R7 photoreceptor targeting phenotype, R7 terminals in M6 layer were counted in at least 10 slices per OL with each slice being 5 μm apart. The number of R7 terminals in M6 layer was divided by the total number of R7 axons seen in M3 layer and above. Images were analyzed and processed using FIiji software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. For all experiments with the exception of MB phenotypes, statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc correction. MB phenotypes were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test, and each genotype was compared to every other genotype from the same experiment. Box and Whisker plots show 10–90 percentile whisker span. For embryo binding experiments, sample size was 8–10 embryos per genotype. For NMJ phenotypes, sample size was 30–60 NMJs per genotype. For larval MB phenotypes, sample size was 12–20 animals per genotype. For adult MB phenotypes, sample size was 20–30 animals per genotype. For OL phenotype, sample size was 10–12 OLs per genotype. Each experiment was repeated at least three times.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>H.K.L. performed the embryo GOF screen.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Much of the fabric of observations leading to the major conclusions here are based on transcriptional reporters of gene expression, with the underlying assumption that expression is equivalent to functional action. While that is often true, and correlates well with cell-type specific expression and knock-down experiments, the authors should highlight any remaining uncertainty, as the trans-heterozygous interactions do not address the site of action and RNAi can be weak. It would seem to be important to test the trans-cellular functional interaction a bit more thoroughly. For example, if Sns and Lar loss of function was combined using a LAR null het in combination with either CIS or TRANS RNAi for Sns, we would predict that the MB or Optic lobe genetic interaction would have very clear cell-type specificity.</p><p>2) The authors should test whether Lar can interact with Hbs.

This raises the question of what a strong Sns looks like in key contexts where similar phenotypes are used as evidence of requisite ligand-receptor pathway function.

As suggested, we performed <italic>cis</italic> RNAi for Sns in combination with a Lar null het (<italic>Lar<sup>13.2</sup>/+</italic>) and analyzed phenotypes at the larval and adult mushroom body (MB). We used a mushroom body specific GAL4 driver (OK107) to drive RNAi for either Lar or Sns in all neurons of the mushroom body. We confirmed specificity of the OK107-GAL4 line by driving UAS-EGFP reporter expression driven by OK107-GAL4 in both larval and adult brains. Lar knockdown in all MB neurons resulted in medial lobe fusion in ~50% animals in the larval MB, and β’ lobe fusion in ~75% animals in the adult MB, suggesting that Lar acts cell autonomously in MB neurons, consistent with the observation that Lar is expressed in Kenyon cells. Sns knockdown specifically in MB neurons, however, did not result in any MB phenotypes, consistent with a <italic>trans</italic> role of Sns in the MB. A combination of a Lar null het (<italic>Lar<sup>13.2</sup>/+</italic>) and <italic>cis</italic> RNAi for Sns using OK107-GAL4, also did not result in any MB phenotypes. Pan-neuronal RNAi for Sns did result in ~50% β’ lobes fused across the midline in the adult MB. These new data, along with our existing data on expression patterns of Lar and Sns in the larval and adult MB, clearly show that Lar and Sns act in <italic>trans</italic> in the larval and adult MB, with Lar acting cell autonomously in MB neurons and Sns functioning in a non-MB neuronal population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should test whether Lar can interact with Hbs. If so, then genetic assays should be used to look for common functions between Lar and hbs.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the suggested experiments and have included the new data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We tested whether Lar and Hbs, and Lar and Kirre, bind to each other using our in vitro ECIA assay. Using a LAR-Fc fusion protein, we did not detect any binding between either LAR-Fc and HBS-AP fusion proteins, or between LAR-Fc and Kirre-AP fusion proteins. We observed a three-fold increase in binding between LAR-Fc and SNS-AP fusion proteins above background. As expected, we observed strong binding between Kirre-Fc and HBS-AP fusion proteins. This strong binding interaction between Hbs and Kirre has been previously reported. Since we did not observe any in vitro binding between Lar and Hbs, we did not proceed with genetic analyses of their interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Use a second sns allele or a deficiency to confirm the transheterozygous interaction with Lar.</p></disp-quote><p>We had already mentioned in the Results section of the manuscript that we had performed genetic interactions between <italic>Lar</italic> and <italic>sns</italic> using an <italic>sns</italic> deficiency line as well, in addition to using the reported <italic>sns</italic> null allele. However, as requested, we have included these transheterozygous data using the <italic>Sns<sup>Df</sup></italic> line in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2. We observed similar phenotypes at the larval NMJ and larval MB using <italic>Lar<sup>13.2</sup>/sns<sup>Df</sup></italic> transhets, as observed using <italic>Lar<sup>13.2</sup>/sns<sup>xb3</sup></italic> and <italic>Lar<sup>451</sup>/sns<sup>xb3</sup></italic> transhets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Test whether knocking down sns in all neurons or in neurons such as C2 that project to the M5 layer disrupts R7 targeting (see below too)</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed Sns RNAi knockdown experiments using either pan-neuronal RNAi (elav-GAL4) or a C2-specific driver (Tuthill 2017). While we did not observe a significant R7 retraction phenotype upon pan-neuronal Sns knockdown, we did observe abnormalities in R7 innervation in the M6 layer. These included abnormal R7 innervation of neighboring columns, as well as a low number of R7 retractions. We have included examples of these phenotypes in Figure 8—figure supplement 1. However, the R7 phenotypes did not reach statistical significance. Sns knockdown specifically in C2 neurons using a C2-specific driver, did not result in any obvious R7 phenotypes. This is probably due to the fact that the C2 driver is a split-GAL4 driver that is much weaker than the strong pan-neuronal Elav-GAL4 driver. Alternatively, it might indicate that Sns acts in some other additional neuronal population in the optic lobe (OL) to generate the R7 phenotypes. Since Sns is expressed in several different OL neuronal types, it would be difficult to speculate at this time which Sns-expressing OL neuronal population is responsible for the R7 phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given the many phenotypes of Sns mutants, the authors are restricted to use of partial or conditional loss of function (LOF) in this study. This raises the question of what a strong Sns looks like in key contexts where similar phenotypes are used as evidence of requisite ligand-receptor pathway function. For this reason, in one of the contexts, it would be very helpful if the authors could use MARCM technology to show what complete loss of Sns looks like in the class of neurons that appear to selectively require its function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting and important to find out the effects of complete loss of Sns, we were unable to perform MARCM analyses of Sns in the MB and OL due to the fact that we do not yet know the specific neuronal populations where Sns acts in both of these contexts. We have confirmed that Sns does not act in MB neurons based on MB-specific Sns RNAi. Moreover, since Sns is not expressed in any photoreceptor neurons at any developmental stage, it is unlikely that Sns acts in these neurons in the OL. Thus, we would not expect to see any phenotypes in the MB and OL if we were to perform MARCM analyses using MB specific or photoreceptor-specific Sns clones. We already observe very strong phenotypes at the larval NMJ upon neuronal Sns knockdown. The NMJ phenotypes upon Sns knockdown are as strong as Lar knockdown. Moreover, since Sns is expressed in motor neurons and not in larval muscles, and we observe NMJ phenotypes upon neuronal knockdown of Sns, we can conclude that Sns acts in motor neurons at the larval NMJs. Thus, we do not anticipate gaining much additional insight into Sns’s actions at the NMJ by performing motor neuron-specific MARCM analysis of Sns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Test whether rst or kirre mutations affect NMJ size, MB development, or R7 projections.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed <italic>kirre</italic> RNAi analyses at the larval NMJ, larval and adult MB and adult OL. We have included these additional data in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1. We could not use a <italic>kirre</italic> null allele, since <italic>kirre</italic> null animals do not survive to third instar larval stages, similar to <italic>sns</italic> null animals. Neuronal knockdown of Kirre using Elav-GAL4 did not result in any abnormalities in either 1b or 1s bouton numbers, NMJ area, length or branch numbers at the 7/6 NMJ (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Pan-neuronal Kirre knockdown also did not result in any abnormalities in either the medial lobe or the dorsal lobes of the larval MB (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Similarly, the adult MB was also morphologically normal upon Kirre knockdown in all neurons. The α/β, α’/β’ and the γ lobes of the adult MB were not different from controls (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We also looked at R7 projections in the adult OL upon Kirre RNAi knockdown and did not observe any obvious R7 phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A relatively easy test of whether Sns is acting as a Lar ligand would be to express sns RNAi in a Lar null mutant background. If Sns acts by binding to Lar, its knockdown should not increase the severity of the phenotype. (Of course, this only provides a genetic test of the pathway hypothesis, and could also be used to test relative tissue-specificity of the functional contribution. Strictly speaking, it will not directly test the Ligand-Receptor binding hypothesis; something that is very hard to test in vivo without mutations that disrupt binding in vitro and function in vivo.)</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed this experiment and included the new data in Figure 3—figure supplement 2. We performed this experiment in the context of the larval NMJ, as the <italic>Lar</italic> null phenotype at the NMJ is ~50% penetrant. On the other hand, the <italic>Lar</italic> null phenotypes at the MB and OL are ~70-90% penetrant. The high penetrance of <italic>Lar</italic> null phenotypes in the MB and OL would make it difficult to conclude the contribution of adding Sns RNAi in these contexts. We used a combination of two <italic>Lar</italic> alleles which gives a slightly lower penetrance at the larval NMJ (<italic>Lar<sup>13.2</sup>/Lar<sup>2127</sup></italic>). This <italic>Lar</italic> null combination shows ~40-50% reduction in 1b NMJ area, number of boutons, NMJ length, longest branch length and number of branches at the 7/6 NMJ, compared to ~65% reduction seen with <italic>Lar<sup>13.2</sup>/Lar<sup>451</sup></italic>. Since the NMJ phenotype seen in <italic>Lar<sup>13.2</sup>/Lar<sup>2127</sup></italic> nulls is not too strong, if Sns and Lar are acting in separate pathways, we would expect the severity of this phenotype to increase upon addition of Sns RNAi. Consistent with our other observations, we did not observe an increase in the severity of the NMJ phenotype upon adding neuronal RNAi knockdown of Sns to <italic>Lar<sup>13.2</sup>/Lar<sup>2127</sup></italic> mutants. <italic>Lar<sup>13.2</sup>/Lar<sup>2127</sup></italic>; elav-GAL4&gt;UAS-Sns RNAi animals also show ~40-50% reduction in all 1b NMJ parameters. These observations strongly point towards Lar and Sns acting in the same genetic pathway at the larval NMJ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
