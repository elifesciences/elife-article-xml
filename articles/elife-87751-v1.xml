Seasonal changes in photoperiodic information acts to entrain endogenous programs in physiology to optimize an animal’s fitness. Attempts to identify the neural and molecular substrates of photoperiodic time measurement in birds have, to date, focused on blunt changes in light exposure during a restricted period of photoinducibility. The objectives of these studies were first to characterize a molecular seasonal clock in Japanese quail and second, to identify the key transcripts involved in endogenously generated interval timing that underlies photosensitivity in birds. We hypothesized that the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) provides the neuroendocrine control of photoperiod-induced changes in reproductive physiology, and that the pars distalis of the pituitary gland contains an endogenous internal timer for the short photoperiod-dependent development of reproductive photosensitivity. Here, we report distinct seasonal waveforms of transcript expression in the MBH, and pituitary gland and discovered the patterns were not synchronized across tissues. Follicle-stimulating hormone-β (<italic>FSHβ</italic>) expression increased during the simulated spring equinox, prior to photoinduced increases in prolactin, thyrotropin-stimulating hormone-β, and testicular growth. Diurnal analyses of transcript expression showed sustained elevated levels of <italic>FSHβ</italic> under conditions of the spring equinox, compared to autumnal equinox, short (&lt;12L) and long (&gt;12L) photoperiods. <italic>FSHβ</italic> expression increased in quail held in non-stimulatory short photoperiod, indicative of the initiation of an endogenously programmed interval timer. These data identify that FSHβ establishes a state of photosensitivity for the external coincidence timing of seasonal physiology. The independent regulation of FSHβ expression provides an alternative pathway through which other supplementary environmental cues, such as temperature, can fine tune seasonal reproductive maturation and involution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Japanese quail</kwd><kwd>bird</kwd><kwd>avian</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RL-2019-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stevenson</surname><given-names>Tyler</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular analyses reveal the neuroendocrine control of seasonal life-history transitions in birds.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Seasonal rhythms in reproduction are ubiquitous in plants and animals. In birds, the annual change in daylength, referred to as photoperiod, provides an initial predictive environmental cue to time seasonal physiology and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ball, 1993</xref>). Temperature, nutrient availability, and social cues act as supplementary cues that function to fine tune the timing of breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wingfield and Farner, 1980</xref>). Seasonal timing of reproductive physiology and breeding requires the integration of both environmental cues and endogenously generated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gwinner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wingfield, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helm and Stevenson, 2014</xref>). Even in the absence of seasonal fluctuations in daylength, temperature, and food availability, endogenous circannual cycles in migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gwinner and Dittami, 1990</xref>), hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pengelley and Fisher, 1957</xref>), and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woodfill et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lincoln et al., 2006</xref>) are maintained with remarkable temporal precision. Other endogenous timing mechanisms include interval timers that are programmed to establish a physiological state in anticipation of the next season, such as flowering in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duncan et al., 2015</xref>) and the photorefractory state in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prendergast et al., 2001</xref>). The anatomical and cellular basis of endogenous programs that time seasonal transitions in biology remain poorly characterized, but current evidence indicates that, in mammals, circannual time may reside in pituitary lactotropes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lincoln et al., 2006</xref>) and thyrotropes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wood et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In most long-lived species (e.g., &gt;2 years), the annual change in photoperiod acts to entrain endogenous annual programs to time transitions in physiological state to seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradshaw and Holzapfel, 2007</xref>). In many temperate-zone birds, exposure to long days (&gt;12 hr), induces a photostimulated state in which gonadal development occurs in male and female birds. Short photoperiods (e.g., &lt;12 hr) can induce gonadal involution in both sexes leading to a reproductively regressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dawson et al., 2001</xref>). Birds become reproductively sensitive to stimulatory long photoperiods only after experiencing short photoperiods for at least 10 days, in which a photosensitive state is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dawson et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In most birds, reptiles, and amphibians, annual changes in daylength are detected by photoreceptors located in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pérez et al., 2019</xref>). Stimulatory long photoperiods trigger a molecular cascade that starts with the upregulation of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone-β (<italic>TSHβ</italic>) subunit in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland and results in gonadal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakao et al., 2008</xref>). The current gap in our knowledge is how short days (i.e., &lt;12 hr) induce gonadal involution, and how prolonged exposure to short days stimulates endogenous programs that sensitizes the brain to respond, at a molecular level, to stimulatory long days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Follett and Sharp, 1969</xref>). Previous studies in European starlings (<italic>Sturnus vulgaris</italic>) demonstrated that exposure to short days increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (<italic>GNRH</italic>) expression in the preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stevenson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stevenson et al., 2012a</xref>). As both GnRH and gonadal growth increased in the absence of stimulatory long daylengths, another cellular pathway must also be involved in the endogenous development of reproductive physiology in birds.</p><p>There were three objectives of the present work. First, we aimed to characterize the photoperiod-induced seasonal molecular clock in the MBH and pituitary gland in Japanese quail. Then, we examined the daily waveform of multiple transcripts in the MBH and pituitary in birds from stimulatory long photoperiod (16L:8D), inhibitory short photoperiod (8L:16D), and the two equinoxes. The last objective was to determine if follicle-stimulating hormone-β (<italic>FSHβ</italic>) expression in the pituitary gland was upregulated after prolonged exposure to short photoperiods. We theorized multiple neuroendocrine regions including the preoptic area, MBH, and pituitary cells are independently involved in the timing of seasonal transitions in physiology. Specifically, we hypothesized that pituitary gonadotropes establish a state of photosensitivity to stimulatory long day photoperiods and thus act as calendar cells that provide endogenous timing of gonadal growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular characterization of the photoperiod-induced seasonal clock</title><p>To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the seasonal molecular changes in the MBH and pituitary gland, we collected MBH and pituitary gland samples from Japanese quail using an experimental paradigm that aimed to maximize resolution (i.e., high sampling frequency), high dimensionality (i.e., advanced nucleic acid sequencing), and robust statistical power (i.e., large sample sizes). Our experimental design simulated the photoperiodic regulation of seasonal physiology of Japanese quail, using sequential changes of an autumnal decrease, followed by a spring increase in daylength and measured testes volume, body mass, and abdominal fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As anticipated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Follett and Sharp, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robinson and Follett, 1982</xref>), light phases that exceed the critical daylength (i.e., &gt;12 hr) resulted in robust gonadal growth. Increases in body mass and abdominal fat deposition were delayed until the spring increase in daylengths reached 10 hr (10v) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). EdgeR analyses, of MBH sequences obtained using Minion, identified 1481 transcripts were differentially expressed (p &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>), and BioDare2.0 established 398 have rhythmic patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2 fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 1–3</xref>).

EdgeR analyses identified 3090 transcripts were differentially expressed in the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). DAVID gene ontology analyses identified that gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor and epidermal growth factor pathways are consistently observed across photoperiodic transitions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>). BioDare2.0 established that 130 transcripts were rhythmically expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref>). A remarkable 96.5% (384/398) of MBH transcripts show a photoperiod-induced spiked patterned and only 12/14 remaining transcripts displayed sine waveforms. Conversely, 100% of pituitary transcripts conformed to sine (124/130) or cosine (6/130) waveforms. The predominant rhythmic patterns of expression likely reflect endogenous long-term molecular programs, characteristic of calendar cell function.</p><p>Lastly, we examined <italic>GNRH</italic> expression to delineate photoperiod-induced changes in the neuroendocrine control of reproductive physiology. <italic>GNRH</italic> expression in the preoptic area was temporarily decreased during the 8L short photoperiod indicating another nucleus-specific cellular timer is present in this brain region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, the pituitary showed a distinct transcriptomic profile compared to the MBH suggesting independence in the representation of seasonal photoperiodic timing. The spring photoperiodic transition from 8L to 12v resulted in a significant increase in <italic>FSHβ</italic> without a change in tanycyte restructuring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Subsequent transition to 14v and then 16v resulted in the upregulation of prolactin (<italic>PRL</italic>) and <italic>TSHβ</italic>, respectively.

The scale-free topology and mean sample independence was assessed to determine a soft-threshold of 5 for both MBH and the pituitary gland sequencing datasets. Ten modules were identified for the MBH, and the pituitary gene set was grouped into 22 modules. Of these modules there were 6 significant module–trait relationships in the MBH. There was one module with a significant negative correlation with fat score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata6">Figure 1—source data 6</xref>). Forty-four transcripts were identified to be significant in the negative relation for fat score.

Overall, there were 23 transcripts that were significant and overlapped with photoperiod, testes width, and testes volume. The other module found 70 transcripts for both body mass and fat score. Despite several modules showing trends toward significance, only one module for body mass was positively related in the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Association plots show no overlap in DNA-binding motifs between MBH and pituitary transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) suggesting tissue-specific transcription-binding factor regulation. Within the pituitary gland, several common transcription factors, such as the Jun proto-oncogene, Spi1 proto-oncogene, and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (<italic>MEF2a</italic>) might be actively involved in the photoperiodic regulation of transcript expression.

The data reported herein demonstrate that photoperiods less than 12 hr light induce gonadal involution. Prolonged exposure to short photoperiods (i.e., 8) were found to significantly increase <italic>DIO3</italic> expression and vimentin immunoreactivity in the median eminence. Increased <italic>DIO3</italic> expression and innervation of tanycytes occurred after gonadal regression suggesting that another unidentified mechanism is involved in the initiation of the termination in the breeding state. The gradual increase in photoperiods during the spring transition was found to be associated with a marked increase in <italic>FSHβ</italic> expression in the pars distalis while lower levels of <italic>TSHβ</italic> expression in the pars tuberalis were maintained. As photoperiods increase there is a steady elevation in <italic>FSHβ</italic> expression, but vimentin immunoreactivity in the median eminence did not decline until after the critical daylength for photostimulation (i.e., 12L:12D) thus the release of FSH is prevented as daylengths are below the critical threshold.

Although the present study did not directly examine photoinduction, <italic>TSHβ</italic> expression was consistently elevated in long day photoperiod (i.e., 16L). The patterns of expression suggest that stimulatory daylengths longer than 12 hr induce thyrotropes to increase <italic>TSHβ</italic> leading to a cascade of molecular events in the MBH that permit GnRH to stimulate gonadotropes to release FSHβ and initiate gonadal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshimura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamamura et al., 2004</xref>). Note that other pituitary cell types, somatotropes and corticotropes do not appear to show any molecular switches across the photoperiodic phases. These findings uncover a two-component mechanism for the cellular basis of the external coincidence model for the avian photoperiodic response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Increase <italic>FSHβ</italic> expression establishes a state of photosensitivity to stimulatory daylength, and <italic>TSHβ</italic> thryotropes in the pars tuberalis monitor daylength and when light stimulation occurs during a period of photoinducibility, initiate gonadal development. The two-component model is exciting as it accommodates evidence for endogenous growth of quail gonads in the absence of photostimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Follett and Sharp, 1969</xref>). Moreover, a TSH<italic>-</italic>independent programmed change in <italic>FSHβ</italic> expression addresses how seasonal rhythms in tropical, non-photoperiod birds can be regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gwinner and Dittami, 1990</xref>).</p><p>The photoperiodic induction of gonadal growth in quail is dependent on circadian timing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Follett and Sharp, 1969</xref>).

Similarly, E-box elements are only identified in the proximal promoter of <italic>EYA3</italic>. The presence of E- and D-boxes provides a clear molecular mechanism by which the circadian clock can control the long photoperiod-induced expression of these highly photoperiodic genes. Conversely, <italic>FSHβ</italic> expression did not show diurnal variation and instead maintained constitutive expression across long (16L:8D), short (8L:16D), and the ‘equinox’ (12L:12D) photoperiodic conditions. We used a broad, unbiased bioinformatic approach to identify putative transcriptional bindings sites that may regulate <italic>FSHβ</italic> expression. We identified several potential transcriptional binding proteins and <italic>MEF2</italic> motifs were observed across multiple promoters of genes for transcripts in the pars distalis and pars nervosa of the pituitary gland. However, functional analyses are necessary to establish a causal link between these newly identified signaling pathways (e.g., MEF2) and the seasonal regulation of transcript expression.</p><p>The high-dimensionality and high-frequency analyses of seasonal transition in physiology used in this study, facilitated the ability to uncover that photoperiod differentially regulates two endocrine systems: reproduction and energy balance. <italic>POMC</italic> has well-described roles in the neuroendocrine regulation of food intake and body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yeo and Heisler, 2012</xref>).

In most temperate breeding males, full reproductive development can be achieved in response to photoperiod cues. The robust change in gonadal growth and involution provides a powerful approach to identify the key neuroendocrine mechanisms that govern the avian photoperiodic response. Despite ovarian changes in response to photoperiodic manipulations, female birds generally require other supplemental cues (e.g., temperature, social cues) to attain full reproductive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wingfield, 1980</xref>). In female, white-crowned sparrows (<italic>Zonotrichia leucophrys</italic>), increased photoperiod induces ovarian development to a pre-breeding state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farner et al., 1966</xref>), and supplementary cues, such as temperature, can modify ovarian growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wingfield et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wingfield et al., 2003</xref>).

As the initial predictive environmental cue (i.e., photoperiod) times reproduction similarly in both male and female birds, the data provided in this paper provides key insights into the fundamental mechanisms that govern transitions in the hypothalamo-pituitary control of reproduction. However, studies that seek to understand how supplementary cues (e.g., temperature) are integrated to fine tune the timing of reproduction will require a focus on female birds.</p><p>In conclusion, these studies provide a comprehensive transcriptome dataset that can facilitate ecological studies that seek to uncover the molecular substrates which environmental cues, such as temperature, impact phenological timing and mistiming in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Visser and Gienapp, 2019</xref>). The observation for photoperiod-independent regulation of <italic>FSHβ</italic> expression provides a new cellular mechanism in which supplementary environmental cues, such as temperature, can regulate the timing of seasonal reproduction. For example, the marked population differences in Great tit laying dates in Corsica, despite similar daylength cues, might be driven by local temperatures cues acting on <italic>FSHβ</italic> expression to advance, or delay follicular maturation. Overall, the data indicate a multi-cellular, multi-neural interval timing mechanism resides in the brain and has significant implications for understanding species-specific seasonal transitions in life histories.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All Japanese quail were provided by Moonridge Farms, Exeter United Kingdom (moonridgefarms.co.uk).

To mimic the autumnal decline and subsequent spring increase in the annual photoperiodic cycle, birds were exposure to a sequential change in daylength from 16L (16a), to 14L (14a), to 12L (12a), to 10L (10a), to 8L, then back to 10L (10v), to 12L (12v), to 14L (14v), and lastly 16L (16v) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Each photoperiod treatment lasted for 2 weeks to minimize the impact of photoperiodic history effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stevenson et al., 2012a</xref>). At the end of each photoperiodic treatment a subset of quail (<italic>n</italic> = 12) body mass was used as a measure to pseudo randomly select birds for tissue collection and served to reduce the potential for unintentional bias. Birds were killed by cervical dislocation followed by jugular cut. A jugular blood sample was collected in 50 µl heparinized tubes (Workhardt, UK) and stored at −20°C. Brain and pituitary stalk were rapidly dissected, frozen on powdered dry ice and stored at −80°C. Testes were dissected and weighed to the nearest 0.001 g using the Sartorius microbalance (Sartorius, Germany). The length and width of the testes were measured using callipers and volumes were calculated using the equation for a spheroid (4/3 × 3.14 × [<italic>L</italic>/2] × [<italic>W</italic>/2]2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">King et al., 1997</xref>).

The scale range is 0–5, which 0 is no visible fat and 5 indicates bulging fat bodies are present.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Study 2 – daily rhythms in molecular profiles during solstices and equinoxes</title><p>To investigate the daily molecular representation of summer- and winter-like solstices and the autumnal and spring equinoxes, Japanese quail (<italic>N</italic> = 188) were subjected to the same photoperiodic treatments described in Study 1. A subset of quail was pseudo randomly selected after the autumnal 12L:12D (<italic>n</italic> = 47), short day 8L:16D (<italic>n</italic> = 48), spring 12L:12D (<italic>n</italic> = 46), and long day 16L:8D (<italic>n</italic> = 47) treatment conditions. For each of the four photoperiodic treatment conditions, five to six birds were collected shortly after lights on (Zeitgeber time (zt) 0), and then every 3 hr for 24-hr period. This resulted in a high-frequency daily sampling period that included zt0, zt3, zt6, zt9, zt12, zt15, zt18, and zt21. Brain, pituitary gland, and liver were extracted and stored at −80°C.

A subset of quail was killed by decapitation followed by exsanguination and established the photoregressed 8L group (<italic>n</italic> = 6). A subset of birds (<italic>n</italic> = 6) was maintained in short day photoperiods for four more weeks (8Lext). This group of birds provided the ability to examine whether an endogenous increase in <italic>FSHβ</italic> expression would occur in constant short day photoperiod condition. The other twelve birds were transitioned to the 10L:14D (10v) light treatment for 2 weeks and another subset of birds were collected (<italic>n</italic> = 6). The last subset of birds was transitioned to 12L:12D (12v) for 2 weeks and were then killed (<italic>n</italic> = 6). For all birds, the brain and pituitary glands were dissected and immediately frozen in dry ice and then placed at −80°C. This experimental design provided the ability to examine endogenous changes in pituitary cell function via the 8Lext group, and the photoinduced increase in photosensitivity (i.e., 10v and 12v).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Hypothalamic and pituitary dissection</title><p>During brain extraction the pituitary stalk was severed. The procedure leaves pituitary gland components of the pars intermedia, pars distalis, and pars nervosa resting in the sphenoid bone.

Some of these changes, however, can begin to occur before the day length threshold is reached, suggesting that short days similarly have the capacity to alter aspects of phenotype. This study seeks to understand the mechanisms by which short days can accomplish this task, which is an interesting and important question in the field of organismal biology and endocrinology.</p><p>The set of studies that this manuscript presents is comprehensive and well-controlled. Many of the effects are also strong and thus offer tantalizing hints about the endo-molecular basis by which short days might stimulate major changes in body condition. Another strength is that the authors put together a compelling model for how different facets of an animal's reproductive state come &quot;on line&quot; as day length increases and spring approaches. In this way, I think the authors broadly fulfill their aims.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87751.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Majumdar</surname><given-names>Gaurav</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03vrx7m55</institution-id><institution>University of Allahabad</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Prayagraj</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liddle</surname><given-names>Timothy A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00vtgdb53</institution-id><institution>University of Glasgow</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Glasgow</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Calum</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00vtgdb53</institution-id><institution>University of Glasgow</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Glasgow</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00vtgdb53</institution-id><institution>University of Glasgow</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Glasgow</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bain</surname><given-names>Maureen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00vtgdb53</institution-id><institution>University of Glasgow</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Glasgow</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stevenson</surname><given-names>Tyler</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00vtgdb53</institution-id><institution>University of Glasgow</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Glasgow</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Editorial comments:</bold></p><p>Comment 1 - Recommendations for the authors: please note that you control which revisions to undertake from the public reviews and recommendations for the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the feedback from the 3 Reviewers and Editor. We have enumerated each Reviewer comment and provide a detailed response. We endeavoured to include each suggestion into the revised manuscript. All changes in the manuscript are indicated in red font. In instances in which we respectfully disagree with the Reviewer, we have provided a fair rebuttal. We feel the comments from the Reviewers has significantly improved the clarity and quality of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2 - The revision process has demonstrated the value of your work, highlighting both its strengths and shortcomings. Importantly, it provides detailed and achievable suggestions for improving the current version of your contribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers and Editor for their time and expert input on our manuscript. We feel the suggestions from the Reviewers to address the shortcomings has resulted in a significantly improved manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3 - There is a general consensus among the reviewers on three key aspects. Firstly, the article would greatly benefit from a clearer layout of the experimental design and methodology, potentially including schematics to help readers comprehend the complexity and details of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the feedback from Reviewer 2 in particular. We have added a new schematic for Experiment 3 (see PUBLIC REVIEWS Reviewer #2 Comment 2). We have also revised the Results section by including subheadings and additional text to help explain the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4 - Secondly, conducting a more comprehensive analysis of the available dataset, utilizing tools such as WGCNA to explore gene co-expression networks beyond specific genes, is recommended. Additionally, it is advised to exercise greater caution when discussing the limitations of the employed methods.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggestion for the WGCNA is excellent and very much appreciated. The revised manuscript includes WGCNA for both the MBH and pituitary gland.

The authors simulated photoperiod to attain winter and summer-like physiology and samples of neural tissues at spring, and autumn life-history states, daily rhythms in transcripts in solstices and equinox, and lastly studies FSHb transcripts in the pituitary. The experiments are based on a series of changes in photoperiod and gave some interesting results. The experiment did not have a control for no change in photoperiod so it seems possible that endogenous rhythms could be another aspect of seasonal rhythms that lack in this study. The short-day group does not explain the endogenous seasonal response.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the fair assessment of the manuscript. The statement ‘the experiment did not have a control for no change in photoperiod’ is not clear to us. We think the Reviewer is arguing that prolonged constant photoperiod was not conducted to examine circannual timing in avian reproduction. The constant short photoperiod in Exp3 does provide the ability to examine the initial stages of interval timing. A different endogenous mechanism used by animals. The revised manuscript has clarified the different physiological responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2 - The manuscript would benefit from further clarity in synthesizing different sections. Additionally, there are some instances of unclear language and numerous typos throughout the manuscript. A thorough revision is recommended, including addressing sentence structure for improved clarity, reframing sentences where necessary, correcting typos, conducting a grammar check, and enhancing overall writing clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated the suggestions from both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 that aimed to increase the clarity of the manuscript. We have provided detailed responses to each comment below and state how each comment was incorporated in the revised manuscript. We also had the manuscript reviewed by a colleague to help identify issues associated with sentence structure, grammar, and spelling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3 - Data analysis needs more clarity particularly how transcriptome data explains different physiological measures across seasonal life-history states. It seems the discussion is built around a few genes that have been studied in other published literature on quail seasonal response. Extending results on the promotor of DEGs and building discussion is an extrapolating discussion on limited evidence and seems redundant.</p></disp-quote><p>A new statistical analysis (ie., WGCNA) was conducted to identify relations between photoperiod, physiology and transcripts. The focus on the few photoperiodic gene was kept in the discussion as the transcript expression is important to highlight the differences from the prevailing hypotheses and novel patterns of expression across seasonal timescales. (See Figures S3 &amp; Table S6 and lines 166-182; 497-505).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4 - Last, I wondered if it would be possible to add an ecological context for the frequent change in the photoperiod schedule and not take account of the endogenous annual response. Adding discussion on ecological relevance would make more sense.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. The introduction and discussion were substantially revised to include the ecological relevance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Comment 1 - This study is carefully designed and well executed, including a comprehensive suite of endpoint measures and large sample sizes that give confidence in the results. I have a few general comments and suggestions that the authors might find helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewers support for our manuscript. We have endeavoured to incorporate all suggestions in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2 - I found it difficult to fully grasp the experimental design, including the length of light treatment in the three different experiments (which appears to extend from 2 weeks up to 8 weeks). A graphical description of the experimental design along a timeline would be very helpful to the reader. I suggest adding the respective sample sizes to such a graphic, because this information is currently also difficult to keep track of.</p></disp-quote><p>We have created a new figure panel to address the Reviewer’s concern. See figure S4 panel ‘a’. The new schematic representation was designed to illustrate the similarity in experimental design used in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. But clearly illustrates the extended short photoperiod manipulation (4 weeks and not 8 weeks). We added the sample sizes to initial drafts but felt the added text hindered the clarity of the schematic representation (particularly for Fig1a). The sample sizes for each experiment and treatment are provided in the raw data provided in the supplementary Table 1. For this reason, we have opted to not add the sample size to each diagram. We hope that the Reviewer will understand our perspective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3 - The authors use a lot of terminology that is second nature to a chronobiologist but may be difficult for the general reader to keep track of. For example, what is the difference between &quot;photoinducibility&quot; and &quot;photosensitivity&quot;? Similarly, &quot;vernal&quot; and &quot;autumnal&quot; should be briefly explained at the outset, or maybe simply say &quot;spring equinox&quot; and &quot;fall equinox.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very helpful suggestion, and we thank the Reviewer. Two changes were made to the manuscript to address this comment. First, we revised the second introductory paragraph to describe the photoperiodic response and the terms used. Second, we have removed all reference to ‘vernal’ and replaced with ‘spring’. We opted to keep ‘autumn’ as the change to ‘fall’ did not provide the clarity of seasonal state in some statements (as fall is also used as a downward direction).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4 What was the rationale for using only male birds in this study? The authors may want to include a brief discussion on whether the expected results for females might be similar to or different from what they found in males, and why.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer’s position that studies should include, or least describe, male and female biology. We have revised the text to address this comment. In the methods, we provide 2 sentences that state the photoperiodic response is the same for both male and females, and why males were selected. See lines (352-355). Then, in the discussion, we describe why females will be important to study how other supplementary environmental cues impact seasonal timing of reproduction. See lines (312-330; and 334-339).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5 - The authors used the Bonferroni correction method to account for multiple hypothesis testing of measures of testes mass, body mass, fat score, vimentin immunoreactivity and qPCR analyses in Study 1. I don't think Bonferroni is ever appropriate for biological data: these methods assume that all variables are independent of each other, an assumption that is almost never warranted in biology. In fact, the data show clear relationships between these endpoint measures. Alternatively, one might use Benjamini-Hochberg's FDR correction or various methods for calculating the corrected alpha level.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern is not clear to us. The Benjamini-Hochberg’s FDR is a slight modification of the Bonferroni correction. Moreover, the FDR is a less-stringent statistical test compared to the Bonferroni correction. We prefer to keep the Bonferroni approach to correct for multiple tests for two reasons. First, this test is commonly used in the field of chronobiology, and second, the Bonferroni correction is more conservative. We hope the Reviewer will appreciate our perspective to be consistent with the research field and higher stringency in our statistical approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6 - The graphical interpretations of the results shown in Figure 1n and Figure 3e, along with the hypothesized working model shown in Figure S5, might best be combined into a single figure that becomes part of the Discussion. As is, I do not think these interpretative graphics (which are well done and super helpful!) are appropriate for the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion. During the revision we developed a single figure to show the graphical representation for the respective experiments. Unfortunately, we found the single source to be very difficult to provide a clear description and overview of the findings. We feel that the interpretations, (admittedly unusual for Results section) are best placed in the respective figures that correspond to the different experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Comment 1a - It is well known that as seasonal day length increases, molecular cascades in the brain are triggered to ready an individual for reproduction. Some of these changes, however, can begin to occur before the day length threshold is reached, suggesting that short days similarly have the capacity to alter aspects of phenotype. This study seeks to understand the mechanisms by which short days can accomplish this task, which is an interesting and important question in the field of organismal biology and endocrinology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their positive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1b - The set of studies that this manuscript presents is comprehensive and well-controlled. Many of the effects are also strong and thus offer tantalizing hints about the endo-molecular basis by which short days might stimulate major changes in body condition. Another strength is that the authors put together a compelling model for how different facets of an animal's reproductive state come &quot;on line&quot; as day length increases and spring approaches. In this way, I think the authors broadly fulfill their aims.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the positive support of our research and manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1c - I do, however, also think that there are a few weaknesses that the authors should consider, or that readers should consider when evaluating this manuscript. First, some of the molecular genetic analyses should be interpreted with greater caution. By bioinformatically showing that certain DNA motifs exist within a gene promoter (e.g., FSHbeta), one is not generating robust evidence that corresponding transcription factors actually regulate the expression of the gene in question. In fact, some may argue that this line of evidence only offers weak support for such a conclusion. I appreciate that actually running the laboratory experiments necessary to generate strong support for these types of conclusions is not trivial, and doing so may even be impossible. I would therefore suggest a clear admission of these limitations in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer’s position. The transcription binding protein analyses was used as a means to identify potential factors involved in the regulation of transcript expression. We have written a new paragraph to address this comment. In the discussion, we that highlight the links between the well characterised circadian regulation of photoperiodic transcripts (e.g, D- &amp; E-box elements and the photoperiodic control of TSHβ). We also indicate that our bioinformatic approach identified potentially new transcription binding motifs, and provide a clear admission and state that functional analyses are required to determine necessity of these pathways (e.g., MEF2). See lines 293-295.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2 - Second, I have another issue with the interpretation of data presented in Figure 3. The data show that FSHbeta increases in expression in the 8Lext group, suggesting that endogenous drivers likely act to increase the expression of this gene despite no change in day length. However, more robust effects are reported for FSHbeta expression in the 10v and 12v groups, even compared to the 8Lext group. Doesn't this suggest that both endogenous mechanisms and changes in day length work together to ramp up FSHbeta? The rest of the paper seemed to emphasize endogenous mechanisms and gloss over the fact that such mechanisms likely work additively with other factors. I felt like there was more nuance to these findings than the authors were getting into.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer and a similar concern was raised by Reviewer 1. Our aim was to highlight that FSH expression increased in constant short photoperiod. We have revised the manuscript to address the concern raised by the Reviewer. We have added 2 sentences in the results to highlight the additive role of endogenous timing and photoperiodic effects on FSH expression (see lines 223-226). We have kept the text that describes endogenous increases in expression (e.g., FSH/GnRH) in response to short photoperiod in the manuscript as this observation is not influenced by long photoperiod.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3 - Third, studies 1 - 3 are well controlled; however, I'm left wondering how much of an effect the transitions in day length might have on the underlying molecular processes that mediate changes in body condition. While the changes in day length are themselves ecologically relevant, the transitions between day length states are not. How do we know, for example, that more gradual changes in day length that occur over long timespans do not produce different effects at the levels of the brain and body? This seemed especially relevant for study 3, where animals experience a rather sudden change in day length. I recognize that these experimental methods are well described in the literature, and they have been used by endocrinologists for a long time; nonetheless, I think questions remain.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two points raised in this comment. First, the effect of transition in day length on body condition. We are investigating the impact of photoperiodic transitions on body condition. The ongoing project has examined the changes in tissue lipid content and conducted transcriptomic analyses of multiple peripheral tissues involved in energy balance. Although we made an initial attempt to combine all the findings into a single manuscript, the large datasets resulted in an overwhelming manuscript that lacked clarity. Instead, we have opted for two manuscripts that focus on the respective physiological systems. Those data should be published shortly. We did expand the discussion by developing a single paragraph that focused on the pattern of POMC expression and changes in quail body mass and adipose tissue. See lines 300-311.</p><p>Second, the Reviewer raised the issue of more gradual changes in day length over longer timespans. The day length and duration of exposure selected was to replicate previously used photoperiod manipulations to ensure reproducibility in research programmes, and to reduce the impact of photoperiod history (see lines 367-369). The present manuscript is the first study in birds to examine multiple intervening (ie within the extreme long- and short-photoperiods) day length conditions and we feel this is a major and novel contribution to the field. We agree that other time points (e.g., 13L:11D), or quicker/longer timespans could provide additional insight into the molecular mechanisms that govern seasonal transitions in reproduction/energy balance. The question raised by the Reviewer requires the types of studies that use natural conditions from wild-caught animals (or semi-natural laboratory settings) and beyond the focus of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p><p>Comment 1 - Abstract: Overall abstract needs more clarity in rationale, hypothesis, and result outcomes.

The abstract has clarified the rationale, hypothesis and results outcomes. We have also added new introductory and concluding statements that place the work into a wider ecological context (as suggested below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2 - In general the introduction needs more clarity and doesn't seem to cover the ecological relevance of learning photoperiodic/seasonal response.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer the introduction could be improved. We have substantially revised the introduction with an aim to increase the clarity. This involved an addition on the ecological context, clarification of the photoperiodic states in birds, and a description of the general and specific objectives. Note we did not include an introduction to ‘learning’ of the photoperiodic response, as the term implies a cognitive component is involved which is incorrect. See lines (61-67, 71-74, 80-86, and 100-105).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3 - Line 58: What does the author mean by &quot;future seasonal environment&quot; Is it to introduce change in climate or future seasonal events? This sentence needs rephrasing and more clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to Comment 2, we have revised the introductory paragraph and the sentence was removed from the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4 - Line 63: I would recommend the use of circannual rhythms with caution for the kind of experiments authors have proposed. The approach used here is beyond the scope of addressing circannual endogenous rhythms, which can be tested only independent of photoperiod change.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer’s concern. The use of circannual rhythms was limited to the first paragraph (lines 56-63) only to introduce the concept of endogenous rhythmicity. We were careful to not use the term ‘circannual’ for the rest of the manuscript, as the Reviewer has indicated, would be inappropriate. We have retained the use of ‘endogenous program’ to refer to the molecular and physiological changes that can occur independent of photoperiod change (ie Experiment 3). In this case, the use of endogenous is appropriate as this form of timing adheres to an interval timer. We also provided a definition for interval timer and ecological examples to illustrate the difference between circannual rhythms and annual interval timer (see lines 71-74). We also reviewed the entire manuscript to ensure the distinction for the endogenous program was clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5 - Another aspect authors missed is that Quail is not an absolute photorefractory (Robinson and Follett, 1982).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that quail are not absolute photorefractory (but instead relative photorefractory). As our photoperiod manipulations do not address criterion 1, or criterion 2 of the avian photoperiodic response (MacDougall-Shackelton et al., 2009; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icp048">https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icp048</ext-link>), we feel that adding the type of photorefractory response would be a distraction and reduce the clarity of the concepts/experimental design described in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6 - Line 223-234: &quot;Chicks were raised under constant light and constant heat lamp&quot;. Constant photoperiod experienced during development raises concern on how this pretreatment would shape the adult seasonal response, which could be different in the seasonal response of birds raised in natural photoperiod. If this is correct, the results shown are not tenable for birds inhabiting the natural environment.</p></disp-quote><p>The light schedule used in our experiment is the most appropriate for laboratory reared chicks. The light schedule, use of an incubator and hatchery is commonly used in research laboratories. The procedure serves to increase the hatch rate and welfare of chicks. Undoubtedly there will be some early developmental programming effects on quail development. However, the gonadal response across all 3 experiments was consistent with the vast scientific literature on the avian photoperiodic response in both laboratory and wild birds. As the robust gonadal response clearly replicated previous studies, we are confident the results are tenable for birds inhabiting natural environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7 - Numerous studies done in mammals suggest that photoperiod experienced in the early life stage affects the circadian and seasonal response in adults (Ciarleglio et al., 2011, Perinatal photoperiod imprints the circadian clock, Nat Neurosceince; Stetson M., et al., 1986, Maternal transfer of photoperiodic information influences the photoperiodic response of prepubertal Djungarian hamsters).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that developmental programming in mammals is important for the photoperiodic response. However, there are vast differences between the avian and mammalian photoperiodic response. Critically, in mammals, the maternal transfer of information to the offspring is achieved via the melatonin hormone. Conversely, in birds, melatonin is not necessary, nor sufficient for photoperiodic time measurement (Juss et al., 1993; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1993.0121">https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1993.0121</ext-link>). It is not scientifically tenable to relate the mammalian and avian photoperiodic responses in adulthood based on early developmental programs. For this reason, we did not introduce or discuss developmental programming in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 8 - Please give details on the month in which these birds were exposed to different short and long photoperiods. It is not clear in the method section. The birds experience long to short day transition and then back to long day in 16 weeks (~ 4 months). The annual cycle is ~12 months long in nature. Again, what is the ecological relevance of such an experimental paradigm. This could give some idea on photoperiodic response, but not on how the endogenous annual cycle would respond.</p></disp-quote><p>Birds were delivered in September 2019 and 2020. We have added these details to the manuscript (see lines 351-352). We agree with the Reviewer that the ecological relevance of the experimental design is limited. Our focus was to use laboratory conditions and well characterised photoperiodic manipulations to examine the role of the environmental, initial predictive cue to time seasonal transitions in reproduction. The 2-week duration for each photoperiod state in Experiment 1 provides the ability to eliminate the impact of photoperiodic history (see lines 367-369; Stevenson et al., 2012a) and reduce the time necessary for the research project. As described above in Comment #4 – we did not examine the endogenous annual cycle – but instead focused on an endogenous interval timer. Experiment 3 was designed to best examine an endogenous interval timer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 9 - Line 251: &quot;A jugular blood sample&quot; Please rephrase this sentence and add 50 ul heparinized tubes</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for identifying this oversight.

The Reviewer is correct that MinION is portable, however, more than one sample can be run at a time.

Unfortunately, we have not found a supplier of the epitope for quail/chicken vimentin. We have conducted another in silico analysis an established that the sequences for the vimentin antibody is specific for vimentin. The next closest sequence alignment is only 68% for a protein that is not expressed in the brain. The immunoreactive pattern observed in our histology reproduces work from mammalian models in which the epitope is available.

Our study does not examine photoinduction; which does not provide the ability to compare between our study and previous work (eg., Nakao et al., 2008; see doi: 10.1038/nature06738). We have revised the text in consideration of the concern raised by the Reviewer. The text now states ‘Previous reports established that TSHβ expression is significantly increased during the period of photoinducibility in quail (Nakao et al., 2008). Although the present study did not directly examine photoinduction, TSHβ expression was consistently elevated in long day photoperiod (i.e., 16L).’.

However, the photoperiodic response (growth and regression) is similar in both males and females. Sex differences exist in response to supplementary environmental cues (e.g., temperature). Males were used in these studies as the gonadal response to changes in photoperiod manipulations are much larger compared to ovarian changes in females. The focus on males allows for fewer animals to be used in the experiments and greater statistical power. To address the Reviewers concern, we have added a paragraph in the discussion that describes the similarity in photoperiodic responses in males and females, and the importance of supplementary cues for full reproductive development in female birds. We also provide a couple sentences in the methods that describe the justification for only males in the present study.

Second, the authors may want to consider WGCNA or a similar approach to discover gene co-expression modules, and then examine whether any of the resulting module eigengenes co-vary with any morphological or physiological measures and/or vary rhythmically.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and the new analyses was incorporated into the revised manuscript. Using the Langfelder and Horvath 2008 WCGNA package we conducted module-trait analyses to examine co-variation in our findings. These data are presented in Figure S# and lines 476-484. We agree that other DEG analyses would be useful; our main objectives was to use BioDare2.0 to identify rhythmic transcription in the seasonal transcriptomes. EdgR provides an excellent approach to identify transcripts and commonly used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3 - In the Data and code availability statement (lines 226ff) the authors state that &quot;all raw data are available in Extended data Table 1.&quot; However, they should be submitted to the GEO database or a similar public repository along with all relevant metadata. Also, and maybe I overlooked this, I did not see anywhere that the &quot;R code used in Study 1 is freely available&quot; (I was not sure what &quot;the methods reference list&quot; was supposed to refer to). Instead of stating that &quot;the full R code used is available upon request&quot; I suggest making all scripts available via GitHub or Dataverse, along with all non-omics data. The advantage of the latter platform is that a citable DOI is assigned to each upload.</p></disp-quote><p>The data are now available in the GEO database and can be accessed see GSE241775. We have added this information to the text. The R code is now provided as a Table S11 so that the reader can directly access the script.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4 - Line 191: Delete the extra &quot;that&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for identifying the oversight. We have revised the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5 - Line 24f: What does &quot;pseudo-randomly&quot; mean? Maybe &quot;haphazardly&quot; would be more appropriate here?</p></disp-quote><p>The term pseudo-randomly is used to describe the organized manner in which subjects are assigned to each treatment group. The aim is to ensure that a particular physiological variable, such as body mass, is evenly distributed across treatment groups. (Note although the term derived from the field of psychology). The aim is to reduce bias in the experiment due to an initial bias established when assigning treatment group. We are reluctant to replace pseudorandomly with haphazardly as the latter does not imply a logical organization. We have added text to help clarify the reason. The text now state: At the end of each photoperiodic treatment a subset of quail (n=12) body mass was used as a measure to pseudo randomly select birds for tissue collection and served to reduce the potential for unintentional bias.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6 - Figure 1e,j: The text indicates that 398 and 130 genes were &quot;rhythmically expressed&quot; in the MBH and pituitary, respectively, but considerably fewer genes are shown in the heatmaps in Figure 1e,j. How were these genes selected, and what was the rationale for doing so? Also, some autumnal and vernal expression patterns show some strong similarities (e.g., 16a and 16v in the MBH), which could be discussed. Consider showing the two heatmaps with the columns also hierarchically clustered in a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the full heatmap for the transcripts should be provided. The heat maps in Figure 1 are based on the transcripts with the most significant change; and were selected to provide a graphical representation that would be easily digested by the wide readership. We have created a new figure (ie. Fig. S1) that provides all the transcripts in heat maps for both the MBH and pituitary gland.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Comment 1 I do not have too much to add to this section of my review. Broadly speaking, I would suggest that the authors address some of the concerns I highlight above, and integrate their thoughts into the paper more than they currently do. I think this is particularly important with respect to the limitations of many of the bioinformatic analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their input and time assessing the manuscript. We have revised the manuscript in many sections incorporating the suggestions by Reviewer 3 above, and Reviewers 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2 Some of the methods are also a little scant. For example, the qPCR analyses are not described in sufficient detail to replicate the study. What are the efficiencies? Were samples run in duplicate? What was the housekeeping control gene used? Was there only one, or were multiple housekeeping genes used?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the oversight, the absence of information was a mistake that missed our previous early revisions. The revised manuscript includes all the requested information. Line 333 states that all samples were run in duplicate. The efficiency for each transcript was within the MIQE guidelines (indicated on line 342) and were within the 0.7 to 1.0 range. Actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as the reference transcripts. The most stable reference transcript was used to calculate fold change in target gene expression (lines 343-345).</p></body></sub-article></article>
