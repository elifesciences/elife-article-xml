To function effectively, the T6SS must penetrate the membranes of both attacker and target bacteria. Structures associated with the cell envelope, like polysaccharides chains, can therefore introduce spatial separation and steric hindrance, potentially affecting the efficacy of the T6SS. In this study, we examined how the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> affects T6SS’s antibacterial function. Our findings show that the CPS confers resistance against T6SS-mediated assaults from rival bacteria. Notably, under typical growth conditions, the presence of the surface-bound capsule also reduces the efficacy of the bacterium’s own T6SS. This T6SS impairment is further enhanced when CPS is overproduced due to genetic modifications or antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bacterium adjusts the level of the T6SS inner tube protein Hcp according to its secretion capacity, by initiating a degradation process involving the ClpXP protease. Collectively, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between T6SS and CPS and how they respond swiftly to environmental challenges.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic></kwd><kwd>capsular polysaccharide</kwd><kwd>immunity protein-independent protection</kwd><kwd>type VI secretion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>407240_167061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blokesch</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_204335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blokesch</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>55008726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blokesch</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Capsular polysaccharides of <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> regulate type VI secretion system activity, balancing self-protection with interbacterial competitiveness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen known for causing hospital-acquired infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified it as a critically high-priority pathogen in dire need of new therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tacconelli et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with its classification, <italic>A. baumannii</italic> is a member of the ‘ESKAPE bugs’, a term referring to six pathogenic species (<italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter</italic> spp.) notorious for causing hospital-acquired infections and their ability to escape antibiotic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rice, 2008</xref>).</p><p><italic>A. baumannii</italic> can gain new functions, including antibiotic resistance, through horizontal gene transfer, notably via plasmid conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Venanzio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamidian et al., 2014</xref>) and natural competence for transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godeux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Godeux et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramirez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vesel and Blokesch, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilharm et al., 2013</xref>). Beyond its resistance to antibiotics, the bacterium can withstand desiccation, disinfectants, and survive on surfaces for extended periods, posing a significant challenge in hospital environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harding et al., 2018</xref>). For <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic>, a non-pathogenic species belonging to the same genus, resilience against external stresses was shown to be at least partly attributed to extracellular polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ophir and Gutnick, 1994</xref>). These polysaccharides, whether secreted into the environment as biofilm matrix components (exopolysaccharides; EPS) or part of/attached to the bacterial membrane (like lipopolysaccharide, lipooligosaccharide, and capsule [capsular polysaccharide; CPS]), serve various protective roles against physical, chemical, and biological stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flemming et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paczosa and Mecsas, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simpson and Trent, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Whitfield et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, the capsule, encoded within the genomic region between the <italic>fkpA</italic> and <italic>lldP</italic> genes known as the K locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wyres et al., 2020</xref>), is a key feature for many strains. The K locus is usually arranged in three parts: (1) the genes encoding the CPS export machinery (e.g., the <italic>wza</italic>, <italic>wzb</italic>, <italic>wzc</italic> operon); (2) a central region for capsule construction and processing (including the genes <italic>wzy</italic> and <italic>wzx</italic>, which encode the repeat unit polymerase and translocase, respectively); and (3) a module for synthesizing simple sugar substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wyres et al., 2020</xref>). The CPS assembles into complex, multibranched glycans that are tightly anchored to the outer membrane by the Wzi protein, effectively encasing the cell in a protective polysaccharide shield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tickner et al., 2021</xref>). This capsule plays a crucial role in the virulence of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, as demonstrated in in vivo studies using animal models where it provided resistance against complement-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lees-Miller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Russo et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies targeting CPS have been shown to protect mice from infection by hypervirulent strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nielsen et al., 2017</xref>). Despite its significant role in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> pathogenicity, the regulatory mechanisms governing capsule production remain largely unexplored. However, recent findings indicate that exposure to specific antibiotics at sub-MIC concentrations, such as of chloramphenicol, can trigger the upregulation of K locus genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisinger and Isberg, 2015</xref>). This response is mediated by the BfmRS two-component regulatory system, leading to enhanced virulence of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisinger and Isberg, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Extracellular polysaccharides such as EPS and CPS are known to protect against attacks by bacteria with a type VI secretion system (T6SS), a key player in bacterial warfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith et al., 2023</xref>). Found in 25% of Gram-negative bacteria and in more than 50% of β- and γ proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bingle et al., 2008</xref>), the T6SS is a contact-dependent contractile machinery that resembles inverted contractile bacteriophage tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leiman et al., 2009</xref>). The T6SS features a membrane complex that extends across both the inner and outer bacterial membranes, with a baseplate-like structure connected within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cherrak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2015</xref>). The baseplate of the T6SS is linked to an internal tube composed of Hcp hexamers, encased by a contractile sheath formed by TssB and TssC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basler et al., 2012</xref>). Upon contraction, the T6SS propels its inner tube, along with VgrG-PAAR spike proteins and toxins, into neighboring cells, leading to either growth arrest or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cherrak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Russell et al., 2014</xref>). To protect themselves from the effects of their own T6SS-launched toxins, bacteria that possess the T6SS also produce immunity proteins. These proteins specifically neutralize the bacterium’s own toxic effector proteins, preventing self-intoxication or intoxication of kin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacIntyre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Russell et al., 2011</xref>). As mentioned above, recent research has identified mechanisms of resistance to T6SS toxicity that do not involve immunity proteins, which include defenses provided by the production of EPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Granato et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hersch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toska et al., 2018</xref>) and capsules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flaugnatti et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The T6SS is widely found across <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species, including <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weber et al., 2013</xref>). The genes encoding the core components of the T6SS reside in a single locus. However, the <italic>vgrG</italic> genes, which are crucial for the system’s function, are scattered throughout the chromosome alongside effector/immunity modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eijkelkamp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The regulation of the T6SS in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> varies, with some isolates expressing the system under standard laboratory conditions, while others regulate expression via proteins such as H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eijkelkamp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Repizo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weber et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, TetR-like repressors encoded on large conjugative plasmids, which also bear antibiotic resistance genes, can suppress T6SS to aid conjugation and plasmid dissemination among cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Venanzio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weber et al., 2015</xref>). This diversity in regulatory mechanisms indicates a complex interplay between antibiotic resistance, T6SS activity, and bacterial competitiveness. Indeed, the T6SS in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> significantly influences interbacterial dynamics, effectively targeting not only Gram-negative and -positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weber et al., 2013</xref>) but also exhibiting antifungal capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2023</xref>). However, although the T6SS confers competitive advantages to <italic>A. baumannii</italic> by targeting a wide range of microorganisms in vitro, studies in diverse animal models have shown that T6SS mutants do not incur a fitness cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weber et al., 2013</xref>), a finding that might be strain dependent, at least in the <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> wax moth model of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Repizo et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the T6SS’s role in the bacterium’s virulence might not be direct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Subashchandrabose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), highlighting a complex interaction with host organisms and/or its environment that warrants further investigation.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the impact of capsule production on T6SS antibacterial activity in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. Our findings reveal that the CPS acts as a shield against T6SS attacks from rival bacteria. Despite this, many <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains also have an operational T6SS, underscoring the capsules primary role as a one-way barrier. However, we show that under typical laboratory growth conditions, the presence of the surface-bound capsule nonetheless reduces the efficacy of the bacterium’s own T6SS. This T6SS impairment is further enhanced when CPS is overproduced due to genetic modifications or antibiotic treatment. Finally, we go on to demonstrate that when T6SS secretion is hindered, the accumulation of Hcp protein components is curtailed by a degradation process facilitated by the ClpXP protease system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The capsule of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> contributes to protection against T6SS attacks</title><p>In our study, we explored how capsule production influences the antibacterial activity of the T6SS in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, specifically focusing on the clinical isolate A118 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramirez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Traglia et al., 2014</xref>).

To investigate this protection further, we conducted a killing assay using capsulated (WT) and non-capsulated (Δ<italic>itrA</italic>) <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains as prey in a T6SS-inactivated (T6SS−) strain background. Interestingly, the attacker <italic>E. cloacae</italic> was ineffective in killing CPS-producing <italic>A. baumannii</italic> prey (WT carrying a cargo-less transposon; WT-Tn) in a T6SS-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, the lack of CPS in the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> prey (Δ<italic>itrA-</italic>Tn) resulted in increased susceptibility to T6SS-mediated attacks by <italic>E. cloacae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This vulnerability could be reversed by introducing a new copy of the <italic>itrA</italic> gene into the strain’s genome (Δ<italic>itrA</italic>-Tn-<italic>itrA</italic>), as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. When we conducted the experiment again under conditions that allow <italic>A. baumannii</italic>’s T6SS to function (T6SS+), we observed an unexpected outcome: the non-capsulated strain (Δ<italic>itrA</italic>) exhibited full resistance to <italic>E. cloacae</italic>’s T6SS attacks, mirroring the resistance shown by the capsulated WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Indeed, several studies have reported that certain isolates of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> are equipped with a constitutively produced antibacterial T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Repizo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weber et al., 2013</xref>).

These results verify that <italic>A. baumannii</italic> A118 indeed possesses an active antibacterial T6SS when tested under standard laboratory conditions.

Or essentially, does the capsule function as a one-way barrier? To start addressing this question, we conducted a killing experiment with <italic>A. baumannii</italic> A118 strains, both CPS-positive (WT) and CPS-negative (Δ<italic>itrA</italic>), acting as attackers. Notably, in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, the CPS and protein <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation pathway share common enzymes, including the initiating (glycosyl)transferase ItrA, which attaches the first monosaccharide to the undecaprenol-phosphate (Und-P) lipid carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lees-Miller et al., 2013</xref>). To distinguish between these pathways, both affected in the <italic>itrA</italic> mutant, we also included an <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation-specific mutant (Δ<italic>pglL</italic>) as an attacker. Initially, at a standard attacker:prey ratio of 1:1, no significant differences in prey survival were observed between CPS-positive (WT), CPS-negative (Δ<italic>itrA</italic>), and <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation (Δ<italic>pglL</italic>) mutant strains, with survival rates at or below the detection limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To enhance the sensitivity of the assay and increase its dynamic range, we adjusted the attacker:prey ratio to 1:5, reflecting better a situation where a bacterium invades an already existing community. Under these conditions, we noted decreased T6SS-mediated killing activity in the WT strain compared to the Δ<italic>itrA</italic> strain, while no difference was noted between the WT and Δ<italic>pglL</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This suggests that T6SS-mediated killing activity is elevated in the absence of CPS and that the <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation pathway does not contribute to this phenotype.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Capsular polysaccharide (CPS) interferes with T6SS activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Non-capsulated strains show increased T6SS killing-mediated activity.

This assay, a benchmark for assessing T6SS secretion functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pukatzki et al., 2006</xref>), relies on immunodetecting the Hcp protein in the supernatant, with intracellular Hcp serving as a control. Importantly, while all strains produced Hcp at comparable levels, the amount of Hcp detected in the supernatant was considerably higher in the Δ<italic>itrA</italic> strain compared to the WT or the Δ<italic>pglL</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This finding reinforces the notion that T6SS secretion activity is enhanced in the absence of the CPS. As an internal BSA precipitation control ensured that the observed differences in Hcp recovery were not due to variations in precipitation efficiency, we hypothesized that the CPS might directly impact the assembly of and/or firing by the T6SS machinery. We therefore compared T6SS structures within cells using a functional translational fusion between TssB and msfGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).

This suggests that the capsule may serve as an additional barrier the T6SS has to traverse to be expelled from the cell. Supporting this theory, our analysis reveals that the enhanced T6SS activity in the non-capsulated mutant (Δ<italic>itrA</italic>) is not due to a higher number of T6SS assemblies but likely due to an increase in the number of successful T6SS firing events. This finding is in line with previous reports on <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, where the T6SS was only cytotoxic to red blood cells in a capsule-deficient context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleumink-Pluym et al., 2013</xref>), leading to the hypothesis that the capsule acts as a physical barrier, limiting T6SS’s ability to directly interact with target cells. Variations in capsule production have been observed in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, which employs a kind of bet-hedging strategy that leads to the formation of two types of variants within the same clonal population, namely opaque and translucent colonies. These variants are capable of phenotypically switching between these states, thereby enhancing their adaptation to diverse environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chin et al., 2018</xref>). Such a strategy in capsule modulation can offer significant advantages, including protection against external threats like complement-mediated killing, as well as competitive interactions with surrounding organisms. Furthermore, the increased T6SS activity in the non-capsulated strain may provide a protective advantage against surrounding competitors in the absence of the protective capsule layer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Alterations in the organization of capsule material disrupt the secretion process</title><p>Having established that CPS interferes with the T6SS secretion process, we next explored whether enhancing CPS production could entirely block T6SS activity. Previous research has identified two genetic alterations that increase CPS secretion and/or production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisinger and Isberg, 2015</xref>). Indeed, Geisinger and Isberg demonstrated that a substitution in the Walker A motif of the Wzc protein, which controls the size of exported polysaccharides, induces in a mucoviscous phenotype characterized by abnormally high molecular weight polysaccharides predominantly found in the supernatant and only loosely attached to the cell. The second mechanism for elevated CPS production involves the two-component system BfmRS, recognized for its role in various cellular processes including biofilm formation, serum resistance, antibiotic resistance, and envelope stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geisinger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Russo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tomaras et al., 2008</xref>). The BfmS histidine kinase within this system typically represses K locus expression by phosphorylation of the response regulator BfmR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palethorpe et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, removing <italic>bfmS</italic> disrupts this phosphorylation cascade, resulting in the overproduction of the K locus gene cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisinger and Isberg, 2015</xref>).</p><p>To enhance CPS production in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> A118, we therefore introduced a point mutation in <italic>wzc</italic> encoding the Walker A motif variant [K547Q], and we also created a deletion mutant of <italic>bfmS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Both modifications led to the formation of mucoviscous colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), with a noticeable difference: stretching of the Wzc[K547Q] colonies produced a string (&gt;5 mm), a phenomenon not observed in the mucoviscous Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> mutant. This suggests that the capsular characteristics differ between the two mutants. Indeed, further analysis, including CPS extraction followed by Alcian blue staining and the serum-mediated killing assay, revealed distinct outcomes for these mutants. The Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> mutant showed increased resistance to serum-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), aligned with an augmented presence of cell-associated CPS material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

By complementing the Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> mutant in cis with a copy of <italic>bfmS</italic> under its native promoter, T6SS-mediated killing was restored to levels similar to those of the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To rule out the possibility of the <italic>bfmS</italic> mutation having broad effects on T6SS production or function, we also evaluated the double mutant Δ<italic>bfmS</italic>Δ<italic>itrA</italic>, which reinstated the strain’s killing ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These findings were consistent with the Hcp secretion profiles of these mutants. Specifically, the mutant lacking <italic>bfmS</italic> showed a significant impairment in its Hcp secretion activity, whereas the Δ<italic>bfmS</italic>Δ<italic>itrA</italic> double mutant reflected the secretion pattern of the Δ<italic>itrA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that the observed phenotype indeed results from the increased production of the capsule.</p><p>To investigate whether capsule-secreted material could interact with proteins in the supernatant, we co-cultured the WT and a secretion-impaired Δ<italic>tssB</italic> mutant and compared their Hcp secretion profiles to the WT co-cultured with Δ<italic>bfmS</italic>. Notably, all strains except the Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> mutant secreted comparable amounts of polysaccharide into the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We observed no significant differences in the levels of Hcp protein secretion between the two co-culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that the secretion defect seen in Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> is attributable to an impairment in secretion rather than to interactions of Hcp with CPS in the supernatant. We also engineered a <italic>bfmS</italic> deletion in two environmental <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolates (29D2 and 86II/2C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wilharm et al., 2017</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>, both strains are capable of producing an antibacterial T6SS. Importantly, the deletion of <italic>bfmS</italic> in these strains also resulted in the impairment of the T6SS-mediated killing. These findings indicate that <italic>bfmS</italic> affects T6SS-mediated killing activity across different strains.</p><p>Unlike the Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> phenotypes, the Wzc[K547Q] variant demonstrated T6SS-mediated killing similar to that observed in the WT, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. Consistently, this variant also exhibited Hcp secretion levels that appeared comparable (or even increased) to those of the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This finding is in line with the observation that the Wzc[K547Q] variant was not protected from complement-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and produces minimal surface-bound CPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>To gain more insight into the ultrastructure of the capsule in the different genetic backgrounds, we imaged cells using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The WT cells were surrounded by material forming large finger-like projections extending about 150 nm from the cell surface, arranged in a semi-regular pattern of projections and spaces. As expected, these structures were absent in the Δ<italic>itrA</italic> mutant, confirming its essential role in capsule assembly. Notably, the Wzc[K547Q] variant also lacked these structures, appearing similar to the Δ<italic>itrA</italic> mutant. However, we observed a significant presence of what is presumed to be capsular material floating in the medium surrounding the cells, with additional material potentially being lost during the fixation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This detached CPS aligns with the Alcian blue staining results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and could explain the observed differences in the string test results for the Wzc[K547Q] colonies compared to the Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). The creation of such a viscous environment by the release of long-chain CPS may therefore impact T6SS activity, explaining the decreased killing ability compared to the Δ<italic>itrA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>bfmS</italic> mutant exhibited a dense, tangled, mesh-like network of CPS covering the cell surface, similar to the WT but without the clear periodic spaces. As expected, this dense capsule network was absent in the Δ<italic>bfmS</italic>Δ<italic>itrA</italic> double deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Taken all together, these results indicate that disruption in the organized, finger-like structure of the capsule, as seen with overexpression of the K-locus, leads to a suppression of T6SS-mediated killing activity and blocks Hcp secretion. This observation highlights the importance of CPS’s surface organization in affecting the extracellular secretion process. It is tempting to speculate that, within the WT scenario, T6SS may deploy through gaps akin to arrow-slit in the capsule’s mesh, a process that becomes unfeasible when CPS organization is disrupted. This concept mirrors a hypothesis suggested by Toska et al. for <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, where T6SS secretes through biofilm-associated EPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toska et al., 2018</xref>). An alternative explanation might be that capsule overexpression enhances polysaccharide dispersion into the surroundings. Coupled with changes to the capsule directly attached to the cell surface, this could effectively increase the spatial gap between cells, impeding T6SS functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Antibiotics-induced CPS production impairs T6SS activity</title><p>It has been shown that the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolate 17978 boosts CPS production via the BfmRS two component system in response to sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MIC) of chloramphenicol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisinger and Isberg, 2015</xref>). When we exposed <italic>A. baumannii</italic> A118 to various chloramphenicol concentrations, we found that the capsule induction by the antibiotic was dose-dependent, as evidenced by increased CPS presence in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We next asked whether T6SS activity inhibition seen in the Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> mutant could also be induced under antibiotic-triggered capsule overproduction conditions in the WT background. Unfortunately, the Hcp secretion assay did not yield conclusive results due to contamination from cytoplasmic material, indicating that chloramphenicol exposure caused partial cell lysis (LB+Cm), which was not observed in the untreated control (LB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

ClpXP and Lon proteases are known to play crucial roles in various stress responses, specifically in degrading misfolded or accumulated proteins to mitigate proteotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sauer and Baker, 2011</xref>). To investigate the potential involvement of these general proteases in the post-transcriptional regulation of Hcp, we generated individual Δ<italic>clpXP</italic> and Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutants, as well as combinations with a T6SS secretion-impaired background (Δ<italic>tssB</italic>Δ<italic>clpXP</italic> and Δ<italic>tssB</italic>Δ<italic>lon</italic>). The <italic>lon</italic> mutant strains (Δ<italic>lon</italic> and Δ<italic>tssB</italic>Δ<italic>lon</italic>) consistently showed lower Hcp levels than the WT, suggesting that Lon is not responsible for Hcp degradation in stationary phase cultures. In contrast, deletion of <italic>clpXP</italic> resulted in intracellular Hcp accumulation over time in both the WT and <italic>tssB</italic>-deficient backgrounds, indicating that ClpXP may be involved in the degradation mechanism of Hcp when secretion is impaired in the otherwise WT background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Supporting this idea is the observation that, although undetectable when secretion is blocked in the ∆<italic>tssB</italic> and Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> strains, Hcp levels were comparable to WT in the Δ<italic>tssB</italic>Δ<italic>clpXP</italic> and Δ<italic>bfmS</italic>Δ<italic>clpXP</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Given the time-dependent nature of this degradation, we analyzed the transcript levels of <italic>clpX</italic> and <italic>clpP</italic> at various times (2, 6, 8, and 12 hr) before, during, and after the degradation of Hcp, both under secretion-permissive (WT) and non-permissive (Δ<italic>tssB</italic>) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We observed an increase in <italic>clpX</italic> transcripts at 6 hr, corresponding with the transition into stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, there were no statistically significant differences in the expression levels of <italic>clpX</italic> and <italic>clpP</italic> between the WT and the Δ<italic>tssB</italic> background at any of the tested time points.</p><p>The ClpXP degradation system recognizes its substrates via the C-terminal region, for instance for proteins that were tagged by the SsrA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sauer and Baker, 2011</xref>), and binds it within the axial pore of the ClpX ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin et al., 2008</xref>), facilitating the enzyme’s ability to unfold substrates and translocate polypeptides into ClpP for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wawrzynow et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wojtkowiak et al., 1993</xref>). The canonical sequence of the SsrA-tag, consisting of 11 residues (AADENYNYALAA), is recognized by ClpX at the last three C-terminal amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flynn et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, when represented as a hexamer, the crystal structure of the Hcp protein from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain AB0057 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>) shows that its C-terminal domain is exposed, potentially making it accessible for interaction with ClpX and subsequent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, the last 11 C-terminal residues of the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> A118 Hcp protein are SLSNNTASYAA. Thus, one can speculate that when Hcp fails to be secreted and accumulates, this ‘SsrA-like’ tag might be recognized by the ClpXP protease machinery, leading to degradation. However, under secretion-permissive conditions, the Hcp hexamer is enclosed within the contractile sheath, thereby hiding the protein’s C-terminus and protecting Hcp from degradation.</p><p>To assess the importance of the Hcp C-terminus, we constructed plasmids encoding Hcp variants lacking the last 11 amino acids (p-<italic>hcp</italic><sup>CTDΔ11</sup>) or with Ala-to-Asp substitutions in the last two amino acids (p-<italic>hcp</italic><sup>[A166D/A167D]</sup>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, both variants were produced at levels similar to native Hcp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Importantly, in the Δ<italic>hcp</italic> background of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, we also detected high protein levels of these two modified Hcp versions (p-<italic>hcp</italic><sup>CTDΔ11</sup> and p-<italic>hcp</italic><sup>[A166D/A167D]</sup>), whereas native Hcp was again heavily degraded (p-<italic>hcp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest that the Hcp C-terminus plays a crucial for its degradation by the ClpXP machinery. More broadly, these observations indicate that <italic>A. baumannii</italic> has evolved a sophisticated regulation of its T6SS, closely tied to the strain’s secretion capacity to prevent unnecessary protein accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study reveals a novel role of the CPS in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, highlighting its complex interaction with the T6SS, which is crucial for environmental colonization and survival (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Notably, we demonstrated that both the capsule and the T6SS independently offer protection during antagonistic interactions with competitors, and these protective effects might be synergistic, at least under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, overproduction of the capsule in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> A118 impedes T6SS activity by hindering its assembly, potentially due to increased membrane tension from excess polysaccharides affecting membrane complex anchoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This inhibition is alleviated in the double mutant Δ<italic>bfmS</italic>Δ<italic>itrA</italic>, which does not produce the capsule, indicating that the polysaccharide directly inhibits T6SS. Furthermore, capsule overproduction disrupts the organization of polysaccharides on the cell surface, likely impairing proper T6SS secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). While the inhibition observed in Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> could result from both increased membrane tension and altered surface organization, our data conclusively show that strains lacking capsules exhibit enhanced T6SS activity and secretion compared20181905 to their encapsulated counterparts, suggesting that the capsule imposes steric hindrance on T6SS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of capsule function and its impact on T6SS activity in <italic>A. baumannii</italic>.</title><p><bold>Left panel:</bold> <italic>A. baumannii</italic> capsular polysaccharide and T6SS protect against competitor T6SS attacks independently of immunity proteins. <bold>Middle panel:</bold> Under permissive conditions, the capsule only slightly impairs type VI secretion, preventing intracellular accumulation of Hcp. <bold>Right panel:</bold> Under non-permissive conditions, capsule overexpression—induced by <italic>bfmS</italic> deletion (Δ<italic>bfmS</italic>) or sub-MIC antibiotic treatment—modifies cell-associated polysaccharide organization, inhibiting T6SS secretion and therefore killing activity.

It is plausible that this inhibition is an adaptive response to withstand antibiotic exposure. Ultimately, this trade-off between T6SS functionality and capsule-mediated protection poses a competitive disadvantage, with the optimal balance achieved in the wild type, where both systems are functional.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that in secretion-impaired strains, the accumulation of Hcp is mitigated by a degradation mechanism involving the general ClpXP protease machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

This interaction urges further characterization to develop effective strategies against this problematic and often antibiotic-resistant pathogen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"

Engineered strains and plasmids underwent initial PCR screening and were finally validated by Sanger sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments or plasmids.</p><p><italic>A. baumannii</italic> mutants were created via allelic exchange with the counter-selectable suicide plasmid pGP704-Sac-Kan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Metzger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vesel and Blokesch, 2021</xref>). Briefly, deletion constructs or <italic>msfGFP</italic> gene fusions were crafted to include &gt;800 bp up- and downstream the target gene. These segments were amplified via PCR using oligonucleotides with 5′ restriction sites for later digestion. After enzymatic digestion, the fragments were ligated with the similarly cut pGP704-Sac-Kan plasmid using T4 DNA ligase and then introduced into chemically competent <italic>E. coli</italic> S17-1λ<italic>pir</italic> cells for further processes. Transformants were confirmed via colony PCR, and plasmid accuracy was ensured through Sanger sequencing. These plasmids were then introduced into <italic>A. baumannii</italic> through biparental mating for 8 hr at 37°C. Selection of single-crossover transconjugants utilized CHROMagar <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> (CHROMagar, France) plates or LB agar with chloramphenicol and kanamycin. After mating, the transconjugants were incubated at 37°C for 16 hr and then underwent selection at room temperature for the SacB-containing suicide plasmid’s loss using plates of NaCl-free LB agar containing 10% sucrose. Colony checks for antibiotic sensitivity confirmed plasmid loss. Mutants were validated through colony PCR and Sanger sequencing.</p><p>Selective mutants with antibiotic resistance markers were created via natural transformation, a method detailed in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Godeux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vesel et al., 2023</xref>). The transforming material, generated by overlapping PCR, included a kanamycin resistance cassette (<italic>aph</italic>) flanked by FRT sites and 800 bp of homologous regions, enabling efficient transformation. Selected transformants on LB agar with kanamycin underwent verification through colony PCR and Sanger sequencing. The resistance cassette was then excised using the FLP/FRT recombinase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tucker et al., 2014</xref>), with the process and loss of the recombinase plasmid confirmed by antibiotic resistance tests, colony PCR, and Sanger sequencing, ensuring precise genetic manipulations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Interbacterial killing</title><p>The interbacterial killing assay was slightly modified from prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flaugnatti et al., 2021</xref>). Bacteria were incubated overnight at 37°C with continuous shaking. They were then diluted 1:100 in fresh LB medium and grown until the optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) reached 1. For stationary-phase samples, overnight cultures after 15–16 hr of growth were used directly. Bacterial cultures (1 ml) were concentrated to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 10 with sterile PBS buffer. Attackers and prey were mixed in 1:1 or 1:5 ratios and spotted onto filters placed on LB agar plates. After incubation at 37°C for 4 hr, bacteria were resuspended in PBS, serially diluted, and spotted on selective media for an overnight incubation at 37°C. <italic>A. baumannii</italic> was selected on CHROMagar <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> medium (CHROMagar, France), while <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were selected on LB agar supplemented with streptomycin. Recovered colonies were counted to calculate the number of colony-forming units (CFU) per ml.</p><p>In this interbacterial killing assay to stimulate capsule production via chloramphenicol, bacteria were initially grown in LB for 20 hr at 37°C, then 1:100 diluted and grown further for 20 hr in LB without or with chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml). The cultures were subsequently processed as outlined above and the mixture of attackers and treated prey was spotted onto LB agar, with or without chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), and incubated at 37°C for 4 hr. After incubation, bacteria were resuspended in PBS, diluted, and plated on selective media for overnight growth at 37°C, as mentioned above. Each experiment was repeated three independent times. Statistical significance was determined based on log-transformed data, with detection limits defined by the absence of at least one recoverable prey bacterium.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Hcp secretion assay</title><p>To assess Hcp secretion, bacteria were grown in LB medium overnight at 37°C, followed by a 1:100 dilution and further aerobic cultivation until reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1. For stationary-phase studies, overnight growth was extended to 15–16 hr before proceeding with further analyses.</p><p>Chloramphenicol-treated samples underwent a similar initial growth phase for 20 hr, followed by additional growth in the presence of chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) for 20 hr, maintaining the same aerobic growth conditions. Subsequently, 2 ml of the culture was collected through centrifugation (5 min, 8000 rpm) and the supernatant filtered (0.22 μm filter; VWR). Secreted proteins in the supernatant were then precipitated using 10% ice cold trichloroacetic acid on ice for 2 hr. To verify consistent precipitation, BSA (100 μg/ml) was added to the supernatant before precipitation. The precipitated proteins were washed with 100% acetone, resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer (50 μl/OD unit of initial culture), and heated before undergoing SDS–PAGE and western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>SDS–PAGE and western blotting</title><p>Proteins were separated on 12% mini-protean TGX stain-free precast gels and transferred to a PVDF membrane using the Trans-blot system as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad).

Primary antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides of Hcp (Eurogentec) and used at a dilution of 1:667 in 2.5% skim milk. After 1.5 hr of incubation, the membranes were washed three times with TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween-20) buffer. They were then incubated for 1 hr with an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (A9169; Sigma-Aldrich) as the secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000. Following three additional washes, the membranes were treated with Lumi-Light<sup>PLUS</sup> Western Blotting substrate (Roche, Switzerland) for signal development and visualized using a ChemiDoc XRS +station (Bio-Rad). The anti-Sigma70 antibodies (BioLegend, USA distributed via Brunschwig, Switzerland) were used at a dilution of 1:10,000 to serve as a loading control in the experiment.

These classifiers were made by manually annotating a set of images representative of the dataset variability. However, due to challenges in differentiating between contracted and extended sheath structures, this distinction was not made in the final analysis.</p><p>For bacterial segmentation, since they remain stationary and unchanged in shape throughout the acquisition, the first phase contrast time-point was utilized. The segmentation method has been previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Proutière et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Data analysis involved pre-processing, segmentation, and sheath structure classification steps performed in ImageJ/Fiji using a Groovy script for batch processing (WorkFlow_File.groovy). This script generated a new multi-channel time-lapse stack per image, which consisted of the drift-compensated phase contrast channel, the bleach and drift-compensated fluorescent channel, a color-coded mask channel for contracted and extended sheath structures, and a label image of detected bacteria. The resulting stacks were used for visual assessment of the method and for downstream data analysis. A second script (CountObject_File) quantified the sheath structures per bacterium, per time point, and for each condition, output the data in a tsv file.

We are confident that we have addressed all points of critique, as outlined below. The reviewers' comments are in blue, and our responses are in black.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The transport of effector proteins across membranes from the producing bacterium into a target cell is at the core of bacterial secretion systems. How an additional layer in form of a capsule affects effector export and the susceptibility towards effector import is not fully understood. Here, Flaugnatti and colleagues combined bacterial genetics with phenotypic assays and electron microscopy to demonstrate a dual role of a bacterial capsule in preventing T6SS-mediated effector export and promoting protection from effector import by another bacterium's T6SS. The wide variety of methods used, complementation of the mutants, and validation of the findings across strains strengthen the author's conclusions. Although the main conclusions seem straight forward, the authors unravel the unexpected complexity underlying these phenotypes with strong mechanistic work. In brief, a capsule-deficient mutant (∆itra) is shown to assemble its T6SS similar to the WT, yet secretes more Hcp than the WT and is better in T6SS-mediated killing of other bacteria. A capsule-overproducing mutant (∆bfmS) shows both, a partial deficiency in T6SS assembly and an additional reduction in exported Hcp, and is worse in T6SS-mediated killing than the WT. A mutant with a capsule similar to WT and deficient in cell sensing (∆tslA) forms the least T6SS apparatuses and is yet better in T6SS-mediated killing than the overcapsulated mutant. Together, these data show an effect of the capsule on (i) T6SS apparatus assembly, (ii) effector export, (iii) effector import, and (iv) the need for clearance of accumulating non-secreted Hcp by ClpXP.</p><p>The work on a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter tumefaciens and the data on an impaired T6SS activity on other cells by antibiotic-induced capsulation is a strong demonstration of the work's clinical relevance in addition to the findings' conceptual novelty.</p><p>In my view, the manuscript is outstanding with very high quality of experimental data, very well written text and very clear presentation of the data in figures. A few minor comments and suggestions below that I think would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their enthusiasm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment:</p><p>OPTIONAL: Figure 4c/l. 320: Having an indirect effect of an antibiotic on T6SS activity by antibiotic-induced capsule formation is very intriguing and contributes to the clinical relevance of the overall findings. When I saw the data in Figure 4c, the graph instantaneously reminded me of the panel in Figure 2a, where a similar phenotype is observed by changing the predator:prey ratio in the absence of any antibiotic. The authors themselves comment on the possibility of antibiotic-induced, reduced predator growth (and thereby a change in predator:prey ratio) as a one factor impacting the phenotype here. I am wondering if this data could be strengthened or better disentangled to test more precisely if it is the antibiotic induced capsule formation per se that affects T6SS-mediated killing by A. baumanii in the presence of antibiotics. Would it help to take the bfmS mutant along as a control for direct comparison to see if antibiotic-induced capsule formation of the WT to similar levels of the mutant results in the same killing phenotype? Would it help to test for T6SS-mediated killing in the presence and absence of antibiotics at multiple predator:prey ratios? Could the effect of the antibiotic on A. baumanii growth be measured and considered when choosing the ratio at which the bacteria are mixed?</p></disp-quote><p>The point raised by the reviewer is very important. As we have stated in the manuscript, the capsule-induced production using antibiotics impacts the growth of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and could therefore change the predator-prey ratio, potentially affecting the observed phenotype. However, the antibiotic is expected to equally impact the non-encapsulated ΔitrA strain, yet this strain maintains very strong T6SS killing activity in the presence of chloramphenicol.</p><p>However, to still address this valid point more directly, we nonetheless repeated the experiments with a different attacker:prey ratio (5:1), and included the ∆<italic>bfmS</italic> mutant as control, as suggested by the expert. The new data are presented in Figure 4C and support our initial claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) Figure 1D, l. 155, I might have missed this, do the authors happen to have the numbers of E. cloacae as well? This would strengthen the claim on A. baumannii survival because of E. cloacae is being killed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct; we did not include the survival of <italic>E. cloacae</italic> in the initial manuscript due to technical reasons (counter-selection of <italic>E. cloacae</italic>). During revision, we repeated the experiment using <italic>E. cloacae</italic> strains carrying a plasmid conferring kanamycin resistance (new Figure 1-supplement 1C and D), which provided direct evidence that <italic>E. cloacae</italic> is indeed killed by <italic>A. baumannii</italic> in a T6SS-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2, I suggest to write out the species name of the prey in the box with the ratio. With E. cloacae being referred to in the previous figure and starting with similar letters than <italic>E. coli</italic>, I wasn't sure at first sight what E. c. refers to.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment; we have revised the figure as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) U<italic>se of the term &quot;T6SS activity&quot; throughout the manuscript (e.g. l. 182, l. 187). I leave this up to the authors. To me, it seems like an umbrella term for the initial observation and I see that such a term can be very handy for the writing. I just would like to mention that the use of the term was not always intuitive to me and sometimes even a bit misleading. For example, l. 182 refers to &quot;increased T6SS activity&quot;. As a reader, I only know about 'T6SS activity on other cells' or 'a T6SS-mediated effect on other cells' at this point. T6SS apparatus assembly/firing activity is tested for specifically later and it turns out to differ between mutants. By the time the term is used in the discussion, it captures multiple nuanced phenotypes described by then. The more precise definition of the term in l. 200 helped to capture what exactly is meant by the authors.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We revised the manuscript to rephrase these sentences, now using the term ‘T6SS-secretion activity’ for Hcp secretion assays and ‘T6SS-mediated killing activity’ for killing experiments.</p><p>4) l. 198-199 &quot;Collectively, our findings indicate that CPS does not hinder the secretion process of the T6SS or the consequent elimination of competing cells&quot;. I might be missing something, I cannot entirely follow this sentence. Didn't the authors just show that the CPS does hinder T6SS-mediated elimination of competing cells in panel 2A and less secreted Hcp in the encapsulated WT compared to the non-encapsulated mutant in panel 2B?</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We realize that the sentence wasn’t well phrased, resulting in confusion. What we meant was that the T6SS is functional regarding its T6SS-mediated killing and secretion in the WT strain, while we also showed that the non-capsulated strain kills and secretes more T6SS material in the supernatant. Thus, there seems to be a balance between capsule production and T6SS activity in the WT. We revised the sentence to better reflect this meaning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) l. 224, typo, &quot;in&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected this typo. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Two connected comments: l. 338, Just a thought, I am wondering about the title of the section. After reading it a second time, I think it is technically correct. When reading it first, I was a bit confused when getting to the data because apparatus assmebly is impaired in the capsule-overproducing strain and although &quot;preserved&quot;, doesn't the data indicate that there is less T6SS assembly in the bfmS mutant and that this might be because of less cell sensing and isn't this a main point that there is a difference in apparatus assembly in the capsule overproducing strain compared to WT (other than no difference in apparatus assembly in the strain without capsule)? To me it seems not fully acknowledged as a finding in the interpretation of the data that less cells of the bfmS mutant have a T6SS apparatus. Isn't that interesting? A title along the lines of &quot;Capsule-overproducing strain has preserved sensory function and assembles less T6SS apparatuses&quot; would have been more intuitive for me. l. 352, In case I didn't miss a reference to this data earlier in the manuscript, I am wondering if it would be worth mentioning the finding on the reduced apparatus assembly of the bfmS mutant earlier, together with Figure 3 already. At least a sentence that mentions already that there is more coming later. When I got to this line in the manuscript and read the findings on the apparatus assembly, I first needed to go back to figure 3 and look at the data there again in light of this finding. It is mentioned here on the side but I think very important for the interpretation of the phenotypic data of the bfmS mutant shown earlier, isn't it? The tslA mutant is used beautifully here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and the kind comment about the ‘beautiful usage of the <italic>tslA</italic> mutant’.

On the one hand, I like the concise discussion. On the other hand, I see more potential here for bringing it all together (potentially at the expense of shortening some of the introduction). I think the subtleties of the findings are complex. For example, I could envision a graphical summary with a working model on all the effects of a capsule on the T6SS and its potential clinical relevance making the study accessible to even more readers.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we included a summarizing model as new Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significance</p><p>General assessment: I consider the story very strong in terms of novelty, experimental approaches used, quality of the data, quality of the writing and figures of the manuscript.

We hope the reviewer will be satisfied with the revised version of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In the manuscript by Flaugnatti et al., the authors provide clear evidence of the interplay between capsule outer coat production and the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) in Acinetobacter baumannii. The authors demonstrate that the presence of the capsule or the activity of the T6SS enhances survival against attacking bacteria. However, they also show that in their model bacterium, the (over)production of the capsule likely hinders T6SS dynamics, thereby reducing overall killing efficiency. Additionally, they reveal that the amount of the T6SS component Hcp is regulated in cells that can no longer assemble and/or secrete via the T6SS, presumably by the ClpXP protease. Overall, the experiments are well designed, and most conclusions are supported by the data and appropriate controls. I have however some suggestions that could further strengthen the manuscript prior to publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s enthusiasm and implemented their comments and suggestions in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>Line 164. The authors use <italic>E. coli</italic> as prey to test the T6SS activity of A. baumannii. Why not directly use the E. cloacae strain (with or without T6SS) for this purpose? This would provide direct evidence that A. baumannii uses its T6SS to kill E. cloacae, thus confirming the authors conclusions in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We used <italic>E. coli</italic> to assess the functionality of the T6SS in different strains of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, as it is commonly done in the T6SS field. However, as suggested by reviewer 1 (see minor comment #1) and in response to this query, we also provided survival data of <italic>E. cloacae</italic> in the revised manuscript using plasmid-carrying <italic>E. cloacae</italic> derivatives that allowed direct selection. The new data is shown in Figure 1-supplement 1C and D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2, the authors show that a non-capsulated strain kills more effectively and secretes more than a WT, but has a similar number of T6SS. They suggest in their conclusion that &quot;the observed increase in T6SS activity in the non-capsulated strain suggests a compensatory mechanism for the absence of the protective capsule layer.&quot; This conclusion implies the presence of an &quot;active&quot; regulatory mechanism that would increase the number of successful T6SS firing events, which has not been demonstrated. Could it not simply be that the capsule blocks some shots that cannot penetrate and are therefore ineffective? This hypothesis is mentioned in lines 204-208. The authors should clarify the conclusion of this section. Given the challenge this may pose in A. baumannii, I suggest that the authors quantify the assembly/firing dynamics of the T6SS under WT and ΔitrA conditions. This would help distinguish between the two hypotheses explaining better firing in non-capsulated cells: i.e., if the number of assembled T6SS is the same in both strains (Figure 2C and 2D), do non-capsulated cells assemble/fire faster, indicating an adaptation in regulation, or do we observe the same dynamics, suggesting a simple physical barrier blocking the passage of certain T6SS firing events?</p></disp-quote><p>We realize that the sentence, and more specifically the word &quot;compensatory,&quot; might have been misleading and thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. What we meant to convey is that there is a balance between capsule production and T6SS activity; if disturbed, the balance shifts in one direction or the other. Specifically, there is more protection through the production of a thicker capsule (e.g., in the ∆<italic>bfmS</italic> mutant or under sub-MIC conditions of antibiotics, regulated by the Bfm system, as mentioned in the text) or more T6SS activity when less capsule is present (e.g., in the Δ<italic>itrA</italic> mutant, which we propose is caused by the lack of the steric hindrance). We rephrased this sentence in the revised manuscript to better convey this message.</p><p>Regarding the quantification of T6SS dynamic assembly/firing events between the capsulated (WT) and non-capsulated (ΔitrA) strains, we do not think this is required for this study, as the amount of secreted Hcp reflects the overall activity of the system. Importantly, we also do not have the technical means to quantify assembly/firing rates under Biosafety 2 conditions, as this requires specialized microscopes with very fast acquisition options (see, for instance, Basler, Pilhofer et al., 2012, Nature). Indeed, very few labs in the T6SS field have been able to measure such rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 428-429. It is mentioned that the deletion of lon does not have a notable effect. However, I observe that the absence of Lon alone causes a more rapid degradation of Hcp in the cells compared to the WT strain (Figure 7B). How do the authors explain that the absence of this protease (whether under conditions of Hcp accumulation or not) increases the degradation of this protein in the cell? This explanation should be included in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>That’s a fair point. We didn’t address this point further, as the deletion of <italic>lon</italic> didn’t resolve the issue of why Hcp is degraded. In fact, the opposite seems to be the case, as there is less Hcp in the ∆<italic>lon</italic> strain compared to the WT. While this observation is not directly relevant to the question of why Hcp is degraded late during growth in secretion-impaired strains, we mentioned it in the revised manuscript, as suggested.</p><p>Please also note that a strong growth defect of a Δ<italic>lon</italic>Δ<italic>clpXP</italic> double mutant impaired further investigation in this direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, the authors use the term &quot;predator&quot; to refer to A. baumannii. Predation is a specific phenomenon that involves killing for nourishment. To my knowledge, the T6SS has never been shown to be a predation weapon but rather a weapon for interbacterial competition, which is a different concept. If this has not been demonstrated in A. baumannii, the authors should replace the term &quot;predator&quot; with &quot;attacker&quot; (or an equivalent term) to clarify the context.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The term “predator,” as highlighted by the reviewer, typically implies killing for nourishment/cellular products. In the context of T6SS, it facilitates the killing of competitors, releasing DNA into the environment that can subsequently be acquired through natural competence for transformation, as observed in species like <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (our work by Borgeaud et al., 2015, Science) or other <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species such as <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic> (Ringel et al., 2017, Cell Rep.; Cooper et al., 2017, <italic>eLife</italic>). The acquisition of DNA reflects the killing for cellular products of the prey. As most <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains are also naturally competent, this justifies the usage of the predator and prey nomenclature.</p><p>Apart from this fact, it seems to be a matter of nomenclature, with many papers in the field using one term or the other. Yet, ultimately, this doesn’t change any of the scientific findings. Therefore, to address this point of critique, we changed the term ‘predator’ to ‘attacker’ throughout the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 274. Since the authors stated that in the Wzc mutant, the capsule is &quot;predominantly found in the supernatant and only loosely attached to the cell,&quot; this result is not unexpected. This finding is also consistent with the previous results from Figure 3A and B, which show sensitivity to complement-mediated killing and the weak amount of (ab)normal CPS produced in that strain, further confirmed by Figure 3E</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s suggestion and removed the statement from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 299. The authors speculate that &quot;… T6SS may deploy through gaps akin to arrow-slits in the capsule's mesh…&quot;. However, this is very unlikely since a WT strain kills (Figure 3C) and secretes (Figure 2B and 3D) less effectively than the itrA mutant, suggesting that the T6SS is not assembled in the &quot;right places&quot; devoid of CPS; otherwise, we would expect similar T6SS activity. Based on the results in Figure 2 (and my earlier comment), this implies that A. baumannii assembles its T6SS randomly, and in the presence of the capsule, its shots would need to be in the right place to penetrate the envelope and reach the target. Could the authors comment on this point and provide a model figure to better visualize the interplay between the capsule and T6SS under the three major conditions: WT, non-capsulated, and capsule overproduction?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and agree with their comment. We discussed the hypothesis of T6SS deployment through gaps, drawing a parallel to what was proposed for biofilm/EPS and T6SS in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (Toska et al., 2018, PNAS). To clarify our findings further, we now included a model summarizing our results as new Figure 8, as also requested by reviewer 1 (see minor comment #7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5A, the microscopy panels should be adjusted to the same dynamic range as the WT (which represents a true signal), which does not appear to be the case for the tlsA mutant panel for instance. The image gives the impression of a large amount of free TssB-msfGFP in the cytoplasm. However, this effect is due to the dynamic range being adjusted to display a signal. This observation is consistent with the fact that the amount of TssB-msfGFP protein is identical across all strains (Figure S2F).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In fact, all images were adjusted to the same dynamic range as the WT in our initial submission. The observed differences in fluorescence intensity in Figure 5, which we confirmed by quantifying total fluorescence per cell (new Figure 5-supplement 1A), were also unexpected to us. Thus, during the revision, we consulted an expert from our microscopy facility, who confirmed that acquisition times and channel adjustments were identical for all samples. Given that TssB-msfGFP protein levels were consistent between <italic>bfmS</italic>-positive and <italic>bfmS</italic>-negative strains, we speculate that GFP folding might be affected in the ΔbfmS background.</p><p>Importantly, regardless of image presentation, the enumeration of T6SS structures remains consistent, with the “dimmer” Δ<italic>bfmS</italic>Δ<italic>itrA</italic> strain displaying WT-like T6SS sheath assembly, which was the primary focus of this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unless I am mistaken, the authors do not comment on the fact that in a ΔbfmS strain, the number of T6SS is halved compared to a WT or ΔitrA strain. If capsule overproduction only partially limits the TslA-dependant T6SS assembly, how can this result be explained? Is it related to the degradation of Hcp in this background, which ultimately limits the formation of T6SS? If so, it would be interesting to mention this connection in the section &quot;Prolonged secretion inhibition triggers Hcp degradation”</p><p>We do not believe that the reduced T6SS assembly observed in the Δ<italic>bfmS</italic> background (Figure 5) is linked to Hcp degradation, as the latter process occurs only in the later growth phase (see Figure 6C). Therefore, we refrained from speculating this connection in the section ‘<italic>Prolonged secretion inhibition triggers Hcp degradation’</italic>.</p><p>Significance</p><p>This work is highly intriguing as it not only delves into the specific mechanisms involved but also connects fundamental elements in bacterial competition, i.e., the necessity for self-protection and aggression for survival.

The work is well-done and the writing is also clear.
