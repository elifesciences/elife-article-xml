However, the reporting of statistical methods for studies in the biomedical sciences is often limited. This systematic review examines the quality of reporting for two statistical tests, t-tests and ANOVA, for papers published in a selection of physiology journals in June 2017. Of the 328 original research articles examined, 277 (84.5%) included an ANOVA or t-test or both. However, papers in our sample were routinely missing essential information about both types of tests: 213 papers (95% of the papers that used ANOVA) did not contain the information needed to determine what type of ANOVA was performed, and 26.7% of papers did not specify what post-hoc test was performed. Most papers also omitted the information needed to verify ANOVA results. Essential information about t-tests was also missing in many papers. We conclude by discussing measures that could be taken to improve the quality of reporting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>analysis of variance</kwd><kwd>t-test</kwd><kwd>transparency</kwd><kwd>meta-research</kwd><kwd>systematic review</kwd><kwd>statistics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16GRNT30950002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissgerber</surname><given-names>Tracey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1 TR000135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissgerber</surname><given-names>Tracey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000871</institution-id><institution>Mayo Clinic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Robert W Fulk Career Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissgerber</surname><given-names>Tracey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03-CA212127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winham</surname><given-names>Stacey J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Walter and Evelyn Simmers Career Development Award for Ovarian Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winham</surname><given-names>Stacey J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Many papers in basic biomedical science do not contain the information that is needed to determine what statistical tests were used and to verify the results of these tests.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The inability to reproduce key scientific results in certain areas of research is a growing concern among scientists, funding agencies, journals and the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nature, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fosang and Colbran, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">National Institutes of Health, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">National Institutes of Health, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nature, 2017</xref>). Problems with the statistical analyses used in published studies, along with inadequate reporting of the experimental and statistical techniques employed in the studies, are likely to have contributed to these concerns. Older studies suggest that statistical errors, such as failing to specify what test was used or using incorrect or suboptimal statistical tests, are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Müllner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ruxton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Strasak et al., 2007</xref>), and more recent studies suggest that these problems persist. A study published in 2011 found that half of the neuroscience articles published in five top journals used inappropriate statistical techniques to compare the magnitude of two experimental effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011</xref>). A more recent study of papers reporting the results of experiments that examined the effects of prenatal interventions on offspring found that the statistical analyses in 46% of the papers were invalid because authors failed to account for non-independent observations (i.e., animals from the same litter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lazic et al., 2018</xref>). Many studies omit essential details when describing experimental design or statistical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Real et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lazic et al., 2018</xref>). Errors in reported p-values are also common and can sometimes alter the conclusions of a study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuijten et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A main principle of the SAMPL guidelines for reporting statistical analyses and methods in the published literature is that authors should &quot;describe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results&quot; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lang and Altman, 2013</xref>). However, these guidelines have not been widely adopted.</p><p>Clear statistical reporting also allows errors to be identified and corrected prior to publication. The journal <italic>Science</italic> has attempted to improve statistical reporting by adding a Statistical Board of Reviewing Editors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McNutt, 2014</xref>). Other journals, including <italic>Nature</italic> and affiliated journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nature, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nature, 2017</xref>), <italic>eLife</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Teare, 2016</xref>) and <italic>The EMBO Journal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">EMBO Press, 2017</xref>) have recently implemented policies to encourage transparent statistical reporting. These policies may include specifying which test was used for each analysis, reporting test statistics and exact p-values, and using dot plots, box plots or other figures that show the distribution of continuous data.</p><p>T-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are the statistical bread-and-butter of basic biomedical science research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Strasak et al., 2007</xref>). However, statistical methods in these papers are often limited to vague statements such as: &quot;Data were analyzed by t-tests or ANOVA, as appropriate, and statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.&quot; There are several problems with such descriptions. First, there are many different types of t-tests and ANOVAs. Vague statistical methods deprive reviewers, editors and readers of the opportunity to confirm that an appropriate type of t-test or ANOVA was used and that the results support the conclusions in the paper. For example, if authors use an unpaired t-test when a paired t-test is needed, the failure to account for repeated measurements on the same subject will lead to an incorrect p-value. Analyses that use inappropriate tests give potentially misleading results because the tests make incorrect assumptions about the study design or data and often test the wrong hypothesis. Without the original data, it is difficult to determine how the test results would have been different had an appropriate test been used. Clear reporting allows readers to confirm that an appropriate test was used and makes it easier to identify and fix potential errors prior to publication.</p><p>The second problem is that stating that tests were used &quot;as appropriate&quot; relies on the assumption that others received similar statistical training and would make the same decisions. This is problematic because it is possible to complete a PhD without being trained in statistics: only 67.5% of the top NIH-funded physiology departments in the United States required statistics training for some or all PhD programs that the department participated in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Weissgerber et al., 2016a</xref>). When training is offered, course content can vary widely among fields, institutions and departments as there are no accepted standards for the topics that should be covered or the level of proficiency required. Moreover, courses are rarely designed to meet the needs of basic scientists who work with small sample size datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Weissgerber et al., 2016a</xref>). Finally, these vague statements fail to explain why t-tests and ANOVA were selected, as opposed to other techniques that can be useful for small sample size datasets.</p><p>This systematic review focuses on the quality of reporting for ANOVA and t-tests, which are two of the most common statistical tests performed in basic biomedical science papers. Our objectives were to determine whether articles provided sufficient information to determine which type of ANOVA or t-test was performed and to verify the test result. We also assessed the prevalence of two common problems: i) using a one-way ANOVA when the study groups could be divided into two or more factors, and ii) not specifying that the analysis included repeated measures or within-subjects factors when ANOVA was performed on non-independent or longitudinal data.</p><p>To obtain our sample two reviewers independently examined all original research articles published in June 2017 (n = 328, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in the top 25% of physiology journals, as determined by 2016 journal impact factor (see Methods for full details). Disagreements were resolved by consensus. 84.5% of the articles (277/328) included either a t-test or an ANOVA, and 38.7% of articles (127/328) included both. ANOVA (n = 225, 68.6%) was more common than t-tests (n = 179, 54.5%). Among papers that reported the number of factors for at least one ANOVA, most were using a maximum of one (n = 112, 49.8%) or two (n = 69, 30.7%) factors. ANOVAs with three or more factors were uncommon (n = 6, 2.7%). This approach involved a number of limitations. All the journals in our sample were indexed in PubMed and only published English language articles, so our results may not be generalizable to brief reports, journals with lower impact factors, journals that publish articles in other languages, or journals that are not indexed in PubMed. Further research is also needed to determine if statistical reporting practices in other fields are similar to what we found in physiology.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36163.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Systematic review flow chart.</title><p>The flow chart illustrates the selection of articles for inclusion in this analysis at each stage of the screening process.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36163.003</object-id><label>Figure 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Data from systematic review.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-36163-fig1-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36163-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Can we determine which type of ANOVA was performed?</title><p>While ANOVA encompasses a wide variety of techniques, basic biomedical science papers generally use one and two-way ANOVAs, with or without repeated measures.

Examples of factors might include age (young vs. old), hypertension (hypertensive vs. normotensive) or time since drug administration (baseline, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours).</p><p># The groups or conditions within each factor are called levels. In the example above, age has two levels (young vs. old), hypertension has two levels, and time since drug administration has five levels.</p><p># Each factor can be entered into the ANOVA as a between-subjects factor or a within-subjects factor. Measurements on unrelated participants, specimens or samples (i.e., age, hypertension) are entered into the ANOVA as between-subjects factors. Longitudinal measurements (i.e., time since drug administration) are entered into the analysis as within-subjects factors.</p><p># Other types of non-independent measurements may also be entered as within-subjects factors. This includes related measurements that are performed in the same participants (i.e., arm vs. leg), or groups in which subjects are matched (i.e., normotensive and hypertensive participants matched for sex and age).</p><p># An ANOVA that includes at least one within-subjects factor is called repeated measures ANOVA.</p><p># A repeated-measures ANOVA with two or more factors may include between-subjects factors, depending on the study design. For example, a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with one between and one within-subjects factor might be used for a study in which men and women completed four weeks of exercise training. Sex (female vs. male) would be a between-subjects factor, whereas exercise training (baseline vs. post-training) would be a within-subjects factor. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA with two within-subjects factors might be used for a study in which vascular function was measured in both arms (right vs. left), before and after 4 weeks of right arm handgrip training (baseline vs. post-training).</p><p># Post-hoc tests are used to determine which groups in the ANOVA differ from each other. These tests are used when p-values for the ANOVA show that there is a significant effect of any factor, or a significant interaction between two or more factors. There are many different types of post-hoc tests. These tests use different procedures to determine which groups to compare and adjust for multiple comparisons; some are more conservative than others.</p></boxed-text><boxed-text id="box2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36163.005</object-id><label>Box 2.</label><caption><p>Checklist for clear statistical reporting for t-tests and ANOVAs</p></caption><p>Basic biomedical science studies often include several small experiments.

Among papers that used one-way ANOVAs, 60.9% (67/110) used a one-way ANOVA for an analysis where the study design included two or more factors. (Note: Two papers that reported using a maximum of one factor in the ANOVA were excluded, as these papers also included a repeated measures ANOVA with an unknown number of factors.) For example, investigators might have used a one-way ANOVA to compare four independent groups: wild-type mice that received vehicle (placebo), wild-type mice that received a treatment, knockout mice that received vehicle (placebo), and knockout mice that received a treatment. This approach may be appropriate for extremely small sample sizes, as these datasets may not have enough power for an ANOVA with two or more factors. In most cases, however, a two-way ANOVA with mouse strain (wild-type vs. knockout) and treatment (placebo vs. treatment) as factors may provide more information. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show the difference between these two approaches and illustrate how the two-way ANOVA may offer additional insight. The two-way ANOVA allows investigators to examine the effects of both factors simultaneously and may help investigators to avoid unnecessary post-hoc tests. If the sample size is large enough, the two-way ANOVA can test for an interaction between the two factors (i.e., whether the effect of mouse strain depends on treatment).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36163.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Why it matters whether investigators use a one-way vs two-way ANOVA for a study design with two factors.</title><p>The two-way ANOVA allows investigators to determine how much of the variability explained by the model is attributed to the first factor, the second factor, and the interaction between the two factors. When a one-way ANOVA is used for a study with two factors, this information is missed because all variability explained by the model is assigned to a single factor. We cannot determine how much variability is explained by each of the two factors, or test for an interaction.

When used for a study with two factors, the one-way ANOVA incorrectly assumes that the groups are unrelated, generates a single p-value that does not provide information about which groups are different, and does not test for interactions. The two-way ANOVA correctly interprets the study design, which can increase power. The two-way ANOVA also allows for the generation of a set of p-values that provide more information about which groups may be different, can test for interactions, and may eliminate the need for unnecessary post-hoc comparisons. This figure uses an experimental design with four groups (wild-type mice receiving placebo, wild-type mice receiving an experimental drug, knockout mice receiving placebo and knockout mice receiving an experimental drug).

Many of the 15 papers that provided adequate information reported using one-way repeated measures ANOVA. When the ANOVA only includes one factor, stating that repeated measures were used demonstrates that this factor was treated as a within-subjects or non-independent factor. When a repeated measures ANOVA includes two or more factors, however, authors need to clearly report which factors were treated as between vs. within-subjects factors. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA could refer to two different tests – an ANOVA with two within-subjects factors, or an ANOVA with one within-subjects factor and one between-subjects factor (<xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>).</p><p>The remaining 81.8% of papers that included ANOVA did not indicate whether repeated measures were used. Only one of these papers stated that all factors were entered as between-subjects factors (1/184, 0.5%). If repeated measures or within-subjects factors are not mentioned, one would typically assume that all factors were independent or between-subjects. Our data suggest that scientists should be cautious about this assumption, as 28.3% of papers that did not indicate that repeated measures were used (52/184) included at least one ANOVA that appeared to require repeated measures. There is no way to distinguish between papers that used the wrong test and papers that failed to clearly specify which test was used. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the differences between these two tests. Failing to account for repeated measures in an ANOVA makes it less likely that investigators will detect an effect, as the variability that can be attributed to individual subjects remains unexplained. To avoid confusion, we recommend that reviewers, editors and journal guidelines encourage authors to specify whether each factor was entered as between or within-subjects factor, even if the paper does not include a repeated measures ANOVA.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36163.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Why it matters whether investigators used an ANOVA with vs. without repeated measures.</title><p>This figure highlights the differences between ANOVA with vs. without repeated measures and illustrates the problems with using an ANOVA without repeated measures when the study design includes longitudinal or non-independent measurements.

While the term Student’s t-test traditionally refers to the unpaired t-test for equal variances, we identified numerous instances where authors referred to a paired t-test as a Student’s t-test. Due to this confusion, we did not assume that the Student’s t-test was unpaired unless the authors included additional terms like unpaired t-test or independent samples t-test. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> illustrates why clear reporting that allows readers to confirm that the correct test was used is essential. Unpaired and paired t-tests interpret the data differently, test different hypotheses, use different information to calculate the test statistic and usually give different results. If the incorrect test is used, the analysis tests the wrong hypothesis and the results may be misleading. Without the original data, it is difficult to determine how the test results would have been different had the appropriate tests been used.For example, differencesbetween the results of the paired and unpaired t-tests depend on the strength of the correlation between paired data points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which is difficult or impossible to determine from line graphs that only show summary statistics.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36163.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Why papers need to contain sufficient detail to confirm that the appropriate t-test was used.</title><p>This figure highlights the differences between unpaired and paired t-tests by illustrating how these tests interpret the data differently, test different hypotheses, use information differently when calculating the test statistic, and give different results.

The comments on the right side of the figure illustrate what happens when an unpaired t-test is inappropriately used to compare paired, or related, measurements. We expect paired data to be positively correlated – two paired observations are usually more similar than two unrelated observations. The strength of this correlation will vary. We expect observations from the same participant to be more similar (strongly correlated) than observations from pairs of participants matched for age and sex. Stronger correlations result in greater discrepancies between the results of the paired and unpaired t-tests. Very strong correlations between paired data are unusual but are presented here to illustrate this relationship. We do not expect paired data to be negatively correlated – if this happens it is important to review the experimental design and data to ensure that everything is correct.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36163-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Equal vs. unequal variance</title><p>When using unpaired t-tests, it is important to specify whether the test assumes that the variance is equal in both groups. The unpaired Student’s t-test (also called the t-test for equal variances) assumes that the variance is similar in both groups, whereas the Welch’s t-test (the t-test for unequal variances) assumes that variance differs between the two groups. If the variance is not estimated appropriately, the type I error is actually higher than advertised; this means that the null hypothesis is falsely rejected more often (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ruxton, 2006</xref>). Among the 155 papers that included unpaired t-tests, 64.5% (100/155) reported whether the test assumed equal variance for all unpaired t-tests and 6.5% (10/155) provided this information for some unpaired tests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Papers rarely contain information needed to verify the test result</title><p>Reporting the test statistic (ANOVA: F-statistic, t-tests: t-statistic), degrees of freedom and exact p-values are important for several reasons. First, these values allow authors, reviewers and editors to confirm that the correct test was used. This is particularly important when the statistical methods do not provide enough information to determine which type of ANOVA or t-test was performed, which was common in our dataset. Second, reporting the degrees of freedom allows readers to confirm that no participants, animals or samples were excluded without explanation. A recent study found that more than two thirds of papers using animal models to study stroke or cancer did not contain sufficient information to determine whether animals were excluded, while 7-8% of papers excluded animals without explanation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Holman et al., 2016</xref>). Biased exclusion of animals or observations can substantially increase the probability of false positive results in small sample size studies. Third, this information allows authors and readers to verify the test result. In an analysis of psychology papers, over half reported at least one p-value that did not match the test statistic and degrees of freedom: this error was sufficient to alter the study conclusions in one out of eight papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuijten et al., 2016</xref>). Authors and journal editors can eliminate these errors by double checking their results, or using software programs such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://statcheck.io">statcheck</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eskamp and Nuijten, 2016</xref>) to confirm that p-values match the reported test statistic and degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, the information needed to verify the test result is not reported in many papers.</p><p>Among the studies in our sample that included ANOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), more than 95% failed to report the F-statistic or degrees of freedom. Moreover, 77.8% of these papers reported ranges of p-values (i.e., p&gt;0.05, p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01), with just 50 papers reporting exact p-values (41 of 225 papers reported exact p-values for some ANOVAs, and 9 papers reported exact p-values for all ANOVAs). Among studies that included t-tests, 16 papers (8.9%) were excluded because abstractors were unable to determine what data were analyzed by t-tests or to identify a two-group comparison. While most papers reported the sample size or degrees of freedom for some (16.6%) or all (76.7%) t-tests, t-statistics were missing from 95.7% of papers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Selecting statistical tests that are not appropriate for the study design may be surprisingly common. Often, it is not possible to determine why statistical tests were selected, or whether other analyses may have provided more insight. Investigators frequently present data using bar or line graphs that only show summary statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Weissgerber et al., 2015</xref>) and raw data are rarely available. Many journals have recently introduced policies to encourage more informative graphics, such as dot plots, box plots or violin plots, that show the data distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nature, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fosang and Colbran, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kidney International, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">PLOS Biology, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Teare, 2016</xref>) and may provide insight into whether other tests are needed. Non-parametric tests, such as the Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon sign rank test and Kruskal Wallis test, may sometimes be preferable as sample sizes in basic biomedical science research are often too small to determine the data distribution. However, these tests are not commonly used. A systematic review of physiology studies showed that 3.8% used only non-parametric tests to compare continuous data, 13.6% used a combination of parametric and non-parametric tests, and 78.1% of studies used only parametric tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Weissgerber et al., 2015</xref>).

While p-values focus on whether the difference is statistically significant, effect sizes answer the question: &quot;how big is the difference?&quot; A published tutorial provides more details on how to calculate effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lakens, 2013</xref>). Presenting confidence intervals provides more information about the uncertainty of the estimated statistic (i.e., mean, effect size, correlation coefficient). A guide to robust statistical methods in neuroscience examines a variety of newer methods to address the problems with hypothesis tests, and includes information on techniques that are suitable for studies with small sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wilcox and Rousselet, 2018</xref>). Small, underpowered studies frequently produce inconclusive results that may appear to be contradictory. Meta-analyses combine these divergent results to provide a comprehensive assessment of the size and direction of the true effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cumming, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The findings of the present study highlight the need for investigators, journal editors and reviewers to work together to improve the quality of statistical reporting in submitted manuscripts.

In contrast, a randomized controlled trial of animal studies submitted to PLoS One demonstrated that asking authors to complete the ARRIVE checklist at the time of submission had no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hair et al., 2018</xref>).

The authors focused on the use of t-tests and ANOVA. They conclude that key information was routinely absent. Similar studies have been published in the past that describe the problems with statistical analysis of scientific papers. However, with the change in Guidelines to Authors instituted by many journals over recent years, it might have been hoped that the situation had improved. Sadly, that does not appear to be the case. The paper includes several figures that demonstrate the challenges that arise when data is inappropriately analysed: these are very useful. The authors are to be congratulated on a clear, well-written, compelling study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>a) Given the authors are stating that reporting initiatives are urgently needed, it is a shame that they did not use the PRISMA guidelines to draft the manuscript.

We have also integrated the SAMPL guidelines for statistical reporting in the Introduction. The SAMPL guidelines are very general and may not include adequate information for scientists with little or no statistical training to determine what details should be reported. This paper is designed to provide basic biomedical scientists with more information about why it is important to include additional information so that readers can determine whether an appropriate type of ANOVA or t-test was performed. While we focus on t-tests and ANOVA because they are the most common, the same principles apply to other types of tests.</p><p>We always follow all relevant aspects of the PRISMA guidelines as part of our standard protocol for conducting systematic reviews. However, it is important to note that large portions of the guidelines do not apply to literature surveys or to systematic reviews without a meta-analysis. For example, search terms are not included because no selective electronic search was performed. Journals were identified by selecting the top 25% of journals, according to 2016 impact factor, in the physiology category of the Journal Citation Reports database. Articles were then identified by examining journal websites to identify all articles in issues published in June 2017. This process was completed by two independent reviewers. The PRISMA guidelines recommend a structured Abstract, however this contradicts this journal’s requirements for features articles. Elements such as PICO, risk of bias assessments, and reporting of elements relevant to meta-analyses are not relevant to this literature survey.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The manuscript selects instances where a t-test or an ANOVA have been performed.

First, while t-tests and ANOVA are very common, our previous work has shown that non-parametric tests are not. We examined articles published in the top 25% of physiology journals during a three-month period in 2014 (Weissgerber et al., 2015). We found that 78.1% of studies used only parametric tests to compare continuous data (i.e. t-tests and ANOVA), 13.6% used a combination of parametric and non-parametric tests, and 3.8% used only non-parametric tests. We have now described this data in the manuscript. Second, there are many different types of ANOVAs and t-tests; therefore additional detail is needed to determine which test was performed. In contrast, the name of the non-parametric test (i.e. Kruskal-Wallis, Mann Whitney, Wilcoxon Rank Sum, Wilcoxon Signed Rank) is sufficient because these tests do not have variations.</p><p>We understand the reviewers’ desire for a single paper that outlines the problems with the reporting of existing analyses, addresses the misconceptions that lead to these reporting errors and shows how to correct them, and also describes how to select more informative or optimal tests. However, it is important to be realistic about what can be accomplished in a single paper designed for basic biomedical scientists, many of whom have limited or no statistical training. There are several papers that address the problems with t-tests and ANOVA and describe how to select more informative alternatives. Although these papers tend to be quite long, the authors frequently note that they are intended to supplement existing statistical knowledge and are not a substitute for statistical training. We have rewritten the last section of the paper to briefly address other approaches and referred readers to existing resources for additional information. A shift away from hypothesis testing in basic biomedical science will require retraining the scientific workforce, which will take time. It is likely that most investigators will continue to perform t-tests and ANOVA in the near future; hence, efforts to improve reporting for these techniques are needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The checklist provided in box 2 does not have prompts for effect sizes and confidence intervals to be reported.
