by specific regulatory circuits, the abundance of proteins and transcripts can also be influenced by physiological states of the cell such as growth rate and metabolism. Here we examine the control of gene expression by growth rate and metabolism, by analyzing a multi-omics dataset consisting of absolute-quantitative abundances of the transcriptome, proteome, and amino acids in 22 steady-state yeast cultures. We find that transcription and translation are coordinately controlled by the cell growth rate via RNA polymerase II and ribosome abundance, but they are independently controlled by nitrogen metabolism via amino acid and nucleotide availabilities. Genes in central carbon metabolism, however, are distinctly regulated and do not respond to the cell growth rate or nitrogen metabolism as all other genes. Understanding these effects allows the confounding factors of growth rate and metabolism to be accounted for in gene expression profiling studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>growth rate</kwd><kwd>nitrogen metabolism</kwd><kwd>central carbon metabolism</kwd><kwd>amino acid metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF10CC1016517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Rosemary</given-names></name><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Rosemary</given-names></name><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Global gene expression control mechanisms are modeled using a large dataset consisting of absolute-quantitative proteomics, transcriptomics, and partial metabolomics of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> at a wide range of growth conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the presence of environmental or genetic perturbations, differential expression of genes, orchestrated by dedicated regulatory circuits, shapes the physiological responses of the cell. Common physiological responses to perturbations, for example in response to stress or during oncogenic transformation, often include changes in the cell growth rate and metabolism. Both growth rate and metabolism in turn influence gene expression: a faster growing cell doubles its transcriptome and proteome in a shorter amount of time, and synthesis of transcripts and proteins demand energy and building blocks to be supplied through metabolism. Seminal studies in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Slavov and Botstein, 2011</xref>) have previously examined the interaction between growth rate, metabolism, and gene expression, using microarrays and relative-quantitative metabolomics, in the eukaryal model organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. However, absolute-quantitative concentrations of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites are needed to understand the precise influence of growth rate and metabolism on gene expression and to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. Understanding these effects would allow studies of specific environmental or genetic perturbations to uncouple the perturbation-specific regulation of gene expression from gene expression control exerted by differences in cell growth or metabolism. In bioengineering applications, this would also allow synthetic gene circuits with complex behaviors to be designed, a key goal of synthetic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shahrezaei and Marguerat, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Slavov et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Herein we examine the absolute-quantitative transcriptomic, proteomic, and intracellular amino acid concentrations, in a total of 22 steady-state yeast chemostat cultures in biological triplicates, designed to orthogonally probe the effects of growth rate and nitrogen metabolism on gene expression. The 22 chemostat conditions consist of 14 which we have performed in this study and 9 which were performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xia, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xia, 2019b</xref>, with one condition being a duplicate between the two studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that growth rate and metabolism influence the expression of ~90% of genes; however, genes in central carbon metabolism represented a major group of genes that were exceptions to these effects. The gene expression changes associated with growth rate were highly coordinated between transcript abundance and protein abundance and reflected the availabilities of the transcription and translation machineries. In contrast, the coordination between transcript and protein concentrations was lost when amino acid and nucleotide availabilities were modulated experimentally without changing the cell growth rate. Finally, by re-analyzing gene expression profiles of a distantly related yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, and of the human Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line P493–6, we demonstrated that these effects on gene expression by the cell growth rate and metabolism can be uncoupled from gene expression regulation by specific environmental and genetic perturbations, allowing novel biological insights in gene expression regulation to be uncovered.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Regulation of gene expression by the physiological state of the cell.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design to orthogonally probe the effects of growth rate and nitrogen metabolism on gene expression.

We then profiled the absolute-quantitative transcriptomic and proteomic abundances (mmol/gDW) of these chemostat cultures in biological triplicates, generating a multi-omics dataset containing 3127 transcript–protein pairs across 14 conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). In both GR and NM experiments, we found &gt;2,000 genes to be differentially expressed at both the transcript and protein levels with false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01 (one-way ANOVA comparing all conditions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that gene expression is subject to extensive control by both growth rate and nitrogen metabolism. A total of 1493 genes (48%) in the GR experiments, and 1959 genes (63%) in the NM experiments, were differentially expressed not only significantly, but by more than twofold. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, we present the total protein–RNA correlation of these chemostat cultures, with a Pearson r of 0.51 and a Spearman ρ of 0.27, and sample-wise proteome–transcriptome correlations, with a median Pearson r of 0.40 and Spearman ρ of 0.63, agreeing well with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lahtvee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marguerat et al., 2012</xref>).

This variability in the proteomics data reflects a mixed effect of inaccuracies in the proteomics methodology, and proteins that are partially synthesized, partially degraded, or not being part of its designated protein complex. For f1f0 ATP synthase, ATP15 and TIM11 were 4 orders of magnitude lower than the abundance of other subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), likely reflecting the difficulty in extracting and quantifying membrane-embedded proteins.</p><p>We further mined absolute-quantitative transcriptomics and proteomics data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xia, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xia, 2019b</xref> (XIA experiments), wherein <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were grown at nine different dilution rates with glucose being the limiting nutrient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Of these, one condition (carbon-limited, nitrogen source NH<sub>4</sub>, dilution rate 0.10 h<sup>−1</sup>) was duplicated in the chemostats that we performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); thus, the number of unique conditions examined in this study is a total of 22. Data from the XIA experiments, containing paired transcript-protein abundance of 2235 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), allowed us to validate our findings in the GR experiments in a different nutrient limitation setting.</p><p>Leveraging these absolute-quantitative data, we performed a series of exploratory analyses with the goal of describing the control of (1) transcription and (2) translation with respect to growth rate; and (3) transcription and (4) translation with respect to nitrogen metabolism. As transcript and protein abundances span several orders of magnitude, for ease of visualization we present most of our analyses using scaled expression levels; details of the scaling done can be found in the Materials and methods section, and the absolute concentrations can be found in supplementary files as indicated. We also suggest mechanisms and consequences of these observations, by examining the abundance of RNA polymerase II, ribosomes, and intracellular amino acid levels. The lessons learned from these analyses are collected into a conceptual model. We note however that this does not imply direct causation, rather hypotheses which should be tested by further experiments. Finally, we showcase the significance of understanding the effect of growth rate and metabolism on gene expression, by accounting for these confounding factors in a re-analysis of two previously published gene expression profiling datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Growth rate regulates a large number of transcripts with exceptions in central carbon metabolism</title><p>We first considered the regulation of mRNA abundance by growth rate. We used 25 clustering indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charrad et al., 2014</xref>) to determine the best clustering scheme for transcript abundance in the GR experiments and found that they fell into an optimal number of three clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Of note is that genes with low protein–transcript correlations contain higher proportions of Gln, Glu, Asn, and Asp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), which are central to the metabolism of all other amino acids as well as nucleic acids. Thus, it is possible that the uncoupling of translational regulation from transcriptional regulation in these genes represents a mechanism to allow intracellular amino acids to modulate protein abundance. We also found that the codon usage of genes with low protein–transcript correlation tend to have higher usage of purines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting that nucleic acid levels may also play a role in controlling the transcript abundance of these grenes and contributing to the uncoupling between transcription and translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Model of gene expression control by growth rate and metabolism</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, we collect the lessons learned from all of the above analyses into a conceptual model.

However, there is an inherent difference in growth rate between proliferating and quiescent cells, and quiescence was induced experimentally by nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marguerat et al., 2012</xref>). Together, we expect these differences in growth rate and nitrogen availability to influence the abundance of &gt;90% of transcripts. What, then, are the gene expression changes induced by quiescence per se, without the confounding factors of growth rate and nitrogen limitation? To answer this question, we took the transcriptome abundance and protein translation rates of proliferating <italic>S. pombe</italic> and calculated the theoretical transcriptome abundance and protein translation rates if reduced growth rate and limitation of the nitrogen source (NH<sub>4</sub>) were the only regulatory signals controlling differential gene expression.

As the expression of CCM genes generally do not follow the gene expression controls by growth rate and nitrogen metabolism, in the calculations of the theoretical transcriptome abundance and protein translation rates, we therefore considered them to be at a constant level for these genes.

We mined gene expression datasets in the B-cell line P493–6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feist et al., 2018</xref>), which carries a conditional <italic>c-Myc</italic> allele that can be experimentally turned on (MYC<sup>high</sup>), mimicking overexpression of the MYC transcription factor that is the driving oncogenic event in Burkitt’s lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schuhmacher et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2012</xref> quantified the absolute abundance of 1263 transcripts in the P493–6 cell system and found that 707 transcripts (56%) were upregulated by &gt;2-fold in MYC<sup>high</sup> cells. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feist et al., 2018</xref> quantified the absolute abundance of 1662 proteins and found that 871 proteins (52%) were upregulated by &gt;2-fold in MYC<sup>high</sup> P493–6 cells. However, MYC overexpression in P493–6 also leads to faster cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schuhmacher et al., 1999</xref>) and Gln dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feist et al., 2018</xref>), both of which could influence gene expression. We therefore sought to uncouple the effects of these physiological differences from the specific effects of MYC overexpression, which would help to elucidate direct MYC targets. Taking a similar approach as we have done in the re-analysis of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> dataset, we took the transcriptome abundance and protein translation rates of MYC<sup>low</sup> P493–6 cells and calculated the theoretical transcriptome abundance and protein translation rates if increased growth rate and usage of Gln as the nitrogen sources were the only regulatory signals controlling differential gene expression. Comparisons between the measured and calculated transcriptome abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and protein translation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) can then inform us of how gene expression is regulated by the MYC oncogene, without the secondary effects of increased growth rate and Gln usage. As before, we also considered all CCM genes (identified by AmiGO 2 term ‘cellular carbohydrate metabolic process’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AmiGO Hub et al., 2009</xref>) to be expressed constantly; thus, for CCM genes, the comparisons made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref> are equal to directly comparing the transcriptome abundance and protein translation rates between MYC<sup>high</sup>and MYC<sup>low</sup> P493–6 cells. Results indicated that the majority of the upregulated transcripts could be accounted for by changes in the cell growth rate and Gln usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), while MYC overexpression specifically upregulated 309 transcripts (24%) and downregulated 167 transcripts (13%). Similarly, protein translation dynamics in MYC<sup>high</sup> P493–6 cells were also largely accounted for by changes in the cell growth rate and Gln usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), with MYC overexpression causing the up- and downregulation of <italic>k<sub>sP</sub></italic> for 101 (6%) and 212 (13%) proteins, respectively. Genes with upregulated mRNA abundance generally had lowered <italic>k<sub>sP</sub></italic>, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that protein translation plays a buffering role in MYC-overexpressing cancer cells, producing dampened effects on protein abundance compared to changes in transcript abundance, which will be an important consideration in efforts to develop MYC-targeting therapeutics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Gene expression regulation is coupled with the physiological state of the cell such as growth rate and metabolism, which controls the availabilities of building blocks and energy, the abundance of RNA polymerases and ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klumpp et al., 2009</xref>), as well as the sizes of transcriptomic and proteomic reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mori et al., 2017</xref>). Here we quantified the effects of cell growth rate and nitrogen metabolism on gene expression, by analyzing an orthogonal multi-omics dataset consisting of paired absolute-quantitative transcript–protein abundances of 22 steady-state yeast cultures. Overall, &gt;90% of genes are regulated by the growth rate and/or nitrogen metabolism at both the transcript and protein levels, suggesting widespread confounding effects in gene expression profiling studies in which these factors are commonly neglected. The availabilities of RNA polymerase II and ribosomes are major contributors of differential gene expression with respect to the cell growth rate, while differential gene expression with respect to nitrogen metabolism occurs independently of these transcript and protein synthetic machineries. Additionally, transcription and translation are regulated in a coordinated manner in response to changing growth rate, but are regulated in distinct ways with respect to nitrogen metabolism, highlighting that interaction between different physiological parameters can be quite complex in regulating gene expression.</p><p>Previously we have shown that the cell growth rate determines the allocation of the proteome and transcriptome to different processes, including the relative abundance of RNA polymerases and ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Björkeroth et al., 2020</xref>). Our results here indicate that these growth rate-dependent changes in the transcription and translation machineries directly influence the absolute abundance of ~90% of genes. However, the expression of genes involved in CCM are independent of the cell growth rate. Of note, this means that the allocation of the transcriptome and proteome (i.e. the relative abundance normalized to total transcripts and protein abundance, respectively) to CCM would decrease with growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Peebo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Valgepea et al., 2013</xref>), highlighting this important distinction between absolute and relative quantification of gene expression. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauer et al., 2008</xref> have shown using relative-quantitative data that carbon metabolic processes are enriched in genes that are negatively correlated with growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauer et al., 2008</xref>). Here we showed that, in absolute-quantitative terms, CCM genes were expressed at constant levels independent of the cell growth rate. However, with 90% of genes having a positive relationship with the cell growth rate, in relative-quantitative terms, CCM genes would appear to be negatively regulated by the cell growth rate, consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We also showed that nitrogen metabolism acts as a regulator of gene expression by consistently modulating the overall abundance of 96% of transcripts. Differential gene expression with respect to nitrogen metabolism is not dependent on how much RNA polymerases and ribosomes are present in the cell, but instead is closely associated with the availability of amino acids and nucleotides, as well as the proportion of specific amino acids in the protein sequence and codon usage in the transcript. Genes demonstrating the strongest uncoupling of transcription and translation as two distinct points of regulation – that is, genes whose transcript and protein abundances were correlated especially poorly – were enriched for CCM processes, consistent with previous work showing that this central metabolic pathway is regulated by complex mechanisms to ensure robust output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2020a</xref>). These genes also contained higher proportions of Glu, Gln, Asp, and Asn, which are central to amino acid metabolism, and have higher usage of codons with higher purine content, together suggesting that amino acids and nucleotide metabolism may independently influence protein and transcript abundances, thereby contributing to a poor transcript–protein correlation.</p><p>In many experimental systems (e.g. drug treatment, wild type vs mutant, expression of transgenes), the physiological state of the cell is different between experimental conditions but is difficult to control for. Recent approaches to gain such control include the development of isogrowth gene expression profiling, whereby cell cultures treated with a 2D-drug gradient are sampled along a line of constant growth (the isobole), in order to dissect the gene expression changes without the confounding factor of changing growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lukačišin and Bollenbach, 2019</xref>). This methodology is however technically challenging and difficult to scale up. We show here that effects of growth rate and metabolism can be disentangled based on the results presented in this study. Of note, it is particularly important to take these effects into consideration when the fold-change in gene expression is small (i.e. a few fold), as very large changes (e.g. by orders of magnitude) are unlikely to be regulated by physiological parameters of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klumpp et al., 2009</xref>). One application of this is the gene expression changes in human cancer cells induced by overexpression of the oncogene MYC, which has been suggested to play an amplifier role to drive small increases in all expressed transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2012</xref>), but this effect is debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Walz et al., 2013</xref>). Our analysis indicates that the increase in gene expression is in line with altered cell physiology during MYC-driven oncogenic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feist et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schuhmacher et al., 1999</xref>), thereby allowing MYC-specific effects of transcript expression and protein translation to be identified. Thus, by understanding the effects of gene expression exerted by the physiological state of the cell, our results allow better analyses of gene expression profiles to gain novel biological insights, a key conceptual goal of systems biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CEN.PK113-7D</td><td valign="top">Nielsen lab</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">MATa, MAL2-8c, <italic>SUC2</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit</td><td valign="top">Qiagen</td><td valign="top">Cat # 74106</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat # Q32852</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit</td><td valign="top">Illumina</td><td valign="top">Cat # RS-122–2101</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat # 23225</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">TMT10plex Isobaric Label Reagent Set</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat # 90110</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">SCIEX aTRAQ Reagents Application Kit</td><td valign="top">Sciex</td><td valign="top">Cat # 4442678</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">UPS2 Proteomics Dynamic Range Standard</td><td valign="top">Sigma–Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # UPS2-1SET</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Proteome Discoverer 2.2</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Mascot 2.5.1</td><td valign="top">Matrix Science</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">R 4.0.3</td><td valign="top">R Project</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culture conditions</title><p>The yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CEN.PK113-7D (MATa, MAL2-8c, <italic>SUC2</italic>) was used for all experiments.

Linear regression between the absolute concentrations of these mRNAs and their corresponding FPKM values from RNAseq was performed to obtain the slope and y-intercept, which were used to quantify all mRNA in this study. The calculated mRNA abundance was then scaled to the total RNA content measured by Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). For proteomics, linear regression was calculated between the known log10 UPS2 concentrations and the log10 IBAQ abundances for the corresponding proteins. The resulting regression coefficients were used to estimate the absolute concentrations of all detected yeast proteins.</p><p>Protein translation rate <italic>k<sub>sP</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lahtvee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>) for each protein <italic>j</italic> was calculated by:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The gene-specific protein degradation rate (<italic>k<sub>dP</sub></italic>) for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was mined from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lahtvee et al., 2017</xref>.

In the GR dataset, the scaling is done as follows: for each gene, linear regression is performed between the data being scaled (transcript abundance, protein abundance, protein translation rate, or amino acid abundance) and the growth rate. The y-intercept is obtained, and the data being scaled is divided by the y-intercept. This scaled data is then plotted on a log2 scale, which can be interpreted intuitively as the fold-change from when the cells are growing at a theoretical growth rate of 0. In the NM dataset, the scaling is done as follows: for each gene, the data being scaled (transcript abundance, protein abundance, protein translation rate, or amino acid abundance) is divided by the mean of the data in nitrogen-limited Phe and Ile as nitrogen source conditions (samples 34, 35, 36, 40, 41, and 42, in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). This scaled data is then plotted on a log2 scale, and here the interpretation is the fold-change from when cells are growing with severe nitrogen restriction (i.e. nitrogen is limiting and the nitrogen source is non-preferred).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>Processed quantitative transcriptomics and proteomics data are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1b,c</xref>.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This study has generated a large amount of solid data in the form of a new multi-ome database containing combinations of absolute mRNA quantities, proteome and amino acid concentrations in a set yeast population grown in various conditions in chemostats. Apart from being a valuable resource for colleagues, analysis of the data confirms the results of several previous seminal studies, suggesting how protein levels correlate with mRNA abundance, growth parameters and/or amino acid and nucleotide levels.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Quantifying absolute gene expression profiles reveals distinct regulation of central carbon metabolism genes in yeast&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Kevin J Verstrepen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agree that while no further experimental work is needed, the paper needs to be thoroughly revised before it can be considered for publication. The consensus is that in its current form, the text does not make it clear what the exact goals and setup of the experiments were. In addition, some terminology seems ill-defined.</p><p>We would therefore ask a thorough revision to better highlight the central goal and strategy of the study, and better explain the logic behind the conclusions.</p><p>The individual reports below contain more detail that will hopefully help as you rework the text. As you can see, reviewers 2 and 3 in particular share the feeling that the flow and logic of the paper is lacking. We are optimistic that a thorough re-write will make the potential impact of this work that we see more apparent to future readers, but if there is any doubt, we will send the work back to reviewers for additional input.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Remark</p><p>While it is tempting to make speculations based on the observed correlations, and while I do believe that in general, the suggestions that the authors make are likely correct, it remains important to point out that correlations do not imply direct causation. Therefore, I'd suggest pointing this out explicitly, for example in the section that concludes that &quot;increasing growth rate modulated global gene expression via coordinated increases in both transcription and translation, by increasing the availability of RNA polymerase II and ribosomes.&quot; (and other similar parts).</p><p>Question</p><p>Is there any difference in the correlation between mRNA levels and protein abundance for proteins that contain different proportions of specific amino acids? And what about codon usage? One would expect that these are perhaps more important factors when different nitrogen sources are used, and less so when growth rate is controlled through the availability of a good nitrogen source? If so, this would perhaps provide further evidence for the hypotheses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Key point: Through a major rewrite they authors could better explain the intent of the paper, and the significance of the manuscript overall.</p><p>Important pieces of information are not explained, or are left to the Materials and methods section or another paper. For instance, the calculation of the protein translation rate is left to the Materials and methods section (even though it seems to be an important point) and from the main text, it is not clear how the &quot;coarse-graining approach&quot; (the &quot;framework&quot;?) works, even though the &quot;approach/framework&quot; could be the key aspect of the paper (see above). Notably, Shahrezaei and Marguerat, 2015, which is the paper the authors refer to with regards to the &quot;coarse-graining approach&quot; is a Current Opinion paper, which has no Materials and methods section. Thus, I really don't understand what the authors mean with the &quot;coarse-graining approach&quot; and what they did.</p><p>Maybe due to this vagueness, due to the relatively limited explanations, or possibly also due to my insufficient understanding of the material, I had trouble getting the model that the authors present (in Figure 7), and the analyses that the authors perform in the following.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper would be really valuable if rethought and rewritten from the base up. Decide on the main points you want to make (this part seems to be mostly done), and then devote a section/paragraph to each of them containing the supporting evidence. This will help the reader tremendously. Right now, it just feels like a treasure trove of anecdotes that is complicated to read.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65722.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agree that while no further experimental work is needed, the paper needs to be thoroughly revised before it can be considered for publication.

Indeed this has shown that proportions of Gln, Glu, Asp, and Asn in the protein sequence (among others), and usage of codons with higher purine content, are different between genes with high vs. low protein-transcript correlations, supporting our model that amino acid and nucleotides can regulate gene expression independently of RNA polymerases and ribosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Key point: Through a major rewrite they authors could better explain the intent of the paper, and the significance of the manuscript overall.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-structured our manuscript and re-written many sections of the text to increase clarity and flow.
