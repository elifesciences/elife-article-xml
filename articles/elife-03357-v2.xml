communication among its constituent neurons. However, factors that specify this characteristic feature of the SCN are unknown. Here, we identified <italic>Lhx1</italic> as a regulator of SCN coupling. A phase-shifting light pulse causes acute reduction in <italic>Lhx1</italic> expression and of its target genes that participate in SCN coupling. Mice lacking <italic>Lhx1</italic> in the SCN have intact circadian oscillators, but reduced levels of coupling factors. Consequently, the mice rapidly phase shift under a jet lag paradigm and their behavior rhythms gradually deteriorate under constant condition. Ex vivo recordings of the SCN from these mice showed rapid desynchronization of unit oscillators. Therefore, by regulating expression of genes mediating intercellular communication, Lhx1 imparts synchrony among SCN neurons and ensures consolidated rhythms of activity and rest that is resistant to photic noise.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03357.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03357.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03357.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As anyone who has experienced jet lag can testify, our sleeping pattern is normally synchronized with the local day–night cycle. Nevertheless, if a person is made to live in constant darkness as part of an experiment, they still continue to experience daily changes in their alertness levels. In most individuals, this internal ‘circadian rhythm’ repeats with a period of just over 24 hr, and exposure to light brings it into line with the 24-hr clock.</p><p>The internal circadian rhythm is generated by a structure deep within the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is essentially the ‘master clock’ of the brain. However, each cell within the SCN also contains its own clock, and can generate rhythmic activity independently of its neighbors. Cross-talk between these cells results in the production of a single circadian rhythm.</p><p>Now, Hatori et al. have identified the master regulator that controls this cross-talk. When mice living in 24-hr darkness were exposed to an hour of light in the early evening, they showed changes in the levels of proteins associated with many SCN genes. But one gene in particular, known as <italic>Lhx1,</italic> stood out because it was strongly suppressed by light.</p><p>Mice with a complete absence of <italic>Lhx1</italic> die in the womb. However, mice that lose <italic>Lhx1</italic> during embryonic development survive, although they struggle to maintain circadian rhythms when kept in complete darkness. This is not because their SCN cells fail to generate circadian rhythms. Instead, it is because the loss of <italic>Lhx1</italic>—a transcription factor that controls the expression of many other genes—means that the SCN cells do not produce the proteins they need to synchronize their outputs.</p><p>As well as identifying a key gene involved in the generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms, Hatori et al. have underlined the importance of cell-to-cell communication in these processes. These insights may ultimately have therapeutic relevance for individuals with sleep disturbances caused by jet lag, shift work or certain sleep disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03357.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03357.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>suprachiasmatic nucleus</kwd><kwd>Lhx1</kwd><kwd>VIP</kwd><kwd>Ror-alpha</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY016807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panda</surname><given-names>Satchidananda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK091618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panda</surname><given-names>Satchidananda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS31558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Leary</surname><given-names>Dennis D M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH086147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Leary</surname><given-names>Dennis D M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A transcription factor called Lhx1 coordinates the activity of the brain's master circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, by controlling communication between its constituent cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian clocks generate ∼24 hr rhythms in behavior and physiology which allow an organism to anticipate and adjust to environmental changes accompanying the earth's day/night cycle. These rhythms are generated in a cell-autonomous manner by transcription–translation based feedback loops which are composed of clock proteins, such as PERIOD (PER1, PER2, and PER3), CRYPTOCHROME (CRY1 and CRY2), CLOCK, BMAL1, REV-ERB (REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ), and ROR (RORα, RORβ, and RORγ) in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mohawk et al., 2012</xref>). These oscillatory loops reside in almost all tissue types and regulate their downstream effectors to generate oscillations in the steady-state mRNA levels of thousands of genes in a tissue-specific manner. Identification of tissue-specific circadian transcripts in peripheral organs has elucidated the mechanism by which circadian clocks dictate the temporal regulation of organ function. The tissue level clocks are organized in a hierarchical manner. The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) composed of ∼20,000 densely packed neurons acts as the master clock by orchestrating molecular oscillations in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Welsh et al., 2010</xref>). Tight intercellular communication among SCN neurons (coupling) drives synchronous oscillations. This, in turn, imparts overt rhythms in activity-rest and dependent rhythms in physiology and metabolism of the whole organism. While coupling between the SCN neurons buffers against the noise in oscillations of the constituent neurons, it is plastic enough to allow adaptive resetting of the phase of the SCN oscillator in response to changes in the environment.</p><p>Light is the principal cue for entraining the SCN circadian clock to environmental cycles. Light stimuli are perceived in the retina and transmitted to the SCN via melanopsin (OPN4)-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hatori and Panda, 2010</xref>). The time-of-the-day specific response (called ‘gating’) of the SCN to light pulses properly adjusts the phase of the circadian clock. In mice held under constant darkness, light administered at subjective daytime, subjective evening, or subjective late night causes no shift, phase delay or phase advance of the behavioral rhythm respectively. This phase-dependent light response is conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pittendrigh, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zatz et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwartz and Zimmerman, 1990</xref>). It is known that illumination at night triggers extensive chromatin remodeling in the mouse SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crosio et al., 2000</xref>), which likely results in changes in the levels of a large number of transcripts. However, except for a few dozen transcripts including the clock genes <italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jagannath et al., 2013</xref>), the extent of light-triggered transcriptional changes in the SCN is largely unknown. These acute transcriptional changes impinge on the molecular oscillator to adjust the phase of the mRNA rhythms in the SCN.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that coupling among the SCN neurons buffers against phase shifts, and the transient weakening of such coupling facilitates large phase shifts. SCN neurons exhibit tight intercellular communication imposed by paracrine peptidergic signals such as VIP (Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide), AVP (Arginine vasopressin), and GRP (Gastrin-releasing peptide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Welsh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hogenesch and Herzog, 2011</xref>). As the deficiency of <italic>Vip</italic> or its receptor <italic>Vpac2r</italic> causes desynchronization among SCN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aton et al., 2005</xref>), this peptide-mediated coupling mechanism is a unique and necessary feature of the SCN in order to generate robust synchronous rhythms. Weaker coupling among the SCN neurons is suggested to facilitate rapid and large phase shifts of the overt rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzog 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, transcription factors that regulate expression of the SCN coupling agents are central to the unique function of the SCN.</p><p>Here, using a combination of behavioral, genetic, and genomic tools, we vastly expand the understanding of the dynamic transcriptional landscape of the SCN. We conducted comprehensive analysis of the light-regulated, circadian, and tissue-enriched protein-coding transcriptome of the mouse SCN in order to understand the specificity of the master circadian clock. We found that the SCN-enriched transcription factor Lhx1 (LIM homeobox 1) is required for expression of a number of genes including <italic>Vip</italic> whose protein product participates in intercellular signaling. The SCN-specific loss of <italic>Lhx1</italic> attenuates cell to cell coupling of cell-autonomous oscillators in the SCN, abolishing circadian behavioral activity consolidation in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Light-regulated and circadian-controlled transcripts of the SCN</title><p>To comprehensively identify circadian-, light-regulated, and SCN-enriched protein-coding transcripts in the adult SCN, following 2 weeks of entrainment to 12 hr light:12 hr dark (LD) cycles male C57BL6/J mice were transferred to constant darkness (DD), and the SCN was collected every 2 hr over 48 hr. Light at subjective night, but not during subjective day is known to cause a behavioral phase shift. To assess the gene expression effect of a phase-shifting pulse of light, a subset of mice were exposed to a 1 hr white light pulse delivered at 30 hr, 40 hr, and 46 hr after the onset of DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure1—figure supplement 1</xref>) representing subjective daytime (CT6), early evening (CT16), and late night (CT22).

Similarly, in WT mice maintained in DD for 2 weeks, the SCN displayed circadian oscillation of the multi-unit activity with a similar peak phase among the different electrodes examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Although the SCN has long been recognized as the master circadian oscillator and the principal target for light modulation of circadian rhythms in mammals, the molecular basis for these at the protein-coding transcript level have not been comprehensively identified. In this study, we present a thorough analysis of transcriptional oscillations in the SCN, its response to light at different phases of the circadian oscillator and a glossary of SCN-enriched genes. This detailed description of the transcriptional landscape of the SCN has a variety of implications for understanding SCN function. In this study, we focused on the relevance of oscillator synchrony in circadian rhythms and light-induced phase shift in behavior.</p><p>Under natural conditions, time-of-the-day dependent interaction of the SCN with light input from the retina specifies the phase of overt activity-rest rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hatori and Panda, 2010</xref>). Light during the subjective night induces expression of several genes including immediate early genes <italic>c-fos</italic>, activates MAPK pathway, acutely upregulates the <italic>Per1</italic> transcript and resets the phase of overt behavioral rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Obrietan et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dziema et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butcher et al., 2005</xref>). We found that global transcriptional changes in the SCN parallel the sensitivity of the activity rhythms to light. During the subjective day, when light is ineffective in resetting overt rhythms, a very small fraction of the transcriptome changed in response to light. Conversely, during the subjective night, extensive changes in transcripts correlated with the large phase shifting effect of light, suggesting that changes in multiple pathways accompany the shift in the phase of the SCN oscillator network. Among the transcripts that change both during daytime and nighttime, their magnitude of expression was attenuated during the daytime. The magnitude of transcript changes also reflected the effectiveness of retinal photoreceptors in entraining the clock. As seen in the <italic>Opn4</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Panda et al., 2002b</xref>), attenuated light-induced change in overt rhythms paralleled the reduced transcriptional responses to light. Mice lacking mRGCs or those lacking rod, cone and melanopsin photopigments exhibited no behavioral phase shift in response to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hatori and Panda, 2010</xref>). They also showed no significant mRNA expression changes in transcripts in the SCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Collectively, these observations support the notion that a light signal perceived through retina photoreceptors causes transcriptional changes in the SCN that parallel the behavioral phase-shifting effect of light.</p><p>Included among the light-induced transcripts were several components of intracellular signaling cascades, kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors (MAPK pathway genes, SIK1, PER1, PER2, DEC1, EGR1, and EGR2), which likely function at the different signaling steps needed to transduce light information received at the plasma membrane to generate an appropriate change in the phase of the core clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Obrietan et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dziema et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butcher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jagannath et al., 2013</xref>). The light-suppressed transcripts on the other hand included intercellular signaling agents, cell surface receptors, and associated signaling components. This indicated that stimulus-induced downregulation of the tight coupling among SCN neurons is a likely mechanism to allow desynchronization and then resynchronization of cellular clocks to reset the SCN to a new phase. Since tight intercellular communication among the SCN neurons is a characteristic feature of the SCN, we further focused on the subset of transcripts that are light-suppressed as well as enriched in the SCN. The search for SCN-specific genes among 82 different mouse tissues did not yield any protein coding gene that is exclusively expressed in the SCN, suggesting that a combinatorial gene expression signature specifies SCN development and function. LHX1 is one of the SCN-enriched and light-suppressed transcription factors, and hence we reasoned that LHX1 might regulate transcription of at least a subset of the intercellular communication agents that specify SCN neuronal network features.</p><p>During the preparation of this manuscript, another study showed <italic>Six3-Cre</italic> dependent loss of <italic>Lhx1</italic> expression severely affected terminal differentiation as well as peptidergic outputs of the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedont et al., 2014</xref>). By using <italic>Rora-Cre</italic> in our study, the loss of <italic>Lhx1</italic> expression likely occurred after the onset of <italic>Rorα</italic> expression at E14.5, thereby allowing any terminal differentiation function of <italic>Lhx1</italic> in SCN development to occur normally. In both studies, the loss of Lhx1 in the SCN did not affect the overall expression level of any of the clock components, while the expression of several genes implicated in cellular synchrony including <italic>Vip</italic> and <italic>Avpr1a</italic> were downregulated. AVP, VIP, and their cognate receptors have been implicated in maintaining inter-cellular communication among SCN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzog, 2007</xref>). Light pulse also reduced the expression of <italic>Avpr1a</italic> and <italic>Vip</italic> mRNA. Mice carrying loss-of-function alleles of <italic>Vip</italic> or vasopressin receptors exhibit a weakened SCN network, progressive desynchronization of SCN neurons and increased sensitivity to light-induced phase shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzog, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the loss of AVP receptor weakens the network and increases the sensitivity of the behavioral rhythm to changes in the light regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herzog, 2007</xref>). While these observations have indicated that AVP- and VIP-mediated intercellular communication constitutes the framework for the SCN network, the transcription factor(s) that determines this SCN-specific property was unknown. Direct transcriptional induction from the VIP promoter by LHX1, the severe loss of VIP mRNA and immunoreactivity in the <italic>Lhx1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> SCN along with a desynchronous SCN now establishes Lhx1 as a critical regulator of VIP production in the SCN.</p><p>In summary, we have discovered that Lhx1 is a master regulator of multiple factors including VIP that maintain robust coupling among SCN neurons after their differentiation into oscillator neurons. While the loss of <italic>Vip</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colwell et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>Avpr1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wersinger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2009</xref>), or <italic>Rasd1</italic> alone causes a mild alteration in the circadian organization or light responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>), the parallel perturbation of multiple intercellular signaling components in the <italic>Lhx1</italic><sup><italic>SCN-KO</italic></sup> mice indicates a critical role for Lhx1 in determining the specific feature of SCN neurons that impart coupling among neurons. The intercellular coupling is thus as important as the cell-autonomous oscillations for maintaining the consolidated rhythm of activity-rest that can resist abrupt changes in the ambient light conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Salk Institute.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and two reviewers, one of whom, Louis Ptáček, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. We are very pleased to inform you that your article has been accepted for publication.</p><p>The manuscript by Hatori and colleagues describes an elegant line of experiments showing that Lhx1 is a master regulator of clock neurons in the SCN, and for communication and coordination among these neurons. The experiments range for extensive expression analysis of SCN in WT mice under different lighting regimens. They go on to identify Lhx1 as a candidate of particular interest and then do in vitro and in vivo experiments that support this supposition. There is beautiful correlation of the light induced transcriptional changes with the degree to which there is light-induced behavioral phase shifting.</p><p>One concern you might like to address before publication is the use of Lhx1 as ‘THE’ master regulator of SCN. I favor a more conservative approach in referring to it as ‘A’ master regulator.</p><p>[Editors’ note: given the minor nature of the revisions, there is not an accompanying Author response.]</p></body></sub-article></article>
