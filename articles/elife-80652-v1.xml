This has been particularly informative for dissecting the molecular and cellular correlates of natural human variation that can influence vaccine responses and outcomes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsang, 2015</xref>). Sex and prior exposure to the same or similar antigen are prominent examples of natural variation that influence vaccinee responses. However, immune response differences associated with sex and prior exposure have typically been defined and analyzed separately. These variables have not been examined together because vaccination studies often involve individuals who are either almost entirely previously exposed (e.g., influenza studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucasas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kotliarov et al., 2020</xref>) or naive (e.g., Ebola or yellow fever studies in US cohorts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaucher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Querec et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rechtien et al., 2017</xref>) to the vaccine pathogen. Here, we utilize a unique cohort of herpes simplex virus (HSV) 2 vaccine recipients that includes both sexes, as well as naive and previously exposed subjects, thus allowing us to study the in vivo molecular and cellular response correlates of the joint effects of sex and prior exposure.</p><p>Sex is a well-known variable that can influence vaccine and disease responses. Females typically develop higher antibody responses and report more adverse reactions following vaccination than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klein et al., 2015</xref>). These differences could be a result of multiple sex dimorphic traits, including sex hormones and increased expression of X-linked genes escaping inactivation. Females in particular have been observed to show higher levels of Toll-like receptor (TLR)/interferon (IFN)-associated gene expression in innate responses to vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein et al., 2010</xref>). Systems immunology studies have identified prevaccination differences that predict antibody titer responses, such as CD20<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>high</sup> B cell frequency and plasmacytoid dendritic cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kotliarov et al., 2020</xref>). Prior exposure to antigen is another dominant factor in immune response, but its effects have most often been analyzed focusing on adaptive, antigen-specific responses. An example of particular interest for innate responses involved vaccine vectors using replication-defective viruses: trials testing an experimental adenovirus vector-based HIV vaccine revealed increased inflammatory responses in subjects seropositive for a prevalent adenovirus subtype and showed an enhanced risk of HIV infection that was associated with prior adenovirus exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchbinder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we analyzed a unique cohort receiving a multidose, replication-defective vaccine, to interrogate the interaction of sex and prior exposure to infection. Subjects received an experimental HSV2 vaccine in a phase 1 clinical trial where comparisons could be made between three groups of volunteers based on their HSV serostatus prior to vaccination: HSV1<sup>−</sup>/HSV2<sup>−</sup>, HSV1<sup>+</sup>/HSV2<sup>−</sup>, or HSV1<sup>±</sup>/HSV2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dropulic et al., 2019</xref>). Each of these groups included subjects from both sexes. HSV2 is an important human pathogen. Persons infected with HSV2 have a threefold increased risk of acquiring HIV, and HSV2 infection causes genital herpes and severe disease in neonates, patients with AIDS, and transplant recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koelle and Corey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2006</xref>). Prior attempts to produce an effective prophylactic vaccine for HSV2, including glycoprotein subunit or replication-competent vaccines, have been unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dropulic and Cohen, 2012</xref>). The replication-defective vaccine HSV529 studied here is deleted for two essential HSV genes, UL5 and UL29, and propagated in a cell line expressing these two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Da Costa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Da Costa et al., 2000</xref>). Infection of cells not expressing these two essential genes results in expression of nearly all the viral genes, but viral DNA replication is abolished, and no virions are produced. The vaccine induced greater than fourfold increases in HSV-specific antibody titers in most HSV1<sup>−</sup>/HSV2<sup>−</sup> vaccine recipients, but lower increases in antibody responses were observed in volunteers in the other serogroups; T cell responses were modest in all three serogroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dropulic et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We characterized immune responses longitudinally by analyzing blood transcriptomic profiles and high-dimensional immune cell phenotyping throughout the three-dose vaccine regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dropulic et al., 2019</xref>). Vaccine-induced changes and correlates of outcomes such as neutralizing antibody titers and adverse reactions to the vaccine were determined. The transcriptomic responses were associated with both sex and prior exposure to HSV, but the responding genes and pathways also differed markedly based on the combination of both variables. Women showed stronger early inflammatory and type I IFN responses when compared to men, but this was only observed for HSV seronegative vaccine recipients. Thus, using unbiased systems immunology analyses, we show how prior exposure and sex interact to shape early, innate immune responses to a replication-defective vaccine, and identify transcriptional profiles that may shape the subsequent immune responses induced in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Vaccine recipients and study design</title><p>All HSV529 vaccine recipients signed informed consent for a protocol (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT01915212) approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Institutional Review Board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dropulic et al., 2019</xref>). The HSV529 vaccine was manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur. Peripheral blood was obtained at various timepoints and PBMCs were isolated by separation with Ficoll-Paque PLUS and cryopreserved. A web tool for visualization of experimental designs was used to summarize the samples and assays available at sampled timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheung and CHI Consortium, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>Fresh PBMCs were collected and lysed in TRIzol (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), and total RNA was isolated and purified with an miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All blood samples at different timepoints from the same subject were processed together. RNA quality and quantity were estimated using Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Before sequencing analysis, all samples were batched according to their age, sex, race, and immunization status, but assayed blindly. Two reference samples were simultaneously processed with the vaccine study samples in each batch. Stranded cDNA sequencing libraries were generated with a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 500 ng of total RNA was used for mRNA selection. After the reverse transcription to first strand cDNA, strand information was maintained with dUTP during second strand synthesis. A single nucleotide (containing adenine) was added to the dsDNA fragments and the products were ligated to an adapter. The products were then purified and amplified by PCR to create the final cDNA library. The library was qualified with an Agilent Bioanalyzer and quantified with a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. The cluster generation and pair-end (2 × 75 bp) sequencing were performed on an Illumina HiSeq 3000. Up to 96 barcoded samples were pooled for one single run, which yielded at least 30 M passed filter paired reads per sample. Sequencing results were demultiplexed and converted to FASTQ format using Illumina bcl2fastq software. The sequencing reads were adapter and quality trimmed and then aligned to the human genome using STAR software, and read counts determined with HTSeqCount software. Raw read counts were normalized using the DESeq2, LIMMA packages, and R software.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cells and flow cytometry</title><p>Viable PBMCs were isolated and cryopreserved according to Center for Human Immunology (CHI) protocols (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chi.niaid.nih.gov/web/new/our-research/sop.html">https://chi.niaid.nih.gov/web/new/our-research/sop.html</ext-link>).

Sample staining plates included up to 10 study samples in addition to control PBMCs from a healthy donor, and staining was preceded by an additional incubation with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Acquisition was performed with a Becton Dickinson LSRFortessa, using DIVA 8 software, acquiring 250,000 cells for each sample. Subsequent analysis to determine population frequencies used FlowJo version 9.6.2. Compensation performed with unstained cells and Becton Dickinson compensation beads was used to aid acquisition monitoring. Subsequently a final compensation matrix was calculated using FlowJo during postacquisition analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Statistics and computational analysis</title><p>Batching of samples, quality control filtering, and statistical analyses were performed using R/Bioconductor as well as R-Shiny web tools similar to those previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheung, 2023</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/foocheung/hsv_study_2017">,</ext-link> copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:e132a8ebb48b1a8ffc2ce03ed8bf72ee7f391ecf;origin=https://github.com/foocheung/hsv_study_2017;visit=swh:1:snp:993e80db95f4050009220ea95b000cb7e3b40bf9;anchor=swh:1:rev:5480d6351a4740b56297f2470b24402bd1b676b9">swh:1:rev:5480d6351a4740b56297f2470b24402bd1b676b9</ext-link>). Longitudinal changes in flow cytometry populations were evaluated by Wilcoxon’s signed-rank paired test, and p values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method, using an R webtool.

This was also true for the changes in cell populations and might be expected for a replication-defective vaccine which presents antigens to the immune system immediately after vaccination, but is not amplified over time like a replication-competent attenuated virus or vector-based vaccine. Therefore, we further focused analyses on day 1 after the first dose of vaccine, to investigate how subjects differing in sex or prior exposure vary in their responses to HSV529 vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Innate responses to HSV529 that differ based on prior exposure resemble differences between innate responses to yellow fever and influenza vaccinations</title><p>We analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) observed after HSV529 vaccination to investigate the transcriptomic responses which were associated with prior exposure to HSV. We compared day 1 DEGs in each of the three HSV serogroups that received HSV529 vaccine, with the early transcriptomic responses that have been previously reported in recipients of either yellow fever or influenza vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaucher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Querec et al., 2009</xref>). In the previous studies, yellow fever is a pathogen for which vaccine recipients had no prior exposure, whereas all subjects receiving the influenza vaccine were expected to have some degree of immunity due to prior influenza infection and vaccine exposure. Jaccard index values, reflecting the size of the intersection relative to the size of the union for two sample sets, were determined to quantify the overlap in day 1 transcriptomic responses to these different vaccines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). DEGs in HSV seronegative HSV529 recipients were strikingly similar to those seen in yellow fever vaccine recipients (p &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−90</sup>, Jaccard index &gt;0.35). In contrast, DEGs in both HSV seropositive groups were more similar to those seen in influenza vaccine recipients (p &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−30</sup>, Jaccard index &gt;0.13). Thus, transcriptomic responses observed in HSV naive and seropositive subjects mirror the responses to yellow fever and influenza vaccine recipients, respectively. This indicates that the effect of prior HSV exposure on response to HSV529 is consistent with differences observed between the early responses to vaccines for other pathogens that represent either naive responses or those mounted by individuals with existing adaptive immunity.</p><p>Network analysis of pathways that were enriched in overlap between HSV seronegative HSV529 recipients and yellow fever vaccine recipients, showed central roles for gene sets involved in type I IFN (IFN-α/β) and antiviral innate responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Therefore, we next focused within the IFN antiviral sensing module, on the seven component gene sets that were each significantly enriched. Examining the leading-edge genes that drove enrichment of these gene sets in individual vaccine recipients revealed that while many of these genes were induced at day 1 in some men or HSV seropositive women, their trend of increasing expression occurred more frequently and consistently in HSV naive women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We used a systems immunology approach characterizing peripheral blood transcriptomic and cell population phenotypes. While prior studies using systems approaches have been reported for live attenuated virus, subunit, and vectored vaccines, this is the first such study of a replication-defective vaccine in humans. After a longitudinal analysis throughout the three-dose vaccine regimen, we focused on transcriptional responses at day 1 after the first dose, as these exhibited the most robust changes associated with both sex and prior exposure. Changes in these phenotypes were determined and comparisons were made with other outcomes, such as the observation of more robust vaccination responses in women than men in subjects previously naive to HSV, revealed by faster neutralizing antibody responses. Thus, we provide insights for how prior exposure and sex interact to shape the early innate immune response.</p><p>The day 1 transcriptional responses differed between HSV529 vaccine recipients based on prior exposure to HSV. Responses to HSV529 by HSV seronegative individuals overlapped strongly with those previously reported for recipients of the yellow fever vaccine, whereas responses to HSV529 by HSV seropositive individuals were significantly different from those who were HSV seronegative and instead overlapped with persons who had been vaccinated with influenza. These findings support the notion that prior exposure to the pathogen against which the vaccine is targeting is a major determinant of the early innate immune response to the vaccine, independent of the vaccine type (live attenuated, subunit, or replication-defective) or the pathogen itself (yellow fever virus, influenza virus, or HSV).Interestingly, IFN responses appeared to be skewed toward IFN-α in the HSV seronegative vaccine recipients but toward IFN-γ in the HSV seropositive group. Type I IFNs, including IFN-α, are produced very early after viral infections, including with HSV, and cellular RNA and DNA sensors for HSV produce type I IFNs in response to virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Danastas et al., 2020</xref>). IFN-γ signals through a different receptor and is predominantly produced by natural killer cells and T cells during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Platanias, 2005</xref>). IFN-γ is particularly important for inhibiting HSV reactivation and thus may be more prominent when the immune system has previously been exposed to the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Decman et al., 2005</xref>). Both IFNs contribute to the induction of an antiviral state through the upregulation of molecules that can antagonize virus replication, but are increasingly being recognized to exert regulatory effects on the innate response that influence development of adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Ashkar, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Sex was associated with day 1 transcriptional responses, but the enriched pathways differed between HSV naive and seropositive individuals. A transcriptional profile of increased responses was observed for women, specifically for those previously naive to HSV. The transcriptomic modules and leading-edge genes that characterized this response were centered on type I IFN and antiviral pathways. This suggests that in the absence of prior exposure, the more robust transcriptional responses in women to a replication-defective virus may be due to an underlying difference in baseline inflammation or in the speed of induction of inflammation in comparison to men. Such IFN-associated broad immune activation has recently been found to underlie shared set point signatures for increased vaccine responsiveness in healthy individuals of both sexes (although this signature tends to be more elevated in females than males at baseline), as well as disease activity in patients with lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kotliarov et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the more robust day 1 transcriptional responses in HSV naive women could have contributed to the more rapid neutralizing antibody responses observed in HSV naive women in this cohort. Interestingly, we found that within HSV naive women the transcriptional IFN response correlated negatively with vaccine-induced antibody titers. Possibly, as HSV529 is a replication-defective vaccine dependent on an initial infection of host cells, early IFN responses inhibited the number of cells infected or the efficiency of viral antigen expression. This is consistent with the established role of IFN antagonizing natural HSV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leib, 2002</xref>) and indicates how the effects of IFN responses on vaccine effectiveness may be context dependent. Further work will be necessary toassess whether similar observations can be replicated in other naive responses to replication-defective or live attenuated vaccines, including similar consequences for the induction of antibody titers.</p><p>Despite the IFN response on day 1 that was associated with reduced antibody titers in HSV naive women, these individuals as a group showed the most robust antibody responses to HSV529, with more rapid antibody responses compared to HSV naive men. Overall, HSV naive individuals showed greater titer increases compared to HSV exposed subjects particularly at later timepoints. The diminished responses by HSV exposed subjects may also have resulted from suppression of HSV529 infection, in this case by preexisting neutralizing antibody or T cell immunity. This is supported by the large number of genes upregulated on day 1 after vaccination in HSV1<sup>−</sup>/HSV2<sup>−</sup> persons in comparison with the much smaller number of genes upregulated in these same individuals with subsequent doses of vaccine, or in HSV1<sup>+</sup>/HSV2<sup>−</sup> or HSV1<sup>±</sup>/HSV2<sup>+</sup> subjects at any timepoint. Evidence for preexisting antibody inhibiting live virus vaccination has been reported for other pathogens such as measles, for which efficacy improves if vaccination is administered later within the first year of life; clinical data combined with experimental models indicate this is more likely due to interference from maternal antibodies rather than immaturity of the neonatal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Binnendijk et al., 1997</xref>), although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Another example is the live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine which is approved in the United States for persons aged 2–49; prior exposure to influenza may lead to neutralization and reduced replication of the live influenza virus vaccine resulting in reduced efficacy in adults compared to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoft et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grohskopf et al., 2021</xref>). In HSV exposed subjects a higher dose of HSV529 may be required to achieve a better response; indeed the live attenuated zoster vaccine is given at 14 times the dose of the varicella vaccine, in part, to overcome the effect of preexisting immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen, 2008</xref>).</p><p>More robust responses by women compared to men have been described for several vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klein et al., 2015</xref>), and our findings demonstrate some overlap with prior studies of sex differences in the context of HSV. In two double-blind randomized studies of an HSV subunit vaccine, the vaccine was protective against genital herpes in women who were HSV1<sup>−</sup>/HSV2<sup>−</sup> prior to vaccination, but the vaccine was not effective in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stanberry et al., 2002</xref>). A subsequent large double-blind placebo-controlled trial found that women reported more symptoms and developed higher levels of antibody than did men after vaccination; however, the differences in antibody titers were not significant, and a later large study focused on HSV1<sup>−</sup>/HSV2<sup>−</sup> women failed to replicate efficacy against HSV2 infection or disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belshe et al., 2012</xref>). Murine studies have also implicated IFN responses in association with sex in the context of HSV. Male mice have a higher mortality rate after HSV infection than females which correlates with the difference in IFN-γ response, and male IFN-γ knockout mice have higher HSV reactivation rates than control mice whereas female IFN-γ knockout mice show no difference from controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2001</xref>). We now show that in the context of human responses to HSV529, sex-associated differences in IFN and inflammatory signaling are significantly more pronounced in women not previously exposed to HSV.</p><p>Prior studies suggest that HSV2 subunit vaccines are more effective in women than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stanberry et al., 2002</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms of the sex-dependent response may be different for the live, replication-defective HSV2 vaccine used in our study. For example, HSV is known to activate TLR9, and thus a replication-defective vaccine like ours would be expected to activate TLR9 by presenting viral DNA to the immune system. TLR9 responses are known to be sex dependent, with a role in autoimmune disorders disproportionately affecting females, and may have thus contributed to the more robust innate responses in females in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lund et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marshak-Rothstein, 2006</xref>). A replication-defective live viral vaccine may also be more effective in triggering the presentation of processed viral peptides on the surface of the infected host cells to stimulate innate and virus-specific T cell responses compared to protein subunit vaccines. Thus, our HSV2 replication-defective vaccine may be more likely to trigger innate and cellular immune response pathways that are more robust in women, for example, similar to earlier observations of more robust IFN-α production and CD8 T cell activation after stimulation of PBMCs with a viral peptide in HIV-infected women compared to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meier et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Due to the more rapid vaccine response in seronegative women observed in this study, we analyzed changes in plasmablasts. In a trial of the malaria recombinant protein vaccine RTS,S, increased plasmablasts were observed on day 1, but only after the second and third doses of vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kazmin et al., 2017</xref>). We detected expansion of plasmablasts when analyzing all subjects at both days 1 and 7 after the first dose of vaccine, but these changes did not reach statistical significance when stratifying by prior exposure and sex. We also observed that the numbers of plasmablasts peaked around day 7 as others have reported, although the early response we observed at day 1 was unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wrammert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magnani et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several individual genes were highlighted by our transcriptomic screen. TLR7 is an X-linked gene for which higher levels of expression have been reported in B cells of naive female versus male mice after vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine, and these higher levels of TLR7 correlated with high levels of antibodies in the female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fink et al., 2018</xref>). We also detected higher levels of TLR7 gene expression in HSV1<sup>−</sup>/HSV2<sup>−</sup> women compared to men on day 1 after vaccination. TLR7 is important for immunoglobulin class switching and could represent a molecular mechanism for sex-based differences, which have been attributed to X-linked immune response genes as well as to hormonal differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harper and Flanagan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein and Flanagan, 2016</xref>). A further observation arising from the broad phenotypic characterization is the concordance between significant host gene expression responses and pathogen immune evasion. The most significantly upregulated individual genes were dominated at day 1 by IFN-stimulated (<italic>CXCL10</italic>, <italic>GBP1</italic>, and <italic>IFIT2</italic>) or Fcγ receptor genes (<italic>FCGR1A</italic>, <italic>FCGR1B</italic>, and <italic>FCGR1C</italic>).

HSV encodes immune evasion proteins that antagonize many of these specific gene functions: blocking IFN, antibody-mediated cytolysis, and activity of integrin β3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leib, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lubinski et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gianni et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our study confirms and adds to the substantial effects observed for prior exposure and sex in innate immune responses. We document at a systems level how these two variables interact in the context of response to a replication-defective vaccine, and determine resulting transcriptional response profiles that may form the basis for differences in neutralizing antibody responses in vivo. To improve vaccination effectiveness, it will thus be important to better understand how prior exposure and sex affect the innate responses that are increasingly being shown to shape subsequent adaptive immunity.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing, Data curation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing, Project administration, Resources, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Investigation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial registration clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT01915212.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>All HSV529 vaccine recipients signed informed consent for a protocol (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT01915212) approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Institutional Review Board.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Flow cytometry markers and lists of significantly upregulated genes and changes in cell populations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Four parallel 10-color staining panels used for high parameter flow cytometry analysis.

This conclusion is alluded to but not explicitly made.</p><p>The authors achieved their aims in quantifying the difference in the immune response between naive individuals and those with previous exposure to HSV as well as differences between males and females. Their results fully support the conclusions stated in the manuscript.</p><p>This manuscript provides a comprehensive assessment of the differences between male and female responders as well as naive and virus-experienced responders. These results show many interesting leads for a better understanding of these differences. These results are especially important in the context of the development of vaccines against viruses that establish lifelong infections, such as HSV, CMV and VZV. Since the authors have committed to releasing the data, this will likely offer other teams some rich data for subsequent analysis.</p><p>I. Comments and questions:</p><p>a) Analysis for Figures B and C: Since all of the Δ_Day0 Neutralizing Ab Titers are at zero on Day 0, I'm not sure the statistical test is accurate. The test compares means and since all values have a mean of zero on the first day (post normalization) and necessarily do not have a mean of zero at the next time points (as per the normalization procedure), this makes me conclude that the test is likely biased. Perhaps changing the strategy would be best. The authors seem to want to verify if the difference between men and women is significant. Perhaps simply comparing the values at the second timepoint would be a better use of a statistical test and reflect reality. So my suggestion is:</p><p>ttest(a, b) where a = women's normalized titer @ 30 Days and b = men's normalized titer @ 30 Days.</p><p>b) Line 162: This statement is not entirely true. Since Supplementary Figure 1 only shows recorded responses for HSV- individuals (as per legend description), only based on that figure it is impossible to state that prior exposure markedly affects the response to the vaccine. These results are not even in that Figure! If they are, the legend should be adjusted, if not, they should be added to match the conclusion!</p><p>c) Figure 2, 3, 4: For each of these Figures, the manuscript would benefit from clear indications of which subgroups are being compared.</p><p>d) Methods should contain a clear description of the BTM analysis: how was it done? Which software was used? What are the gene sets used?</p><p>e) I am curious about Dose 2. What happened to it? Why is there such a low cell enrichment (Figure 2A) and such a low number of differentially expressed genes (Figure 2B)? Was the immune response sustained from Day 7 to Dose 3 and this is why there are few differentially expressed genes? Was there a problem in the quantification?</p><p>f) Why did the authors combine all responders for Figure 2C when they suspected differences in sex and between naive/antigen-experienced groups?</p><p>g) I really like the analysis done in Figure 2D. I think the link to other vaccine studies is interesting. Since DEGs are often very dependent on the dataset, perhaps repeating the comparison but with enriched pathways or even the BTMs would be more convincing. I feel like the signal is slightly blurred with the DEGs and Jaccard index since DEGs are often dataset-specific and the Jaccard index is so highly dependent on the overall set size. I suspect the authors will find a greater signal using pathways instead.</p><p>h) Line 246: IL-12 has some influence on Th1 adaptive immune response. Perhaps splitting the results from Figure 2C into seronegative and seropositive would have been better and would show the difference in IL-12-based Th1 cell enrichment.</p><p>i) Line 300: The authors are correct to note that TLR7 is located on chromosome X. Would it be possible to check within the placebo group comparing males and females if TLR7 is still significantly enriched? This would rule out any vaccine-based effect compared to the sex-based only effect.</p><p>j) Figure 4 and Lines 334 and 336. Authors state similar pathway enrichments but then conclude that there is a difference in the effect of sex between seropositive and seronegative groups. In Figure 4B, it seems like the biggest difference is seen between seronegative individuals. And yet there are the same genes enriched in.</p><p>k) Figure 4A. Perhaps some additional explanation could reconcile this contradiction in this paragraph!</p><p>Line 370: So if I understand correctly, seropositive females lose the high IFN response because of a higher neutralizing titer (as seen in seronegative/positive males?)</p><p>l) Data was not available and is currently embargoed until October 2024!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors study responses to a non-replicating human HSV vaccine. They find that the vaccine responses differ in males and females, predominantly in those individuals who are HSV seronegative.</p><p>Strengths.</p><p>The authors have a relatively large cohort of patients enabling longitudinal studies in seronegative and seropositive male and female individuals</p><p>The authors performed a comprehensive study of the immune responses both on the level of neutralizing antibodies and gene activation for long time periods</p><p>Their work identified clear differences between males and females in seronegative individuals: females produce neutralizing ab's faster, but males have delayed but higher levels.</p><p>The work is able to relate some of the differences to the differences in the Type I IFN response.</p><p>Weaknesses.</p><p>Many of the observations reported in the paper have already been described in the literature, such as sex-specific immune responses to viral vaccines.</p><p>The possible causal connection between the kinetics of gene activation and the differences in ab responses is discussed but requires further work.</p><p>The paper leaves uncertain if this vaccine is going to be epidemiologically/clinically useful (as these are Phase 1 clinical trials).</p><p>I am uncertain what is the significance of these results for understanding the fundamental biology of the immune responses to vaccination.</p><p>I think this is a technically very strong paper that reports interesting results</p><p>However, I am not sure it reports a breakthrough in our understanding of either the vaccine responses or the sex-linked differences.</p><p>I think this is important work that might be more appropriate in a human immunology/vaccinology journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study describes early antiviral innate responses of a replication-defective herpesvirus vaccine and the subsequent impact on adaptive responses based on the sex of the vaccinee and prior exposure to the virus. As early as one day after the vaccination the differences depended on sex and prior exposure to the virus were noted using blood transcriptomics and cell population profiling. Type I interferon (IFN) signature was found to be the most pronounced in HSV naive women and associated with lower neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting that a strong early antiviral response reduced the uptake of this replication-defective virus vaccine.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The methodology used by the authors has a wider implication beyond the replication-defective herpes virus vaccine.</p><p>This is the first detailed study using the systems immunology approach to assess early immune responses and transcriptomic analysis for a replication-defective herpesvirus vaccine.</p><p>The authors have provided a robust data set to justify the conclusions.</p><p>Figures are clear and statistical analysis is vigorous.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Overall, this manuscript has minimal weaknesses.</p><p>The manuscript shows that neutralizing activity is negatively correlated with IFN type 1 signatures in females, it would be of great interest to analyze whether overall gD2 binding or HSV-2 binding antibody levels are also lower in females compared to males or only the antibody with neutralizing activity.</p><p>If total binding antibody levels are not different, analyzing the Fc receptor-mediated activity such as ADCC would be of great interest.</p><p>A few recommendations are made to improve the manuscript</p><p>1. Since this study most likely used the same sets of samples that were used in a prior study (Dropulic et al. JID 2019 published by the same group), it may be possible to discuss whether the difference in binding antibody was noted. Alternatively, the data may be further analyzed by sex for discussion purposes.</p><p>2. Day 1 following 1st immunization seems to show the most interesting pattern in HSV naïve population. Conceptually, with a replication-defective viral vaccine, the subsequent immunizations in the HSV naive group are more likely to behave similar to that of the virus-exposed group and consequently, immune responses may be indicative of that. It is not clear whether later time point samples were assessed and analyzed based on the naive and prior exposure group.</p><p>3. Volcano plot for figure 2B clearly shows the changes in individual genes in samples collected over time. The Y-axis scale variations among panels minimize the appearance of huge differences. If it is difficult to maintain the same scale for all the panels, a comment can be inserted in the figure legend to note the differences in the scale.</p><p>4. Previously published phase III trials with subunit vaccines showed higher efficacy in the HSV naïve women. It is to be noted that higher efficacy in females was not assessed for correlation with neutralizing activity in the prior study. One of the most interesting findings presented here is that a replication-defective vaccine had a smaller boost in neutralizing activity in females following 2nd immunization compared to men. It may be interesting to discuss the possibility of variations in immunological outcome based on the sex with a replication-defective viral vaccine compared to an adjuvanted subunit vaccine.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80652.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

These results are especially important in the context of the development of vaccines against viruses that establish lifelong infections, such as HSV, CMV and VZV. Since the authors have committed to releasing the data, this will likely offer other teams some rich data for subsequent analysis.</p><p>I. Comments and questions:</p><p>a) Analysis for Figures B and C: Since all of the Δ_Day0 Neutralizing Ab Titers are at zero on Day 0, I'm not sure the statistical test is accurate. The test compares means and since all values have a mean of zero on the first day (post normalization) and necessarily do not have a mean of zero at the next time points (as per the normalization procedure), this makes me conclude that the test is likely biased. Perhaps changing the strategy would be best. The authors seem to want to verify if the difference between men and women is significant. Perhaps simply comparing the values at the second timepoint would be a better use of a statistical test and reflect reality. So my suggestion is:</p><p>ttest(a, b) where a = women's normalized titer @ 30 Days and b = men's normalized titer @ 30 Days.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that performing a δ using the baseline at day 0, i.e. (D30-D0) and then analyzing this using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon for either males or females separately within the seronegative group is an informative approach to assess whether a more robust titer responses after vaccination are displayed by seronegative females. This showed a significant response in the female group (p&lt;0.001) but insignificant change for males, consistent with the observation that increases in titer at day 30 are seen for 7 out 10 females but only 1 out of the 5 males.</p><p>We also performed the test suggested by this reviewer. This specific test yields p=0.1, even though our analysis described above did highlight the possibility of responses distinct to seronegative females. We thus think that we are likely not powered to assess significant differences in titer responses between groups. However, as shown in the manuscript, we subsequently investigated further by analyzing immune phenotypes and showed, at the transcriptional level, significantly different responses in seronegative females compared to males or seropositive subjects (Figures3 and 4). These data together support our overall conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Line 162: This statement is not entirely true. Since Supplementary Figure 1 only shows recorded responses for HSV- individuals (as per legend description), only based on that figure it is impossible to state that prior exposure markedly affects the response to the vaccine. These results are not even in that Figure! If they are, the legend should be adjusted, if not, they should be added to match the conclusion!</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text, now lines 220-225, as well as included responses for HSV+ individuals in the figure, now Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Figure 2, 3, 4: For each of these Figures, the manuscript would benefit from clear indications of which subgroups are being compared.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the figure legends to be clear which subgroups are being compared. The legend to Figure 2A states in the first sentence that all groups are being compared (no subgroups) and we have now stated this for the legend for Figure 2B and 2C. Figure 2D indicates we used subgroups based on HSV serology. The first sentence of the legend to figure 3 states that the figure is analyzing HSV seronegative vaccine recipients based on sex. The first sentence of the legend to figure 4 states that the figure is analyzing vaccine recipients based on HSV serology and sex (the bottom of panel A shows the subgroups and the top of panels B and C show the subgroups), while the legend for panel D indicates it shows HV seronegative women.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Methods should contain a clear description of the BTM analysis: how was it done? Which software was used? What are the gene sets used?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to essential revision comment 2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) I am curious about Dose 2. What happened to it? Why is there such a low cell enrichment (Figure 2A) and such a low number of differentially expressed genes (Figure 2B)? Was the immune response sustained from Day 7 to Dose 3 and this is why there are few differentially expressed genes? Was there a problem in the quantification?</p></disp-quote><p>The immune responses appeared much higher to the first dose of vaccine than to either the 2<sup>nd</sup> (day 30) or 3<sup>rd</sup> (day 180) doses. Note the large difference in scale of the y axis in figure 2B day7, 37, and 187 compared to day1, and in response to the reviewers comment we now highlight this in the legend for figure 2B. There were not technical problems when quantifying response to dose 2, although we did not collect blood on days 31 and 188 (day 1 after the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> doses of the vaccine) and may have missed the peak of those responses. There was also not sustained transcriptomic perturbation at the day of the second does, indicated by very few DEG comparing between day 30 and day 0. Differential responses between doses have been documented for other vaccines, and may reflect altered responsiveness particularly when re-vaccinating within a short period of 30 days (dose 2) compared to 150 days (dose 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Why did the authors combine all responders for Figure 2C when they suspected differences in sex and between naive/antigen-experienced groups?</p></disp-quote><p>Despite the potential sex/exposure effects, in Figure 2A-C we initially combined all subjects to first characterize what the vaccine is doing to the immune system in terms of transcriptomic and cell population responses overall. We then go on to explore effects of sex and prior exposure in subsequent figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) I really like the analysis done in Figure 2D. I think the link to other vaccine studies is interesting. Since DEGs are often very dependent on the dataset, perhaps repeating the comparison but with enriched pathways or even the BTMs would be more convincing. I feel like the signal is slightly blurred with the DEGs and Jaccard index since DEGs are often dataset-specific and the Jaccard index is so highly dependent on the overall set size. I suspect the authors will find a greater signal using pathways instead.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion but, given the analysis using DEGs already showed a clear effect, we have not gone on to explore the analysis at the pathway level to avoid inundating the reader with additional data (since this is already an omics level study with a dense presentation of data). We agree it could show a greater signal but feel the important point of overlap with other vaccines based on prior exposure is already shown, and that the particular pathways involved are also well characterized in those prior studies of vaccines in which all recipients are either naïve (yellow fever) or previously exposed (influenza).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h) Line 246: IL-12 has some influence on Th1 adaptive immune response. Perhaps splitting the results from Figure 2C into seronegative and seropositive would have been better and would show the difference in IL-12-based Th1 cell enrichment.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention for Figure 2A-C was to initially combine all subjects to first characterize what the vaccine is doing to the immune system. Subsequently we focused on transcriptomic rather than flow cytometry responses to assess effects of prior exposure to HSV. Although we appreciate the point about IL-12 and Th1 populations specifically, overall we feel that the transcriptomic responses represent an unbiased approach and have more power based on the greater response observed. Therefore, we have remained focused on the transcriptomic rather than flow data to investigate the effects of prior exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) Line 300: The authors are correct to note that TLR7 is located on chromosome X. Would it be possible to check within the placebo group comparing males and females if TLR7 is still significantly enriched? This would rule out any vaccine-based effect compared to the sex-based only effect.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to essential revisions comment 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>j) Figure 4 and Lines 334 and 336. Authors state similar pathway enrichments but then conclude that there is a difference in the effect of sex between seropositive and seronegative groups. In Figure 4B, it seems like the biggest difference is seen between seronegative individuals. And yet there are the same genes enriched in.</p></disp-quote><p>The contrasts assessed in Figure 4 demonstrate that effects of sex within either seropositive group are statistically different from the effects of sex within seronegative individuals. The text, now lines 336-339, then highlights that the pathways which differed most in both of these comparisons were also those which differed when effect of sex was compared within seronegative subjects alone (Figure 3). These results confirm that the effect of sex on transcriptional response to HSV529 vaccination, which we first observed to be strongest for seronegative subjects in Figure 3, is statistically significant when comparing between naïve and HSV-exposed individuals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>k) Figure 4A. Perhaps some additional explanation could reconcile this contradiction in this paragraph!</p><p>Line 370: So if I understand correctly, seropositive females lose the high IFN response because of a higher neutralizing titer (as seen in seronegative/positive males?)</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretation is that high early IFN response by HSV naïve women may have inhibited the number of cells this live-attenuated vaccine could infect, and this impaired the titer of the subsequent antibody responses.

Here we evaluated three different subject groups to dissect the effects of sex when in subjects with: (1) no prior exposure, (2) exposure to prior HSV1, and (3) exposure to prior HSV2. We found significant differences in the effect of sex between these groups, both in innate and adaptive responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The possible causal connection between the kinetics of gene activation and the differences in ab responses is discussed but requires further work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree but we feel that further analysis is beyond the scope of this current work. For example, further work will be necessary to determine if the more robust IFN responses observed here in women can be replicated in other naïve responses to vaccination with replication-defective or live attenuated vaccines, and whether such more robust early responses can lead to similar consequences for differential induction of antibody titers. If so, the possibility that a robust early IFN responses in HSV naïve women can inhibit infection or antigen expression by live vaccines would warrant further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper leaves uncertain if this vaccine is going to be epidemiologically/clinically useful (as these are Phase 1 clinical trials).</p></disp-quote><p>The prior clinical study report on this vaccine (Dropulic et al. now reference 16) discusses these points. Briefly, the HSV529 vaccine was safe and elicited modest levels of neutralizing antibody responses in HSV-seronegative vaccinees indicating potential as a prophylactic vaccine, although modifications will likely be required to improve its immunogenicity. This paper focuses on the unique opportunity of a cohort with a controlled immune stimulus of vaccination across subjects stratified by both sex and prior exposure, enabling study of how these variables interact to shape an immune response in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am uncertain what is the significance of these results for understanding the fundamental biology of the immune responses to vaccination.</p></disp-quote><p>This paper emphasizes the interplay between prior exposure to viruses and sex-dependent responses to vaccination. Immune imprinting due to prior exposure is becoming an increasingly important topic affecting the response to many pathogens and vaccines, and sex-specific differences in immune responses to vaccination and infection and disease are becoming increasingly appreciated as fundamental to vaccinology. Our work point to the importance of studying both together as their effects could be dependent on each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think this is a technically very strong paper that reports interesting results</p><p>However, I am not sure it reports a breakthrough in our understanding of either the vaccine responses or the sex-linked differences.</p><p>I think this is important work that might be more appropriate in a human immunology/vaccinology journal.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see responses to reviewer 2’s earlier comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study describes early antiviral innate responses of a replication-defective herpesvirus vaccine and the subsequent impact on adaptive responses based on the sex of the vaccinee and prior exposure to the virus.

Since this study most likely used the same sets of samples that were used in a prior study (Dropulic et al.

Day 1 following 1st immunization seems to show the most interesting pattern in HSV naïve population. Conceptually, with a replication-defective viral vaccine, the subsequent immunizations in the HSV naive group are more likely to behave similar to that of the virus-exposed group and consequently, immune responses may be indicative of that. It is not clear whether later time point samples were assessed and analyzed based on the naive and prior exposure group.</p></disp-quote><p>While we have data on gD2 binding, we focused on neutralizing antibody here as it is thought to be more important as a correlate of protection than simply binding to the soluble gD we have used in our assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Previously published phase III trials with subunit vaccines showed higher efficacy in the HSV naïve women. It is to be noted that higher efficacy in females was not assessed for correlation with neutralizing activity in the prior study. One of the most interesting findings presented here is that a replication-defective vaccine had a smaller boost in neutralizing activity in females following 2nd immunization compared to men. It may be interesting to discuss the possibility of variations in immunological outcome based on the sex with a replication-defective viral vaccine compared to an adjuvanted subunit vaccine.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to essential revision comment 3 above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
