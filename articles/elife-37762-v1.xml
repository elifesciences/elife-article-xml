However, thermal optima and limits remain unknown for most vector-borne pathogens. We built a mechanistic model for the thermal response of Ross River virus, an important mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia, Pacific Islands, and potentially at risk of emerging worldwide. Transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4°C) and declines to zero at thermal limits (17.0 and 31.5°C). The model accurately predicts that transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in the nationwide seasonal peak in human cases. Climate warming will likely increase transmission in temperate areas (where most Australians live) but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum. These results illustrate the importance of nonlinear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37762.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mosquitoes cannot control their body temperature, so their survival and performance depend on the temperature where they live. As a result, outside temperatures can also affect the spread of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. This has left scientists wondering how climate change may affect the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. Predicting the effects of climate change on such diseases is tricky, because many interacting factors, including temperatures and rainfall, affect mosquito populations. Also, rising temperatures do not always have a positive effect on mosquitoes – they may help mosquitoes initially, but it can get too warm even for these animals.</p><p>Climate change could affect the Ross River virus, the most common mosquito-borne disease in Australia. The virus infects 2,000 to 9,000 people each year and can cause long-term joint pain and disability. Currently, the virus spreads year-round in tropical, northern Australia and seasonally in temperate, southern Australia. Large outbreaks have occurred outside of Australia, and scientists are worried it could spread worldwide.</p><p>Now, Shocket et al. have built a model that predicts how the spread of Ross River virus changes with temperature. Shocket et al. used data from laboratory experiments that measured mosquito and virus performance across a broad range of temperatures. The experiments showed that ~26°C (80°F) is the optimal temperature for mosquitoes to spread the Ross River virus. Temperatures below 17°C (63°F) and above 32°C (89°F) hamper the spread of the virus. These temperature ranges match the current disease patterns in Australia where human cases peak in March. This is two months after the country’s average temperature reaches the optimal level and about how long it takes mosquito populations to grow, infect people, and for symptoms to develop.</p><p>Because northern Australia is already near the optimal temperature for mosquitos to spread the Ross River virus, any climate warming should decrease transmission there. But warming temperatures could increase the disease’s transmission in the southern part of the country, where most people live. The model Shocket et al. created may help the Australian government and mosquito control agencies better plan for the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Aedes vigilax</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Culex annulirostris</italic></kwd><kwd>Ross River virus</kwd><kwd>temperature</kwd><kwd>mosquito-borne disease</kwd><kwd>infectious disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1518681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mordecai</surname><given-names>Erin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1640780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mordecai</surname><given-names>Erin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Accounting for nonlinear responses to temperature is critical for accurately predicting how Ross River virus and other mosquito-borne diseases will respond to climate change and detecting the effects of temperature on disease transmission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Temperature impacts the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases via effects on the physiology of mosquitoes and pathogens. Transmission requires that mosquitoes be abundant, bite a host and ingest an infectious bloodmeal, survive long enough for pathogen development and within-host migration (the extrinsic incubation period), and bite additional hosts—all processes that depend on temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>). Although both mechanistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wesolowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Paull et al., 2017</xref>) and statistical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Perkins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Siraj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Paull et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Peña-García et al., 2017</xref>) support the impact of temperature on mosquito-borne disease, important knowledge gaps remain. First, how the impact of temperature on transmission differs across diseases, via what mechanisms, and the types of data needed to characterize these differences all remain uncertain. Second, the impacts of temperature on transmission can appear idiosyncratic—varying in both magnitude and direction—across locations and studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gatton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jacups et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stewart-Ibarra and Lowe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Peña-García et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Koolhof et al., 2017</xref>). Although inferring causality from field observations and statistical approaches alone remains challenging, nonlinear thermal biology may mechanistically explain this variation. As the climate changes, filling these gaps becomes increasingly important for predicting geographic, seasonal, and interannual variation in transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens. Here, we address these gaps by building a model for temperature-dependent transmission of Ross River virus (RRV), the most important mosquito-borne disease in Australia (1500–9500 human cases per year) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Koolhof et al., 2017</xref>), and potentially at risk of emerging worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flies et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>RRV in Australia is an ideal case study for examining the influence of temperature. Transmission occurs across a wide latitudinal gradient, where climate varies substantially both geographically and seasonally. Moreover, compared to vector-borne diseases in lower-income settings, RRV case diagnosis and reporting are more accurate and consistent, and variation in socioeconomic conditions (and therefore housing and vector control efforts) at regional and continental scales is relatively low. Previous work has shown that in some settings temperature predicts RRV cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gatton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Werner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Koolhof et al., 2017</xref>), while in others it does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gatton et al., 2005</xref>). Understanding RRV transmission ecology is critical because the virus is a candidate for emergence worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Flies et al., 2018</xref>), and has caused explosive epidemics where it has emerged in the past (infecting over 500,000 people in a 1979–80 epidemic in Fiji) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Klapsing et al., 2005</xref>). RRV is a significant public health burden because infection causes joint pain that can become chronic and cause disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Koolhof et al., 2017</xref>). A mechanistic model for temperature-dependent transmission could help explain these disparate results and predict potential expansion.</p><p>Mechanistic models synthesize how environmental factors like temperature influence host and parasite traits that drive transmission. Thermal responses of ectotherm traits are usually unimodal: they peak at intermediate temperatures and decline towards zero at lower and upper thermal limits, all of which vary across traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>). Mechanistic models are particularly useful for synthesizing the effects of multiple, nonlinear thermal responses that shape transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rogers and Randolph, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>). One commonly used measure of disease spread is <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>, the basic reproductive number, defined as the number of secondary cases expected from a single case in a fully susceptible population. Relative <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>— <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> scaled between 0 and 1—is a modified metric that captures the thermal response of transmission without making assumptions about other factors that affect the absolute value of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>). For mosquito-borne disease, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> is a nonlinear function of mosquito density, biting rate, vector competence (infectiousness given pathogen exposure), and adult survival; pathogen extrinsic incubation period; and human recovery rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dietz, 1993</xref>). To understand how multiple traits that respond nonlinearly to temperature combine to affect transmission, we incorporate empirically-estimated trait thermal responses into a model of relative <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>. Synthesizing the full suite of nonlinear trait responses is critical because such models often make predictions that are drastically different, with transmission optima up to 7°C lower, than models that assume linear or monotonic thermal responses or omit temperature-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>). Previous mechanistic models that incorporated multiple nonlinear trait thermal responses have predicted different optimal temperatures across pathogens and vector species: 25°C for <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria in <italic>Anopheles</italic> vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>) and West Nile virus in <italic>Culex</italic> vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Paull et al., 2017</xref>), and 29 and 26°C for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses (in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wesolowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we build the first mechanistic model for temperature-dependent transmission of RRV and ask whether temperature explains seasonal and geographic patterns of disease. We use data from laboratory experiments with two important vector species (<italic>Culex annulirostris</italic> and <italic>Aedes vigilax</italic>) to parameterize the model with unimodal thermal responses. We then use sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to determine which traits drive the relationship between temperature and transmission potential and identify key data gaps. Finally, we illustrate how temperature currently shapes patterns of disease transmission across Australia. The model correctly predicts that RRV disease is year-round endemic in tropical, northern Australia with little seasonal variation due to temperature, and seasonally epidemic in temperate, southern Australia. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for idiosyncrasies in RRV temperature responses observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gatton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Werner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Koolhof et al., 2017</xref>). A population-weighted version of the model (assuming a two-month lag between temperature and human cases based on mosquito and disease development times) also accurately predicts the seasonality of human cases nationally. Thus, from laboratory data on mosquito and parasite thermal responses alone, this simple model mechanistically explains broad geographic and seasonal patterns of disease.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Natural history of RRV</title><p>The natural history of RRV is complex: transmission occurs across a range of climates (tropical, subtropical, and temperate) and habitats (urban and rural, coastal and inland) and via many vertebrate reservoir and vector species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Claflin and Webb, 2015</xref>). Marsupials are generally considered the critical reservoirs for maintaining the virus between human outbreaks, but recent work has argued that placental mammals and birds may be equally important in many locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stephenson et al., 2018</xref>). The virus has been isolated from over 40 mosquito species in nature, and 10 species transmit it in laboratory studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Russell, 2002</xref>). However, four species are responsible for most transmission to humans (<italic>Culex annulirostris</italic>, <italic>Aedes [Ochlerotatus] vigilax</italic>, <italic>Ae.

Identifying transmission optima and limits by characterizing nonlinear thermal responses, rather than simply assuming that transmission increases with temperature, can more accurately predict geographic, seasonal, and interannual variation in disease. Thermal responses vary substantially among diseases and vector species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>; Tesla et al., in press), yet we lack mechanistic models based on empirical, unimodal thermal responses for many diseases and vectors. Here, we parameterized a temperature-dependent model for transmission of RRV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) with data from two important vector species (<italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> and <italic>Ae. vigilax</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The optimal temperature for transmission is moderate (26–27°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and largely determined by the thermal response of adult mosquito lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both low and high temperatures limit transmission due to low mosquito fecundity and survival at all life stages—thermal responses that are often ignored in transmission models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Temperature explains the geography of year-round endemic versus seasonally epidemic disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and accurately predicts the seasonality of human cases at the national scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, the model for RRV transmission provides a mechanistic link between geographic and seasonal variation in temperature and broad-scale patterns of disease.</p><p>While the thermal response of RRV transmission generally matched those of other mosquito-borne pathogens, there were some key differences. The moderate optimal temperature for RRV (26–27°C) fit within the range of thermal optima found for other diseases using the same methods: malaria transmission by <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp. at 25°C, and dengue and other viruses by <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> at 29 and 26°C, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>). For all of these diseases, the specific optimal temperature was largely determined by the thermal response of adult lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>,;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). However, the traits that set the thermal limits for RRV transmission differed from other systems. The lower thermal limit for RRV was constrained by fecundity and survival at all stages, while the upper thermal limit was constrained by fecundity and adult lifespan. By contrast, thermal limits for malaria transmission were set by parasite development rate at cool temperatures and egg-to-adulthood survival at high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>). As with previous models, the upper and lower thermal limits of RRV transmission are more uncertain than the optimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>), because trait responses are harder to measure near their thermal limits where survival is low and development is slow or incomplete. Overall, our results support a general pattern of intermediate thermal optima for transmission where the well-resolved optimal temperature is driven by adult mosquito lifespan, but upper and lower thermal limits are more uncertain and may be determined by unique traits for different vector–pathogen systems. Additionally, upper thermal limits of mosquito-borne disease transmission (a major concern for climate change) are primarily determined by vector life history traits with symmetrical thermal performance curves (like fecundity and survival at various life stages) rather than rate-based traits with asymmetrical thermal performance curves (like biting rate or pathogen development rate).</p><p>The trait thermal response data were limited in two keys ways. First, two traits (fecundity and adult lifespan) had data from only three temperatures. We used priors derived from data from other mosquito species to minimize over-fitting and better represent the true uncertainty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, versus uniform priors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, data from more temperatures would increase our confidence in the fitted thermal responses. Second, no vector species had data for all traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), so we combined mosquito traits from <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> and pathogen infection traits in <italic>Ae. vigilax</italic> to build composite relative <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> models. Geographic and seasonal variation in vector populations suggests that <italic>Ae. camptorhynchus</italic> and <italic>Ae. vigilax</italic> have different thermal niches (cooler and warmer, respectively) and <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> has a broader thermal niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Russell, 1998</xref>). We need temperature-dependent trait data for more species to test the hypothesis that these niche differences reflect the species’ thermal responses. If true, the current model, parameterized primarily with <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> trait responses, may not accurately predict the thermal responses of transmission by <italic>Ae. camptorhynchus</italic> and <italic>Ae. vigilax</italic>. Hypothesized species differences in thermal niche could explain why RRV persists over a wide climatic and latitudinal gradient. Thus, thermal response experiments with other RRV vectors are a critical area for future research.</p><p>The temperature-dependent <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> model provides a mechanistic explanation for independently-observed patterns of RRV transmission across Australia. As predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), RRV is endemic in tropical Australia, with little seasonal variation in transmission potential due to temperature, and seasonally epidemic in subtropical and temperate Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Weinstein, 1997</xref>). The model also accurately predicts disease seasonality at the national scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), reproducing the <italic>a priori</italic> predicted lag (8–10 weeks, or 2 months) for temperature to affect reported human cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jacups et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Stewart Ibarra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>). This lag between temperature and reported human cases arises from the time it takes for mosquito populations to increase, bite humans and reservoir hosts, acquire RRV, become infectious, and bite subsequent hosts; for pathogens to incubate with vectors; for humans to potentially develop symptoms, seek treatment, and report cases. Further, RRV transmission by <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> in inland areas often moves south as temperatures increase from spring into summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Russell, 1998</xref>), matching the model prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although temperature is often invoked as a potential driver for these types of patterns, it is difficult to establish causality from statistical inference alone, particularly if temperature and disease both exhibit strong seasonality and could both be responding to another latent driver. Thus, the mechanistic model is a critical piece of evidence linking temperature to patterns of disease.</p><p>In addition to explaining broad-scale patterns, the unimodal thermal model explains previously contradictory local-scale results. Specifically, statistical evidence for temperature impacts on local time series of cases is mixed. RRV incidence is often—but not always—positively associated with warmer temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tong and Hu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tong et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jacups et al., 2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Williams et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Werner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Koolhof et al., 2017</xref>). However, variation in the effects of temperature on transmission across space and time is expected from an intermediate thermal optimum, especially when observed temperatures are near or varying around the optimum. The strongest statistical signal of temperature on disease is expected in temperate regions where mean temperature varies along the rapidly rising portion of the <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> curve (~20–25°C). If mean temperatures vary both above and below the optimum (as in Darwin), important effects of temperature may be masked in time series models that fit linear responses. Additionally, if temperatures are always relatively suitable (as in tropical climates) or unsuitable (as in very cool temperate climates), variation in disease may be due primarily to other factors. A nonlinear mechanistic model is critical for estimating temperature impacts on transmission because the effect of increasing temperature by a few degrees can have a positive, negligible, or negative impact on <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> along different parts of the thermal response curve. Although field-based evidence for unimodal thermal responses in vector-borne disease is rare (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Perkins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Peña-García et al., 2017</xref>), there is some evidence for high temperatures constraining RRV transmission and vector populations: outbreaks were less likely with more days above 35°C in part of Queensland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gatton et al., 2005</xref>) and populations of <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> peaked at 25°C and declined above 32°C in Victoria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dhileepan, 1996</xref>). Future statistical analyses of RRV cases may benefit from using a nonlinear function for temperature-dependent <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> as a predictor instead of raw temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Breeding habitat availability also drives mosquito abundance and mosquito-borne disease. Local rainfall or river flow have been linked to the abundance of RRV vector species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jacups et al., 2015</xref>) and RRV disease cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tong and Hu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tong et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kelly-Hope et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gatton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jacups et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Williams et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Werner et al., 2012</xref>), as have high tides in coastal areas with saltmarsh mosquitoes, <italic>Ae. vigilax</italic> and <italic>Ae. camptorhynchus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tong and Hu, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jacups et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kokkinn et al., 2009</xref>). Overlaying models of species-specific breeding habitat with temperature-dependent models will better resolve the geographic and seasonal distribution of RRV transmission. Relative <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> peaked at similar temperatures whether or not we assumed mosquito abundance was temperature-dependent (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> versus <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>); however, the range of suitable temperatures was much wider for the model that assumed a temperature-independent mosquito population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Since breeding habitat can only impact vector populations when temperatures do not exclude them, it is critical to consider thermal constraints on mosquito abundance, even when breeding habitat is considered a stronger driver. Nonetheless, many mechanistic, temperature-dependent models of vector-borne disease transmission do not include thermal effects on vector density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Martens et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Craig et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Paull et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caminade et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hamlet et al., 2018</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the decision to exclude these relationships can have a critical impact on model results, especially near thermal limits.</p><p>Several important gaps remain in our understanding of RRV thermal ecology, in addition to the need for trait thermal response data for more vector species. First, the relative <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> model needs to be more rigorously validated using time series of cases to determine the importance of temperature at finer spatiotemporal scales. These analyses should incorporate daily, seasonal, and spatial temperature variation, including aquatic larval habitat and adult microhabitat temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Paaijmans et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cator et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>). They should also integrate species-specific drivers of breeding habitat availability, like rainfall and tidal patterns, infrastructure (e.g. drainage), and human activities (e.g. deliberate and accidental water storage). Second, translating environmental suitability for transmission into human cases also depends on disease dynamics in reservoir host populations and their impact on immunity. For instance, in Western Australia heavy summer rains can fail to initiate epidemics when low rainfall in the preceding winter depresses recruitment of susceptible juvenile kangaroos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mackenzie et al., 2000</xref>). By contrast, large outbreaks occur in southeastern Australia when high rainfall follows a dry year, presumably from higher transmission within relatively unexposed reservoir populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Woodruff et al., 2002</xref>). Third, as the climate changes, long-term predictions should consider potential thermal adaption of vectors, since transmission at upper thermal limits is currently limited by vector life history traits. To date, we know very little about standing genetic variation for thermal performance or existing local thermal adaptation in vectors for any disease system. Building vector species-specific <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> models and integrating thermal ecology with other drivers are important next steps for forecasting variation in RRV transmission. These more advanced models are necessary to translate our relative <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> results into predictions of absolute <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> (i.e. estimating the secondary cases per primary case, and where and when <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt;1 for sustained transmission).</p><p>Nonlinear thermal responses are particularly important for predicting how transmission will change under future climate regimes. Climate warming will likely increase the geographic and seasonal range of transmission potential in temperate, southern Australia where most Australians live. However, climate change will likely decrease transmission potential in tropical areas like Darwin, where moderate warming (~3°C) would push temperatures above the upper thermal limit for transmission for most of the year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, the extent of climate-driven declines in transmission will depend on how much <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> and <italic>Ae. vigilax</italic> can adapt to extend their upper thermal limits and whether warmer-adapted vector species (e.g. <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and potentially <italic>Ae. polynesiensis</italic>) can invade and sustain RRV transmission cycles. Thus, we can predict the response of RRV transmission by current vector species to climate change based on these trait thermal responses. However, future disease dynamics will also depend on vector adaptation, potential vector species invasions, and climate change impacts on sea level and precipitation that drive vector habitat availability.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Temperature-Dependent R<sub>0</sub>models</title><p>The ‘full <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> model’ (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) assumes temperature drives mosquito density and includes vector life history trait thermal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parham and Michael, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>).

These priors allowed us to more accurately represent the fit and uncertainty.</p><p>Our data did not include declining trait values at high temperatures for biting rate (<italic>a</italic>) and parasite development rate (<italic>PDR</italic>). Nonetheless, data from other mosquito species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mordecai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>) and principles of thermal biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dell et al., 2011</xref>) imply these traits must decline at high temperatures. Thus, for those traits we included an artificial data point where the trait value approached zero at a very high temperature (40°C), allowing us to fit the Brière function. We used strongly informative priors to limit the effect of these traits on the upper thermal limit of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> (by constraining them to decline near 40°C). Because our approach is designed to identify which traits constrain transmission at thermal limits, this choice is conservative by allowing <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> to be limited by other traits with better data. Accordingly, in the absence of data we favored overestimating <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> and underestimating <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> over the alternative. For comparison, we also fit all thermal responses with uniform priors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); these results illustrate how the priors affected the results.</p><p>Bayesian inference produces estimated posterior distributions rather than a single estimated value. Because these distributions can be non-normal and asymmetric, we report and apply medians rather than means, since medians are less sensitive to outlying values in extended tails. However, we plot mean values in the figures because they show a smoother and more visually intuitive representation of where trait and <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> thermal responses go to zero at the upper thermal limit. The means and medians are not substantially different, except at this thermal limit (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses</title><p>We conducted sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the full <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) to understand how trait thermal responses shape the thermal response of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>. We examined the sensitivity of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> two ways. First, we evaluated the impact of each trait by setting it constant while allowing all other traits to vary with temperature. Second, we calculated the partial derivative of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> with respect to each trait across temperature (∂<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>/∂<italic>X ·</italic> ∂<italic>X</italic>/∂<italic>T</italic> for trait <italic>X</italic> and temperature <italic>T</italic>; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3 equ4 equ5 equ6">Equations 3-6)</xref>. To understand what data would most improve the model, we also calculated the proportion of total uncertainty in <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> due to each trait across temperature. First, we propagated posterior samples from all trait thermal response distributions through to <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>T</italic>) and calculated the width of the 95% highest posterior density interval (HPD interval; a type of credible interval) of this distribution at each temperature: the ‘full <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>T</italic>) uncertainty’. Next, we sampled each trait from its posterior distribution while setting all other trait thermal responses to their posterior medians, and calculated the posterior distribution of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>T</italic>) and the width of its 95% HPD interval across temperature: the ‘single-trait <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>T</italic>) uncertainty’.

We used these data—along with the number of female adults alive on the first day of oviposition at each temperature—to generate a semi-daily time series estimating the number surviving.

Because the population was synchronized, and because mosquitoes lay discrete clutches of eggs separated by several days (the gonotrophic cycle duration), there were many data points when the populations did not produce offspring. These zero-inflated fecundity data are not ideal for fitting thermal responses. Therefore, after digitizing the semi-daily fecundity time series, we binned periods of several days (the bin size varied by temperature, since the gonotrophic cycle duration varies with temperature) and took a survival-weighted average within each bin (so days with more individual mothers contributing to offspring production counted more). To generate the dataset that we used to directly fit the thermal responses, we weighted the values within each bin by the mean number of surviving mothers in that bin. This approach allowed us to more accurately reflect daily fecundity averaged over a non-synchronized mosquito population. Note that the variation captured by these data and this approach is not variation between individual adult females, but rather variation by age for the whole population.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Leah Johnson and Matt Thomas for comments and Cameron Webb for posting the RRV case data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cameronwebb.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/why-is-mosquito-borne-disease-risk-greater-in-autumn/">https://cameronwebb.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/why-is-mosquito-borne-disease-risk-greater-in-autumn/</ext-link>).

Because it is difficult to measure traits at biologically extreme temperatures where survival and organismal performance are low, the shape of thermal performance curves at lower and upper thermal limits is always somewhat uncertain. To ensure that our models were not artificially constrained by assumptions about trait performance at temperatures for which they were not measured, we conservatively forced these traits to zero only at the extreme temperature of 40°C. In the <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> model, transmission is constrained by the traits with the most restrictive <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>max</sub></italic>. Therefore, the positive biting rate at temperatures where adult survival is zero does not result in any predicted transmission. Given the lack of biting rate data at higher temperatures, we did not want biting rate to artificially constrain transmission (i.e., in the absence of data it is much better to overestimate <italic>T<sub>max</sub></italic> and underestimate <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> than vice versa). Additionally, we consulted with our colleague Dr. Matthew Thomas (an empirical mosquito physiologist at Penn State) whose expert opinion (based on years of measuring thermal performance curves in mosquitoes) is that biting rate is the last trait to go to zero – if mosquitoes are alive, they will bite. He argues that biting rate will never constrain <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>, and that models of transmission should reflect that.</p><p>We revised the manuscript (in the Materials and methods and in the Results) to make the rationale behind our approach clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Mean monthly temperatures are used to create the suitability maps, but how well do these temperatures represent the various vector breeding habitats and available adult mosquito resting sites?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that water stores heat differently than air, and therefore larval habitat temperatures do not exactly match the surrounding air temperatures. (The discrepancy between air and water temperatures depends on the volume of the body of water.) Thermal consequences of adult mosquito microhabitat selection is an open area of research. However, our suitability maps are already so coarse in scale (monthly mean temperatures) that these differences are likely trivial compared to other sources of temperature variation that we also do not include (i.e., daily and weekly thermal variation). Nonetheless, our coarse-scale, constant-temperature analysis is an important and necessary first step before it is possible to incorporate finer-scale and varying temperature analyses.</p><p>We added text (in the Discussion) to point out these additional sources of temperature variation as limitations on our results and important avenues for further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Just wondering: looking at your PDR curve and your mosquito curves, do you hypothesize that the virus is already prepared for climate change, and that the limiting factor or bottleneck is the mosquito at moment? If true, subtle differences in the upper limit (and/or the ability to adapt) between mosquito species may become important.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct. For almost all organisms, development rates peak at higher temperatures than other life history traits like survival and fecundity. Thus, these traits – and particularly adult lifespan – are the key limitation on disease transmission at high temperatures. Moreover, differences in the thermal response of lifespan between mosquito species are very important (e.g., Mordecai et al., 2017 predict a 3°C difference in the optimal temperature for dengue transmission by <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> that arises from differences in mosquito survival at high temperatures). As a result, any evolutionary response of mosquito lifespan to climate change will impact how climate change affects disease transmission.</p><p>We revised the manuscript (in the Discussion) to better emphasize these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The comparison of the results to data on seasonality is welcome but lacks two key components. First, the authors do not describe how the timing of the RRV peak corresponds to that of the model-based estimates. They state 'as hypothesized', but do not relate this hypothesis which is critical to the results. They also characterize this finding as 'matching… the seasonal peak' in the Abstract, which is not explicitly the case because there is a delay. Second, The authors only make a single comparison despite having a data on multiple outbreaks in multiple parts of the country and highlighting their region specific estimates. The density model for Australia is spatiotemporal should it should be analyzed against spatiotemporal data (e.g. Discussion, fourth paragraph), not just summarized temporal data.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers make an excellent point. Our model estimates the value of <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> at constant temperatures but does not simulate transmission dynamically in a population. Therefore, our model cannot directly predict when human cases should peak as temperature changes over time, since temporal lags are introduced based on the time it takes for mosquito abundance to increase, the virus to incubate in the vectors, transmission to new humans to occur, and for humans to present symptoms, seek healthcare, and have cases recorded. Our “predicted seasonality” is based on independent work in other systems showing that there is often a 6-week lag between temperature and mosquito population abundance, resulting in a 8-10 week lag between temperature and observed cases. Based on this predicted lag (2 months), the seasonality of human cases is consistent with our temperature-based <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> model.</p><p>We agree that a spatiotemporal analysis is an important and obvious next step. However, we do not currently have multi-year or multi-location outbreak data. If we are able to obtain these data, we hope to accomplish this spatiotemporal analysis in a future paper. Although we do not have sufficient data to fully validate the temperature-dependent <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> model, the seasonal RRV data shows that our model is consistent with broad-scale observed patterns of disease. Validating this type of model (where the output is relative <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> that depends only on temperature) with human incidence data across time and space is non-trivial and there are no consensus methods for doing so. We are currently working on developing new methods to validate the model (with the spatiotemporal data described above that we hope to obtain). However, doing so is beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>We have revised our description of the seasonality results to make the rationale for the expected two-month lag between peak <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> and peak cases clearer (in the Introduction, Results, and Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The way the mosquito species are combined in the final model is unclear, e.g. Figure 5. Some data were available from different species and were used in different combinations for different components, but I could not tell which ones entered the final model or why that is expected to be a reasonable model despite the differences between species which the authors highlight at multiple points (e.g. Discussion, last paragraph). Uncertainty around this is compounded by the limited validation (i.e. comment above).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text to the manuscript (in the Results, and in various figure captions [Figure 2; Figure 5; Figure 6; Figure 7]) to be clearer about which species traits are incorporated into the main <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> model. As in Figure 2, mosquito-only traits are from <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> and infection traits are from <italic>Ae. vigilax</italic>. The trait fits from other vector and virus species (and the corresponding alternative <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> models) are only shown in supplemental figures for comparison with the main model.</p><p>The main text <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> model is primarily constrained by <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> traits, and is a reasonable model for transmission by <italic>Cx. annulirostris</italic> because the temperature-dependence of vector transmission is largely driven by vector traits (Mordecai et al., 2013, 2017). For other mosquito species, including <italic>Ae. vigilax</italic>, demographic and infection rate traits are likely to vary, resulting in different relationships between <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> and temperature. A major aim of our research program and this paper is to rigorously and clearly identify what trait data from which vector species are available in the literature, and to highlight how that impacts our predictions for how disease transmission will respond to climate change. There is a common misconception that the relationships between vector and pathogen traits and temperature are already well-known, yet that is clearly not the case. For these reasons, we hope this work will motivate further empirical work on the thermal responses of other Australian vector species, an important research gap that we highlight in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The Discussion should include limitations of the utility of the results due to estimating 'relative R<sub>0</sub>' as opposed to R<sub>0</sub>.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very important discussion point. Our major goals in this paper are to synthesize the multiple vector and parasite traits by which temperature influences transmission, to predict the overall response of transmission to temperature, and to identify the traits that drive both the response of transmission to temperature and the uncertainty in this response. To accomplish these goals, we needed a metric for transmission that incorporates the (nonlinear) influence of multiple traits, which can be parameterized with laboratory experiment data in which thermal responses can be measured rigorously. Relative <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> is an appropriate metric for this purpose because it incorporates the known temperature-dependent processes (and their nonlinear responses) involved in vector transmission. In this and previous papers, we have shown that relative <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> models parameterized in this way can accurately predict the temperature response of transmission in the field (Mordecai et al., 2013, 2017). However, our relative <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> metric differs from some traditional uses <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> as the number of secondary cases arising from a primary case in a fully susceptible population (i.e., the absolute reproductive number), and to calculate the critical vaccination threshold. This departure is intentional, because we do not expect temperature to be the only driver of variation in <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic>, nor do we expect laboratory experiments to capture <italic>quantitative</italic> transmission rates in the field. Instead, we are most interested in the <italic>relative</italic> effect of temperature on transmission potential, the optimal temperature for transmission, and the thermal limits at which transmission potential declines to zero.</p><p>We now more fully describe this rationale (third and last paragraphs in the Introduction) and explicitly mention translating relative <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> into absolute <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> (seventh paragraph in the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors included a square root in the R<sub>0</sub> calculation which changes its traditional meaning. It's not clear why they have made this modification and it probably has little if any impact on the results. Nonetheless, it would be best to use the traditional equation to reduce confusion in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that there are multiple forms of <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> commonly used in the literature, and that their meaning and derivation differ (Dietz 1993, Heffernan et al., 2005, Smith et al., 2012). As we explain in response 6, we are only using <italic>R<sub>0</sub></italic> to predict relative effects of temperature on transmission and to identify the thermal limits and optima. These metrics are not affected by whether our equation or its square is used because there is a monotonic, 1:1 relationship between the two forms (we previously demonstrated this in the supplementary materials of Mordecai et al., 2017, Figure F). The method we use here was derived from the next generation matrix method and is used in our previous analyses for malaria (Mordecai et al., 2013), dengue (Mordecai et al., 2017), and Zika (Tesla et al. bioRxiv, 2018). By keeping the model methods consistent, we facilitate comparison across systems.</p><p>We have added text indicating that there is disagreement in the literature and providing our reasoning (subsection “Temperature-Dependent R0 Models”, first paragraph in the Materials and methods).</p></body></sub-article></article>
