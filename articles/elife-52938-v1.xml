principal function is to stop bleeding by forming aggregates for hemostatic reactions. In addition to their participation in physiological hemostasis, platelet aggregates are also involved in pathological thrombosis and play an important role in inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis. The aggregation of platelets is elicited by various agonists, but these platelet aggregates have long been considered indistinguishable and impossible to classify. Here we present an intelligent method for classifying them by agonist type. It is based on a convolutional neural network trained by high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of blood cells to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists. The method is a powerful tool for studying the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and is expected to open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Platelets are small cells in the blood that primarily help stop bleeding after an injury by sticking together with other blood cells to form a clot that seals the broken blood vessel. Blood clots, however, can sometimes cause harm. For example, if a clot blocks the blood flow to the heart or the brain, it can result in a heart attack or stroke, respectively. Blood clots have also been linked to harmful inflammation and the spread of cancer, and there are now preliminary reports of remarkably high rates of clotting in COVID-19 patients in intensive care units.</p><p>A variety of chemicals can cause platelets to stick together. It has long been assumed that it would be impossible to tell apart the clots formed by different chemicals (which are also known as agonists). This is largely because these aggregates all look very similar under a microscope, making it incredibly time consuming for someone to look at enough microscopy images to reliably identify the subtle differences between them. However, finding a way to distinguish the different types of platelet aggregates could lead to better ways to diagnose or treat blood vessel-clogging diseases.</p><p>To make this possible, Zhou, Yasumoto et al. have developed a method called the “intelligent platelet aggregate classifier” or iPAC for short. First, numerous clot-causing chemicals were added to separate samples of platelets taken from healthy human blood. The method then involved using high-throughput techniques to take thousands of images of these samples. Then, a sophisticated computer algorithm called a deep learning model analyzed the resulting image dataset and “learned” to distinguish the chemical causes of the platelet aggregates based on subtle differences in their shapes. Finally, Zhou, Yasumoto et al. verified iPAC method’s accuracy using a new set of human platelet samples.</p><p>The iPAC method may help scientists studying the steps that lead to clot formation. It may also help clinicians distinguish which clot-causing chemical led to a patient’s heart attack or stroke. This could help them choose whether aspirin or another anti-platelet drug would be the best treatment. But first more studies are needed to confirm whether this method is a useful tool for drug selection or diagnosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Moreover, it is known that a range of diseases or medical conditions, such as inflammation, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis, are closely associated with platelet aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lievens and von Hundelshausen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engelmann and Massberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gay and Felding-Habermann, 2011</xref>). Also, in patients with artificial lungs due to severe respiratory failure such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramanathan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ronco et al., 2020</xref>), the long-term foreign body contact of blood with the artificial devices in the extracorporeal circulation often leads to platelet aggregation and thrombus formation followed by serious complications (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodie and Bacchetta, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oliver, 2009</xref>). Here, the aggregation of platelets is elicited by a variety of agonists, which bind to and activate specific receptors expressed on the platelet. This leads to platelet activation and structural and functional changes of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa expressed on the platelet surface. The activated form of the glycoprotein can bind with fibrinogen, enabling platelets to interact with each other and form aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moser et al., 2008</xref>). Despite the existence of diverse agonist types, platelet aggregates look morphologically similar and have long been thought indistinguishable since the discovery of platelet aggregates in the 19th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison, 2005</xref>). This is because morphological characteristics of platelet aggregates on a large statistical scale have been overlooked as microscopy (a high-content, but low-throughput tool) has been the only method to examine them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Finsterbusch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nitta et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this Short Report, we present an intelligent method for classifying platelet aggregates by agonist type. This is enabled by performing high-throughput imaging flow cytometry of numerous blood cells, training a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the image data, and using the CNN to identify and differentiate subtle yet appreciable morphological features of platelet aggregates activated by different types of agonists. Our finding that platelet aggregates can be classified by agonist type through their morphology is unprecedented as it has never been reported previously. The information about the driving factors behind the formation of platelet aggregates is expected to lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of platelet aggregation and open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of the iPAC</title><p>Our procedure for developing an intelligent platelet aggregate classifier (iPAC) is schematically shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. First, a blood sample obtained from a healthy person was separated into several different portions, into which different types of agonists were added to activate platelets while no agonist was added to the last portion for negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; Materials and methods). Here, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), collagen, thrombin receptor activator peptide-6 (TRAP-6), and U46619 were used since they are commonly used in platelet aggregation tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison, 2005</xref>). Initially, the concentrations of the agonists were carefully chosen (20 µM for ADP, 10 µg/mL for collagen, 13 µM for TRAP-6, 14 µM for U46619) to minimize variations in aggregate size between the different blood sample portions. These images were acquired through six experimental trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) to mitigate potential bias in the dataset that may have come from experimental variations (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, fluctuations in optical alignment, hydrodynamic cell focusing conditions, sample preparation). Then, four different concentrations of each agonist (2, 5, 10, 20 µM for ADP, 1, 5, 10, 20 µg/mL for collagen, 1, 5, 13, 20 µM for TRAP-6, 2.8, 5.6, 14, 28 µM for U46619) were used for platelet activation to examine the potential influence of agonist concentrations on the ability to differentiate platelet aggregates by agonist type, where the concentrations were chosen by referring to the concentrations of agonists used in light transmission aggregometry and in vitro flow-cytometric platelet aggregation tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koltai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Granja et al., 2015</xref>). The platelet aggregates were enriched by density-gradient centrifugation to remove erythrocytes from the blood sample portions. To prevent the platelet aggregates from dissolving during imaging flow cytometry, 2% paraformaldehyde was added to the blood sample portions to fix them. In addition to this sample preparation procedure, we tested other procedures such as pipetting, vortexing, fixation, and non-fixation and identified the current procedure to be advantageous over the others in preserving the morphology of platelet aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; Materials and methods). Second, an optofluidic time-stretch microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lau et al., 2016</xref>) was employed for high-throughput, blur-free, bright-field image acquisition of events (e.g., single platelets, platelet-platelet aggregates, platelet-leukocyte aggregates, single leukocytes, cell debris, remaining erythrocytes) in each sample portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>; Materials and methods). Here, fluorescence image acquisition is not needed because fluorescence images of platelet aggregates would look very similar to their bright-field images (except for the colors). Third, the acquired images of the events were used to train two CNN models that classified the platelets based on their morphological features by agonist type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Specifically, we first trained a CNN model with images of platelet aggregates activated by certain concentrations of agonists (12,000 images per agonist type) in order to examine their morphological changes while minimizing a potential influence of concentration-dependent factors on the morphology of the platelet aggregates. Then, we trained the other CNN model with a dataset in which the images of platelet aggregates activated by different concentrations of the agonists were equally mixed (12,000 images in total per agonist type) in order to show that different concentrations of the agonists do not perturb the CNN model’s ability to classify platelet aggregates. We employed the CNN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>) with an encoder-decoder architecture to disregard insignificant features such as background noise and keep important features in the bottleneck layer and trained it with the data of a single blood donor to ensure that only the morphological features driven by the agonists contributed to the development of the iPAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; Materials and methods). In comparison, we measured the platelet samples that were prepared under the same procedure using a conventional flow cytometer (Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter) which is based on fluorescence measurements for cell classification. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the flow cytometer was not capable of differentiating them as indicated by their significant overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>; Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of the iPAC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Procedure for developing the iPAC.

Large separations between the different platelet sample portions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> that visualizes the bottleneck layer in the CNN indicate the first CNN model’s ability to discriminate various types of agonist-activated platelet aggregates and negative control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). The negative control shows the highest classification accuracy, indicating that large morphological changes were made to the activated platelets. The U46619-treated blood sample portion shows the second highest classification accuracy of all the blood sample portions, indicating that the morphological changes caused by the agonist are very different from those caused by the other agonists. Many platelet-leukocyte aggregates were identified in the U46619-treated sample portion, but few in the other blood sample portions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This may be because U46619 acted as a thromboxane A2 (TXA<sub>2</sub>) receptor agonist, which activated TXA<sub>2</sub> receptors that are abundantly expressed on platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells, and injured vascular endothelial cells. The activation of TXA<sub>2</sub> receptors may affect the morphology of U46619-induced platelet aggregates by promoting the expression of adhesion molecules that favors the adhesion and infiltration of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George, 2000</xref>). The low classification accuracy values of the ADP-, collagen-, and TRAP-6-treated blood sample portions are presumably due to the fact that these agonists partially share similar mechanisms in forming platelets aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2000</xref>). For example, since platelets also release ADP themselves during activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison, 2005</xref>), platelet aggregates produced by other agonists may also share similar morphological features as ADP-activated platelet aggregates. In addition, TRAP-6 activates thrombin receptors while thrombin generation may be amplified by other agonists during platelet activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mann, 2011</xref>), which indicates that the low prediction values of TRAP-6 can be attributed to the participation of thrombin in platelet aggregation induced by all types of agonists. Furthermore, it is common that platelets are simultaneously activated by multiple agonists whose effects on platelet aggregation are coupled whereas they are also influenced by other factors such as locally produced inhibitors, vascular endothelial cells, blood flow, and coagulation proteins during activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cattaneo and Lecchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelson, 2012</xref>), thereby leading to the low classification accuracy values of certain agonists, which can be overcome by including the influences into the classification model to cover a wide spectrum of aggregation factors. To demonstrate the reproducibility of the iPAC, we tested it with an independent dataset (a total of 25,000 images of all event types), which was performed under the same conditions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

The results also reveal the existence of the unique morphological features related to each agonist type, which is promising for potential application to diagnosis of thrombotic disorders by tracing back to the leading factors of platelet aggregation. In addition, from a viewpoint of potential clinical applications, while the conventional assays can only evaluate platelet aggregability qualitatively, the iPAC can quantify it with the resolving power to identify the contribution of each agonist type to it. However, it can be recognized from the image library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) that U46619-activated platelet aggregates have relatively larger size than those in the other sample portions, which may be captured as a type of morphological features by the CNN, leading to the high classification accuracy of the U46619-activated samples.</p><p>To demonstrate the diagnostic utility of the iPAC, we applied it to blood samples of four healthy human subjects to predict the contribution of each agonist type to platelet aggregates (if any) in the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The blood samples were prepared by following the same procedure as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> except for the step of adding agonists (with 2000 images of events in each blood sample). The experiment was repeated under the same conditions three times. Over 85% of the total population of platelets in all the samples were identified as single platelets, which indicates the ability of the iPAC to differentiate single platelets and platelet aggregates. Furthermore, the agonist types of the platelet aggregates in each subject’s platelet classification results are consistent between the repeated experiments, indicating that the variations between the subjects resulted from platelet heterogeneity, not test variations. The iPAC’s diagnostic ability to obtain this type of information is an effective tool for studying and elucidating the mechanism of platelet aggregation and holds promise for clinical diagnostics, pharmacometrics, and therapeutics, although the iPAC needs more training with a wide spectrum of diseases and medical conditions for the purpose. For example, the iPAC may provide an important clue to the choice of drugs (e.g., aspirin or thienopyridines) for antiplatelet therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mauri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roe et al., 2012</xref>), the gold standard of the treatment and prevention of atherothrombosis (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction), in that aspirin inhibits the formation of TXA<sub>2</sub> whose stable analogue is U46619 while thienopyridines exert an antiplatelet effect by blocking the ADP receptor P2Y<sub>12</sub>. Furthermore, the iPAC may be able to identify TRAP-6-activated platelet aggregates in the bloodstream of patients with deep vein thrombosis (since TRAP-6 interacts with the receptor of thrombin) and suggest that they come from the venous side.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>iPAC-based diagnosis of platelets from four healthy human subjects.</title><p>The experiment was repeated under the same conditions three times per subject.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52938-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The information about the driving factors behind the formation of platelet aggregates is expected to lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of platelet aggregation and, thereby, open a window on an entirely new class of clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. For example, antiplatelet therapy is the gold standard of the treatment and prevention of atherothrombosis (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction) for which aspirin and thienopyridines (e.g., prasugrel and clopidogrel) are primarily used as antiplatelet drugs worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mauri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roe et al., 2012</xref>). Aspirin inhibits the formation of TXA<sub>2</sub> whose stable analogue is U46619, whereas thienopyridines exert an antiplatelet effect by blocking the ADP receptor P2Y<sub>12</sub>. Accordingly, the ability to identify the type of platelet aggregates in the blood stream may provide an important clue to the choice of a drug for antiplatelet therapy. Furthermore, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that normally occurs in a deep vein where coagulation activation plays an important role. Since TRAP-6 interacts with the receptor of thrombin (i.e., the product of the coagulation cascade), the ability to identify TRAP-6-activated platelet aggregates in the blood stream may suggest that aggregates come from the venous side. Therefore, the iPAC may pave the way for introducing a novel laboratory testing technique for the management of pathological thrombosis such as atherothrombosis and DVT although further basic and clinical studies are needed.</p><p>The relation between platelet activation signaling pathways and the formation of platelet aggregates has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brass et al., 2013</xref>). It is known that agonists activate platelets in a selective manner via specific receptors, which is followed by a variety of downstream signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2010</xref>). For example, collagen interacts with the immune-like receptor glycoprotein VI, which signals through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and activates the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2010</xref>) In contrast, soluble agonists such as TRAP-6, U46619, and ADP interact with G protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michelson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brass, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, each soluble agonist couples with a specific type of G protein, which leads to different aggregation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rivera et al., 2009</xref>) and thus suggests different underlying mechanisms for expressing different morphological features on platelet aggregates. It is challenging, but is expected to be intriguing to study and elucidate the mechanisms for a further understanding of the biology of platelets.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">PE anti-human CD61 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat#336405;

The pulse that contained the spatial profile of the cell on its spectrum was collected by the second objective lens and spatially recombined by the second diffraction grating, followed by photodetection with a high-speed photodetector (New Focus 1580-B) with a detection bandwidth of 12 GHz. To ensure imaging of platelet-related events (i.e., single platelets, platelet-platelet aggregates, platelet-leukocyte aggregates), fluorescence detection was used in conjunction with the optofluidic time-stretch microscope. A 488 nm continuous-wave laser was used to detect CD61 fluorescence signals with a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu H10723-01MOD). Only the image signals associated with CD61 fluorescence signals were collected. The image-encoded pulse and fluorescence signal were digitized using a high-speed oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO 71604B) with a detection bandwidth of 16 GHz and a sampling rate of 50 GS/s. Pulses were repeated by the mode-locked pulse laser at 75 MHz so that image-encoded pulses detected by the photodetector were digitally stacked to form 2D images using MATLAB R2018b (MathWorks). The pulse intensity profile (usually Gaussian-shaped with ripples) was normalized to obtain a flat background. Also, all the images were cropped into 160 × 160 pixels by the same cropping algorithm, by which the cell-contained part was completely included in each image for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Evaluation of agonist-activated platelets by conventional flow cytometry</title><p>We analyzed agonist-activated platelets with a conventional flow cytometer (Cytomics FC500, Beckman Coulter) that can count and analyze large cell populations via scattering and fluorescence measurements with high throughput. Blood samples were processed using the same procedure as for optofluidic time-stretch microscopy, but labeled with anti-CD61-APC and anti-CD45-FITC antibodies (Beckman Coulter) for detecting white blood cells and platelets, respectively. To only detect single platelets and platelets aggregates, gating of cellular size and granularity was applied to the light scatter plots. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the C1 areas, which correspond to CD61-APC positive and CD45-FITC negative, show events associated with single platelets and platelet-platelet aggregates. The C2 areas, which correspond to CD61-APC/CD45-FITC double positive, show events associated with platelet-leukocyte aggregates. The C3 areas (CD61-APC/CD45-FITC double negative) and C4 areas (CD61-APC negative and CD45-FITC positive) correspond to events which did not contain any platelets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Convolutional neural network</title><p>The details of the CNN with the encoder-decoder architecture are as follows. The encoder was used to extract morphological features of platelet aggregates, while the decoder was used to recover the platelet aggregate images from the morphological features. This two-stage structure forced the encoder to extract features from the cells instead of the background or noise, which helped enhance the reliability and accuracy of classification. The images were normalized to 0-mean and divided into training, validation, and test sets at a ratio of 3:1:1. The CNN classifier was trained on the training set. The validation loss was calculated with the validation dataset at each epoch to monitor the learning process. The learning rate was reduced when the validation loss stopped descending for more than 3 epochs until it reached 1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. The training was ceased when there was no more decrease in the validation loss for more than 6 epochs. After the training ended, the test set was processed to calculate the final classification accuracy for each agonist type. The CNN classifier was implemented on Keras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chollet, 2015</xref>) with the Tensorflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abadi et al., 2016</xref>) backbone. The training of the CNN classifier was optimized by Adam with an initial learning rate of 0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the ImPACT Program, JSPS Core-to-Core Program, White Rock Foundation, Nakatani Foundation, and University of Tokyo’s Center for Nano Lithography.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is a shareholder of two cell analysis startups (CYBO and Cupido).</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee in the School of Medicine at the University of Tokyo [no. 11049-(6)].

In addition, human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prepared from blood collected into trisodium citrate (3.8% w/v) has a depressed ionic calcium concentration, which can cause platelet aggregation and release of substances during centrifugation (2). To overcome these different problems, a centrifugation technique has been developed for the isolation and washing of platelets from human or rodent blood anticoagulated with acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD). The cells are resuspended in a physiological buffer under well-defined conditions, notably the presence of plasmatic ionic calcium concentrations (2 mM) and the absence of coagulation factors or other plasma components&quot;. Thus, physiological calcium (2 mM) needs to be added back to the platelet suspension to avoid artifacts. If the authors wish to study platelet-rich plasma, an alternate non-calcium chelating anti-coagulant, such as PPACK could be used.</p><p>Please make textual changes to your manuscript to indicate these caveats to your data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52938.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Data are presented for three healthy subjects.

There is no other assessment of the variation amongst normals.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We interpreted the data from the three healthy subjects as individual variations, not test variations, because all three donors are healthy, but their genders, ages, and races are different. To provide more solid evidence, we have performed additional experiments to obtain results from additional healthy subjects and repeat the experiments on different days three times. As shown in revised Figure 3E (now Figure 4 in the revised manuscript), each subject’s platelet classification results are consistent, indicating that the variations between the subjects result from the individual variations, not test variations. To address the reviewer’s comment, we have revised/added the following text in the revised manuscript (subsection “Demonstration of the iPAC”): “To demonstrate the diagnostic utility of the iPAC, we applied it to blood samples of four healthy human subjects to predict the contribution of each agonist type to platelet aggregates (if any) in the samples (Figure 4). The blood samples were prepared by following the same procedure as shown in Figure 1A except for the step of adding agonists (with 2,000 images of events in each blood sample). The experiment was repeated under the same conditions three times. Over 85% of the total population of platelets in all the samples were identified as single platelets, which indicates the ability of the iPAC to differentiate single platelets and platelet aggregates. Furthermore, the agonist types of the platelet aggregates in each subject’s platelet classification results are consistent between the repeated experiments, indicating that the variations between the subjects resulted from platelet heterogeneity, not test variations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Endothlelial TXA2 receptors are cited (subsection “Demonstration of the iPAC”) as a mechanism of one effect from U46619, but they studied studied blood, which likely has, if anything, a very small amount of circulating endothelial cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As they correctly state, the concentration of circulating endothelial cells in blood is very small. However, TXA2 receptors on platelet membranes and vascular endothelial cells are abundantly expressed, such that they may have a significant effect on U46619-induced platelet aggregation. To clarify this point, we have added the following statement to the revised manuscript (subsection “Demonstration of the iPAC”): “U46619 acted as a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor agonist to activate endothelial TXA2 receptors that are abundantly expressed on platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells, and injured vascular endothelial cells. The activation of TXA2 receptors may affect the morphology of U46619-induced platelet aggregates by promoting the expression of adhesion molecules that favors the adhesion and infiltration of leukocytes (Michelson, 2012; George, 2000).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unlikely that a platelet will ever see a single agonist in circulation. This is not discussed. Collagen-induced activation of platelets results in ADP and TXA2 release. They tested all three of those agonists. Some consideration of these combinations would aid in the feasibility of this novel technology. Similarly, platelets circulate in an environment with locally produced inhibitors (NO, prostacyclins, ADPases). Their effect has not been assessed, and this can be substantial (see Cattaneo et al., 2007).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. It is true that a platelet in vivo is activated by multiple agonists simultaneously. This is why the diagonal values in the confusion matrices shown in Figure 3A and Figure 3D are not 100%, but there exist some cross-coupling effects from multiple agonists on platelet aggregation. Our ultimate goal is to develop a complete classification model that can predict the contribution of each agonist very accurately, even when multiple agonists influence platelet aggregation simultaneously. This requires image data from experiments in which multiple agonists are used to induce platelet aggregation both in vitro and in vivo. To clarify this point, we have added the following statement to the revised manuscript (subsection “Demonstration of the iPAC”): “Furthermore, it is common that platelets are simultaneously activated by multiple agonists whose effects on platelet aggregation are coupled, thereby leading to the low classification accuracy values of certain agonists, which can be overcome by including the influences of multiple agonists into the classification model to cover a wide spectrum of aggregation factors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Platelets circulate in vivo where the calcium concentration is 2 mM. The studies are done in citrated plasma where the calcium concentration is far lower. Studying platelets at artificially low calcium concentrations has, in the past, led to artifactual findings. Other anticoagulants could be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In our study, we used citric acid because it is a reversible calcium chelator, does not significantly reduce the calcium concentration, and is commonly used in the study of platelets and coagulation proteins. Alternatively, ACD can be used because it is an anticoagulant that contains citric acid and is equivalent to citrated blood. On the other hand, other anticoagulants such as heparin and EDTA are not suitable for this study because heparin attenuates platelet function by the inhibition of thrombin while EDTA is a strong irreversible calcium chelator that completely suppresses platelet function. To clarify this point, we have added the following statement to the revised manuscript (Discussion section): “specifically, blood samples were obtained from a healthy person with citric acid as the anticoagulant, which did not dissociate platelet aggregates (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) while maintaining the sufficient calcium concentration for platelet aggregation (Cazenave, 2004). The other common anticoagulants, such as heparin and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), are not suitable for this study because they influence the coagulation functions of platelets (Ludlam, 1981).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Was there additional activation of the platelets when they were spun on the gradient?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The high percentage (99%) of the “control” in the confusion matrix indicates that platelets were not significantly affected by the sample preparation procedure. Furthermore, even if there is a minor influence from the density gradient on the morphology of platelet aggregates, it should be considered identical among all the samples since we applied the same protocol to each sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In deep learning network used for classification what is the need for the up-sampling layer (decoder part)? The decode part reconstructs the image. Is this reconstructed image being used anywhere? Why is the classifier layer at the CNN bottleneck not sufficient for classification?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The reconstructed images were used in the training process to optimize the CNN’s performance. By minimizing the difference between the original images and the reconstructed images, we ensured in the CNN model that the features in the bottleneck layer were crucial to cellular morphology. This two-stage structure forced the encoder to extract features from the cells instead of the background or noise (while the classification result may be prone to noise if only the classifier is applied in the CNN), which helped us enhance the reliability and accuracy of platelet classification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors mention that crops from the actual image containing the cells are used for classification. However, how these crops are generated is a big question. Are they manually cropped from the image or some automated technique is used to obtain the cropped regions, specifically during testing phase?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The images were cropped in the image recovery process automatically. In the process, the region of the cell in each image is identified by using a segmentation algorithm. Then, the image was cropped into 160 x 160 pixels in size with the cell region at the center of the image. Therefore, the cell region remains intact in the image. This cropping algorithm was the same for all the images in this work. To clarify this point, we have added the following statement to the revised manuscript (subsection “Blood samples for detection of platelet aggregates”): “Also, all the images were cropped into 160×160 pixels by the same cropping algorithm, by which the cell-contained part was completely included in each image for further analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The classification accuracy for the TRAP-6 in both confusion matrix of Figure 3 is low in comparison to the others. Is there any explanation on why so? Is there any class imbalance during training phase? How many total images were used for training and how mane images were there in each class?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The low classification accuracy elements of the TRAP-6-treated blood sample portions in the confusion matrix are presumably due to the fact that ADP, collagen, and TRAP-6 agonists partially share similar mechanisms in forming platelets aggregates, as discussed in previous publications (Michelson, 2012; George, 2000; Michelson, 2003; Harrison, 2005; Li et al., 2000). In particular, TRAP-6 activates protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), which is one of the thrombin receptors. Meanwhile, thrombin is released into the blood when platelets are activated by the other agonists. Therefore, TRAP-6-induced platelet aggregates may be similar to those induced by other agonists due to the thrombin-related platelet aggregation. As for the number of images for training, the classes are balanced during the training process. In fact, 12,000 images for each class were used for the training (60,000 images in total). To clarify the point of the low TRAP-6 element value, we have added the following statement to the revised manuscript (subsection “Demonstration of the iPAC”): “In addition, TRAP-6 activates thrombin receptors while thrombin generation may be amplified by other agonists during platelet activation (Mann, 2011), which indicates that the low prediction values of TRAP-6 can be attributed to the participation of thrombin in platelet aggregation induced by all types of agonists. Furthermore, it is common that platelets are simultaneously activated by multiple agonists whose effects on platelet aggregation are coupled, thereby leading to the low classification accuracy values of certain agonists, which can be overcome by including the influences of multiple agonists into the classification model to cover a wide spectrum of aggregation factors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Accuracy of which data is shown in Figure 3A and 3C?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Figure 3A shows the accuracy of the images of platelet aggregates induced by the optimized concentrations of agonists (20 µM for ADP, 10 µg/mL for collagen, 13 µM for TRAP-6, 14 µM for U46619), while Figure 3C shows the images and prediction results of an independent dataset that was not used in the training process. The independent dataset was acquired from the blood samples induced by the optimized concentrations of agonists (20 µM for ADP, 10 µg/mL for collagen, 13 µM for TRAP-6, 14 µM for U46619) under the same preparation procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) A more elaborate explanation on what can be seen in the images in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 will be good. Also, can the images be shown at same pixel size/scale?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have added more text to the legend of the supplementary figure and revised the figure with images at the same pixel size and scale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Has the classification accuracy been compared with any other multi-class classification method from literature?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that we classify platelet aggregates by morphology and there is no previous work that shows classification of platelet aggregates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) As I understand, the classifier is trained using brightfield images. If the fluorescence images being used to capture any extra information for classification?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Although we have not done high-throughput fluorescence imaging of platelets, we doubt that the fluorescence images will provide extra information for classification because fluorescence does not differentiate the contribution of each agonist and fluorescence images of platelet aggregates will look pretty much similar to their bright-field images (except for the colors). Since different types of leukocytes can be stained with different fluorescent probes, platelet-leukocytes can be better classified with the availability of their fluorescent images, but fluorescent labeling is not desirable for this work because it also activates platelets and may produce artifacts. To clarify this point, we have added the following statement to the revised manuscript (subsection “Development of the iPAC”): “Here, fluorescence image acquisition is not needed because fluorescence images of platelet aggregates would look very similar to their bright-field images (except for the colors).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Comment 2: Please change &quot;endothelial TXA2 receptors&quot; to &quot;TXA2 receptors&quot; to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. We have made the change as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In response to comment 3, the authors did not address this concern about the lack of locally produced inhibitors (NO, PGI2, ectoADPases etc): &quot;Similarly platelets circulate in an environment with locally produced inhibitors (NO, prostacyclins, ADPases). Their effect has not been assessed, and this can be substantial (see Cattaneo et al., 2007).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. It is true that the locally produced inhibitors have a substantial effect on platelet aggregation. However, to evaluate this effect using our iPAC, an experiment has to be conducted in vivo, where locally produced inhibitors, vascular endothelial cells, blood flow, and coagulation proteins affect platelet aggregation simultaneously. In this manuscript, the purpose of our study is to classify platelet aggregates by agonist based on our intelligent classification model that was constructed by adding various agonists into whole blood in vitro, measuring their effects on the morphology of platelet-platelet aggregates and platelet-leukocyte aggregates, and forming the confusion matrix as a linear superposition of the effects. Thus, the low classification accuracy values of some agonists in the confusion matrices (Figure 3A, Figure 3D) are also attributed to the fact that in vitro experiments are not able to evaluate all factors of platelet aggregation. In other words, it is meaningful to perform this study in vitro because if these agonists are administrated in vivo to develop the confusion matrix, it can lead to thrombosis and death. On the other hand, we hope to perform in vivo experiments using animals and address this point in our future study. To clarify this point, we have revised the following statement in the manuscript (subsection “Demonstration of the iPAC”): “Furthermore, it is common that platelets are simultaneously activated by multiple agonists whose effects on platelet aggregation are coupled whereas they are also influenced by other factors such as locally produced inhibitors, vascular endothelial cells, blood flow, and coagulation proteins during activation (Cattaneo, 2007; Michelson, 2012), thereby leading to the low classification accuracy values of certain agonists, which can be overcome by including the influences into the classification model to cover a wide spectrum of aggregation factors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In response to comment 4, the authors appear to misstate Cazenave et al., 2004 which says &quot;Citrate is the preferred anticoagulant for blood collection,.…. however, this method has certain disadvantages. In particular, the PRP preparation has a limited stability (no longer than 2 h) and contains plasma proteins, including enzymes. In addition, human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prepared from blood collected into trisodium citrate (3.8% w/v) has a depressed ionic calcium concentration, which can cause platelet aggregation and release of substances during centrifugation (2).

Thus, physiological calcium (2 mM) needs to be added back to the platelet suspension to avoid artifacts. If the authors wish to study platelet-rich plasma, an alternate non-calcium chelating anti-coagulant, such as PPACK could be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. Considering the practical utility of the iPAC, we used the same conditions as those used in conventional clinical coagulation tests in Japan, where 3.2% citrate blood is used. In addition, as described in the original manuscript, platelet aggregation was induced by adding various agonists into whole blood, instead of PRP used by Cazenave et al., before the centrifugation was performed. The use of washed platelets in PRP eliminates the involvement of leukocytes and coagulation factors and is significantly different from the mechanism of platelet aggregation in vivo, and therefore, we think it is important to do experiments with whole blood. Although the calcium concentration in citrate blood may not be the same with that in vivo, we expect the iPAC constructed based on in vitro experiments to be practically useful as a new laboratory testing tool for diagnosing thrombosis, and therefore, 3.2% citrate whole blood (not an alternate noncalcium chelating anticoagulant) was used in our experiments as it can minimize the problem of a depressed ionic calcium concentration. Meanwhile, we also consider the effect of the anticoagulant and ionic calcium concentration on the morphology of platelet aggregates as an exciting topic to address in the future. To clarify these points, we have revised the manuscript as follows (subsection “Blood samples for detection of platelet aggregates”): “Specifically, blood samples were obtained from a healthy person with 3.2% citric acid as the anticoagulant (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Although it has a depressed concentration of ionized calcium, 3.2% citrate blood is desirable for clinical coagulation tests (Adcock, 1997; Cazenave, 2004).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
