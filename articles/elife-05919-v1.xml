marine invertebrates, are critical for the survival of reef-building corals and other marine organisms exposed to high-solar irradiance. These compounds have also been found in marine fish, where their accumulation is thought to be of dietary or symbiont origin. In this study, we report the unexpected discovery that fish can synthesize gadusol de novo and that the analogous pathways are also present in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Furthermore, we demonstrate that engineered yeast containing the fish genes can produce and secrete gadusol. The discovery of the gadusol pathway in vertebrates provides a platform for understanding its role in these animals, and the possibility of engineering yeast to efficiently produce a natural sunscreen and antioxidant presents an avenue for its large-scale production for possible use in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05919.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05919.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05919.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sunlight is the Earth's primary energy source and is exploited by an array of natural and man-made processes. Photosynthetic plants harness solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into biomass, and solar panels capture light and convert it to electricity. Sunlight is critical to life on Earth, and yet excessive exposure to sunlight can cause serious harm as it contains ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which damages the DNA of cells. In humans, this damage can lead to conditions such as cataracts and skin cancer.</p><p>The marine organisms and animals that live in the upper ocean and on reefs are subject to intense and unrelenting sunlight. In their effort to protect against potentially deadly UV radiation, many small and particularly vulnerable marine organisms, such as bacteria and algae, produce UV-protective sunscreens. While UV-protective compounds have also been found in larger organisms, including fish and their eggs, the presence of these sunscreens has always been attributed to the animal sequestering the compounds from their environment or partnering with a sunscreen-producing microorganism.</p><p>Now, Osborn, Almabruk, Holzwarth et al. have discovered a fish that is able to produce such a UV-protective compound completely on its own. After identifying the full set of genes—or pathway—responsible for generating the UV-protective compound, the same pathway was detected in a variety of diverse animals, including amphibians, reptiles, and birds. This opens up a new area of study, because besides providing UV protection, no one yet knows what other roles the molecule may have in these animals. Furthermore, introducing the complete pathway into yeast enabled these cells to produce the sunscreen. In the future, engineering a yeast population to produce large quantities of the natural sunscreen could lead to large-scale production of the UV-protective compound so it can be used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05919.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05919.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>vertebrates</kwd><kwd>gadusol</kwd><kwd>sunscreen</kwd><kwd>mycosporine</kwd><kwd>2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 ES000210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanguay</surname><given-names>Robert L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Oregon State University College of Pharmacy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>General Research Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahmud</surname><given-names>Taifo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Many vertebrates are able to synthesize a sunscreen compound de novo and the pathway involved can be used for heterologous production of the compound in yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sunscreen compounds, mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and related gadusols, commonly found in bacteria, fungi, algae, and marine invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shick and Dunlap, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miyamoto et al., 2014</xref>), have been proposed to fulfill a variety of functions, such as sunscreen, antioxidant, stress response, intracellular nitrogen reservoir, and/or optical filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao and Garcia-Pichel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bok et al., 2014</xref>). Although their formation had long been proposed to originate from the shikimate pathway, more recent bioinformatic and biochemical studies revealed that in cyanobacteria, MAAs are synthesized by desmethyl-4-deoxygadusol synthase (DDGS), a dehydroquinate synthase (DHQS) homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balskus and Walsh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asamizu et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, inactivation of the DDGS gene in <italic>Anabaena variabilis</italic> ATCC 29413 did not abolish the production of MAAs, suggesting that additional pathways exist for the biosynthesis of MAAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spence et al., 2012</xref>). DDGS converts sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (SH7P) to desmethyl-4-deoxygadusol via a unique sequence of dephosphorylation, aldol condensation, enolization, dehydration, reduction, and tautomerization reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balskus and Walsh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asamizu et al., 2012</xref>). The product is subsequently converted by a methyltransferase to 4-deoxygadusol, the building block of MAAs.</p><p>4-Deoxygadusol has also been proposed to be the precursor of gadusol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Starcevic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosic and Dove, 2011</xref>), a related compound initially isolated from cod roe (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic> L.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Plack et al., 1981</xref>), but also found in roes of other marine fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Plack et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbeloa et al., 2010</xref>), sea urchin eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chioccara et al., 1986</xref>), cysts and nauplii of brine shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grant et al., 1985</xref>), mantis shrimp crystalline cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bok et al., 2014</xref>), and sponges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandaranayake et al., 1997</xref>). As genes responsible for the production of 4-deoxygadusol and MAAs are commonly found in bacteria (e.g., cyanobacteria), algae, and other marine microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shick and Dunlap, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miyamoto et al., 2014</xref>), the accumulation of these compounds in marine animals has been proposed to be of dietary or symbiont origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbeloa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao and Garcia-Pichel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loew, 2014</xref>). On the other hand, a gene cluster like that in cyanobacteria apparently encoding a four-step DDGS-based pathway for converting SH7P to MAAs was discovered in the genomes of a coral (<italic>Acropora digitifera</italic>) and sea anemone (<italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>), suggesting that these invertebrates can produce MAAs autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosic and Dove, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shinzato et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>DDGS is a member of the sugar phosphate cyclase (SPC) superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to DHQS, this superfamily includes four enzymes known for their roles in the biosynthesis of natural products with therapeutic application: 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (EEVS), 2-epi-valiolone synthase, aminoDHQS, and 2-deoxy-<italic>scyllo</italic>-inosose synthase (DOIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mahmud, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asamizu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). EEVS catalyzes the entry step to the biosynthesis of pseudosugar-containing natural products, such as the antidiabetic drug acarbose and the crop protectant validamycin A, and has so far only been identified and characterized in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mahmud, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we surprisingly also found genes that encode EEVS-like proteins (annotated as ‘PREDICTED: pentafunctional AROM polypeptide-like’) in the genomes of fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). This gene is located in a cluster with another functionally unknown gene (labeled as MT-Ox hereafter) and flanked by a suite of transcription factor genes encoding FRMD4B, MitF, MDFIC, and FoxP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These transcription factors have been known to regulate the expression of genes with essential roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rice et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). However, whether they have a direct functional relationship with the EEVS and MT-Ox genes remains an open question. Whereas humans and other mammals also have FRMD4B, MitF, MDFIC, and FoxP1 homologs, they lack the EEVS-like and the MT-Ox genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, the presence of the EEVS-like gene, previously only found in bacteria, in the genomes of fish, and other egg-laying vertebrates is puzzling and evolutionarily intriguing. Here, we report bioinformatics and functional studies of zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) EEVS-like and MT-Ox genes and the expression of this two-enzyme pathway in yeast, and discuss the evolutionary origin of this pathway in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05919.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bioinformatic analysis of sugar phosphate cyclases in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and biochemical characterization of gadusol biosynthetic enzymes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bayesian phylogenetic tree of SPCs.

investigate the function of the vertebrate EEVS-like genes, the protein encoded by the zebrafish EEVS-like gene (LOC100003999) was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Incubation of the recombinant protein with SH7P gave a product, which was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and GC-MS to be EEV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3 fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 3, 4</xref>), identifying the protein as an EEVS. The best-characterized bacterial EEVS is ValA from the validamycin pathway in <italic>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</italic> subsp. <italic>jinggangensis</italic> 5008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2006</xref>), and the crystal structure of ValA (Protein Data Bank [PDB] entry 4P53) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kean et al., 2014</xref>), allowed identification of a fingerprint set of 14 active-site residues with characteristic variations that could differentiate the various SH7P cyclases. Further supporting the assignment of the LOC100003999-encoded protein as an EEVS, sequence comparisons show that all animal EEVS-like proteins are highly similar (60–72% identity) and also match the sequence of ValA at all 14 fingerprint sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5 fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 5, 6</xref>). This firmly establishes the presence of EEVS activity in animals.</p><p>The second gene, MT-Ox (zgc:113054), is predicted to encode a protein that contains two domains: the <italic>N</italic>-terminal domain is similar to <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM)–dependent methyltransferases, and the <italic>C</italic>-terminal domain is similar to NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent oxidoreductases. Although its function in zebrafish is unknown, the transcription of this gene in larvae is upregulated by light, leading to a prediction of its involvement in circadian clock regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weger et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, we hypothesized that this bifunctional protein is involved in modifying EEV to yield an oxidized and methylated product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To test this hypothesis, recombinant MT-Ox protein encoded by zgc:113054 was incubated with EEV in the presence of SAM and NAD<sup>+</sup>. Following incubation, a product with λmax of 294 nm (pH 7) and 270 (pH 2.5) was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Further analysis of the product by (−)-ESI-MS (<italic>m/z</italic> 203 [M-H]<sup>−</sup>) and <sup>1</sup>H NMR confirmed its identity as gadusol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). We postulate that the conversion of EEV to gadusol by MT-Ox takes place via oxidation of the C-2 or C-3 OH, followed by enolization and methylation of the resulting C-2 OH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This new pathway to the UV-absorbing vinylogous acid functional group shared by gadusol and 4-deoxygadusol is distinct from that used in the biosynthesis of the MAAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balskus and Walsh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Spence et al., 2012</xref>), and the existence of multiple pathways for generating this scaffold is intriguing and may indicate that this is a privileged chemical scaffold in living organisms.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05919.012</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Production of gadusol in zebrafish and yeast and its sunscreen activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) HPLC traces and UV absorptions of gadusol produced from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cell-free extract containing EEVS and purified MT-Ox protein at pH 7.0 and 2.5.

To demonstrate de novo synthesis of gadusol in zebrafish, the embryos were collected at 72 hpf, lyophilized and extracted with methanol, and the extract was analyzed by HPLC and ESI-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Our finding of gadusol in the extract unambiguously confirms the ability of zebrafish to synthesize gadusol and amends the current perception that gadusol found in fish and other vertebrates is necessarily of dietary or symbiont origin. However, as MAAs are synthesized via a different pathway and there is no evidence that fish have those biosynthetic enzymes, the accumulation of MAAs in fish would still appear to be of dietary origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mason et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zamzow, 2004</xref>).</p><p>To show that the recombinant LOC100003999 and zgc:113054 genes are sufficient for encoding gadusol synthesis, they were cloned into a yeast expression vector and transferred into a <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain, in which the transaldolase gene <italic>TAL1</italic> had been deleted. Yeast possesses a robust pentose–phosphate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), and by removing the transaldolase enzyme, which normally metabolizes SH7P, and adding EEVS and MT-Ox, we expected to facilitate an effective shunt pathway from SH7P to gadusol. Analysis of the culture broth by HPLC, ESI-MS, and UV spectrophotometry revealed the presence of gadusol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and its accumulation to ∼20 mg/l after 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The results not only demonstrate the ability of the engineered yeast to produce and secrete gadusol but also present a new avenue for large-scale production of the compound for possible commercial uses, for example, sunscreen and/or antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Plack et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardozo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbeloa et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To test the UV-protective activity of gadusol, a yeast <italic>rad1∆</italic> mutant, which is sensitive to UVB, was suspended at approximately 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL in the concentrated supernatant from the gadusol-producing yeast strain or from an otherwise isogenic control strain that did not produce gadusol. The gadusol-containing supernatant suppressed the UVB-sensitivity of the <italic>rad1∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), confirming the UVB-protective activity of gadusol. Analogous experiments with a wild-type strain (RAD1) at higher doses of UVB showed comparable results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), consistent with UVB protective activity.</p><p>As noted above, the SPCs EEVS, EVS, DDGS, aminoDHQS, and DOIS are all related to DHQS and are widespread in bacteria and fungi, but other than this report, are not known to exist in vertebrates or prevertebrates. We suggest that the vertebrate EEVS and MT-Ox genes were most plausibly acquired via horizontal gene transfer. Interestingly, searches identify the stramenopile <italic>Aureococcus anophagefferens</italic> and the microalgae <italic>Coccomyxa subellipsoidea</italic>, as the only non-vertebrate organisms in current databases that harbor a similar bifunctional MT-Ox gene, and both organisms have a predicted EEVS gene adjacent to that of MT-Ox. As algae are known to be active horizontal gene transfer agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ni et al., 2012</xref>), algae such as these become a plausible place both for the development of this alternate pathway for gadusol production and as a source of the genes found in vertebrates. Further supporting such a relationship, the <italic>A. anophagefferens</italic> EEVS protein is substantially more similar to the vertebrate EEVSs than it is to bacterial EEVSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, denoted by the blue star).</p><p>Further bioinformatics studies also showed that the tunicates and lancelets lack the EEVS and MT-Ox genes, suggesting that the gene transfer occurred sometime during the evolution of primitive chordates to bony fishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). While the EEVS and MT-Ox genes are retained in modern ray-finned fish (with the exception of puffer fish), as well as in amphibians, reptiles, and birds, they were lost in mammals, including the egg-laying mammal platypus, indicating the lack of a direct link between gadusol and the mode of reproduction. The West African coelacanth genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amemiya et al., 2013</xref>) also appears to lack the EEVS and MT-Ox genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This rare ovoviviparous fish lives in caves 100–500 meters deep and feeds at night, and its lack of gadusol production ability may be directly related to its limited exposure to UV light and/or oxidative stress. Other than the well-documented presence of gadusol in fish eggs, where it can serve to protect the roe from UV damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbeloa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colleter et al., 2014</xref>), nothing is known of its role(s) in fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds.

Cells (375 µl) were irradiated with UVB (302 nm) at the indicated doses in wells of a 24-well microtiter plate shaken at 900 rpm. 3 µl aliquots of cells were then spotted onto a YEPD plate, which was incubated 24 hr at 30°C prior to being photographed. The supernatants of the gadusol producing and control strains were obtained by centrifugation following 5 day of growth in YNB + 2% glucose + 30 µg/ml leucine + 30 µg/ml lysine at 30°C and 200 rpm. Supernatants were freeze-dried, dissolved in a volume of distilled water 1/10 of the initial culture volume, and stored at 4°C until use. Just prior to suspension of cells, the concentrated supernatant was adjusted to 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.0 resulting in a final ninefold concentrate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This paper is dedicated to Professor Heinz G Floss on the occasion of his 80th birthday.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior Editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a memaber of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Reviewing editor, Wilfred van der Donk; Emily Balskus, peer reviewer. A third reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments, and all three reviewers agree that this study is of general interest to the <italic>eLife</italic> readership, provided the authors can address the concerns listed below.</p><p>The authors show in this manuscript that genes encoding a 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (EEVS) and a bifunctional O-methyltransferase/NAD+ dependent oxidoreductase genes are present in various egg-laying vertebrates. They also show that the two genes are expressed in zebrafish and that gadusol can be isolated from zebrafish embryos. The authors introduced both genes into an engineered strain of yeast that accumulates the EEVS substrate sedoheptulose-7-phosphate and demonstrate the production of gadusol. Finally, they show that extracts from gadusol-producing yeast protect both wild-type and mutant yeast strains from UV-B radiation. Collectively, these data provide strong support that vertebrates can make these compounds and that they need not be produced by symbionts or obtained in diet. Overall, the biochemical data is very convincing, with some questions raised by the reviewers. The bioinformatics/evolution data was considered less robust and needs strengthening. Results from the phylogenetic analyses suggest a series of repeated transfers between bacterial and eukaryotic homologs that appear to be an interesting part of the story. Yet, the methods listed are not sufficient to make this claim. Below are several ways to validate/improve these phylogenetic results. The reviewers agree that the requested revisions should be doable.</p><p>The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission:</p><p>1) The inclusion of bacterial and eukaryotic homologs into the evolutionary history of these genes needs to be justified by a reciprocal blast hit analysis in which the authors switch the BLAST query sequence between bacteria and eukaryotes to see if they always retrieve the same hits in the database. This concern is particularly relevant when using protein sequences, because convergent evolution rather than horizontal gene transfer may drive the appearance of reciprocal orthology when there isn't any.</p><p>2) A model of protein evolution needs to be statistically selected to build the tree. The authors appear to have used the simple, default parameter in Geneious, which is insufficient for accuracy in phylogenetic tree building. To select a model of protein evolution, ProtTest needs to be run, and the selected model needs to be implemented in the tree building.</p><p>3) In addition to building the tree with protein sequences, can the authors build the tree with DNA sequences? The DNA divergences may be too high to do this for all of the sequences in the tree, but subsections of the tree could be reanalyzed with DNA sequences, starting with reciprocal blast analyses and then model selection (using ModelTest for DNA) and tree building.</p><p>4) It is highly desirable to use multiple phylogenetic inference methods to validate evolutionary relationships. Thus, in addition to the reported Max Likelihood analysis, a Mr. Bayes analysis should be run alongside.</p><p>5) Bootstrap and posterior probability support values must be reported in a phylogenetic tree analysis to evaluate the strength of the evolutionary results.</p><p>6) The authors express and purify the proteins of interest, but the experimental section suggests that for some experiments they were assayed as cell free extracts. It is not clear which results discussed in the text and shown in the figures were obtained with purified protein and which with cell free extracts, but the reader is left with the impression that all data was obtained with purified proteins. The authors should also explain why cell free extracts were used when purified proteins were apparently available.</p><p>7) The authors should provide more information about the in vitro biochemical characterization of the zebrafish EEVS. Did they test the activity of the enzyme toward sugar substrates other than sedoheltulose-7-phosphate? Also the TLC shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref> seems to show multiple new products being formed by this enzyme. These products do not appear to be present in the assay with ValA, the bacterial EEVS used as a positive control. What are these alternate products?</p><p>8) The authors should provide some additional commentary in their discussion regarding the proposed biological roles of gadusol and MAAs in fish and the issue of their origin (endogenous synthesis vs dietary), and highlight issues that remain unresolved with the current results. For instance, it has been demonstrated experimentally that fish can accumulate MAAs from their diets (see Mar Biol 144:1057-1064, Comp Biochem Physiol Part A Mol Integr Physiol 120:587-598). Are the relative concentrations of gadusol and MAAs in fish roe known? Just because there is an endogenous pathway for gadusol synthesis in fish does not mean that this compound cannot also be acquired from dietary sources along with the MAAs or that it is the primary contributor to UV protection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05919.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The inclusion of bacterial and eukaryotic homologs into the evolutionary history of these genes needs to be justified by a reciprocal blast hit analysis in which the authors switch the BLAST query sequence between bacteria and eukaryotes to see if they always retrieve the same hits in the database.

We then decided to focus only on the EEVS DNA sequences, but still didn’t see a clear separation between bacterial and vertebrate sequences. Finally, we narrowed down our analysis to vertebrate mRNAs only, and the result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>. MEGA6 was used to determine the best fit nucleic acid evolutionary model (K80+G), and for maximum likelihood analysis of the vertebrate mRNA sequences with tree robustness assessed by bootstrap (500 replicates).</p><p><italic>4) It is highly desirable to use multiple phylogenetic inference methods to validate evolutionary relationships. Thus, in addition to the reported Max Likelihood analysis, a Mr. Bayes analysis should be run alongside</italic>.</p><p>We have used RAxML for maximum likelihood analysis, and the robustness of the trees was assessed by bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates). As suggested, Bayesian analysis was performed by MrBayes (version 3.2.3), using a random starting tree, running eight chains for 4,000,000 generations, sampling every 250 trees. The first 5,000 trees were discarded as the burnin, with the remaining trees used to calculate posterior probability. RAxML and MrBayes were run on the CIPRES science gateway. The Bayesian phylogenetic tree is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, whereas the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>. The results are fully consistent with the previous ones, and even place both algal EEVS sequences closer to the vertebrate sequences, further strengthening our horizontal gene transfer proposal.</p><p><italic>5) Bootstrap and posterior probability support values must be reported in a phylogenetic tree analysis to evaluate the strength of the evolutionary results</italic>.</p><p>We have included the bootstrap and posterior probability values for main branches in the phylogenetic trees. For clarity, values for branches within the clades were excluded.</p><p><italic>6) The authors express and purify the proteins of interest, but the experimental section suggests that for some experiments they were assayed as cell free extracts. It is not clear which results discussed in the text and shown in the figures were obtained with purified protein and which with cell free extracts, but the reader is left with the impression that all data was obtained with purified proteins. The authors should also explain why cell free extracts were used when purified proteins were apparently available</italic>.</p><p>Characterization of the zebrafish EEVS was carried out with a purified LOC100003999 protein as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>. However we discovered that the purified EEVS was relatively unstable and the activity was much lower than that in the cell free extracts. Therefore, for the characterization of the second enzyme (purified MT-Ox), we used cell free extracts containing EEVS to make sure that enough EEV (the substrate for MT-Ox) is produced. We have specified whether purified proteins or cell-free extracts were used in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>7) The authors should provide more information about the in vitro biochemical characterization of the zebrafish EEVS.

These products do not appear to be present in the assay with ValA, the bacterial EEVS used as a positive control. What are these alternate products?</italic></p><p>Since the amino acid sequence of zebrafish EEVS is highly similar to the bacterial EEVS, sharing all the 14 conserved active site residues, we only tested the activity of the protein toward sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and confirmed its identity as an EEVS. We did not test the activity of the enzyme toward other sugar substrates. Regarding the additional spots on the TLC, we are not sure what they are. However, they do not appear to be the products of the enzyme. We have replaced the TLC with a new one with no or very little of these spots.</p><p><italic>8) The authors should provide some additional commentary in their discussion regarding the proposed biological roles of gadusol and MAAs in fish and the issue of their origin (endogenous synthesis vs dietary), and highlight issues that remain unresolved with the current results. For instance, it has been demonstrated experimentally that fish can accumulate MAAs from their diets (see Mar Biol 144:1057-1064, Comp Biochem Physiol Part A Mol Integr Physiol 120:587-598). Are the relative concentrations of gadusol and MAAs in fish roe known? Just because there is an endogenous pathway for gadusol synthesis in fish does not mean that this compound cannot also be acquired from dietary sources along with the MAAs or that it is the primary contributor to UV protection</italic>.</p><p>Based on the present study, we believe that gadusol and MAAs found in marine fish are synthesized through two different pathways. While we propose that gadusol is synthesized de novo by the fish, the accumulation of MAAs in fish would still appear to be of dietary origin. Therefore, we have added the following comment in the Discussion “However, as MAAs are synthesized via a different pathway and there is no evidence that fish have those biosynthetic enzymes, the accumulation of MAAs in fish would still appear to be of dietary origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mason et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zamzow, 2004</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
