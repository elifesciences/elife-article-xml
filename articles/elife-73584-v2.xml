At the time, with slowed vaccination uptake, this novel variant was expected to increase the risk of pandemic resurgence in the US in summer and fall 2021. As part of the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, an ensemble of nine mechanistic models produced 6-month scenario projections for July–December 2021 for the United States. These projections estimated substantial resurgences of COVID-19 across the US resulting from the more transmissible Delta variant, projected to occur across most of the US, coinciding with school and business reopening. The scenarios revealed that reaching higher vaccine coverage in July–December 2021 reduced the size and duration of the projected resurgence substantially, with the expected impacts was largely concentrated in a subset of states with lower vaccination coverage. Despite accurate projection of COVID-19 surges occurring and timing, the magnitude was substantially underestimated 2021 by the models compared with the of the reported cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occurring during July–December, highlighting the continued challenges to predict the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination uptake remains critical to limiting transmission and disease, particularly in states with lower vaccination coverage. Higher vaccination goals at the onset of the surge of the new variant were estimated to avert over 1.5 million cases and 21,000 deaths, although may have had even greater impacts, considering the underestimated resurgence magnitude from the model.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pandemic</kwd><kwd>disease

COVID-19 vaccines in the United States (US) has been one of the biggest public health successes in the US during this pandemic, with reported cases in a nadir in June 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021b</xref>), despite increased testing capacities. With this success, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were lifted, including mask mandates, in almost every jurisdiction across the US in Spring 2021. However, the emergence of novel variants with increased transmissibility and /or immune escape, particularly the Delta and Omicron variants, has continually raised concern about the potential timing and magnitude of the subsequent resurgence, and the ability to mitigate it through increased uptake of vaccination.</p><p>Established in December 2020, the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub is an effort to apply a multiple-model approach to produce six-month projections of the state and national trajectories of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US under defined scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borchering et al., 2021</xref>). Scenarios from projection rounds have focused on control measures, vaccination availability and uptake, emerging variants, and waning immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, 2020</xref>). Projections are released in a timely manner to guide policy decisions and data are made publicly available on a website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we detail results from the seventh round of projections, in which increased transmissibility variants were incorporated into projections to assess the potential impact of the Delta variant. In all scenarios, resurgences across the US were projected, with the largest resurgences occurring for scenarios with the highest variant transmissibility (60% increase over the Alpha variant, which most closely resembles estimates for the Delta variant). Corresponding increases in hospitalizations and deaths were also projected. In scenarios with higher vaccine coverage, the size and duration of this resurgence was notably smaller. Cases were projected to increase in early July 2021 at the national level and peak in mid to late September 2021. Corresponding increases in hospitalizations and deaths were also projected. The resurgence was projected to be geographically heterogeneous; although most states were projected to experience some degree of rebound, those having higher vaccine coverage were projected to experience less severe increases in incidence relative to prior observed peaks. However, while the timing of these projected resurges was relatively accurate compared to what has since been reported, the magnitude of reported cases, hospitalization, and deaths far surpassed what was projected. Here, we describe our experience with multi-model projections of the Delta variant to highlight both the value of scenario-based projections for planning, but also the challenges to understand and predict the constantly evolving COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the two scenarios with high Delta variant transmissibility (60% more transmissible than Alpha), we projected a national wave of cases to continue to grow over the summer and peak in mid- to late September 2021. In the scenario that assumes lower vaccination coverage among eligible individuals (70%) and higher variant transmissibility (the most pessimistic scenario), this resurgence was projected to peak at 414,000 weekly cases (95% projection interval (PI): 140,000–1,525,000) and 5900 weekly deaths (95% PI: 900–30,000) nationally. Overall, this scenario projected 7,554,000 (95% PI: 3,294,000–28,399,000) cumulative cases and 96,000 (95% PI: 27,000–476,000) cumulative deaths during July 4, 2021–Jan 1, 2022 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Historical data and weekly ensemble projections of reported numbers of COVID-19 cases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hospitalizations (<bold>B</bold>) and deaths (<bold>C</bold>) under four scenarios representing different levels of vaccination and Delta variant transmissibility increase — United States, October, 2020–December, 2021.Projections are ensemble estimates of 9 models projecting four 6-month scenarios with 95% prediction intervals (the grey shading encompasses the prediction intervals from all four scenarios).

The ten states with the largest projected increases in incidence relative to their winter 2020–21 peak were, in descending order, Louisiana, Hawaii, Nevada, Arkansas, Florida, Missouri, Georgia, Alabama, Alaska, and Arizona. The ensemble estimates projected these states to experience median peak levels of weekly incident cases that were 18–69% (95% PI: 1%–541%) of their (smoothed) winter peak, although this was exceeded in many states. The 10 states with the lowest projected resurgences were, in ascending order, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and South Dakota. The 10 states with the smallest projected resurgence had a median first-dose vaccine coverage of 70% among the eligible population (ages 12+) on July 3, 2021, compared to 56% in the ten states with the highest projected resurgence. We find a high negative correlation (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>=–0.66, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) between projected cumulative deaths per population and vaccination coverage on July 3, 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">NCIRD, 2021</xref>).

During the projection period, we projected CFR reductions of 15% and 14%, as compared to August-December 2020. Lower transmissibility variant scenarios projected significantly reduced resurgence, projecting cumulative national cases of only 9% and 13% compared to the winter 2020–21 peak. Similarly, in the previous projection round (Round 6), which similar to the 7th round except it assumed only a 20% transmissibility increase from a novel variant, resurgence was expected to produce only 8% of the cases reported during the winter 2020–21 peak nationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Weekly case observations exceeded our 95% projection interval in the first 9 weeks of the projection period in all scenarios, including those assuming 60% increased transmissibility of the Delta variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We compared weekly incident and cumulative cases during the first four weeks after the projection date (July 4–31, 2021). The total median projected number of cases underestimated the observed cases overall during this 4-week period (1,256,000 observed vs 516,000 projected); however, we find a strong correlation between ranking of observed and projected total cases per 100,000 during the first four weeks of the projection period, at the state level (Spearman’s <italic>⍴</italic>=0.87, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

However, all scenarios substantially underestimated the magnitude of the Delta wave for all outcomes. Among the two high variant transmissibility scenarios, at the national level the peak cases were under-projected by 70% (95% PI: −25–91%) and 64% (95% PI: −49–88%) (349,183 and 413,733 vs 1.15 M peak reported weekly cases), though the 95% projection interval did capture the reported magnitude of the peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

This variant prompted concerns about the scale of the COVID-19 resurgence in the US in the summer and fall of 2021, especially in the midst of decreased NPIs and slowing vaccination rates. Projections combining insights from multiple models suggested sizable resurgences of COVID-19 across the US, assuming growth of a variant that is 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant (an assumption aligned with most estimates of the relative transmissibility of the Delta variant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2022</xref>). In scenarios with higher vaccination coverage, the magnitude of the resurgence in cases and deaths was substantially lower than in the lower coverage scenarios. Efforts to increase vaccination rates are critical and will save lives before and during future resurgences. At the outset of the Delta wave on July 1, 2021, only 13 states and Washington, D.C. had accomplished President Biden’s goal for vaccination coverage among eligible populations at or above 70%.</p><p>The rapid case growth observed in July 2021 in multiple US states was surprising, tracking with or above the projections from our worst-case scenario. Scenarios were designed at the end of June 2021 based on information available at that time about the transmissibility of the Delta variant, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccine coverage; projections were generated on or before July 4, 2021. Our data should not be understood as forecasts, but as projections conditional on the scenarios and assumptions; several reasons could explain why case growth was faster than expected, including key epidemiological and behavioral aspects that may have affected the disease dynamics. Possible mechanisms driving the underestimation of the observed Summer 2021 resurgence may include inaccurate assumptions about the transmissibility and severity of Delta (including changes in serial interval or severity of infection relative to other variants), the effectiveness of the vaccines against infection and transmission, waning of natural and vaccine-derived immunity, changes in testing practices, and the interaction of these factors with NPIs and behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elliott et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Puranik et al., 2021</xref>). Assumptions regarding these factors were left to the discretion of the teams and therefore vary across models. Critically, eight of the nine teams did not include waning of natural or vaccine-derived immunity, an assumption that we now know is incorrect. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Higdon et al., 2021</xref>) Subsequent rounds of projection have focused on different scenarios of waning immunity. Yet in this round, absence of waning resulted in a much smaller population susceptible to infection with Delta, thus reducing the overall potential magnitude that could be projected by these models. Use of NPIs has been substantially reduced across the US, with a lapse in mask mandates in most states. Although modeled use of NPIs was left to the discretion of individual modeling teams and did not vary between scenarios, results of prior rounds underscore the effectiveness of NPIs, in combination with increasing vaccination, to moderate the spread of a highly transmissible variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borchering et al., 2021</xref>). The extent to which NPIs may be necessary will vary across states, as those states with high levels of vaccination coverage or natural immunity may be at lower risk for an increase in cases.</p><p>The impact of the resurgence on severe disease and mortality was expected to vary substantially across states; states with younger populations and higher vaccination coverage among older and high-risk populations were expected to experience a relatively lower burden of severe disease, even with resurgences in cases. Several states (for example, South Dakota, North Dakota) with low vaccination coverage were not projected to experience major resurgences, likely because of high naturally acquired immunity. In addition, as the projected resurgence continued throughout the summer and into the beginning of the school year, efforts to promote vaccination among eligible school-aged children and college students and to maintain key prevention strategies in schools (for example, mask-wearing among the unvaccinated, physical distancing, screening programs) likely helped reduce risks with a safe return to in-person instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021a</xref>). Observed increases in new vaccinations, particularly among young age groups and in jurisdictions most severely impacted by the Delta variant, was a positive step in this direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021b</xref>).</p><p>The findings in this report are subject to several limitations. First, considerable uncertainty is inherent to long-term projections. This has been repeatedly illustrated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with rapid changes in behavior, deployment of vaccines and boosters, and the emergence of novel variants, each of which has the capacity to drastically shift the epidemic trajectories. Uncertainty may arise from three main sources: specification of the scenarios (for example, uncertainty in transmissibility); errors in the structure or assumptions of individual models given a specific scenario (for example, variations in assumptions about vaccination uptake); and inaccurate calibration based on incomplete or biased data (for example, reporting backlogs). None of the four scenarios considered here were likely to precisely reflect the future reality over a 6-month period. As a case in point the emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021, at the end of our projection period, could not have been predicted when scenarios were designed in June 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borchering et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, a resurgence in Delta variant incidence was observed in mid-fall 2021, possibly due to changes in behavior and waning immunity, and is not captured in scenarios or model projections. Further, for a given scenario, there is notable variation among individual model projections with regard to both the timing and the magnitude of the resurgence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Variation likely reflects differences in model structure, projected vaccine coverage, projected variant growth, and importance of seasonal effects. Some of these variations reflect true scientific uncertainty, making ensemble projections particularly useful to integrate uncertainty between and within individual models. In addition, these scenarios do not specify considerations of Delta infecting previously immune individuals due to moderate antigenic changes, the waning of existing immunity, increases in NPIs, or vaccination among children aged &lt;12 years starting in November 2021, all of which were expected to be important drivers of dynamics in the subsequent months. In the same vein, model estimates are dependent on assumptions about vaccine hesitancy, which are informed in part by large-scale surveys of vaccine sentiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carnegie Mellon University Delphi Group, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Estimates of Vaccine Hesitancy for COVID-19, 2021</xref>). These surveys may underestimate vaccine hesitancy, as coverage estimates among survey respondents are substantially higher than measured among the overall US population. Additionally, there are limitations to individual component models, although these concerns are tempered by analyzing ensembles of the nine different models. Overall, a full evaluation of our projections and sources of uncertainty is particularly difficult in a scenario context and is beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is worth noting that in this particular round of projection, the relationship between projection accuracy and time horizon is not straightforward (e.g. refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for a visual assessment of coverage).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The emergence and introduction of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants like the Delta variant was projected to lead to a substantial resurgence of COVID-19 in the US, which was observed in every state across the country. The high variant transmissibility scenarios, which more accurately represented the characteristics of the Delta variant, both in transmissibility and in current case trajectories, projected a significant national resurgence with substantial variation in magnitude across states. Resurgences were expected to be more pronounced in low-vaccination jurisdictions. The projections indicated that even with substantial vaccination coverage, the increased transmissibility of new variants like Delta can continue to challenge our ability to control this pandemic. Renewed efforts to increase vaccination coverage are critical to limiting transmission and disease, particularly in states with low natural immunity and lower current vaccination, in addition to re-instituting control measures like indoor masking when needed. Projections of Delta resurgence presented in this paper were made publicly available in early July 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, 2020</xref>), 2 months ahead of the peak of the Delta wave, providing actionable results. There is a trade-off between releasing projections in a timely manner to guide decisions, and projection accuracy and uncertainty that improve with incorporation of recent information. While these projections dramatically underestimated the magnitude of the Delta resurgence, demonstrating the challenges to predict this continually evolving pandemic, they did provide value in projecting the timing and emphasizing the importance of vaccination. Multi-model ensemble efforts such as the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub are particularly well-suited to provide disease projections to inform the pandemic response under changing epidemiological and behavioral situations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, 2020</xref>) convened nine modeling teams in an open call to provide six-month (July 3, 2021-January 1, 2022) COVID-19 projections in the US using data available through July 3, 2021. Each team developed a model to project weekly reported cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, both nationally and by jurisdiction (50 states and the District of Columbia), for four different epidemiological scenarios. Models were calibrated against data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center and federal databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coronavirus Resource Center, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2020</xref>).

Participating teams accounted for vaccination rates by state, age, and risk-groups (for example, older adults and health care workers). Specified vaccine efficacy levels were constant across the scenarios and were based on protection against clinical disease in randomized clinical trials and effectiveness studies; parameters for effectiveness against infection, transmission, and progression to severe outcomes (for example, death) were left to be specified by each team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, 2020</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jodie McVernon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Provide a table describing the basic features of the models included in this analysis.

Provide an analysis showing individual model predictions for a scenario in order to assess inter-model variability of predictions.</p><p>3. Provide further discussion regarding what assumptions of the models may have led to the underestimation of the number of cases in the Summer/Fall, and the features of the models that were more closely able to reproduce the observed resurgence.</p><p>4. Comment on the timeliness of predictions and the time horizon over which predictions are likely to be valid.</p><p>5. Discussion on whether heterogeneity below the state level could have contributed to the overestimation of vaccination effectiveness by the models.</p><p>6.

I think the manuscript would benefit from a more traditional introduction, where the objectives of the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub are detailed, results from previous rounds are summarized, and the objectives of the current round (6? 7?

This does not allow the reader to fully assess the underlying methods. I would generally expect in any multiple model analysis to have a table describing basic features of the models, in the same way that a systematic review/meta-analysis would describe the features of the underlying studies. Key features to describe would be the type of model structure, design, and basic underlying assumptions likely to vary between models such as effectiveness against infection, transmission, and progression to severe outcomes, demographic stratifications included etc.</p><p>– The main value of combining different model predictions is to capture and explore uncertainty due to differences between models. Please consider including a figure of cross-model comparison of individual model predictions for a given scenario. Some discussion regarding differences between models leading to differences in predictions would also be warranted.</p><p>– I liked the comparison between model predictions and observed data for July.

We have added a reference to these figures on line (230-231). Further, our new supplemental tables describing individual model assumptions will help readers better understand some of the drivers of inter-model variability (Supplementary File 1).</p><p>Although we comment on some of the drivers of this variability in the text (see 4th paragraph of Discussion, pg 11), we believe that a formal analysis of individual model predictions is beyond the scope of this paper. Differences between models are many and include variation in model structure, parameters, and calibration; this understanding the drivers of model variation is not straightforward. Overall, there are many dimensions of uncertainty in the epidemiologic situation, and it is likely that no individual model appropriately captures all these aspects of uncertainty. By combining the models together into an ensemble, we aim to better capture the range of this uncertainty and therefore to provide projections that are more useful for public health decision making.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Provide further discussion regarding what assumptions of the models may have led to the underestimation of the number of cases in the Summer/Fall, and the features of the models that were more closely able to reproduce the observed resurgence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional text to further detail why projections underestimate the observed resurgences.</p><p>In the discussion (pg 10), we now state:</p><p>“Possible mechanisms driving the underestimation of the observed Summer 2021 resurgence may include inaccurate assumptions about the transmissibility and severity of Delta (including changes in serial interval or severity of infection relative to other variants), the effectiveness of the vaccines against infection and transmission, heterogeneity in vaccine coverage at the county level or below, waning of natural and vaccine-derived immunity, changes in testing practices, and the interaction of these factors with NPIs and behavior change.<sup>13–15</sup> Assumptions regarding these factors were left to the discretion of the teams and therefore vary across models.”</p><p>No individual model was able to successfully reproduce the observed resurgences at the state-level. Those models that tracked with the observed resurgence at the national level for certain scenarios (particularly USC) did not consistently do so at the state-level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Comment on the timeliness of predictions and the time horizon over which predictions are likely to be valid.</p></disp-quote><p>These should not be considered predictions, but rather projections of the epidemic trajectory under a predefined set of assumptions (the “scenario”). It is likely that no scenario will perfectly align with reality over the projection period and hence a simple comparison between observations and projections (as in forecast) is not satisfactory. As a case in point, the Omicron variant emerged at the end of our projection period and was not part of the scenarios that were designed in June 2021 (round 7) and are discussed in this paper.</p><p>We note that a full evaluation of our scenario projection efforts is underway and includes various stages of the pandemic (not just the Δ wave). We find that accuracy, measured by coverage or other scoring statistics, does not solely depend on time horizon, but also on the stage of the pandemic and on scenario design. In this round of projection particularly, coverage degrades rapidly over the first 9 weeks of the projection period but recovers in subsequent weeks (as can be seen in Figure 1). A full evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper, and in the meantime, we show a figure comparing state-level projections and observations over the first four weeks of projections (Figure 3).</p><p>As regards timeliness, our round 7 projections were made publicly available in mid-July 2021, as COVID19 incidence had just started rising, with the peak of the Δ wave occurring in the first week of September 2021. Hence our projections afforded reasonable time for action.</p><p>We have added two sentences in conclusion to highlight the timeliness of our projections (pg 13) and note the inherent difficulties in evaluating scenario-based projections and changes in accuracy by time horizon (pg 12). We also comment that projections are a valid tool that can be used to demonstrate the anticipated impact of changes to the epidemiologic situation – in this case, the relative importance of vaccine coverage and the introduction of a new variant (conclusion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Discussion on whether heterogeneity below the state level could have contributed to the overestimation of vaccination effectiveness by the models.</p></disp-quote><p>Teams only submit projections at the state and national level, however many of the contributing models are county-level (Columbia, MOBS, UVA-adaptive, JHU APL). Heterogeneity in vaccination coverage at the county-level (or below) not captured by the models due either to spatial structure or lack of county-level data may very well have contributed to the underestimation of the observed resurgences.</p><p>We have added a comment to this effect in discussion pg 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Discussion on the impact of waning vaccine immunity, whether this was accounted for by the models, and whether this will be accounted for in future rounds of predictions.</p></disp-quote><p>Waning of both natural and vaccine-derived immunity was left to the discretion of the individual modeling teams. Only one of the 9 teams included waning immunity in their models. At the time of this round of projections, very little was known about the amount and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 immunity waning. Subsequent SMH rounds do incorporate waning assumptions; these, along with all rounds of SMH projections, can be accessed on the SMH website (see round 13 in particular, https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org).</p><p>We acknowledge this is now likely a limitation of our projections and have added the following to the Discussion section of this paper to discuss this:</p><p>“Critically, eight of the nine teams did not include waning of natural or vaccine-derived immunity, an assumption that we now know is incorrect.<sup>16</sup> Absence of waning resulted in a much smaller population susceptible to infection with Delta, thus reducing the overall potential magnitude that could be projected by these models.”</p><p>“In addition, these scenarios do not specify considerations of reinfections or breakthrough infections with the Δ variant, the waning of existing immunity, changes in NPIs and behavior, or vaccination among children aged &lt;12 years starting in November 2021, all of which were expected to be important drivers of dynamics in the subsequent months.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The current first section &quot;overview&quot; serves as both introduction, and summary of results.

Additionally, to make it clear that this paper is focused on Round 7, we have removed all references to Round 6, focusing on Round 7 only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is very little information about the models which contributing predictions to this analysis.

Additionally, we have added a supplemental table (Supplementary File 1) which provide an overview of individual model structure and assumptions. We provide the following commentary in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Further, for a given scenario, there is notable variation among individual model projections with regards to both the timing and the magnitude of the resurgence (Figure 1-supplemental figure 1-3).

There is a trade-off between releasing projections in a timely manner to guide decisions, and projection accuracy and uncertainty that improve with incorporation of recent information.”</p><p>We acknowledge there was a longer lag to turn this work into a publication.</p><p>We do acknowledge that as the epidemiological situation changes over the projection period, none of the scenarios will be expected to align with reality. However, the goal of these projections is not to predict the future but rather to demonstrate the anticipated impact of changes in vaccination coverage or the introduction of a more transmissible variant. While on occasion, we have provided predictions for shorter horizons (eg two closely spaced rounds of 3-month projections for Omicron, rounds 10 and 11, 17 days apart), these are more appropriate for emergency situations. Overall, we believe that a longer projection period better conveys the long-term impacts of changes in disease dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) About model assumptions and Table 1: It is not clear to me what vaccine efficacy meant here in Table 1. Vaccine efficacy against infection, symptomatic infection, hospitalization, or death of COVID-19?

None of the four scenarios considered here are likely to precisely reflect the future reality over a six-month period.<sup>2</sup>”</p><p>Uncertainty in the ensemble, which is obtained by a linear opinion pool approach, is driven both by differences between the trajectories of individual models, and uncertainty on the trajectory of individual models. We do feel that because sources of uncertainty are so varied, a discussion of model-specific results and uncertainty is beyond the scope of this paper. The reader can also refer to new tables in the supplement that describe the major assumptions from each model (Supplementary File 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although all the data and codes are publicly available, it will be great if the authors could add a table to summarize the major similarities and differences of the nine models, given the high uncertainties in projections across different models in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a table to the supplement with the main assumptions of each of the contributing models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This ensemble modelling exercise is incredibly useful, but could be even further enhanced by more of a discussion of difference, as indicated above.
