The MAPK Erk pathway, which is activated in a large proportion of human tumours, is a prototypic example of distinct cell fates being driven by signal intensity. We have used primary hepatocyte precursors transformed with different dosages of an oncogenic form of Ras to model subclonal variations in MAPK signalling. Orthotopic allografts of Ras-transformed cells in immunocompromised mice gave rise to fast-growing aggressive tumours, both at the primary location and in the peritoneal cavity. Fluorescent labelling of cells expressing different oncogene levels, and consequently varying levels of MAPK Erk activation, highlighted the selection processes operating at the two sites of tumour growth. Indeed, significantly higher Ras expression was observed in primary as compared to secondary, metastatic sites, despite the apparent evolutionary trade-off of increased apoptotic death in the liver that correlated with high Ras dosage. Analysis of the immune tumour microenvironment at the two locations suggests that fast peritoneal tumour growth in the immunocompromised setting is abrogated in immunocompetent animals due to efficient antigen presentation by peritoneal dendritic cells. Furthermore, our data indicate that, in contrast to the metastatic-like outgrowth, strong MAPK signalling is required in the primary liver tumours to resist elimination by NK (natural killer) cells. Overall, this study describes a quantitative aspect of tumour heterogeneity and points to a potential vulnerability of a subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma as a function of MAPK Erk signalling intensity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oncogenic dosage</kwd><kwd>tumour heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>microenvironment</kwd><kwd>NK cells</kwd><kwd>liver</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SIRIC Montpellier Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant INCa_Inserm_DGOS_12553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hibner</surname><given-names>Urszula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grant HTE-ITMO Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HTE201610</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hibner</surname><given-names>Urszula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Association Francaise pour l'Etude du Foie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grégoire</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KWF 12049/2018-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akkari</surname><given-names>Leila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Specific tissue environments provide selective pressures that give rise to distinct Ras oncogenic dosage in primary liver tumours and their metastatic-like outgrowths.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumour subclonal heterogeneity is defined by cancer cells’ intrinsic properties and by phenotypic adaptations to extrinsic signals from the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marusyk et al., 2020</xref>). Specific environments are shaped by the physiological constraints imposed by the tumour localization and by the dynamic interactions with the growing tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerstung et al., 2020</xref>). The environment impacts the tumour phenotype, first by triggering adaptive responses from the highly plastic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pastushenko and Blanpain, 2019</xref>) and second, by exerting selective pressures, leading to expansion of some, and elimination of other, tumoural subclones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janiszewska et al., 2019</xref>). While the notion of inter- and intra-tumour heterogeneities and their consequences for personalized medicine have gained a strong momentum in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Losic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molina-Sánchez et al., 2020</xref>), quantitative aspects leading to differences in the intensity of oncogenic signal transduction within the selected, clonal tumour cell populations (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gross et al., 2019</xref>) are so far understudied.</p><p>Genomic analyses identified major oncogenic pathways for numerous tumour types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018</xref>). For example, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been classified into several classes, defined by their genomic and physiopathological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Llovet et al., 2021</xref>). While some oncogenic driver mutations fall neatly in such defined categories, for example, mutations that activate the β-catenin pathway or that inactivate the p53 tumour suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zucman-Rossi et al., 2015</xref>), others are frequently present in several different HCC types. An interesting example is the activation of the Ras/MAPK Erk pathway. Although mutations of Ras GTPases are found in only 2–4% of HCC patients, multiple activators and regulators of the pathway, such as FGF19, RSK2, RASAL1, RASSF1, and DUSPs, are more frequently mutated. Altogether, the Ras/MAPK is estimated to be activated in 40% of HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delire and Stärkel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lim et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Activation of Ras/MAPK Erk signalling is an essential feature of proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pagès et al., 1993</xref>) and the genetic abrogation of several of the components of the pathway gives rise to embryonic lethality due to a decrease in signal intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorard et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, variations in signal intensity, duration, and tissue-specific context give rise to distinct cellular outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lenormand et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marshall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pouysségur et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we transformed hepatocyte precursors (bipotent mouse embryonic liver [BMEL] cells) with different number of copies of an oncogenic mutant Ras (H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup>), which entailed variable intensity of signalling through the Ras/MAPK Erk pathway. We show that these cells tolerate a wide range of activated Ras dosage in vitro. In contrast, in vivo tumours display a much narrower range of active Ras levels and the consequent Erk signalling, likely attributable to selective pressures from the microenvironment. Specifically, cells that sustain low levels of Ras/MAPK Erk pathway activation are gradually eliminated from the liver primary tumours. Strikingly, they persist in secondary tumours that develop in the peritoneal cavity. Thus, specific microenvironments present in primary and in metastatic tumour locations, which differ in their macrophage, dendritic, and natural killer (NK) cell immune landscape, select distinct tumoural subclones that are characterized by site-specific Ras signalling dosage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The phenotype of hepatic progenitors is affected by the Ras<sup>G12V</sup> gene dosage</title><p>In order to investigate the consequences of distinct Ras oncogenic dosage on tumour development, we used BMEL, bipotential precursors of the two epithelial hepatic lineages, derived from embryonic mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akkari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strick-Marchand and Weiss, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Strick-Marchand and Weiss, 2002</xref>). BMEL are not transformed and retain major characteristics of primary hepatic progenitors, including the capacity to repopulate a damaged adult liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Strick-Marchand et al., 2004</xref>). We have previously reported that the expression of an oncogenic form of Ras (H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup>) is sufficient to transform a subset of BMEL clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akkari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bacevic et al., 2019</xref>), including the ones used for the current study. These cells express p19ARF and wild-type p53, but not p16-INK4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which could account for their escape from Ras-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Because cellular phenotypes are sensitive to the Ras oncogene dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mueller et al., 2018</xref>) and the signalling intensity of its downstream effector, the MAPK Erk pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dikic et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Traverse et al., 1994</xref>), we asked whether a specific level of Ras<sup>G12V</sup> expression was required for hepatic tumour growth in vivo. To obtain cellular populations with distinct levels of Ras<sup>G12V</sup> expression, BMEL cells were transduced with bicistronic lentiviral vectors encoding H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup> and either a Venus or a mCherry fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> upper). Cells were sorted by flow cytometry on the basis of the fluorescence intensity, giving rise to populations that we named ‘Ras<sup>LOW</sup>’ and ‘Ras<sup>HIGH</sup>’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> middle). Since the parental BMEL cells used in this study were clonally derived, the BMEL-Ras populations were isogenic, except for the copy number and insertion sites of the Ras<sup>G12V</sup> – Venus/mCherry transgene and the consequent level of their expression. As expected, the expression levels of the fluorescent markers faithfully reflected the Ras oncogene mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the mean levels of Ras<sup>G12V</sup> protein were different in the Ras<sup>LOW</sup> versus the Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> populations, as shown for Ras<sup>LOW-Cherry</sup> and Ras<sup>HIGH-Venus</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. However, the Ras<sup>LOW</sup> and Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> cells, while respectively enriched in weak and strong H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup> expressors, remained quite heterogeneous with respect to the oncogene expression. Indeed, because of the gates used for sorting, the distribution of Ras expression levels presented an overlap between the two populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, neither the level of Ras expression nor the nature of the co-expressed fluorescent protein altered the in vitro proliferation rate of the transformed BMEL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ras<sup>G12V</sup> oncogenic dosage controls the phenotype of bipotent mouse embryonic liver (BMEL) cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bicistronic vectors were used to transduce BMEL cells that were sorted by flow cytometry according to fluorescence intensities, giving rise to Ras<sup>LOW</sup> and Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> populations labelled with either Venus or mCherry.

Several major signal transduction pathways lay downstream of Ras activation. To gain insight into their activation status in H-Ras<sup>G12V</sup>-transformed BMEL cells, we assayed phosphorylation levels of a set of kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Oncogenic Ras had no effect on AKT<sup>S473</sup> and the GSKb<sup>S9</sup>, two downstream targets of PI(3)K that were strongly phosphorylated both in the parental and in the Ras-transformed cells. Similarly, no differences were detected for JNK and p38 pathway components. In contrast, although this assay did not reveal increased MEK or Erk activation, Ras signalling gave rise to a strong increase in the phosphorylation of Rsk 1 and 2, which are downstream targets of MAPK Erk signalling. Moreover, while the proteomic array assay was not sufficiently sensitive to distinguish between the Ras<sup>LOW</sup> and Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> signalling, the oncogenic dosage did translate into differences of the Ras/MAPK Erk signalling, as evidenced by distinct transcriptional signatures of known Erk delayed early target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>In order to further investigate how the intensity of Ras signalling governs the hepatic transcriptional programmes, we performed RNAseq analysis of parental BMEL, Ras<sup>LOW</sup> and Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> cells in culture. Setting the thresholds at fold change log2=1.5 and p-value &lt;0.01 identified over 1000 genes modulated by Ras<sup>G12V</sup> signalling in these hepatic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The expression of 160 genes was modulated by Ras independently of its mean expression level in the tested population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> left, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>), thus representing a gene signature for the low threshold Ras/MAPK signalling. In a second group of 65 genes, target gene expression was modified only in the Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> middle, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). For these genes, a high-intensity Ras signalling is required for the mRNA accumulation. Finally, the third group contains the genes expression of which correlated with the mean level of Ras expression. We identified six genes (<italic>Al467606, Aim2, Dynap, Htra3, Itgb7, Tspan13</italic>) whose expression was gradually increased in Ras<sup>LOW</sup> and Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> right, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). Similarly, we found nine genes (<italic>Ppp2r2b, Cbr1, Pmp22, Ptp4a3, Pmaip1, Thbs1, Akap12, Sulf2, Crip2</italic>) the expression of which was gradually repressed. Thus, our analysis identifies novel sets of quantitatively regulated Ras/MAPK target genes in hepatic cells. In the general framework of questioning the impact of Ras oncogenic dosage on the tumour-stroma interactions, we note the presence of genes in the gene ontology (GO) category of immune response regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Specific Ras<sup>G12V</sup> gene dosage is selected during tumour growth</title><p>Orthotopic injections of 10<sup>5</sup> BMEL-Ras cells into immunocompromised recipients systematically gave rise within 3–4 weeks to hepatocellular tumours at the site of injection as well as to frequent extrahepatic growth in the peritoneal cavity. First, we concentrated on primary tumours arising in the liver.

In accordance with their superior capacity for anchorage-independent growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> cells gave rise to significantly larger tumours than their Ras<sup>LOW</sup> counterparts, indicating that high level of Ras signalling conferred a selective advantage in vivo.

This was not due to an artefactual effect of the fluorescent markers, as switching the fluorescent labels between the Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> and Ras<sup>LOW</sup> cells had no impact on the dominance of Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> cells.

This suggests that selective pressures operating during the in vivo tumour growth allow the expansion of a population with a defined level of Ras oncogene expression, independently of which parental population they originate from. Since fewer cells in the Ras<sup>LOW</sup> population fell within the range of this ‘optimal’ oncogene dosage, they were underrepresented in the fully grown tumour at the end of the experiment.

On the other hand, the differentiated, tissue resident-like, F4/80<sup>high</sup> macrophages showed a tendency for enrichment in the peritoneal HCC. These results suggest that macrophage subsets are distinct in the liver and peritoneal TME, with tissue-resident, F4/80<sup>high</sup> cells, which are part of organ homeostasis maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dou et al., 2019</xref>) dominating the peritoneal TME while abundant F4/80<sup>low</sup> immature TAMs infiltrate the liver.

Coherent with our findings that more activated and less immature DCs are present in peritoneal TME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and D</xref>), these results suggest that the liver TME may represent a more immune tolerant environment for Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> tumour cell outgrowth compared to the peritoneum, in which the activation levels of the Ras oncogene do not affect the dynamics of tumourigenesis. Thus, through both flow cytometry and RNAseq deconvolution analyses, our results highlight the differences in stromal composition of the tumours in the two locations, showing the complex interplay of innate immune cells that may participate in shaping the clonal selection in the tumour.</p><p>We reasoned that a likely consequence of increased numbers of activated DCs would be an improved efficiency of antigen presentation, thereby allowing a more efficient tumour clearance in the peritoneum.While such phenotype is not relevant in immunodeficient mice that are unable to mount a T-cell response, it should be detectable in immunocompetent animals. In order to test this prediction, we compared the outcomes of orthotopic injections of tumour cells in immunocompetent C57BL/6 and immunodeficient nude mice. For these autologous allografts, we took advantage of a C57BL/6 primary cell line that we derived from a tumour established by a hydrodynamic gene transfer of constitutively active Ras and a simultaneous CrispR/Cas9-mediated inactivation of the p53 tumour suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bacevic et al., 2019</xref>). Orthotopic allografts of 5000 cells performed in parallel on immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice gave rise to comparable macroscopic liver tumours within 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, in contrast to nude mice, of which 50% developed macroscopic peritoneal tumours, no growth at a metastatic location was detected in immunocompetent recipients. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a more effective antigen presentation in the peritoneum limits metastatic tumour growth in immunocompetent animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ras signalling modulates tumour cells interactions with stromal cells</title><p>We next questioned the mechanistic bases of the tumour and stroma crosstalk that might shape the quantitative differences in the oncogenic pathway activation.

It is also expressed on the surface of several immune cell subsets, including macrophages, T lymphocytes, and NK cells, where homophilic interactions with the CEACAM1+ tumour cells abrogate NK-mediated cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helfrich and Singer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Markel et al., 2002</xref>). In order to confirm that the observed Ras-mediated transcriptional activation translates into CEACAM1 expression on the surface of cancer cells, we performed FACS analyses on cells dissociated from the liver and peritoneal tumours. As expected, the majority of the non-hematopoietic (CD45<sup>neg</sup>) cells in both tumoural locations expressed the Venus fluorescent protein and were therefore the Ras<sup>G12V</sup> expressing tumoural cells.

Strikingly, the mean fluorescent intensities of the CEACAM1 labelling in the Venus+ populations were indistinguishable between the tumours at the two locations.

Consistently, the number of caspase 3-positive cells was low for both liver and peritoneal tumours in NSG animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that the discrimination against the Ras<sup>LOW</sup> cells, both in the peritoneum and in the liver, is alleviated in the NSG background. In support of this contention, compared to the nude mice, the hepatic tumours in the NSG background tolerated lower levels of CEACAM1 expression, while there was no significant difference for the peritoneal tumours between the two genetic backgrounds. Of note, however, the difference between CEACAM1 expression in the hepatic and peritoneal tumours was diminished, but not abolished in the NSG animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

The Ras/MAPK Erk pathway is a prototypic example of such complex regulatory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murphy and Blenis, 2006</xref>), whose output is also relevant in the context of tumourigenesis. This has been shown for example in response to the loss of anchorage, where strong Erk signal is protective, while a moderate one is required for anoïkis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zugasti et al., 2001</xref>). However, excessive Erk activation can be detrimental to the cell, provoking cell cycle arrest or senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woods et al., 1997</xref>). More recent single-cell functional analyses further support the evidence for cell-autonomous sensitivity to signal intensity, but also reveal the heterogeneity of cellular response, both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gross et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumagai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molina-Sánchez et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our understanding of how the availability of extracellular stimuli, or the deregulation of their sensors, translate into cellular responses is still incomplete. For example, although only 5% of the small GTPase Ras needs to be activated to give rise to full activation of Erk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hallberg et al., 1994</xref>), a clear dosage effect has been reported in pancreatic and lung tumours for activating Ras mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">East et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mueller et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, amplifications of the wild-type allele of Ras that give rise to an allelic imbalance and the consequent modulation of the activity of the oncogenic Ras mutants result in distinct cellular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambrogio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bremner and Balmain, 1990</xref>). This further argues for the physiological importance of precise Ras dosage in a growing tumour.</p><p>Of note, whereas activating Ras mutations are rare in HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zucman-Rossi et al., 2015</xref>), alterations in the intensity of MAPK Erk signalling participate in shaping the tumoural phenotype, as revealed by inactivating mutations of Rsk2, which is both an ERK target and a negative regulator of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, a recent analysis of transcriptional signatures classified HCC among tumours with significant Ras pathway activation phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">East et al., 2021</xref>). Because the same report highlighted the predictive value of strong versus weak Ras-driven transcriptional signature, it is relevant to model these phenotypes in HCC by controlled dosage of the Ras oncogene, as we have done in this study.</p><p>Our exploration of signal intensity that is optimal for tumour growth in the context of its specific microenvironment led to a description of a novel feature of tumour heterogeneity, manifested by quantitative dosage differences of oncogenic signalling in tumours developing at primary and metastatic locations. We note that the peritoneal tumours in our animal model likely do not result from a bona fide metastatic process. Nevertheless, they do represent tumoural growth at an extrahepatic site and are thus a convenient model to analyse primary and metastatic-like tumour growth within the same animal.</p><p>Although several oncogenic signalling pathways lie downstream of Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018</xref>), in our experimental model Ras<sup>G12V</sup> dosage correlates with the MAP kinase Erk activity, but not with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Whether such uncoupling is a general feature of HCC or simply a reflection of a strong PI(3)K/Akt signalling present in the non-transformed BMEL parental cells remains to be established.</p><p>Comparing tumours formed by BMEL-Ras cells expressing a wide range of Ras<sup>G12V</sup> oncogene (‘parental Ras’ cells), with those initiated by cells with the narrower range of signalling intensities (Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> and Ras<sup>LOW</sup> cells) suggests the existence of a trade-off in the tumours’ evolutionary history. Indeed, we have shown that cells expressing high oncogene levels are globally favoured in the primary liver tumours, however, their selective advantage is curtailed by a higher probability of undergoing programmed cell death. While the propensity to activate the senescence and/or apoptosis in response to oncogenic Ras signalling is well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woods et al., 1997</xref>), the observation of diminished cell death in the tumours growing in NSG animals points to an additional, non-cell-autonomous, mechanism that drives this response.</p><p>The immune response to cancer comprises a complex interplay of innate and adaptive components of immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fridman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molina-Sánchez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>). Concentrating our study on animals devoid of an adaptive immune response gave us access to interactions between the tumour and its innate immune component. Our results point to key differences in myeloid cell population subsets in the liver and peritoneum of tumour-bearing mice. Notably, the content of tumour-infiltrating, immunosuppressive macrophages, whose function in promoting liver carcinogenesis is well recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ringelhan et al., 2018</xref>), was enhanced in Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> liver tumours, and correlated with an increased fraction of immature DCs when compared to the peritoneal TME. These results suggest that rather than total numbers of each myeloid populations, it is the phenotype of these cells, driven by the local cues, that regulates their ability to further engage an anti-tumour immunity and control tumour outgrowth. In line with this observation, recent studies have shown that identical oncogenic drivers have strikingly different consequences on the content and activation of TME cells in lung or pancreatic adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kortlever et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sodir et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, in addition to the tumour cells’ genetic landscape itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wellenstein and de Visser, 2018</xref>), the downstream activation of signalling nodes pertaining to dosage of a specific oncogene should be considered as a tumour-intrinsic feature shaping the TME, as recently also reported for pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ischenko et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>It is of particular interest to consider the role played by NK cells as part of the organismal defence against HCC. NK activities are strongly dependent on, as yet incompletely understood, organ-specific features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). Resident NK cells acquire cytolytic functions mediated through TNFα and granzyme B during hepatotropic viral infections, cirrhotic pathology, and HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sällberg and Pasetto, 2020</xref>). The viral adaptation to the NK-mediated attack includes the suppression of their function through the CEACAM1-mediated blockade of their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suda et al., 2018</xref>). Our results are fully consistent with the idea that a similar mechanism of immune escape operates in primary tumours of HCC. In contrast to the liver, the peritoneal resident cells resemble immature splenic NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzaga et al., 2011</xref>), which may account for a lesser involvement of these cells in anti-tumour immunity in this location, as suggested by our data.</p><p>How can the organ-specific differences in primary and metastatic tumour growth be exploited in designing novel therapeutic approaches remains an open question. The observation that only a narrow range signalling intensity through a signal transduction pathway is compatible with tumour development raises hopes for the therapeutic efficacy of its modulation, as recently reported for stratification of HCC response to chemotherapeutic intervention based on the inactivating Rsk2 mutations that modulate the strength of the MAPK signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, only lung adenocarcinoma with a strong Ras activating signature respond to inhibitors of the MAPK Erk pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">East et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A key role of NK cells in anti-tumour immunity is today well appreciated (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pende et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, there is a rising interest in the use of NK cell-based therapies, largely because of their considerably lower toxicity in comparison to T-cell transfer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2020</xref>), translating into over 200 ongoing clinical trials on solid tumours, including HCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>). Our data suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of NK-based therapy for HCC might be improved by simultaneous inhibition of Erk signalling. Such adjuvant therapy may show clinical benefit, notably for the subset of tumours characterized by strong MAPK signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>BMEL preparation and cell culture</title><p>BMEL cells were isolated from C57BL/6xC3H E14 embryonic mouse female liver, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Strick-Marchand and Weiss, 2002</xref>.

The enriched NK cells populations were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, sodium pyruvate (1 mM), HEPES (10 mM), and β-mercaptoethanol (50 μM), counted and used to set up cytotoxic assays. Efficiency of the enrichment was evaluated by flow cytometry using antibodies directed against CD45 (clone 30-F11, BD Biosciences), enrichment 90–95%; and Nkp46 (clone 29A1.4, Thermo Fisher), enrichment: 80–90%.</p><p>BMEL target cells (clones Ras<sup>LOW-mCherry</sup> and Ras<sup>HIGH-Venus</sup>) were seeded at a 1:1 ratio in a 96-well plate (flat-bottom) pre-coated with collagen type I (BD Biosciences 354236) (in total, 20,000 target cells/well). Cells were incubated 2 hr at 37°C, then enriched NK cell suspensions were added at different ratios to the co-culture of target cells, as indicated (20,000–100,000 cells). The cytotoxicity test was performed in complete RPMI media in the presence of mIL15 (100 ng/ml, R&amp;D Systems). Duplicates were generated for each condition tested. After 16 hr of incubation at 37°C, supernatant and cells were quickly collected by trypsinization and kept on ice. A viability dye was added extemporaneously (DAPI, 400–600 ng/ml final) and the percentage of DAPI+ cells in Ras<sup>LOW-mCherry</sup> and Ras<sup>HIGH-Venus</sup> cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. As a control (baseline level), the percentage of DAPI+ cells was measured in co-cultures of target cells maintained under the same media conditions but not exposed to NK cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Softwares</title><p>The following open-source code and software were used in this study: R (v.3.5.1), Default settings were used for all GSEA.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers at Review Commons, and the evaluation at eLife has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Based on your manuscript and the reviews, we invite you to submit a revised version incorporating the revisions as outlined below:</p><p>This study was designed to investigate Ras-stimulated tumor formation by bipotential mouse embryonic liver cells. The authors examine the effect of Ras dose on tumor formation in the liver and peritoneum. The authors also compare tumor formation in immune-competent and immune-incompetent mouse models, but do not extend the analysis to an examination of Ras dose. The authors conclude that: (1) pre-existing tumor initiating cells with a specified Ras dosage accounts for tumor formation and that the Ras dosage requirement is different for the liver and peritoneum, (2) that the immune microenvironment differs between the liver and peritoneum due to the efficiency of antigen processing by dendritic cells and the presence of NK cells, and (3) that strong MAPK signaling is required primary liver tumors to resist elimination by NK cells.</p><p>Data to support these conclusions is missing from the study presented and further experimentation is required to address these issues. The following specific revisions are requested.</p><p>1) The authors frequently refer to metastasis in the text of the manuscript, including in the abstract. However, the transplantation model is not a metastatic model of cancer. Indeed, the authors state that the location of peritoneal cells occurs at the time of injection. The text needs to be corrected throughout.</p><p>2) The authors conclude that there is selection for pre-existing clones with a specific level of Ras expression for the growth of liver and peritoneal tumors. This seems likely, but not directly demonstrated. If Ras expression is variable (epigenetics etc), is it possible that selection occurs at the level of Ras expression? Studies with single clones would be helpful.</p><p>3) Studies using immunocompetent mice transplanted with liver tumor cells are presented (Fig. 4G). The earlier nude mouse studies were performed using Ras-transformed BMEL cells. Is the absence of peritoneal tumors in the immunocompetent mice because liver tumor cells were employed rather than Ras-transformed BMEL? A different experimental design would be to use syngeneic BMEL cells for all of these studies. How do the authors justify the presented experimental design that prevents comparison of the immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice.</p><p>4) The studies of immunocompetent mice (Fig. 4G) does not address Ras dosage. Does the level of Ras expression affect tumor formation (like nude mice)? Is there selection for the level of Ras expression (like nude mice)? These questions are not addressed.</p><p>5) The abstract refers to an &quot;evolutionary trade-off of increased apoptotic death in the liver&quot;, but no data on increased apoptotic death of RasHigh cells in the liver is presented.</p><p>6) A role of NK cells is inferred from the comparison of nude mice with high levels of NK cells and NSG mice with few NK cells. Differences in Casp3+ cells are described, but the tumor volumes were comparable. The role of NK cells was not directly tested. The authors' conclusions are therefore unclear.</p><p>7) A major conclusion drawn from this study is that strong MAPK activation is required for primary liver tumor resistance to NK cell-mediated elimination (stated in abstract). The only experiment presented that proposes to address a role for NKT cells is the NSG mouse transplantation study, but this study showed comparable liver tumor volumes with nude mice. How is this consistent with the stated conclusion?</p><p>8) The abstract states that MAPK Erk signaling intensity contributes to potential vulnerability in HCC. This should be re-stated as Ras rather than Erk because Erk represents only one the Ras effectors and the relative roles of different Ras effectors was not tested.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76294.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>While studies are very elegant and results convincing, it is unclear how they might be deployed to therapeutic ends.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>The authors should explain why this is an interesting finding.

We have now expanded the discussion on these points and commented on the clinical relevance of our findings to answer the reviewers' concern (Discussion section page 15 lines 7-15).</p><p>Our data are consistent with the widely acknowledged role of NK cells in anti-tumour immunity (e.g. Pende et al., Frontiers Immunol. 2019, 10:1179, for review). NK activity is governed by engagement of a repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors expressed on their surface (Shimasaki et al., Nature Rev Drug Discovery, 2020, 19, 200-218). Among the latter, homophilic interactions of CEACAM1 (CD66A) expressed on melanoma cells have been shown to protect the tumor from NK-mediated toxicity (Markel et al., J Immunol 2002; 168:2803-2810;), in a strict parallel to our interpretation.</p><p>NK cells are relatively sparse in the peripheral blood and abundant in a healthy liver. In patients with HCC, the numbers of peripheral, liver resident and tumor-infiltrating NK all drop significantly, mainly due to the disappearance of CD56<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>pos</sup> cell subset, corresponding to the cytotoxic NK population. Moreover, despite the continuous expression of activating receptors, the functionality of both the cytotoxic (and the cytokine producing (CD56<sup>bright</sup>CD16<sup>neg</sup>)) remaining NKs is severely impaired (Cai et al. Clinical Immunology (2008) 129, 428–437). The molecular mechanisms underlying NK anergy in the context of HCC have yet to be fully elucidated. However, CEACAM1 expression has been shown to suppress NK function in hepatitis C patients (Suda et al. Hepatology Communications 2018;2:1247-1258) and there is ample evidence of CEACAM1 playing a major role in hepatic disease and in particular in protection against inflammation and immune-induced hepatitis (reviewed in Horst et al. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018, 19, 3110). Thus, CEACAM1 is a bona fide regulator of NK function that is relevant in cancer and in non-cancerous liver pathology.</p><p>In this context, our data introduce an additional notion, namely the tumor-promoting effect of a strong ERK activation in HCC that leads to CEACAM1-mediated anergy of NK.</p><p>How might these findings be translated into future therapeutic options for HCC? Several scenarios can be envisaged, a very attractive being a cell-mediated immunotherapy, notably either autologous or allogeneic NK transfer. These therapies, which were initially developed for hematopoietic malignancies, are currently gaining momentum for solid tumors. Infusion of modified NK cells, including CAR-NK, presents major advantages over T-cell based therapies, mainly due to a very much diminished risk of GVDH in allogenic setting and of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity for autologous transfer. Moreover, because NK-mediated cytotoxicity is HLA-independent, it does not require careful haplotype matching, thus greatly increasing the speed and availability of cellular preparations (recently reviewed in Xie et al. EBioMedicine 59 (2020) 102975).</p><p>Currently, there are 219 registered clinical trials, including 31 on HCC, for NK-mediated anti- solid tumor responses (clinicaltrials.gov). Although most of these are only in phase I or phase II, they bear a great promise for the future. Our data strongly suggest that a new combination therapy might have an improved efficiency in a subset of HCC characterized by a strong ERK activation. This would involve either activated NK or CAR-NK in combination with a FDA-approved inhibitor of the MAPK ERK, such as trametinib. Our data lead us to predict that even a partial decrease in the intensity of ERK signaling would be likely to significantly increase the efficacy of NK-mediated anti-tumor activity, at least in a subset of HCC. While we appreciate that this suggestion remains speculative at this point in time, we believe the strength and novelty of our data warrants an exploration of such novel therapeutic opportunity for this tumor type that dramatically lacks reliable treatment options.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific points</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>Minor edits: Editorial review for minor, infrequent word usage edits</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any English language mistakes in the manuscript. While the formulation of the remark makes us believe that our word usage does not impair the understanding of the text, we shall of course be willing to correct it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1E: Not possible to read genes in left heatmap, middle heatmap very small.

We realize that due to the high number or genes, their names are still in a very small print in the left panel of Figure 1E, however, the complete list the genes is given in the supplementary table 1, and we added larger image of the heat map with the table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>1. Is there any significant change of EMT like status in BMEL cells having H-RAS (high) vs H-RAS (low)?</p></disp-quote><p>Several EMT markers (e.g. vimentin or loss of E-cadherin) are induced by H-Ras in BMEL cells, as we have previously reported (Akkari et al. J Hepatol, 2012). Moderate levels of Ras expression appear to be sufficient for this phenotype, since we did not detect significant differences in their expression profiles either between RAS<sup>HIGH</sup> and RAS<sup>LOW</sup> populations or between cells isolated from the hepatic versus the peritoneal tumors. We conclude that the phenotype of a selective advantage afforded by a high RAS expression level is not due to the EMT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There is no significant fold difference (MFI number) to put the sorting gates to enrich H-RAS high vs H-RAS low cells. The mRNA expression level was almost 3 fold difference. Is it correlated with protein expression level?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very valid point. We agree that the MFI difference is not strong, although it is in fact statistically significant in three independent cell sorting experiments. We were confident that the differences in the H-Ras mRNA level were reflected in the level of protein expression, since we have observed distinct transcriptional signatures as well as significant phenotypic differences in Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> and Ras<sup>LOW</sup> cells (Figure 1 B and D). Nevertheless, we quite agree that the difference in protein expression level needed to be confirmed. This has now been done by immunoblot analysis of protein extracts with an antibody specific to Ras<sup>G12V</sup> (Cell signaling #14412). These data have now been included in Figure 1A, and the text modified accordingly (page 4 line 9-19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Is there any translational relevance of these genes Al467606, Aim2, Dynap, Htra3, Itgb7, Tspan13 in HCC patients with poor survivability?</p></disp-quote><p>The expression of these genes positively correlated with the level of the Ras oncogene in the ex vivo cell culture model, thus providing a nice demonstration that variation in HRAS oncogenic dosage translates into differential transcriptomic outputs. The analysis of publicly available data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) also showed their expression in the HCC cohort (372 patients samples).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76294-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The clinical outcome of the level of their expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) is somewhat ambiguous: strong expression of ITGB7 and C16ORF54 (Human ortholog of Al467606) correlated with a better prognosis, while expression of AIM2 and DYNAP had no impact on patient overall survival. Finally, HTRA3 and TSPAN13 were associated with worse outcomes and thus constitute particularly interesting candidates for future investigations. These somewhat unexpected divergent correlations likely reflect the fact that RAS/MAPK signalling is unlikely to be the sole regulator of their expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Is there any difference between survival curve upon grafting of H-RAS (high) vs H-RAS (low) cells in Figure 2A?</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment has not been performed for ethical reasons. Indeed, the difference in tumor growth upon injection of Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> vs Ras<sup>LOW</sup> is statistically significant 21 days after injection (Figure 2A, p-value = 0.008). The size of the Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> tumours is rather large and we chose to sacrifice the animals before they developed any signs of suffering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Is there any difference of H-RAS expression between liver tumor and peritoneal tumors?</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified H-Ras expression levels by RTqPCR in the flow cytometry sorted tumoral cells derived from the liver and peritoneal tumours (Figure 3C). In the revised version of the manuscript we provide evidence that the mRNA expression levels of the oncogene correlate with the protein expression. Therefore, while the measurement of H-Ras protein has not been performed on the tumours, we would argue that it will indeed be different in the two tumour locations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Please provide the data for pro-inflammatory cytokines in TME.</p></disp-quote><p>These data have been shown in the Suppl. Figure 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Please provide an explanation of the DC activation with antigen presentation though the tumor is non-necrotic or apoptotic.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is true that peritoneal tumors are less necrotic and have a lower apoptotic index than the matched hepatic primary ones (Figure 3E), significant cell death can be detected at both locations. We assume that the released antigens are sufficient for presentation by the DC, as supported by the data in Figure 4C, D and G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Is the TAM showing M2 phenotypes at peritoneal tumors?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points out that the distinction between liver and peritoneal TAM polarization is not perfectly clear-cut, since some immunosuppressive but also some inflammatory markers are present at both tumor locations (Figure 4B and Suppl Figure 4). This is not unexpected, as the spectrum of activation macrophages can undertake in vivo is neither static nor fully faithful to the M1/M2 polarization extremes inducible in vitro (see e.g. Ringelhan et al., Nat Immunol. 2018;19(3):222-232 ; Ruffell et al., Trends Immunol. 2012 33(3):119-26). We thus integrate these results with our observations of other modulated immune cell phenotypes in these tumors. Indeed, in addition to the macrophage polarization markers, we noted a more mature, activated phenotype in the peritoneal TAMs. Together with the cytokine expression profile in the two tumor locations (which is included as a supplementary table in the revised version of the manuscript) our data argue for a less inflammatory environment in the peritoneal tumors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significance</p><p>The data showed pretty promising and has a seminal impact on H-RAS high expressing HCC patients. TAM and DC showed some important immune regulation to promote HCC.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his appreciation of the significance of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>It is possible that RAS levels may not stay constant but dynamically go up and down. While this is a possibility that would complicate interpretations of the results, I am ok with the conclusions in the manuscript as it is, since there seems to be a significant difference between the different populations assayed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point that we have addressed by comparing the H-RAS expression level in the parental BMEL population (labelled “cells before injection” in Figure 2D) to those either freshly isolated from the tumors after a rapid cell-sorting by flow cytometry (“tumors” in Figure 2D) and then to those isolated from tumors and kept in culture for 14 days (“tumoral cell lines” in Figure 2D). Our conclusion was that the level of RAS expression was stable upon ex vivo culture. This result does not exclude a possibility of epigenetic regulation that operated in vivo and was maintained in the subsequent cell culture. However, even if this was the case, it would not alter the conclusion of distinct selective advantage of the HRAS expression levels in the two tumoral locations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significance</p><p>The authors should explain why this is an interesting finding. They mention in the abstract that this heterogeneity highlights potential vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited. How do they envision this? Why is this not a trivial result and in what way can this observation help design new therapies?</p></disp-quote><p>This important point is very similar to the concern raised by the reviewer 1 and we have answered them together at the beginning of the rebuttal.</p><p>We would like to thank again the reviewers for raising this issue, which prompted us to include the considerations of potential usefulness of our findings in the revised discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors frequently refer to metastasis in the text of the manuscript, including in the abstract. However, the transplantation model is not a metastatic model of cancer. Indeed, the authors state that the location of peritoneal cells occurs at the time of injection. The text needs to be corrected throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the peritoneal tumours in our experimental model are probably not <italic>bona fide</italic> metastases, since they are likely to be seeded during the orthotopic injection. Nevertheless, our experimental model allows the examination of hepatic tumour growth at the primary (liver) site and a location known to support HCC metastasis in human patients (the peritoneum). We have therefore corrected the text, keeping the terms &quot;metastatic site&quot; and &quot;metastatic-like tumours&quot;, but removing &quot;metastasis&quot; and &quot;metastatic tumours&quot; as such. We have also removed the term of “metastatic” from the title of the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors conclude that there is selection for pre-existing clones with a specific level of Ras expression for the growth of liver and peritoneal tumors. This seems likely, but not directly demonstrated. If Ras expression is variable (epigenetics etc), is it possible that selection occurs at the level of Ras expression? Studies with single clones would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very valid point. Indeed, our data do not exclude the possibility of variable Ras expression that could arise via epigenetic regulation under different growth conditions. Data presented in Fig 2D argue against this interpretation. Moreover, we are working with populations of cells harbouring different copy numbers of the oncogene inserted into different genomic loci. Therefore, in a scenario of epigenetically-driven regulation of oncogene expression, one would expect some, but not all of the subclones to be susceptible to upregulate Ras expression in response to the in vivo microenvironment. This would give rise to a population of cells with a range of Ras expression levels that would be different from the original population that was allografted, but would remain subject to selection operating in vivo. We therefore believe that epigenetic regulation of Ras expression might indeed exist, but is unlikely to account for the observed phenotype.</p><p>Regarding the use of single clones: we chose to use cell populations since they are best adapted to study selection processes operating in vivo. We have nevertheless set out to isolate clonal cell lines from the BMEL-Ras populations. The majority of the single clones analysed (n=26) expressed low to moderate Ras levels. We have verified the stability of Ras expression levels in culture and used Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> and Ras<sup>LOW</sup> clones in the NK cytotoxicity assays described below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Studies using immunocompetent mice transplanted with liver tumor cells are presented (Fig. 4G). The earlier nude mouse studies were performed using Ras-transformed BMEL cells. Is the absence of peritoneal tumors in the immunocompetent mice because liver tumor cells were employed rather than Ras-transformed BMEL? A different experimental design would be to use syngeneic BMEL cells for all of these studies. How do the authors justify the presented experimental design that prevents comparison of the immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The BMEL clone we have used in this work was chosen because of its very high oncogenic potential: unpublished data from our lab indicates that &lt;500 cells are sufficient for orthotopic tumour formation. However, the cells are of a mixed genetic background, making them unsuitable for syngeneic transfer. Therefore, for testing the behaviour of Ras-transformed cells in immunocompetent animals we have turned to an alternative model of a cell line derived from mouse tumours initiated by hydrodynamic gene transfer. We quite agree that the results are not directly transposable to the model of <italic>ex-vivo</italic> transformed BMEL cells, but we disagree with the statement that the experimental design prevents comparison of the immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice. Indeed, the same tumour-derived cells were injected into wt B6 (syngeneic) animals and into nude mice (Fig. 4G). As expected, peritoneal tumours were observed in immunodeficient, but not immunocompetent mice, arguing for an efficient immune control in the peritoneum, consistent with our data suggesting differences in antigen presentation capacity at the two tumoral sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The studies of immunocompetent mice (Fig. 4G) does not address Ras dosage. Does the level of Ras expression affect tumor formation (like nude mice)? Is there selection for the level of Ras expression (like nude mice)? These questions are not addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments presented in Fig. 4G were not designed to investigate the Ras dosage effect in immunocompetent host, but to test the prediction that efficient antigen presentation in the peritoneum would prevent tumour establishment at this location in the mice capable of mounting an immune response.</p><p>While we did measure Ras dosage in the B6 liver tumours, which was not significantly different from the ex vivo grown cells, we did not further investigate this point. This is because for this experiment we used cells that are invalidated for the expression of the TP53 tumour suppressor, a condition necessary to obtain Ras-driven tumours by hydrodynamic gene transfer. The same cells were used for assays in C57Bl/6 and nude mice (Fig. 4G), allowing a direct comparison of tumours arising in immunocompetent and immunodeficient animals. We have however not investigated further the Ras dosage dependence in the context of inactivated p53.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The abstract refers to an &quot;evolutionary trade-off of increased apoptotic death in the liver&quot;, but no data on increased apoptotic death of Ras<sup>High</sup> cells in the liver is presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that apoptosis, revealed by active caspase 3 and by the analysis of the RNAseq data, is correlated with high-intensity Ras signalling (Fig. 3D and E). Moreover, our unpublished data indicates that Ras<sup>High</sup> cells have low clonogenicity. The simplest interpretation of these findings is that strong Ras signalling is deleterious to the transformed cells, in accordance with abundant data in the literature. However, we agree that the concept of the evolutionary trade-off remains an interpretation and not an experimental result. In consequence, we propose to add the word &quot;apparent&quot; in the summary (&quot;significantly higher Ras expression was observed in primary as compared to secondary, metastatic sites, despite the apparent evolutionary trade-off of increased apoptotic death in the liver that correlated with high Ras dosage&quot;). In the discussion, we say that our data &quot;suggests an evolutionary trade-off for the high oncogene dosage in the liver tumours&quot;, clearly indicating that we use this concept to interpret our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A role of NK cells is inferred from the comparison of nude mice with high levels of NK cells and NSG mice with few NK cells. Differences in Casp3+ cells are described, but the tumor volumes were comparable. The role of NK cells was not directly tested. The authors' conclusions are therefore unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a direct test of NK toxicity was missing from the previous version of the manuscript. We have now performed these experiments and the revised version of the manuscript includes data showing that Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> cells are more resistant to NK-mediated toxicity than their Ras<sup>LOW</sup> counterparts. These new results, presented in the revised Fig. 5C, further support our contention of the role of NK cells in progressive elimination of the Ras<sup>LOW</sup> clones in liver tumours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A major conclusion drawn from this study is that strong MAPK activation is required for primary liver tumor resistance to NK cell-mediated elimination (stated in abstract). The only experiment presented that proposes to address a role for NKT cells is the NSG mouse transplantation study, but this study showed comparable liver tumor volumes with nude mice. How is this consistent with the stated conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the scarcity of experiments directly addressing the role of NK cells was a weakness of the previous version of the manuscript. The revised version now contains data from NK cytotoxicity assays showing increased resistance of Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> compared to Ras<sup>LOW</sup> clones. These data support our conclusion of the role of NK cells shaping the dynamics of tumour growth. Of note, we do not claim that the NKs are the sole factor responsible for differences in the liver and peritoneal tumours, in fact we do not believe this is likely to be the case. Indeed, while our data indicate NK participation in creating distinct selective pressures in the two tumour locations, molecular differences between the liver and peritoneal tumours are not totally abrogated in the NSG animals (see e.g. Fig. 5E).</p><p>Regarding the tumour volumes in the nude and NSG mice: the data in Fig. 5C show the relative ratio of peritoneal to liver tumours for each individual mouse rather than absolute tumour volumes. The reason for opting for such presentation is that tumour volumes vary considerably in different experiments, and also between animals in the same experiment (illustrated in Fig. 3B). In order to obtain statistically significant results, a large number of animals must be used and the price of the NSG mice was prohibitive for such a study. Calculating the ratio of tumour volumes at the two locations in the same animal was more informative than representation of absolute tumour sizes. Admittedly, it also suffers from the shortcoming of a low number of animals, which precludes reaching statistical significance of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The abstract states that MAPK Erk signaling intensity contributes to potential vulnerability in HCC. This should be re-stated as Ras rather than Erk because Erk represents only one the Ras effectors and the relative roles of different Ras effectors was not tested.</p></disp-quote><p>It is of course true that MAPK Erk is not a sole effector of Ras and indeed we have not studied the role of alternative effectors in the tumour phenotype we describe. Interestingly, short-circuiting RTK engagement by direct manipulation of Ras activity has been reported to specifically trigger of the MAPK and not the PI(3)K/mTOR pathway (Toettcher et al. 2013, Cell, 155, 1422–1434. doi:10.1016/j.cell.2013.11.004). In our model neither the phosphoproteomic array (Fig. 1C) nor the transcriptomic analysis gave any indication of differential activation of the PI(3)K/Akt /mTOR pathway. This is in contrast to significant differences in Erk activity between Ras<sup>HIGH</sup> and Ras<sup>LOW</sup> BMEL cells, as well as cells isolated from hepatic versus peritoneal tumours, revealed both by transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic data (Figs 1C, 1D and 3D).</p><p>We acknowledge, however, that we have not formally proven that Erk signalling intensity is the Achilles' heel of a subtype of HCC. This is why we mention only a &quot;potential&quot; vulnerability. To further downplay our assertion, we have now changed the text from &quot;highlights a potential vulnerability of a subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma as a function of MAPK Erk signalling intensity&quot; to &quot;points to a potential vulnerability of a subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma as a function of MAPK Erk signalling intensity&quot;.</p></body></sub-article></article>
