The uptake of both ions into cells requires an elaborate mechanism that allows their selection from a large background of alkaline earth metal ions and their efficient concentration within cells. This formidable task is performed by members of the SLC11 family, which constitute a conserved family of secondary active transporters that facilitate the cotransport of transition metal ions together with protons acting as energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Courville et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gunshin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Montalbetti et al., 2013</xref>). To be able to do this across all kingdoms of life, the common molecular features conferring ion selectivity and proton coupling are strongly conserved within different branches of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bozzi and Gaudet, 2021</xref>). However, despite this strong conservation, there are two distinct clades of the family, which have evolved a different substrate selectivity. These comprise the large group of NRAMP-related Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters (NRMTs) and a smaller group of NRAMP-related Al<sup>3+</sup> transporters (NRATs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chauhan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xia et al., 2010</xref>). In a recent study, we have shown how NRMTs have adapted their molecular architecture to facilitate Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake, by characterizing a transporter from the bacterium <italic>Eggerthella lenta</italic> termed EleNRMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). Due to its small ionic radius, the stripping of the interacting solvent is particularly costly for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and its transport by EleNRMT thus likely proceeds as hydrated ion retaining most of its first coordination shell. Besides Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the protein also transports Mn<sup>2+</sup> but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In NRMTs, several of the residues coordinating ions in transition metal transporters of the family are exchanged, including a conserved methionine, which forms coordinative interactions with transition metals while preventing the binding of alkaline earth metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozzi et al., 2016</xref>). The reduction of the side chain volume of interacting residues in combination with small rearrangements of the backbone have increased the volume of the binding site to accommodate the hydrated ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). Unlike in proton-coupled family members, transport in EleNRMT is passive with residues that have been assigned to participate in H<sup>+</sup> transport being replaced by hydrophobic side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Besides the prokaryotic NRMTs, which constitute a large branch of the family that is distantly related to transition metal ion transporters of the same family, the NRATs form a small clade in plants, whose evolutionary relationship to classical SLC11 transporters is much closer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). These proteins have evolved to combat Al<sup>3+</sup> toxicity in soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chauhan et al., 2021</xref>). As strong Lewis acid, this trivalent cation strongly interacts with membranes to compromise their integrity. As one of the mechanisms to neutralize the adverse effect of Al<sup>3+</sup>, NRATs were proposed to catalyze its uptake into the cytoplasm of root cells acting in concert with other proteins, which mediate the further transport into vacuoles where it is neutralized by the complexation with dicarboxylates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xia et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To clarify the mechanism by which NRATs transport trivalent cations, we have here studied the function and structure of a transporter from <italic>Setaria italica</italic> (termed SiNRAT). We show that this protein broadly transports divalent transition metal ions by a mechanism that is not coupled to protons. Although, for technical reasons, transport of trivalent cations could not directly be assayed, we provide evidence for their specific interaction with the binding site, thus defining them as likely substrates. The cryo-EM structure of SiNRAT displays a protein that shares the hallmarks of the SLC11 family. It resides in an occluded conformation where the access to the binding site is sealed from both sides of the membrane. This structure harbors an ion binding region for Al<sup>3+</sup> located inside an aqueous pocket, which encompasses the predicted replacements of coordinating residues and which also contains an additional acidic amino acid that increases the negative charge density of the site to accommodate the larger net charge of the transported substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional characterization of SiNRAT</title><p>In the course of a previous phylogenetic analysis, we were able to spot seven homologues of the prototypic NRAT1 from <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (XP_015625418.1, Uniprot: Q6ZG85) in Blast searches of eukaryotic sequence databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). All identified proteins contain the described hallmarks of NRATs, which distinguishes this clade of the SLC11 family from the bulk of transition metal ion transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Differences include variations in the putative ion coordinating site, where the conserved DPGN motif on α1 of classical NRAMPs is changed to DPSN and the A/CxxM motif on α6 to AxxT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). Latter replaces the conserved methionine, whose sulfur atom is involved in transition metal ion coordination, with a threonine, which offers a hard oxygen ligand for metal ion interactions. To identify proteins that are suitable for structural and functional investigations, we have generated constructs of five NRAT homologues, each containing a C-terminal fusion of eGFP and an SBP tag used for affinity purification preceded by a 3C protease cleavage site. We have subsequently investigated their expression upon transient transfection of HEK293 cells followed by an initial biochemical characterization by fluorescence size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hattori et al., 2012</xref>). These experiments have singled out the protein from <italic>S. italica</italic> (termed SiNRAT, XP_004952002.1) as construct with comparably high expression level and promising biochemical behavior. We have subsequently scaled up the expression of SiNRAT in suspension culture and purified it in the detergent <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) for further studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).</p><p>For a characterization of its transport properties, SiNRAT was reconstituted into proteoliposomes and subjected to previously established fluorescence-based assays that have permitted the functional investigation of other members of the SLC11 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). We have initially studied the transport of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which is a common substrate of SLC11 transporters that can be monitored using the fluorophore calcein. Although, in a physiological context, SiNRAT presumably operates at mildly acidic extracellular conditions (i.e. at a pH &lt;5.5), all transport experiments were carried out at neutral pH since this resulted in maximum proteoliposome stability and highest sensitivity of the employed fluorophores. The assay revealed a concentration-dependent quenching of calcein as a consequence of the influx of Mn<sup>2+</sup> into the proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Transport is strongly dependent on the Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentration and saturates with an apparent K<sub>m</sub> of about 14 µM, reflecting the binding of the transported substrate to a saturable site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We subsequently investigated impairment of Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport by the alkaline earth metal ions Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> and found a concentration-dependent competition by both ions, which is indicative for their specific binding to the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). To investigate whether they would also be transported, we directly monitored their influx into proteoliposomes employing the fluorophores Fura-2 for the detection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Magnesium Green for Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In both cases, we found a weak signal that saturates at µM concentrations, which reflects uptake of both ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E-H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional characterization of SiNRAT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SiNRAT-mediated Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport into proteoliposomes (six experiments from four independent reconstitutions).

However, assaying this ion under in vitro conditions is complicated by the lack of suitable fluorophores and the fact that the chemical properties of Al<sup>3+</sup>, as strong Lewis acid with an ionic radius of 0.53 Å, leads to the destabilization of liposomes even at low µM concentrations. We thus turned our initial attention to the trivalent cation Ga<sup>3+</sup>, which is one period below Al<sup>3+</sup> in the same group of the periodic system, whose larger ionic radius (0.62 Å) and consequent weaker Lewis acidity is less disruptive for lipid bilayers. In an assay to investigate the interference with Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport, we found an inhibition by Ga<sup>3+</sup>, which emphasizes its interaction with the transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Conversely, we did not observe such competition with the prokaryotic transition metal ion transporter EcoDMT, excluding the action of Ga<sup>3+</sup> as non-specific inhibitor of the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Thus, despite the low solubility of Ga<sup>3+</sup> under the assayed conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu and Liao, 2011</xref>), which obscures a definitive assignment of its concentration dependence, our results suggest a specific effect of the ion on SiNRAT-mediated transport. Since equivalent studies with Al<sup>3+</sup> are prevented by its disruptive properties on membrane integrity, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to investigate the binding of the ion to SiNRAT in detergent solution. These experiments showed a specific signal upon Al<sup>3+</sup> titration as a consequence of its interaction with the transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). However, at the neutral pH of the sample, the trivalent ion is at equilibrium with its hydroxyl complexes, which complicates data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiss, 2013</xref>). The thermograms were thus best fitted to a sum of two binding constants, both in the low micromolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Although precluding a definitive mechanistic interpretation, we use the ITC results of Al<sup>3+</sup> binding as a qualitative assay of its interaction with SiNRAT and show later that the event is directly associated with its binding to the site that is relevant for ion transport.</p><p>We then investigated whether metal ion transport would be accompanied by a concentration-dependent acidification of vesicles, which is expected in case of coupled proton symport as observed for the prokaryotic SLC11 transporter EcoDMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>). To this end, we have assayed the import of H<sup>+</sup> at increasing concentrations of the transported ions Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the putative substrate Ga<sup>3+</sup> but did in no case detect evidence for metal ion concentration-dependent decrease of ACMA fluorescence, despite the negative membrane potential established by an outwardly directed K<sup>+</sup> gradient, which would facilitate H<sup>+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J, K</xref>). These findings suggest that, akin to the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter EleNRMT, SiNRAT acts as uncoupled transporter that facilitates the bidirectional transport of metal ions with poor selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structural characterization of SiNRAT</title><p>The described transport properties of SiNRAT are unique among characterized members of the SLC11 family. To define the underlying molecular features, we set out to determine its three-dimensional (3D) structure. Since the protein did not crystallize, we generated nanobody-based binders that, in complex with SiNRAT, increase the size of the protein sufficiently to permit its structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These binders were obtained by immunization of alpacas with the purified protein and subsequently selected by phage display from a library generated from a blood sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>). The procedure allowed the identification of the nanobody Nb1<sup>SiNRAT</sup> (short Nb1) as promising interaction partner that does not dissociate during size exclusion chromatography, and which inhibits Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport in a concentration-dependent manner when added to the outside of liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The incomplete inhibition of transport by Nb1 presumably reflects the mixed distribution of reconstituted SiNRAT residing in either inside-out or outside-out orientation, where the epitopes recognized by the nanobody are only accessible in one orientation. For the SiNRAT-Nb1 complex, we have prepared samples for cryo-EM. Since data recorded in the detergent DDM did not permit a 3D reconstruction at high resolution, we have reconstituted the complex into amphipols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleinschmidt and Popot, 2014</xref>) and collected a large dataset, which ultimately yielded a cryo-EM density map at 3.66 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Due to the challenges associated with the amphipol reconstitution process, the sample used for imaging did not contain transported ions. In case of trivalent ions this would have required a lowering of the pH to increase their solubility, which was incompatible with nanobody binding. The resulting map was of high quality and allowed the unambiguous interpretation with an atomic model revealing details of the 3D organization of SiNRAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structural characterization of the SiNRAT-Nb1 complex by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-EM density of SiNRAT in complex with Nb1 at 3.66 Å viewed from within the membrane at indicated orientations with the extracellular side on top and (<bold>B</bold>) ribbon representation of the complex in the same views.

SiNRAT structure in complex with Nb1 is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It shows a protein sharing the conserved architecture of the SLC11 family with a core consisting of a pair of structurally related repeats of five transmembrane spanning segments that are oriented in the membrane with opposite directions in an arrangement that was initially observed in the amino acid transporter LeuT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). In this architecture, the unwound centers of the first helix of each repeat together constitute a substrate binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). The protein contains a total of 12 membrane-inserted helices akin to other eukaryotic family members and the prokaryotic EcoDMT (PDBID: 5M87) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>), whose Cα-positions superimpose with an RMSD of 2.66 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The nanobody binds to an extended interface located at the extracellular side. These interactions involve contacts of all three CDRs of the nanobody, which bridge the core domain of SiNRAT consisting of α-helices 1–10 with α-helices 11–12 located at its periphery, thereby contacting the loops α1–2, α5–6, α7–8 and residues on α11 and burying 1682 Å<sup>2</sup> of the combined molecular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C, D</xref>).

This resemblance is reflected in an RMSD of Cα atoms of 1.57 Å upon a superposition of SiNRAT with DraNRAMP<sup>occ</sup> and 1.74 Å with DraNRAMP<sup>inw</sup>, whereas the RMSD of 2.71 Å compared to the outward-facing conformation of the same protein (PDBID: 6BU5, DraNRAMP<sup>out</sup>) is considerably larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As in DraNRAMP<sup>occ</sup>, the shorter α1a of SiNRAT is located closer to α6b compared to DraNRAMP<sup>inw</sup>, resulting in a narrowing of an aqueous cavity leading toward the supposed ion binding site, thereby separating this site from the intracellular environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We thus assume that the SiNRAT structure represents an intermediate between both endpoints of a transporter, functioning by an alternate access mechanism, that is closer to an inward-facing state. In its conformation, the binding site is sealed to both sides of the membrane by a thin gate composed of a single layer of residues (i.e. Asp 66, Asp 140, Thr 241, Tyr 243, and Thr 346) toward the inside and a thick gate (encompassing several layers of residues and spanning about 15 Å) toward the outside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Although for the reasons described above, we have not explicitly added transported ions to our sample, we find residual cryo-EM density bridging the neighboring residues Asp 66 and Ser 68 which, as part of the supposed ion binding site, are both located on the unwound loop connecting α1a and α1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This density presumably either originates from water, the monovalent cation Na<sup>+</sup> that is contained in the sample at a concentration of 200 mM, or traces of divalent metal ions found in our solution. Due to its proximity to binding sites identified in structures of other family members, we use this position as reference to analyze plausible protein substrate interactions, which nevertheless should be considered as tentative. In this putative site, Asp 66 is particularly striking, since it is universally conserved and was shown to constitute a key component for ion coordination in the entire SLC11 family. In contrast, Ser 68 is unique to NRATs and substituted by a Gly in all other members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The comparison of the SiNRAT site with the ion interaction in DraNRAMP<sup>occ</sup> shows common features but also differences that may underlie the altered substrate preference of SiNRAT. In both structures, the water-filled paths to the metal ion binding site are sealed from both sides of the membrane and bound ions would thus be segregated from their aqueous environment, although the occlusion toward the intracellular solution is more pronounced in DraNRAMP<sup>occ</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, D</xref>). In its binding site, the interacting transition metal ion in DraNRAMP<sup>occ</sup> is predominantly enclosed by protein residues except for one contact with a small pocket harboring trapped water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ray et al., 2023</xref>). The side chains of Asp 56 and Asn 59 on α1, in conjunction with the backbone carbonyls of Ala 53 and Ala 227, tightly surround the bound Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Additionally, the thioether group of Met 230 contributes a soft ligand for ion interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, a water-mediated interaction with the side chain of Gln 378 on α10 completes the octahedral coordination of the ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, the equivalent region in SiNRAT contains an elongated, approximately cylindrical pocket of predominant polar character that is about 10 Å long and 4–5 Å wide and that encloses a three times larger volume than in DraNRAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This pocket appears of sufficient size to mediate metal ion interactions with protein residues and surrounding water molecules. Despite the inability to pinpoint the exact location of bound ions, we find residues of the consensus binding site to line about half of this pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These include the previously mentioned Asp 66 and Ser 68, both bordering residual density in our cryo-EM data and the conserved Asn 69, all located on α1. On α6, the interacting residues include the conserved Ala 238, whose backbone carbonyl points toward the pocket and Thr 241, which replaces the conserved methionine in NRAMP transporters and whose side chain could contribute a hard ligand for either direct or water-mediated ion interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Distinct from DraNRAMP, the glutamine on α10 involved in ion binding is replaced by a serine (Ser 403), whose shorter side chain does not contact the aqueous pocket and thus would not be available for metal ion interactions. Instead, we find the acidic side chain of Asp 140 located on α3 to line the cavity, close to the predicted ion binding site, at a position that contains a threonine (Thr 130) in DraNRAMP. This acidic side chain, which is conserved in NRATs, would increase the negative charge density of the region by offering favorable coulombic interactions that stabilize the additional positive charge of Al<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, besides the replacement of the conserved methionine of the transition metal ion binding site, we find an expanded interaction region with increased polar character and negative charge density, which together may account for the altered substrate preference and stabilize trivalent cations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SiNRAT metal ion binding site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Selected parts of the SiNRAT ion binding region with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density superimposed.

In NRAMPs, H<sup>+</sup> transport was associated with acidic and basic residues located on the α-helices 1, 3, 6, and 9, most of which are replaced by hydrophobic side chains in NRMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bozzi et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bozzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).

To this end, we have put our focus on residues of the consensus binding site located on α-helices 1 and 6, whose equivalent positions were found to contribute to ion interaction in transition metal ion transporters of the SLC11 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). All investigated mutants were purified and either reconstituted into liposomes for uptake studies of Mn<sup>2+</sup> or used for ITC experiments in their detergent-solubilized form. Upon mutation of the residues Asp 66 or Asn 69 to alanine, we found a severely compromised transport of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, consistent with equivalent results obtained for other pro- and eukaryotic transition metal ion transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozzi et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). We next turned our attention toward Thr 241, which has substituted the conserved methionine found in transition metal ion transporters to provide a potential hard ligand for direct or water-mediated metal ion interactions. In this case, we have mutated the residue to alanine to truncate the side chain and valine to preserve its volume but remove its polar character. In both cases, we found a similar strong negative impact of the respective mutations on Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). For this residue, we were also interested in whether a mutation would affect interactions with trivalent cations and thus investigated binding of Al<sup>3+</sup> to the mutant T241V by ITC. Unlike WT, we did not detect any specific heat exchange, which emphasizes the importance of the residue for Al<sup>3+</sup> interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The absence of a detectable signal in T241V also underlines the correspondence of the ITC data of WT to Al<sup>3+</sup> binding to the consensus site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Finally, we have studied a mutation of Ser 68 to alanine, which concerns a residue that is unique to NRATs and which was found in the SiNRAT structure to contribute to potential ion interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unlike previous mutations, we did in this case not observe an obvious effect on Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport, which proceeds with similar kinetics as WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>) and whose transport is competed by the addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref>). Unlike WT, we did not detect a competition by Ga<sup>3+</sup> in equivalent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). We thus set out to investigate the binding of Al<sup>3+</sup> by ITC but did not find any indication for its interaction with the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>).

As one of the mechanisms to combat Al<sup>3+</sup> toxicity, certain plants have evolved a branch of the NRAMP family with altered substrate preference termed NRATs, which are capable of transporting the trivalent cation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xia et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, we have determined the structure and transport properties of the NRAT of <italic>Setaria italica</italic> termed SiNRAT. Using fluorescence-based in vitro transport assays from proteoliposomes containing the purified transporter, our study has characterized SiNRAT as a protein with broad substrate specificity. We have shown transport of different divalent cations such as Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> with micromolar K<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F, H</xref>). Although the direct assay of transport of trivalent ions such as Ga<sup>3+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup> was prohibited for technical reasons, we have demonstrated the interaction of SiNRAT with both ions, which defines them as plausible substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). However, due to their poor solubility under the assay conditions, these results are tentative and should be taken with caution. The broad substrate selectivity is consistent with previous experiments on the metal ion transporters EcoDMT and DraNRAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>) and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter EleNRMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). Attempts to change the transport properties of these proteins by mutagenesis, while deteriorating selectivity, have usually retained the capability of mutants to permeate Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>), whose transport appears to have lower structural requirements compared to other divalent cations. By the placement of a methionine contributing a soft ligand for transition metal ion interaction, the substrate binding site of classical NRAMPs has evolved to prevent interactions with alkaline earth metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This is illustrated in the mutation of this residue to alanine, which has turned Ca<sup>2+</sup> into a substrate without strongly affecting Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, NRMTs transport the small alkaline earth metal ion Mg<sup>2+</sup> by increasing the volume of their binding site to interact with the hydrated cation, without compromising Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). A comparable feature is observed for SiNRAT, where the protein appears to have evolved to transport trivalent cations without imposing a strong selection against divalent metal ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The SiNRAT structure has shed light into the basis for the altered selectivity of a transporter, whose evolutionary distance to classical NRAMPs is much smaller than to NRMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). Although, for technical reasons, our structure did not contain trivalent ions, we assigned their presumable binding region based on the structural equivalence to the transition metal ion transporters DraNRAMP and ScaDMT and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter EleNRMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ray et al., 2023</xref>). Residual density at the supposed location in the SiNRAT map provides further evidence for this assignment. Similar to NRMTs, and distinct from classical NRAMPs, the ion binding site of SiNRAT is embedded in a larger aqueous cavity, which offers direct metal ion interactions with protein residues and others that are mediated via hydrating waters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>). Unlike the inward-facing structure of EleNRMT, in the structure of SiNRAT, this cavity is sealed from both sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>). Within the canonical binding site of SiNRAT located on α1 and α6, several residues have been replaced to provide additional interactions and the presence of an extra acidic residue on α3 in interaction distance has presumably increased the negative charge density to compensate for the higher net charge of the transported ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In light of the described features, a proposed conversion of a classical plant NRAMP facilitating the transport of transition metals by the mutation of the consensus binding motif on α1 and α6 is likely insufficient to convert the protein into an efficient Al<sup>3+</sup> transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). A related attempt to convert Mg<sup>2+</sup> into a transported substrate of the prokaryotic metal ion transporter EcoDMT by introducing corresponding mutations found in NRMTs was unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramanadane et al., 2022</xref>), which emphasizes the relevance of residues outside a narrow signature region to confer substrate selectivity.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Selectivity and metal ion coordination in different clades of the SLC11 family.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coordination of Mn<sup>2+</sup> in transition metal ion transporters (NRAMPs) of the SLC11 family as defined in the occluded conformation of the prokaryotic DraNRAMP (PDBID: 8E60).

This apparently contradicting observation could reflect the distinct ways of how transport was assayed in both studies. We thus remain cautious with the assignment of substrates transported by NRATs in a physiological context, as the protein might not be efficient in concentrating Mn<sup>2+</sup> inside cells as a consequence of the absent coupling to an energy source. Still, in light of our data it is unclear how Al<sup>3+</sup> transport would proceed in presence of other divalent ions. Despite these ambiguities, our findings are in general agreement with a previous proposal that the NRAT-mediated uptake of Al<sup>3+</sup> into cells and its subsequent detoxification by complexation with organic anions and import into the vacuolar compartment would decrease its ability to interfere with cell wall integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xia et al., 2010</xref>). In summary, our study has provided the first structural insight into the transport of trivalent cations and it revealed the architecture of a protein that is part of the defense against Al<sup>3+</sup> toxicity in plants, which continues to be a large challenge for farming on acidic soil. Since it was previously shown that the increased expression of proteins involved in the regulation of aluminum toxicity can lead to better aluminum tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maron et al., 2013</xref>), it will be interesting to investigate whether the overexpression of NRATs would increase the tolerance of plants to elevated Al<sup>3+</sup> levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of EcoDMT</title><p>EcoDMT and its mutants were expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>).

DNA for transfection was purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> MC1061 cell line using the Nucleobond Xtra Maxi Kit (Macherey-Nagel); 1.3 µg DNA was used per 10<sup>6</sup> cells. For that purpose, the DNA was diluted to 16 µg/ml in a volume of non-supplemented DMEM corresponding to 1/14 of the transfected cell culture volume. In parallel, PEI-max 40 kDA was diluted to 0.04 mg/ml in the same volume of non-supplemented DMEM. The two solutions were mixed and after 15–20 min incubation, the final transfection mixture was added to the suspension cells. Finally, the cell culture was supplemented with 3 mM valproic acid. After 48–60 hr incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min and washed with PBS. All following steps of the purification were carried out at 4°C. The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer RES (200 mM NaCl, 50 mM KPi pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 40 µg/ml DNAse I, and protease inhibitor [Roche Complete, EDTA-free]). The protein was extracted by adding DDM (Anatrace) to a final concentration of 2%. After an incubation for 2 hr under gentle agitation, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 200,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded on Streptactin Superflow affinity resin (IBA Lifesciences) and incubated for 2 hr under gentle agitation. The resin was washed with 25 CV of buffer W (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7, 10% glycerol, 0.04% DDM) and eluted with 20 ml of buffer ELU (buffer W supplemented with 5 mM D-desthiobiotin). The eGFP-Myc-SBP tag was removed by adding HRV 3C protease at a 1:3 molar ratio with SiNRAT and incubated on ice for 1 hr. The protein was concentrated by centrifugation to 500 µl using a 50 kDa molecular weight cut-off concentrator (Amicon) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer SEC (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7, 0.04% DDM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Isothermal titration calorimetry</title><p>A MicroCal ITC200 system (GE Healthcare) was used for ITC experiments. All titrations were performed at 6°C in buffer SEC (200 mM NaCl, HEPES pH 7, 0.04% DDM). The syringe was filled with 1 mM AlCl<sub>3</sub> and the titration was initiated by the sequential injection of 2 μl aliquots into the cell filled with SiNRAT or mutants at a concentration of 30 μM. Data were analyzed with the Origin ITC analysis package and WT protein data were fitted using the integrated two sides model. Each experiment was repeated with independently purified protein samples with similar results.

The lipid mixture consisting of POPE, POPG, and EggPC (Avanti Polar Lipids) at a weight ratio of 3:1:1 was washed with diethylether and dried under a nitrogen stream and by exsiccation overnight. The dried lipids were resuspended into 100 mM KCl and 20 mM HEPES pH 7. After three freeze-thaw cycles, the lipids were extruded through a 400 nm polycarbonate filter (Avestin, LiposoFast-BAsic) and aliquoted into samples at a concentration of 45 mg/ml. The extruded lipids were destabilized by addition of Triton X-100 and the protein was reconstituted at a protein to lipid ratio of 1:50. After several incubation steps with biobeads SM-2 (Bio-Rad), the proteoliposomes were harvested the next day, resuspended in 100 mM KCl and 20 mM HEPES pH 7, and stored at –80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescence-based substrate transport assays</title><p>The proteoliposomes were incubated with buffer IN (100 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7, containing either 250 μM Calcein (Invitrogen), 100 μM Fura-2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), or 400 μM MagGreen (Thermo Fisher Scientific) depending on the assayed ion). After three cycles of freeze-thawing, the liposomes were extruded through a 400 nm filter and the proteoliposomes were centrifuged and washed three times with buffer IN not containing any fluorophores. The proteoliposomes were subsequently diluted to 0.025 mg/ml in buffer OUT (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7) and aliquoted in 100 μl batches into a 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the fluorescence was measured every 4 s using a Tecan Infinite M1000 fluorimeter. An inside negative membrane potential was generated by addition of valinomycin to a final concentration of 100 nM. After 20 cycles of incubation, the substrate was added at different concentrations. The transport reaction was terminated by addition of calcimycin or ionomycin at a final concentration of 100 nM. The initial rate of transport was calculated by linear regression within the initial 100 s of transport after addition of the substrate. The calculated values were fitted to a Michaelis-Menten equation. Fura-2 was used to assay the transport of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. For detection, the ratio between calcium bound Fura-2 (λ<sub>ex</sub> = 340 nm; λ<sub>em</sub> = 510 nm) and unbound Fura-2 (λ<sub>ex</sub> = 380 nm; λ<sub>em</sub> = 510 nm) was monitored during kinetic measurements. Calcein was used to assay the transport of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (λ<sub>ex</sub> = 492 nm; λ<sub>em</sub> = 518 nm) and Magnesium Green was to assay the transport of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (λ<sub>ex</sub> = 506 nm; λ<sub>em</sub> = 531 nm).</p><p>For assaying coupled proton transport, the proteoliposomes were mixed with buffer 1 (100 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES pH 7, 50 μM ACMA). After clarification by sonication, the proteoliposomes were diluted to a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml in buffer 2 (100 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES pH 7) and aliquoted into batches of 100 μl into a flat black 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The fluorescence was measured every 4 s using a Tecan Infinite M1000 fluorimeter (λ<sub>ex</sub> = 412 nm; λ<sub>em</sub> = 482 nm). The transport reaction was initiated after addition of the substrate and valinomycin at a final concentration of 100 nM. The reaction was terminated by addition of CCCP at 100 nM. For experiments involving Ga<sup>3+</sup>, GaI<sub>3</sub> was used. For compensation, NaI was added to reach a final I-concentration of 45 µM, which did not exert any effect on the measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Generation of nanobodies specific to SiNRAT</title><p>SiNRAT-specific nanobodies were generated using a method described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, an alpaca was immunized four times with 200 µg of detergent-solubilized SiNRAT (in intervals of four weeks). Two days after the final injection, the peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated, and the RNA total fraction was extracted and converted into cDNA by reverse transcription. The nanobody library was amplified and cloned into the phage display pDX vector (Invitrogen). After two rounds of phage display, ELISA assays were performed on the periplasmic extract of 198 individual clones. A single nanobody was identified. For all steps of phage display and ELISA, SiNRAT was chemically biotinylated using an EZ-Link NHS-PEG4 Biotinylation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and bound to neutravidin-coated plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fairhead and Howarth, 2015</xref>) .

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Randy B Stockbridge as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Motoyuki Hattori (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 is missing and should be included.</p><p>2. The reviewers ask that the authors provide additional discussion on the following points:</p><p>a. Could the authors describe whether attempts were made to collect a cryo-EM dataset with divalent or trivalent metals (Mn<sup>2+</sup>, ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Al3+, or Ga3+) present, and what the results were?</p><p>b. The result that passive metal transport (uptake) is protective against high environmental aluminum is counterintuitive. However, the proposal (suggested by divalent metal transport) is in line with the model from the previous literature (the Xia et al. reference cited in the manuscript) in which these proteins prevent aluminum disruption of the cell wall by transporting it to the cytoplasm where it can be more effectively sequestered. Could the authors add some text to the discussion explaining this uptake-followed-by-detoxification model, which the current results seem to support?</p><p>c. What, if anything, is known about the pH dependence of this transporter? Presumably lower pH values (i.e. pH 5.5) are more physiologically relevant and would favor Al3+, simplifying the binding analysis. Did the authors attempt experiments in this range?</p><p>d. The authors justify a lack of Al3+ transport data by explaining how this ion is disruptive to membranes. If this is true, it raises a fundamental question how is this transporter able to work in a physiological environment and how are cells membranes able to withstand physiological levels of Al3+ when reconstituted proteoliposomes are not?</p><p>e. Based on the cryo-EM structure of the SiNRAT-Nb1 complex, please provide a possible explanation for the partial inhibition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport by Nb1.</p><p>3. The reviewers had some questions about some of the structural interpretations, which should be addressed in the text:</p><p>a. The text states that a shorter side chain for Ser403 in SiNRAT – compared to a Gln in DraNRAMP – would make an impact on metal binding. However, the earlier statement that the backbone carbonyl is responsible for the relevant interaction presents a contradiction.</p><p>b. Thr241 is part of a signature sequence that distinguishes the NRAT clade and the importance of this residue is confirmed by mutagenesis. However, the coordinates provides show a rotamer with the oxygen atom pointing away from the ion binding site, which seems inconsistent with its presumed role.</p><p>c. There are elongated EM densities at the cavity composed of alpha10-alpha12, which may be derived from lipid molecules. Could the authors please add a comment on this putative lipid binding?</p><p>d. The general description of the SiNRAT structure includes a comparison with EcoDMT, but this is not shown in the figures. Such a comparison would be useful to illustrate the disposition of alpha11 and alpha12. RMSD values are cited, but it is not clear if this calculation applies to Calpha atoms only. Finally, Figure 3 shows superposition with 6C3I but the text refers to 8E60, which is not yet released by the PDB.</p><p>4. The clarity of figures 3 and 4 should be improved according to the following suggestions:</p><p>a. The structural nature of the occluded state is not well depicted in the figures (perhaps this was shown in the missing Figure 3 supplement). The authors state that the substrate-binding pocket is larger for SiNRAT, but the size is not depicted and it is not clear if this conclusion is based on a quantitative measurement or just a visual inspection of the site.</p><p>b. In Figures 3c, 4b, and 4c, the inset is not well-distinguished from the main part of the figure. This could be solved easily by adding a dashed box around the inset in order to better distinguish it from the main part of the figure.</p><p>5. In the first paragraph of the Discussion, the authors say that they have shown the transport of Mn, Ca, and Mg with μM Km. This is not accurate as they have only shown the transport of Mn and have not measured Km for Ca and Mg. This raises the question of why the authors do not quantitate rates for Ca and Mg-based on the data shown in Figure 1 E and F, which should provide at least a rough estimate of Km. In addition, please provide the error value for the KM of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (Page 6, lines 96-98).</p><p>6. Page 54, Figure 6. Please provide a figure for the sequence alignment on the metal binding sites in alpha1 and alpha6 using several NRAMP, NRMT, and NRAT proteins.</p><p>7. The discussion of proton-coupling (pages 9-10) is too vague and speculative without experimental evidence to support these proposals. This section should be shortened/removed since the molecular basis for the lack of proton coupling is still unknown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Enthusiasm for the story is dampened somewhat by the uncertainty of the density in the binding site. I imagine the specific sidechains would rearrange considerably if the density is water vs. a Na<sup>+</sup> vs a residual divalent. Did the authors try to collect a cryo-EM dataset with transition metals (Mn<sup>2+</sup>, ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, or Ga3+) present?</p><p>2. Lack of information about the structure or function at lower pH values seems like an important gap in understanding the system. From a physiological perspective, Al3+ is the predominant species in low-pH environments, and aluminum remediation is especially important in low-pH environments, so it's possible that the conformation and transport activity at pH 5 or 5.5 might be more physiologically relevant than at pH 7 or 7.5. (Lower pH would also likely simplify the ITC experiments). From a biophysical perspective, given the density of the negative charge in the aqueous chamber, it is plausible that Asps are protonated, even at pH 7 or 7.5. The role of pH in substrate binding might therefore be mechanistically important as well.</p><p>3. For a transporter person, the suggestion that a passive transporter could be useful for providing resistance against environmental aluminum is confusing. I anticipated that aluminum export would be the desired transport function. However, it seems like this counterintuitive result is in line with the model from the previous literature (the Xia et al. reference cited in the ms) in which these proteins prevent aluminum disruption of the cell wall by transporting it to the cytoplasm where it can be more effectively sequestered. To make this more intuitive to people who think about ion gradients, could the authors add some text to the discussion explaining this uptake followed by the detoxification model, which the current results seem to support? Could the authors also comment on whether NRATs are broadly distributed in plants, or whether they are only found in a subset?</p><p>4. There are a number of figures with insets where I was confused about whether I was looking at a component of the main figure or an inset (Figure 3c, 4b, 4c). This could be solved easily by adding a dashed box or something around the inset in order to better distinguish it from the main part of the figure.</p><p>5. Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 is missing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While I highly recommend this work for publication, there are a few concerns to be addressed before publication.</p><p>1. Page 6, Lines 96-98. &quot;Transport is strongly dependent on the Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentration and saturates with an apparent KM of 13 µM reflecting the binding of the transported substrate to a saturable site (Figure 1A, B).&quot;</p><p>Please show the error value for KM.</p><p>2.

As mentioned in the text, the structure determination of SiNRAT was challenging and has required the binding of a nanobody and the reconstitution of the protein into amphipols, since previous efforts to determine the structure of the SiNRAT/nanobody complex in detergents did not permit reconstruction at high resolution. The clearly most instructive structure would be in complex with its substrate Al<sup>3+</sup>. However, due to the small mass of Al<sup>3+</sup>, it would likely not be resolved at the obtained resolution of the data, as we experienced in structures of other transport proteins determined in our lab. Moreover, even in complex structures where we were able to resolve bound ions, these had to be supplemented at high concentration (several times above their respective K<sub>M</sub>). Due to the low solubility of trivalent ions at neutral pH, this would have required a decrease of the pH, which leads to the dissociation of the nanobody.</p><p>We have added a sentence to the results (lines 163-165):</p><p>“Due to the challenges associated with the amphipol reconstitution process, the sample used for imaging did not contain transported ions. In case of trivalent ions, this would have required a lowering of the pH to increase their solubility, which was incompatible with nanobody binding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

What, if anything, is known about the pH dependence of this transporter? Presumably lower pH values (i.e. pH 5.5) are more physiologically relevant and would favor Al3+, simplifying the binding analysis. Did the authors attempt experiments in this range?</p></disp-quote><p>We noticed a stabilization of SiNRAT at lower pH but refrained from transport experiments under such conditions as the pH alters the fluorescence properties of the employed metal-sensitive fluorophores. We also want to emphasize that H<sup>+</sup>-coupled transition metal ion transporters of the SLC11/NRAMP family, assayed under the same conditions, show robust transport properties, despite the fact that, in a cellular environment, their extracellular side would face a lower pH. Similarly, in our assays with SiNRAT, we observe pronounced activity for the investigated divalent ions already at neutral pH. We thus suppose that the lowering of the pH would exert its predominant effect on the solubility of the trivalent ions Al<sup>3+</sup> and Ga<sup>3+</sup>, which we were not able to assay directly and where we noticed an effect of the pH decrease on trivalent ion-mediated leakiness of proteoliposomes.</p><p>With respect to ITC, we want to emphasize the technical challenges associated with the use of this technique for poorly expressed eukaryotic membrane proteins. In this method, the measured signal depends on the enthalpic contribution of the binding event for detection. In case of a lower pH, we noticed a severe decrease of the exchanged heat, which presumably originates from the lower binding enthalpy. We thus clearly acknowledge the limited insight of our assays for trivalent ion binding and transport in our manuscript.</p><p>Line 96-99:</p><p>“Although, in a physiological context, SiNRAT presumably operates at mildly acidic extracellular conditions (i.e., at a pH &lt; 5.5), all transport experiments were carried out at neutral pH since this resulted in maximum proteoliposome stability and highest sensitivity of the employed fluorophores.”</p><p>Line 121-124:</p><p>“Thus, despite the low solubility of Ga<sup>3+</sup> under the assayed conditions (Yu and Liao, 2011), which obscures a definitive assignment of its concentration dependence, our results suggest a specific effect of the ion on SiNRAT-mediated transport.”</p><p>Line 127-133:</p><p>“However, at the neutral pH of the sample, the trivalent ion is at equilibrium with its hydroxyl complexes, which complicates data analysis. The thermograms were thus best fitted to a sum of two binding constants, both in the low μM range (Figure 1I). Although precluding a definitive mechanistic interpretation, we use the ITC results of Al<sup>3+</sup> binding as a qualitative assay of its interaction with SiNRAT and show later that the event is directly associated with its binding to the site that is relevant for ion transport.”</p><p>Line 313-317:</p><p>“Although the direct assay of transport of trivalent ions such as Ga<sup>3+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup> was prohibited by technical limitations, we have demonstrated the interaction of SiNRAT with both ions, which defines them as plausible substrates (Figure 1G-I). However, due to the poor solubility of these trivalent metal ions under the assay conditions, these results are tentative and should be taken with caution.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The authors justify a lack of Al3+ transport data by explaining how this ion is disruptive to membranes. If this is true, it raises a fundamental question how is this transporter able to work in a physiological environment and how are cells membranes able to withstand physiological levels of Al3+ when reconstituted proteoliposomes are not?</p></disp-quote><p>We have noticed a concentration-dependent non-specific leak in experiments assaying the competition of Mn<sup>2+</sup> by Al<sup>3+</sup> already at low µM Al<sup>3+</sup> concentrations. The same effect was also observed in mock-reconstituted control liposomes, which has prohibited any competition experiments with Al<sup>3+</sup>. This corroborates the described properties of Al<sup>3+</sup> to interfere with membrane integrity (presumably by forming tight complexes with the phosphate groups). However, it should be emphasized that the detailed stability properties of a liposome and the membrane of a plant cell presumably differ and are influenced by the exact lipid composition and the properties of the surrounding cell-wall.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e.

The reviewers had some questions about some of the structural interpretations, which should be addressed in the text:</p><p>a. The text states that a shorter side chain for Ser403 in SiNRAT – compared to a Gln in DraNRAMP – would make an impact on metal binding. However, the earlier statement that the backbone carbonyl is responsible for the relevant interaction presents a contradiction.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a mistake in our original manuscript. It is the side-chain of Gln 378 in DraNRAMP, not its backbone, which interacts with the bound ion in DraNRAMP (presumably via a bound water as shown in Figure 4C). The shortened sidechain of Ser 403 does not contact the aqueous cavity and we thus suppose that it would not be involved in either direct or indirect ion interactions.</p><p>We have introduced the correction line 228-229:</p><p>“Finally, a water-mediated interaction with the side chain of Gln 378 on α10 completes the octahedral coordination of the ion (Figure 4C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Thr241 is part of a signature sequence that distinguishes the NRAT clade and the importance of this residue is confirmed by mutagenesis. However, the coordinates provides show a rotamer with the oxygen atom pointing away from the ion binding site, which seems inconsistent with its presumed role.</p></disp-quote><p>The resolution of the map is insufficient to define the correct rotamer of the threonine with certainty. We have changed it such that the hydroxyl faces the aqueous cavity. However, due to the uncertain definitive position of the bound ion, we do not know whether it would engage in direct or water-mediated interactions. We also cannot exclude a local reorientation upon metal binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. There are elongated EM densities at the cavity composed of alpha10-alpha12, which may be derived from lipid molecules.

We also do not think that this lipid would be of direct functional relevance.</p><p>Legend to Figure 2 line 809-810:</p><p>“A, B Proteins are shown in unique colors, the density of a bound lipid with uncertain orientation in A is shown in grey.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The general description of the SiNRAT structure includes a comparison with EcoDMT, but this is not shown in the figures. Such a comparison would be useful to illustrate the disposition of alpha11 and alpha12. RMSD values are cited, but it is not clear if this calculation applies to Calpha atoms only. Finally, Figure 3 shows superposition with 6C3I but the text refers to 8E60, which is not yet released by the PDB.</p></disp-quote><p>The superposition of SiNRAT and EcoDMT is now provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 4B. The RMSD was calculated based on Cα-positions. It is at that stage not clear in how much the observed α11-12 conformation would be influenced by the nanobody as there are currently no other structures of family members containing 12 α-helices available, which reside in an occluded conformation. However, since the respective α-helices 11 in the occluded conformations of SiNRAT at EcoNRAMP are close (Figure 3B), we do not expect a pronounced influence of the bound nanobody on helix conformation.

The clarity of figures 3 and 4 should be improved according to the following suggestions:</p><p>a. The structural nature of the occluded state is not well depicted in the figures (perhaps this was shown in the missing Figure 3 supplement). The authors state that the substrate-binding pocket is larger for SiNRAT, but the size is not depicted and it is not clear if this conclusion is based on a quantitative measurement or just a visual inspection of the site.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now tried to better document this property in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 D, where a section through the molecular surface (grey) and the surface of the occluded cavity (magenta) are displayed. We have also quantified the volume of the binding site and found it three times larger in SiNRAT (6,071 Å<sup>3</sup>) compared to DraNRAMP (2,404 Å<sup>3</sup>). It was also emphasized that in DraNRAMP, the bound ion is only in contact with the aqueous cavity on one side where a water molecule presumably occupies one of the coordination sites, whereas in SiNRAT the pocket appears to be located in the center of the presumed anion binding site, potentially providing room for additional solvent-mediated interactions. However, since the described structure was obtained in absence of transported ions, this remains at this stage hypothetical.</p><p>We have rephrased the text: Line 223-225</p><p>“In its binding site, the interacting transition metal ion in DraNRAMP<sup>occ</sup> is predominantly enclosed by protein residues except for one contact with a small pocket harboring trapped water molecules.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. In Figures 3c, 4b, and 4c, the inset is not well-distinguished from the main part of the figure.

In the first paragraph of the Discussion, the authors say that they have shown the transport of Mn, Ca, and Mg with μM Km. This is not accurate as they have only shown the transport of Mn and have not measured Km for Ca and Mg.

Additionally, it should be emphasized that, due to the comparably low affinity of the fluorophore Magnesium Green for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, it is unclear whether the observed concentration dependence reflects the saturation of the binding site of the transporter, which we have stated in the legend to the figure panel.

The discussion of proton-coupling (pages 9-10) is too vague and speculative without experimental evidence to support these proposals. This section should be shortened/removed since the molecular basis for the lack of proton coupling is still unknown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shortened the paragraph concerning residues with potential relevance for proton transport in the results and removed this point in the discussion. However, there is ample of literature on proton coupling in classical transition metal ion transporters of the SLC11/NRAMP family, which points towards an involvement of the described residues. Similar to our previous study on the NRAMP-related Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter EleNRMT, our data did not provide any evidence for H<sup>+</sup> coupling in SiNRAT. In our previous manuscript, we have ascribed this to the altered properties of the presumed proton-pathway, which included the replacement of the conserved His on α6 and alterations of the polar region between the proximal acidic and basic residues on α3 and α9. Whereas former is also replaced in SiNRAT, most of the latter residues are found in its structure at equivalent positions. While we do not want to draw definitive conclusions, we still think that these structural features deserve to be described, particularly in relation to the manuscript our work refers to.</p><p>We have moved the panels showing the described regions to a figure supplement (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and added the equivalent region of EleNRMT for comparison.</p><p>Line 253-267:</p><p>“Although the detailed mechanism of H<sup>+</sup> coupling in the SLC11/NRAMP family is still a matter of debate, there are remarkable structural differences between classical H<sup>+</sup>-coupled metal ion transporters, SiNRAT, and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter EleNRMT, (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). In NRAMPs, H<sup>+</sup> transport was associated with acidic and basic residues located on the α-helices 1, 3, 6, and 9, most of which are replaced by hydrophobic sidechains in NRMTs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C). In contrast, many of these residues are conserved in NRATs, which are evolutionally closer to NRAMPs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). A pronounced difference between NRATs and NRAMPs concerns the substitution of a conserved histidine on α6b (i.e., His 232 in DraNRAMP with a tyrosine (Tyr 243 in SiNRAT)), whereas the equivalent position in NRMTs is occupied by a tryptophane (<italic>i.e</italic>, W229 in EleNRMT) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1). However, the exact relation of the described structural features to the observed transport mechanism is still unclear and requires further investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Enthusiasm for the story is dampened somewhat by the uncertainty of the density in the binding site. I imagine the specific sidechains would rearrange considerably if the density is water vs. a Na<sup>+</sup> vs a residual divalent. Did the authors try to collect a cryo-EM dataset with transition metals (Mn<sup>2+</sup>, ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, or Ga3+) present?</p></disp-quote><p>See response 2. We did not investigate complexes of transported ions for the described reasons. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of local sidechain rearrangements upon ion binding this does not necessarily have to be pronounced. E. g., we did not find an obvious rearrangement (at the resolution of the data) in our initial structure of the prototypic SLC11 transporter ScaDMT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Lack of information about the structure or function at lower pH values seems like an important gap in understanding the system. From a physiological perspective, Al3+ is the predominant species in low-pH environments, and aluminum remediation is especially important in low-pH environments, so it's possible that the conformation and transport activity at pH 5 or 5.5 might be more physiologically relevant than at pH 7 or 7.5. (Lower pH would also likely simplify the ITC experiments). From a biophysical perspective, given the density of the negative charge in the aqueous chamber, it is plausible that Asps are protonated, even at pH 7 or 7.5. The role of pH in substrate binding might therefore be mechanistically important as well.</p></disp-quote><p>See response 2c. We have explained why we refrained from transport experiments at low pH above. In any case, in a cellular environment, the low pH would only be experienced on one side (outside) and robust transport properties were observed at neutral pH for all coupled and uncoupled transporters of the SLC11/NRAMP family. We thus do not necessarily expect a qualitative different behavior under such conditions. ITC experiments at low pH have led to a decrease of the signal, probably as a consequence of the decreased binding enthalpy at these conditions. Although we cannot exclude a change in the protonation of any of the acidic residues in the binding site, their pK<sub>a</sub> would have to be perturbed to be protonated at pH 5.5 and their negative charge would presumably be further stabilized by the bound cation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For a transporter person, the suggestion that a passive transporter could be useful for providing resistance against environmental aluminum is confusing. I anticipated that aluminum export would be the desired transport function. However, it seems like this counterintuitive result is in line with the model from the previous literature (the Xia et al. reference cited in the ms) in which these proteins prevent aluminum disruption of the cell wall by transporting it to the cytoplasm where it can be more effectively sequestered. To make this more intuitive to people who think about ion gradients, could the authors add some text to the discussion explaining this uptake followed by the detoxification model, which the current results seem to support? Could the authors also comment on whether NRATs are broadly distributed in plants, or whether they are only found in a subset?</p></disp-quote><p>We have mentioned that the abundance of NRATs is scarce (we essentially only identified 7 orthologues). We have explicitly mentioned the work by Xia but prefer to refrain from a discussion of potential physiological mechanisms, as this is not topic of our study.
