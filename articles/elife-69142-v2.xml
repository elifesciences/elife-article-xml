process in biology. Gene perturbation screens could provide a powerful approach to probe the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking, but only if protein localization or mislocalization can be tied to a simple and robust phenotype for cell selection, such as cell proliferation or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To empower the study of protein trafficking processes with gene perturbation, we developed a genetically encoded molecular tool named HiLITR (High-throughput Localization Indicator with Transcriptional Readout). HiLITR converts protein colocalization into proteolytic release of a membrane-anchored transcription factor, which drives the expression of a chosen reporter gene. Using HiLITR in combination with FACS-based CRISPRi screening in human cell lines, we identified genes that influence the trafficking of mitochondrial and ER tail-anchored proteins. We show that loss of the SUMO E1 component SAE1 results in mislocalization and destabilization of many mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins. We also demonstrate a distinct regulatory role for EMC10 in the ER membrane complex, opposing the transmembrane-domain insertion activity of the complex. Through transcriptional integration of complex cellular functions, HiLITR expands the scope of biological processes that can be studied by genetic perturbation screening technologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein engineering</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>high-throughput screens</kwd><kwd>tail-anchored proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH119353</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>Alice Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2HD084069-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassik</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1656518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011098</institution-id><institution>Stanford Bio-X</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coukos</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000161</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Standards and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coukos</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2T32HG000044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coukos</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HiLITR is a molecular reporter of protein localization that enables straightforward, large-scale, fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based discovery of genes that regulate complex cellular processes, such as mitochondrial and ER tail-anchored protein trafficking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene perturbation screens, in which libraries of cells bearing individual genetic perturbations are assessed for fitness, growth, or other phenotypes, have been broadly applied to uncover the genetic bases of specific cellular processes. For example, CRISPR-based knockout screens have identified essential human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), discovered factors that confer drug or toxin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), and dissected signaling and regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parnas et al., 2015</xref>). In general, gene perturbation screens can be implemented in either pooled or arrayed formats. Pooled screens simplify the handling of large libraries with &gt;10<sup>5</sup> unique elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kampmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), but require that the cellular function of interest be coupled to a simple readout, such as cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kory et al., 2018</xref>) or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeJesus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Potting et al., 2018</xref>). Arrayed screens, on the other hand, are well-suited to complex readouts, such as high-content or time-lapse microscopy, and have been used to discover factors that regulate cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neumann et al., 2010</xref>), endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liberali et al., 2014</xref>), and membrane protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krumpe et al., 2012</xref>). However, compared to pooled screens, arrayed screens are usually noisier, limited to smaller libraries (10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup>), and are more technically difficult and time-consuming to implement, requiring specialized instrumentation not available to all laboratories.</p><p>To combine the strengths of the pooled screen format (library size, simplicity) and the arrayed screen format (versatility in readout), we sought to develop a molecular reporter capable of converting complex cellular processes such as protein trafficking or mislocalization into a simple, single-timepoint, intensity-based FACS readout. Such a tool would enable screening of large libraries in a pooled format without sacrificing the versatility and specificity required to probe more complex cellular processes.</p><p>Here we report HiLITR (High-throughput Localization Indicator with Transcriptional Readout), a molecular tool that converts protein localization or mislocalization into simple expression of a fluorescent protein. We used HiLITR in combination with a human CRISPRi library to screen for factors that regulate the trafficking of mitochondrial and ER membrane (ERM) proteins. We found that knockdown of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E1 ligase component SAE1 selectively destabilizes and increases the mislocalization of many mitochondrial tail-anchored (TA) proteins. Additionally, we found that knockdown of the EMC10 subunit of the ER membrane complex (EMC) increases insertion of specific TA proteins into the ERM, in opposition to the function of other EMC components.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HiLITR is a live-cell transcriptional reporter of protein localization</title><p>To design HiLITR, we needed a mechanism to convert protein localization or mislocalization in live cells to a simple readout for pooled genetic screens. We designed two protein components – a protease (GFP-TEVp) and a transcription factor (TF), each targetable to specific subcellular locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). If the protease and TF are colocalized to the same organelle (e.g., the mitochondrial membrane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), then proximity-dependent proteolysis of a protease cleavage sequence (TEVcs) in the TF’s membrane anchor releases the TF, which can translocate to the nucleus and drive expression of a chosen reporter gene. If the protease and TF are not colocalized, then TF cleavage and reporter gene expression will not occur.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HiLITR gives transcriptional readout of protein localization in living cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of HiLITR.

The HiLITR protease is under the expression of a doxycycline inducible promoter to avoid prolonged stable expression of both HiLITR components and to enable cell culturing in ambient light prior to induction of the protease. Reducing the protease expression time window from 40 hr to 16 hr prior to light stimulation improved the signal to noise ratio between the light and dark states from 2.3-fold to 4.9-fold with 2 min of light stimulation, with only ~10% reduction in activation in the light state (<bold>A, B</bold>). Varying the concentration of doxycycline used to induce protease expression had a modest impact on HiLITR activation, the proportion of protease-positive cells, and total protease expression (<bold>C, D</bold>). Next, we asked how HiLITR performance varied with light stimulation time. By varying light stimulation time from 0 to 10 min, we found that we could achieve robust HiLITR activation with the mitochondrial protease while maintaining low background with the ER and cytosolic proteases with just 2–5 min of light stimulation time (<bold>E, F</bold>). In this experiment, 2 min of light stimulation gave a ±light signal to noise ratio of 7× and a ±colocalization signal ratio of 35× (activation of HiLITR mito TF with mitochondrial vs. ER protease). To improve light vs. dark signal to noise, we considered that in the heterogenous population of cells, there were likely some cells that produced light-independent cleavage and other cells that never produced TF cleavage under even extended light stimulation. Reducing cell-to-cell variability is desirable in gene-perturbation studies, so we generated clonal cell lines for testing. We identified a clonal population that gave only 1.7% activation in the dark state but 63% activation with 2 min of light stimulation (<bold>G</bold>), a signal to noise ratio of 37×. Because this clone showed lower activation in the dark state and higher activation in the light state than the heterogeneous population, we reasoned that it must represent an intermediate level of HiLITR sensitivity. Finally, we tested the change in HiLITR readout with respect to time of reporter expression after light stimulation. In large screens, time of FACS sorting is non-negligible, so it is important to have a readout that is stable with time. With our clonal line, we found that a minimum of 8 hr is required for robust reporter expression, and reporter levels are stable between 8 and 20 hr post-stimulation (<bold>H, I</bold>). It is likely that keeping cell samples on ice after 8 hr of reporter expression further stabilized total reporter levels in our high-throughput screens.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69142-fig1-figsupp3-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s4" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</label><caption><title>Additional characterization of HiLITR constructs and cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence microscopy of stably-integrated HiLITR components used in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.

For the ER screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we sought to generate a mutant tail-anchored mitochondrial protease with a greater propensity to mistarget to the ER. To do this, we considered the features of tail-anchored proteins which promote ER vs. mitochondrial targeting. Tail-anchor sequences of native ER proteins tend to be longer, more hydrophobic, and have fewer basic flanking residues than mitochondrial tail-anchor sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beilharz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costello et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horie et al., 2002</xref>). We found that neutralizing just one of three positive residues flanking the transmembrane domain in our MAVS-based mito TA protease produced detectable mislocalization to the ER and Golgi (mutant 1, <bold>D, E</bold>), while other mutations disrupted mitochondrial localization too severely (<bold>D</bold>). Note that localization of protease variants in (<bold>D</bold>) to the Golgi and plasma membrane is a consequence of further trafficking after initial insertion at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgese et al., 2019</xref>). We selected mutant 1, a MAVS-R537A mutant of the mito TA construct (‘mTA* protease,’ <bold>D</bold>) for our ER screen. The additional mutant constructs are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>Figure summary - HiLITR at the peroxisomal membrane. As part of our HiLITR panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, we also tested the mitochondrial TF and ER-TF against a peroxisomal protease (localization in <bold>F</bold>). As expected, there was no HiLITR activation with the ER-TF by the peroxisomal protease (<bold>G</bold>). Interestingly, the peroxisomal protease did induce mild HiLITR activation with the mitochondrial TF (<bold>G</bold>). This may be due to mitochondria-peroxisome contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), which could produce crosstalk between protease and TF constructs on neighboring membranes. We also attempted to generate a HiLITR TF for the peroxisomal membrane. Unfortunately, despite testing numerous fusion constructs incorporating both short targeting domains and full-length peroxisomal proteins, we observed leak to non-peroxisome locations in HeLa cells. Our most cleanly targeted peroxisomal TF fusion was based on full-length PMP34, but still showed obvious mistargeting to non-peroxisomal compartments (<bold>F</bold>). Peroxisomes are formed in a process that involves both the ER and the mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sugiura et al., 2017</xref>), and many peroxisome membrane proteins insert at one or both locations, to be subsequently trafficked into newly derived peroxisomes. It is likely that overexpression of the peroxisomal TF construct produces pools of TF on the mitochondria and/or ER that are too abundant to be efficiently concentrated into nascent peroxisomal membranes. The phenomenon of peroxisomal fusion constructs mislocalizing to the mitochondria or ER has been previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sugiura et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the incomplete targeting of the peroxisomal TF to the peroxisome, we observed HiLITR activation when our peroxisomal TF was paired with the peroxisomal, mitochondrial, or ER proteases (<bold>G</bold>). HiLITR activation with the mitochondrial protease was slightly greater than with the peroxisomal protease, which is likely a result of higher expression of the mitochondrial protease relative to the peroxisomal protease, as well as the mislocalization of the peroxisomal TF. Importantly, cytosolic protease did not activate reporter expression with the peroxisomal TF (<bold>G</bold>), indicating that colocalization is still a requirement for TF release.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69142-fig1-figsupp4-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s5" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 5.</label><caption><title>Model selection on K562 cells expressing mitochondrial transcription factor (TF) HiLITR.</title><p>Same as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, except that cells expressing mitochondrial protease (colocalized with TF) are combined with cells expressing ER protease (rather than cytosolic protease as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

The LOV domain sterically blocks protease cleavage in the dark, but changes conformation to provide access under blue light illumination. HiLITR therefore acts as an AND gate, requiring both protease/TF colocalization and blue light to turn on. This two-gate design improves the dynamic range, temporal precision, and tunability compared to a one-gate design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To test HiLITR, we generated a TF construct targeting the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and protease constructs targeting the OMM, ERM, or cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Replacement of the Gal4 TF with a more active Gal4-VP64 fusion also improved signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G and H</xref>).

We also saw clear activation of OMM-TF by OMM protease but not by ERM protease or cytosolic protease. The absence of cross-reactivity is striking given that mitochondria and ER form contacts in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Perhaps the fraction of HiLITR TF localized to these contact sites is very small compared to the total amount of TF on the OMM or ERM surface, such that the contribution of ER-mitochondria contacts to HiLITR activation is insignificant.

There are several interesting results to emerge from the whole-genome screen. First, our top hit, PGK1, is an artifact of using the PGK1 promoter upstream of HiLITR TF in the expression vector (the PGK1 promoter drives an antibiotic resistance gene, not the TF itself). Therefore, sgRNAs against PGK1 have off-target effects that silence the TF expression, giving a profound reduction in HiLITR activation. Interestingly, the second and third most significant hits, RBM12 and CPNE1, share a promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). sgRNAs targeting RBM12 will knock down CPNE1, and vice versa, so it is encouraging that knockdown of RMB12 and CPNE1 produce very similar results. Before the three sublibrary screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>), we performed follow-up on a few hits from the whole-genome screen. Two of these hits, VPS13D and TTC1, showed profound defects in mitochondrial morphology when knocked down by CRISPRi (<bold>B</bold>). VPS13D plays a role in organelle-to-organelle contact and bulk lipid transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao and Yang, 2018</xref>), and the effect of its depletion on mitochondrial morphology has previously been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anding et al., 2018</xref>). TTC1 is a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain-containing protein that binds to both HSP70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 1999</xref>) and HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liou and Wang, 2005</xref>). Despite the general mitochondrial defects we observed, however, knockdown of VPS13D or TTC1 did not produce measurable changes in the colocalization of an endogenous mitochondrial tail-anchored (TA) protein (MAVS) with a mitochondrial marker, TOMM20 (<bold>B</bold>). After we performed the three sublibrary screens, we checked the results for VPS13D and TTC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). While VPS13D has been observed to disrupt mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anding et al., 2018</xref>), it has not been found to disrupt the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seong et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, VPS13D knockdown decreased HiLITR activation in the TA and signal-anchored (SA) screens, but not the ER screen. Likewise, TTC1 knockdown decreased HiLITR activation in only the TA and SA screens. We speculate that VPS13D and TTC1 may have some functional relationship to each other.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69142-fig2-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>A myriad of proteins function at the OMM and ERM, localized via signal-anchored (SA), TA, internal, and multipass transmembrane domains.

For example, the mechanisms by which tail-anchored mitochondrial proteins are delivered and inserted into the OMM are unclear. There are about 40 human mitochondrial TA proteins, including the apoptosis regulators BAX and BCL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wolter et al., 1997</xref>) and mitochondrial fission proteins FIS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yoon et al., 2003</xref>) and MFF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008</xref>). The targeting of TA proteins presents a unique challenge because their hydrophobic transmembrane domains are translated last and must be handed off from the ribosome to appropriate chaperones or lipids before aggregation or misfolding can occur. It is known that the GET/transmembrane recognition complex (TRC) pathway, responsible for targeting of endomembrane system TA proteins to the ER, is not required for targeting of mitochondrial TA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgese et al., 2019</xref>). In yeast, the HSP70 protein Sti1 (human STIP1) and Pex19 may play a role in mitochondrial TA protein targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cichocki et al., 2018</xref>), but in vitro experiments with proteolytically shaved mitochondria show that unassisted or minimally assisted insertion may also be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kemper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Setoguchi et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We envisioned using three distinct HiLITR configurations to investigate mitochondrial TA protein insertion. In the most direct approach, impaired mitochondrial localization of a TA protease would reduce the release of a SA mitochondrial TF, diminishing HiLITR activation (‘TA screen‘; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, this ‘loss of signal’ design may enrich false-positive genes whose knockdown either nonspecifically disrupts HiLITR component expression (e.g., ribosomal proteins) or impairs trafficking of the SA TF, rather than the protease. To filter out such genes, we designed a second HiLITR screen with the same TF but an SA – rather than TA – protease (‘SA screen’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Comparison of TA and SA screen results should eliminate most false positives and identify factors that selectively influence the targeting of mitochondrial TA over SA proteins.</p><p>For our third HiLITR configuration, we designed a ‘gain of signal’ screen based on the hypothesis that disrupted or nontargeted mitochondrial TA protease may reroute to the ERM (and subsequently to other organelles connected to the ER such as the Golgi). Thus, we expressed an ER/Golgi-targeted HiLITR TF together with a mutated mitochondrial TA protease (mTA*) that has increased propensity for mislocalization to ER/Golgi membranes (‘ER screen’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 4D and 4E). Given the partial ER localization of this mTA* protease, we anticipated that our ER screen might also help to identify factors that regulate the targeting of native ERM proteins.</p><p>To first narrow down our list of candidate genes, we performed a whole-genome ‘TA screen’ with the HiLITR components shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.

Using FACS, we collected cell populations with high mCherry expression (i.e., strong HiLITR activation) and low mCherry expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) from two technical replicates. Next-generation sequencing of sgRNA abundance in the collected populations indicated enrichment of genes related to protein folding, membrane trafficking, and proteasome function in the low mCherry cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

The TRC pathway is the first pathway discovered for the targeting of ER-destined TA proteins and is well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgese et al., 2019</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) shows the key players in the TRC pathway. ER-targeted TA proteins that are TRC pathway clients are handled directly by two chaperones, SGTA and TRC40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schuldiner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007</xref>). Three adaptor proteins (UBL4A, TRC35, and BAG6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mariappan et al., 2010</xref>) coordinate handoff between SGTA and TRC40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), while BAG6 additionally recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF126 (not shown) to degrade nonproductively associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rodrigo-Brenni et al., 2014</xref>). At the ER membrane, WRB and CAMLG act as receptors to assist with insertion of the client protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schuldiner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vilardi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamamoto and Sakisaka, 2012</xref>), but proteins with significant positive charge flanking the transmembrane domain (such as mitochondrial TA proteins) are rejected, either by the receptors or due to the energetic barrier posed by the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rao et al., 2016</xref>). The chaperones (SGTA and TRC40) and adaptors (TRC35, BAG6, and UBL4A) were included in our CRISPRi sublibrary, while WRB and CAMLG were not. We further explored the TRC pathway with individual knockdown of the chaperones SGTA and TRC40, the adaptor TRC35, and the receptors WRB and CAMLG. Interestingly, the profiles of HiLITR performance across the three HiLITR configurations segregated based on the function of each protein in the TRC pathway (<bold>C</bold>). Notably, knockdown of none of the proteins affected the SA screen HiLITR configuration, consistent with the fact that the TRC pathway acts only on TA proteins. In the TA screen configuration, knockdown of the chaperones and adaptors both increased HiLITR activation (<bold>C</bold>). If the chaperones are knocked down, there will be decreased mishandling of mitochondrial TA protein, and therefore an increase in normal topogenesis, localization to the mitochondria, and release of mitochondrial TF (<bold>D</bold>). Similarly, upon loss of adaptors, handoff of TA protein between SGTA and TRC40 is less coordinated. Adaptor-mediated degradation of uninserted TA protein will also be reduced. Both effects promote increased targeting of the TA protein to the mitochondrial membrane, increasing HiLITR activation (<bold>D</bold>). Knockdown of receptors in the TA screen configuration did not impact HiLITR activation (<bold>C</bold>). Since mitochondrial TA proteins that reach the ER are rejected on the basis of charge, loss of the receptors will have no additional impact (<bold>D</bold>). In the ER screen configuration, we used the mutant TA protein (mTA*-protease) that partitions between the OMM and ER membrane. We observed that knockdown of the chaperones and receptors decreased HiLITR activation (<bold>A, C</bold>). Loss of chaperones will mean less mTA* protease is routed to the ER, meaning less ends up colocalized with the ER-targeted TF, leading to reduce HiLITR activation (<bold>E</bold>). Similarly, if the receptors are disrupted, the mTA* protease cannot be inserted into the ER, decreasing HiLITR activation (<bold>E</bold>). In contrast to the chaperones and receptors, the adaptors gave mixed results, with two of the three adaptors producing no significant result in the ER screen (<bold>A, C</bold>). Knockdown of the adaptors will decrease handoff of the mTA* protease between SGTA and TRC40, providing opportunity for escape to the mitochondrial membrane (and decreased HiLITR activation). However, this effect is opposed by the fact that loss of adaptors will reduce degradation of the mTA* protease, providing more time for its insertion into the ER membrane (increasing HiLITR activity). As such, the impact of knocking down the adaptors is harder to predict for the ER screen (<bold>E</bold>). Lastly, we tested the effect of TRC protein knockdown on the localization of the mutant TA protease. Knockdown of SGTA, TRC40, and WRB decreased activation of HiLITR in the ER screen configuration, indicating reduced ER targeting of the mTA* protease. As expected, knockdown of any of these components reduced the fraction of mTA* protease colocalizing with the Golgi (<bold>G</bold>). TRC35 also decreased the fraction of mTA* protease colocalized with the Golgi, despite a neutral effect in the ER screen HiLITR configuration. It is likely that loss of TRC35 increases the fraction of mTA* protease which is rescued from the TRC pathway, while also increasing the efficiency by which unrescued mTA* protease is inserted into the ER (<bold>E</bold>). This would result in an increase in mitochondrial mTA* protease and neutral effect on ER mTA* protease, which would decrease the <italic>ratio</italic> of Golgi-localized mTA* protease without affecting total Golgi-localized protease or subsequent HiLITR activation in the ER screen configuration.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig3s1sdata1"><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 1.</label><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69142-fig3-figsupp1-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig3s1sdata2"><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 2.</label><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69142-fig3-figsupp1-data2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69142-fig3-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Retesting individual sgRNAs from the three HiLITR configuration CRISPRi screen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) plots showing the effects of individual sgRNAs on HiLITR readout in three K562 HiLITR cell lines (tail-anchored [TA], signal-anchored [SA], and ER) from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>.

We performed individual validation experiments on a number of hits from sublibrary screens. Performance in individual validation experiments is compared to performance in the sublibrary screens in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. PTPN1 is a TA protein known to localize to both the ER and mitochondria in an isoform-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brambillasca et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fueller et al., 2015</xref>). PTPN1 showed significant reduction in HiLITR activity in only the TA screen. We validated the strong negative effect of PTPN1 on HiLITR activation in the TA configuration with two guides (<bold>A, B, E</bold>). However, PTPN1 also decreased activation in the SA configuration, albeit to a more modest extent. REEP4 plays a role in ER membrane sequestration during metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schlaitz et al., 2013</xref>). It was found to decrease HiLITR activation in the TA and ER screens, while increasing HiLITR activation in the SA screen. Validation of REEP4 with two guides was consistent with screen results, with both guides showing decrease in activation in the TA configuration and one guide each showing either decreased activation in the ER configuration or increased activation in the SA configuration (<bold>B–E</bold>). REEP4 was observed to have a significant growth defect, and its annotation seemed to imply a nonspecific role, so we declined to analyze it further. SEC61A1 is a member of the ER translocon. It was observed to decrease HiLITR activation in the TA and SA screens and increase HiLITR activation in the ER screen. During individual validation, it was instead found to mildly increase HiLITR activation in all three configurations (<bold>C–E</bold>). Knockdown of SEC61A1 also produced a substantial growth defect. CYB5B is a second TA protein known to localize to both the ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D’Arrigo et al., 1993</xref>). It was seen to decrease HiLITR activation in the TA and SA screens and increase HiLITR activation in the ER screen (<bold>C–E</bold>). These results did not replicate with the guide we used for individual validation. The proteins we validated with success were SKA1, CCNK, and ATP6V1A (<bold>A–E</bold>). CCNK and SKA1 have annotation related to mitosis, while ATP6V1A is a member of the vacuolar ATPase. For these guides and for SAE1, we assessed the possibility that clone-specific effects could account for their performance in the HiLITR screens as a consequence of either clone-specific sensitivity to certain biological pathways or off-target silencing if a HiLITR component was integrated next to a targeted gene. We therefore repeated HiLITR assays in the polyclonal cell lines from which the monoclonal screen cell lines were isolated and found that HiLITR performance in polyclonal cell lines generally agreed with screen results, though data were noisier due to the population heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). ATP6V1A showed no loss of HiLITR activation in the heterogeneous TA configuration, while CCNK and SKA1 showed greater activation in the ER configuration than was observed with the clonal population.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69142-fig3-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Retesting individual sgRNAs in polyclonal cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) plots showing the effects of individual sgRNAs on HiLITR readout in polyclonal K562 HiLITR cell lines (corresponding to tail-anchored [TA], signal-anchored [SA], and ER screens from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>).

In addition to individual hits, we took note of three groups of functionally related genes that showed specific patterns of activation in the sublibrary screens. Several components of the exosome complex increased HiLITR activation in one or more screens (<bold>A</bold>). This complex is almost certainly a false positive, as it plays a role in RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kilchert et al., 2016</xref>), but it importantly indicates that in some cases false positives can increase – rather than decrease – HiLITR activation. We noticed that the set of generally activity-increasing hits included several members of the COPI complex, which mediates ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport (<bold>B</bold>). Interestingly, SEC13, a member of the Golgi-to-ER retrograde COPII complex, decreased HiLITR activation in the tail-anchored (TA) and ER screen. While the mechanistic connection of COPI/II to trafficking of the HiLITR components is not readily apparent – and quite possibly indirect – the recapitulation of the opposing roles of COPI and COPII in the HiLITR data is intriguing. Finally, we looked at all proteins in the TOMM and TIMM complexes (<bold>C</bold>). Surprisingly, knockdown of a large number of TIMM components, as well as TOMM20, decreased HiLITR activation in the ER screen. Several components also decreased HiLITR activation in the signal-anchored (SA) screen. We speculate that the knockdown of key TIMM and TOMM members might produce systems-level protein trafficking defects with far-ranging effects. It is interesting to consider how organelles in general, or different classes of proteins specifically, relate to global patterns in protein trafficking.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69142-fig3-figsupp4-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>To assess the validity of our screens, we first checked genes with known roles in mitochondrial and ER protein trafficking. The TRC pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schuldiner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stefanovic and Hegde, 2007</xref>), which handles the membrane insertion of ER TA proteins, also mishandles overexpressed mitochondrial TA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vitali et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this activity, knockdown of the TRC pathway chaperones SGTA and TRC40 significantly altered HiLITR activation in the TA and ER screens, but not the SA screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Other TRC pathway components also altered HiLITR activation in the TA and ER screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The EMC, similar to the TRC pathway, handles insertion of a subset of TA proteins at the ERM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guna et al., 2018</xref>). Among nine subunits tested, eight significantly altered HiLITR activation uniquely in the ER screen (Figure 6A). These results suggest that our HiLITR screens are able to recapitulate the known functions of well-characterized ER and mitochondrial membrane regulatory genes.</p><p>We then searched our data for novel genes that influence the targeting of mitochondrial TA proteins. Such proteins could be expected to have a low TA score, because sgRNA-mediated depletion of TA protease from the OMM would reduce HiLITR activation, but medium to high SA score, because SA protease would be minimally affected. A high ER score could also be expected due to a shift in mTA* protease localization from OMM to ERM, resulting in activation of ER-localized TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, only a single gene met all three criteria: SAE1 (SUMO-activating enzyme 1). SAE1 is an essential protein and a member of the SAE complex (along with SAE2/UBA2), which acts as the sole SUMO E1 ligase in mammalian cells. Modification of target proteins with the small protein tag SUMO can alter protein subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matunis et al., 1996</xref>), regulate protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desterro et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krumova et al., 2011</xref>), and promote cellular stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golebiowski et al., 2009</xref>). Several important mitochondrial proteins are SUMOylation targets, including Parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Um and Chung, 2006</xref>) and Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prudent et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, several chaperones implicated in the handling of TA proteins, including the ubiquilins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>) and STIP1, are also SUMOylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hendriks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soares et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As each HiLITR configuration is unlikely to be perfectly sensitive, we also looked for genes that met two of the three criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The quadrant with low TA score and high ER score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) contained only a few hits, one of which was ATP6V1A, a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase, which has an important role in vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dettmer et al., 2006</xref>).

This may be because a significant fraction of mitochondrial TA protease that fails to target to the OMM is destabilized and degraded. We also used confocal microscopy to analyze the subcellular localization of GFP-tagged mitochondrial mTA* protease. We found that knockdown of SAE1 increases the mislocalization of GFP-mTA* protease to ER/Golgi compartments, as measured by the ratio of GFP overlapping with Golgi versus mitochondrial markers. The effect was rescued by overexpression of sgRNA-resistant SAE1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref> and E).</p><p>Knockdown of SAE1 might impair topogenesis of the TA mitochondrial proteases through SUMOylation activity or through undetermined nonenzymatic binding interactions.

Knockdown of the ER-specific chaperone TRC40 did not alter the extent of colocalization between MAVS and the mitochondrial marker TOMM20.

In these cells, we observed non-mitochondrial MAVS in fibrous, perinuclear structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, zoom) distinct from the small puncta observed in control samples.

This suggests that EMC10 knockdown increases insertion of mTA* protease at the ERM relative to the OMM.</p><p>Although the mTA* protease appears to be a client of the EMC, it is not derived from a canonical ER TA protein. To query a more representative construct, we generated two new proteases targeted to the ERM via fusion to the native ER TA protein SQS or to its transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In K562 cells expressing the HiLITR ER-TF, knockdown of EMC10 increased HiLITR activation with full-length SQS protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). We next tested the effects of EMC10 knockdown on endogenous SQS. HeLa cells were infected with guides against EMC4 or EMC10, and cells were harvested after 9 days of sgRNA expression. Western blotting confirmed knockdown of EMC4 and EMC10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Neither EMC4 nor EMC10 knockdown altered the levels of the ER-translocon-dependent lumen protein calreticulin (CALR) or the TRC-dependent TA protein VTI1B. In contrast, EMC4 knockdown significantly decreased the level of SQS, while EMC10 knockdown significantly increased SQS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>With the advent of CRISPR-based gene perturbation screens and continued improvements to next-generation sequencing, large-scale functional genomics studies have become simpler, faster, and more cost-effective, particularly for pooled-format screens using conventional equipment and reagents. Presently, the biology that can be accessed by pooled-format screens is most limited by our ability to couple cellular processes of interest to a simple and robust readouts. This presents an opportunity for molecular reporter development to contribute to the field of functional genomics.</p><p>Several recent studies have combined pooled cell culturing with automated high-content microscopy using in-place sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feldman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), arrayed imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wheeler et al., 2020</xref>), or photoinducible reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kanfer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yan et al., 2021</xref>) to identify hits. Such approaches simplify cell culturing and collection, but identifying phenotypic hits still requires time-consuming microscopy and computational analysis. In this work, we have developed an alternative approach to the study of protein localization with pooled screens. HiLITR is a genetically encoded tool that provides light-gated readout of protein localization, enabling fast, genome-wide screening with high coverage, while dispensing with the need for specialized equipment or software.</p><p>Protein complementation assays (PCAs), such as split GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabantous et al., 2005</xref>), can also be used as readouts in high-throughput assays. Compared to PCAs, HiLITR provides signal amplification, which may improve sensitivity toward weak or rare effects. The customizable HiLITR reporter is also not limited to fluorescent protein production.</p><p>We envision a wide range of possible HiLITR applications in future studies. Because HiLITR is modular, it can be designed for applications at other organelles. HiLITR is also not limited to single-pass transmembrane proteins. Provided that the TF is robustly excluded from the nucleus and both TF and protease are cytosol-exposed with compatible geometries, HiLITR can be applied to study the localization of multipass, peripheral, or potentially even cytosolic proteins. As demonstrated here, some iteration may be necessary to optimize HiLITR geometry and dynamic range.</p><p>Though not exploited here, the light-gating of HiLITR could be applied to time-resolved detection of transient changes in protein localization, such as protein translocation in response to internal or external cues. HiLITR could also be formatted for use in other high-throughput assays, such as screens of chemical libraries.</p><p>While powerful, HiLITR does have limitations. Loss-of-activation screens produce false positives that nonspecifically decrease the expression of HiLITR components. Repeated applications of HiLITR by the scientific community may generate lists of recurring false positives, but false positives can also be filtered through the use of matched counterscreens (e.g., the SA screen vs. the TA screen used here). Gain-of-activation screens are likely to produce fewer false positives, but they must be designed with prior knowledge of how perturbation will alter construct localization. We also recommend cautious interpretation of hits that produce strong growth defects, for which we have observed generally lower reproducibility. Finally, because HiLITR uses recombinant, chimeric proteins and incorporates signal amplification, changes in HiLITR activation might not perfectly match the magnitude or scope of changes to the regulation of endogenous proteins. Larger HiLITR effect sizes will align with larger functional outputs, but unless conditions can be calibrated to treatments of known effect size, HiLITR should not be used to make specific claims about the magnitude of an effect. Follow-up validation on endogenous proteins is necessary for full confidence in the specificity of experimental observations.</p><p>In this study, we combined HiLITR with CRISPRi to identify genes involved in the trafficking of mitochondrial and ERM proteins. Using a pooled format, we performed a whole-genome screen followed by three smaller-scale screens, focusing on the identification of genes that specifically perturb the trafficking of mitochondrial TA proteins. We identified SAE1, an essential member of the mammalian SUMO E1 ligase. Knockdown of SAE1 specifically decreased the abundance of the endogenous mitochondrial TA proteins, including MAVS and FIS1. Knockdown of SAE1 also promoted mislocalization of endogenous MAVS. The effects of SAE1 knockdown were phenocopied by chemically inhibiting SUMOylation.</p><p>While the effect of SAE1 knockdown appears to be specific to mitochondrial TA proteins, we hypothesize that the perturbation is most likely indirect. Both STIP1 and the ubiquilins show evidence of SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hendriks et al., 2018</xref>), and it is possible that SUMOylation of these or other chaperones alters their activity, client specificity, or subcellular distribution. Alternatively, the effects of SAE1 knockdown may be mediated through changes to cell proliferation. SAE1 was one of several hits involved in regulation of the cytoskeleton and of mitosis. In our proteomics experiment, knockdown of SAE1 globally upregulated most mitochondrial proteins (relative to non-mitochondrial proteins), with the exception of TA proteins. Perhaps cellular and mitochondrial proliferation become uncoupled upon SAE1 knockdown. TA proteins, which must be post-translationally inserted into the OMM, may be less influenced by the factors that alter mitochondrial proliferation relative to cellular proliferation.</p><p>In our ER screen, we observed a novel and unexpected consequence of EMC10 knockdown. While loss of other EMC subunits decreased the ER localization of our mutant TA protease, EMC10 knockdown produced the opposite effect, which we confirmed by immunofluorescence and FACS. We further showed that knockdown of EMC10 increased abundance of the endogenous ER TA protein SQS. EMC10 localizes to the ER lumen, so it is not directly involved in EMC client recognition. However, the EMC has been shown to occupy two distinct conformations that differ in accessibility of the insertase transmembrane cavity, and lumenal domain rotation is observed between these states. Additionally, disruption of the lumenal interface between EMC1/7 increases the level an SQS-based reporter construct, and it has been suggested that permissiveness of the EMC might be adjusted to regulate levels of SQS as the cell responds to changes in demand for sterol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miller-Vedam et al., 2020</xref>). We propose that EMC10 plays a role in this regulation. EMC10 sits below the insertase cavity on the lumenal side and engages with both EMC1/7. Knockdown of EMC10 in our experiments produces results concordant with mutation of the EMC1/7 interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miller-Vedam et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore speculate that EMC10 stabilizes the EMC1/7 junction and the closed insertase conformation, and that EMC10 may dissociate from the EMC to promote increased insertase activity. In addition to its role as an insertase, the EMC also serves as a holdase chaperone to favor proper orientation of multipass transmembrane proteins of the endomembrane system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>). It remains to be shown whether EMC10 plays a regulatory role in this function of the EMC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Total volume of media was 2 mL per transfection. About 48 hr after transfection, the cell medium was harvested in 0.5 mL aliquots and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at –80°C.

Total volume of media was 30 mL per transfection. 48 hr after transfection, the cell medium was harvested, and an additional 30 mL of media was added to each plate. 24 hr later, this media was combined with the media from the 48 hr time point and filtered through a 0.45 µm syringe filter (Millipore SLHV033RB; BD 309653). One 15 cm dish was transfected for each 35 million K562 cells to be transduced.</p><p>To infect K562 cells, 50,000–250,000 cells in log-phase growth were combined with one or two viral aliquots and 1.6 µL of polybrene (10 mg/mL; Millipore TR-1003-G) in a total volume of 2 mL in a 24-well plate format. The plates were subjected to centrifugation at 1000 × g and 33°C for 2 hr. For large-scale experiments, infections were performed in 6-well plates, and the volume of reagents and number of plates used was scaled up in proportion to the desired number of cells infected. HeLa cells were infected by adding one or two viral aliquots to the media of a 6-well plate when the cells had grown to 15–30% confluency. For both K562 and Hela Cell, selection was initiated 2 days after infection with 0.5 µg/mL puromycin (Sigma P8833), which was increased in concentration to 1 µg/mL over the next 2 days and supplied for a total of 3–6 days. Some plasmids instead required selection with blasticidin (Corning 30-100-RB, starting with 4 µg/mL and increased to 8 µg/mL over a selection time course of 5–7 days) or with hygromycin (Corning 30-240-CR, starting with 100 µg/mL and increased to 200 µg/mL over a selection time course of 5–7 days), or with geneticin (Thermo Fisher #10131035, starting with 50 µg/mL and increased to 100 µg/mL over a selection time course of 5–7 days).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Generation of clonal cell lines</title><p>To generate clonal K562 cell lines, cell lines were first generated with stable integration and selection of all desired constructs.

After 1–2 weeks of expansion, clonal cell lines were selected for desired levels of construct expression and HiLITR response, as assessed by flow cytometry analysis.</p><p>Clonal HeLa cell lines were generated from cell cultures with stably integrated and selected constructs. After lifting and separating cells with trypsin (Corning 25-053), serial dilutions were plated on 10 cm cell culture dishes. A day after plating, individual clones were identified with an Olympus CKX31 benchtop inverted microscope. After 1–2 weeks of expansion, previously identified colonies were isolated with a cloning cylinder (Millipore TR-1004), lifted with trypsin, and transferred to a 6-well plate for further expansion.

Roughly 12–16 hr after plating, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (RICCA 3180) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. For immunofluorescence experiments with K562 cells, the plates containing the cells were subjected to centrifugation at 1000 × g during fixation. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS, then permeabilized with 0.2% triton X-100 (Sigma T9284) in PBS for 10 min. After washing again with PBS, cells were incubated with primary antibody for 1 hr in 2% BSA (Fisher BioReagents BP1600) in PBS, then washed with PBS and incubated with secondary, fluorophore-conjugated antibody in 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min, followed by a final wash before imaging. During wash steps, media was removed with vacuum aspiration at the lowest possible pressure setting. On occasions where media removal was performed by hand, additional PBS washes were incorporated between steps.</p><p>Imaging was performed with a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 microscope with a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal head, Cascade IIL:512 camera, a Quad-band notch dichroic mirror (405/488/568/647 nm), and 405 nm, 491 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm lasers (all 50 mW). Images were captured through a 63× or 100× oil-immersion objective for the following fluorophores: BFP and Alexa Fluor 405 (405 laser excitation, 445/40 emission), EGFP and Alexa Fluor 488 (491 laser excitation, 528/38 emission), mCherry and Alexa Fluor 568 (561 laser excitation, 617/73 emission), and Alexa Fluor 647 (647 laser excitation, 700/75 emission). Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were also obtained. Image acquisition times ranged from 50 to 250 ms per channel, and images were captured as the average of two or three such exposures in rapid succession. Image acquisition and processing was carried out with the SlideBook 5.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, 3i).</p><p>Primary antibodies used in imaging include the following: anti-V5 (Mouse, Invitrogen R960); anti-TOMM20 (Rabbit, Abcam ab186735); anti-GRASP65 (Mouse, Santa Cruz sc-374423); anti-CANX (Rabbit, Thermo Fisher PA5-34754); anti-PEX14 (Rabbit, Proteintech 10594-1-AP); anti-RCN2 (Rabbit, Thermo Fisher PA5-56542); anti-AKAP1 (Mouse, Santa Cruz sc-135824); and anti-MAVS (Mouse, Santa Cruz sc-166583).</p><p>Secondary antibodies used in imaging include the following: anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Goat, Invitrogen A11029); anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (Goat, Invitrogen A11031); anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (Goat, Invitrogen A21236); anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (Goat, Invitrogen A11036); and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 405 (Goat, Invitrogen A31556).</p><p>MitoTracker Deep Red FM (Invitrogen M22426) was also used for imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>FACS analysis and sorting</title><p>FACS analysis and sorting of K562 cells were carried out with a SONY SH800S cell sorter equipped with four collinear excitation lasers (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 638 nm; all 30 mW), using a 100 µm sorting chip. The 638 nm laser was disabled during experiments. Additional fluorescent cell cytometry analysis of K562 cells and HeLa cells was performed using a BioRad ZE5 cell analyzer with four parallel excitation lasers (405 nm – 100 mW, 488 nm – 100 mW, 561 nm – 50 mW, and 640 nm – 100 mW). For experiments using the SONY SH800S, instrumental analysis and data processing were performed using the SONY Cell Sorter Software, versions 2.1.2 and 2.1.5. For experiments with the BioRad ZE5, instrumental analysis was performed using Everest software version 2.3 (BioRad) and data processing was performed using FlowJo version 10.7.1.</p><p>The following scatter conditions and fluorophores were measured in FACS experiments (note that for the collinear laser configuration of the SONY instrument, all three active lasers engage in simultaneous excitation): forward scatter (‘FSC’; SONY: 488/17 emission; BioRad: 488 excitation, 488/10 emission), back/side scatter (‘BSC’/’SSC’; SONY: 488/17 emission; BioRad: 488 excitation, 488/10 emission), BFP (SONY: 450/50 emission; BioRad: 405 excitation, 460/22 emission), EGFP (SONY: 525/50 emission; BioRad: 488 excitation, 509/24 emission), mCherry (SONY: 600/60 emission; BioRad: 561 excitation, 615/24 emission). For first experiments with a given laser configuration, appropriate single-fluorophore compensation controls were included. The corresponding compensation matrix was applied to future experiments using the same laser configuration.</p><p>A short series of gates was used to focus sorting and analysis on the desired population of cells. Live and dead cells were first separated by plotting back/side scatter area (BSC-A/SSC-A) against forward scatter (FSC-A), and dead or dying cells were excluded by drawing a gate that omitted cells with a high BSC/SSC:FSC ratio, yielding population P<sub>1</sub>. From P<sub>1</sub>, single cells were separated from cell doublets by plotting forward scatter height (FSC-H) against width (FSC-W) and drawing a gate around the predominant population with lower FSC-W values, yielding population P<sub>2</sub>. For experiments featuring sgRNA constructs with BFP expression indicator (particularly the experiments with sgRNA libraries), population P<sub>2</sub> was further resolved into population P<sub>3</sub> by plotting a histogram of BFP values and collecting only cells with high expression of BFP (and sgRNA by proxy, omitting cells lacking sgRNA or in the bottom 10% of the sgRNA-positive peak of the histogram). Finally, for some experiments in which samples consisted of homogenous cell populations (with identical reporter, TF, TEV protease, and sgRNA constructs integrated), population P<sub>2</sub> or P<sub>3</sub> was refined to population P<sub>4</sub>, the population of cells expressing TEV protease (which was fused to EGFP) by plotting FSC-A against EGFP and drawing a gate around the cluster of EGFP-positive cells.</p><p>Samples were maintained on ice prior to instrumental analysis. For the large-scale sorting experiments, the acquisition and collection chambers of the SONY SH800S were maintained at 4°C. Sorted cells were collected in 15 mL conical tubes containing 5 mL of HEPES-buffered RPMI (Sigma R7388) supplemented with 30% FBS (Avantor 97068-085). During sorting, collections tubes that were filled were subjected to centrifugation at 1000 × g, and the media was removed and replaced with HEPES-buffered RPMI with 10% FBS. After the conclusion of all sorting, collected cells were pooled by sample and sort condition, pelleted again by centrifugation and removal of media, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or immediately subjected to sequencing library preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>HiLITR activation</title><p>For small-scale analyses, K562 cells were grown in 6-well plate format (at 50,000–500,000 cells/mL), while for large-scale sorting experiments (such as the whole-genome selection), the cells were grown in T125 flasks (at 300,000–600,000 cells/mL). Cells were incubated with 400 ng/mL doxycycline to induce expression of the TEV protease component roughly 16–24 hr prior to light stimulation (experiments where conditions differ noted in the text). Upon addition of doxycycline, the plates or flasks were wrapped completely in tin foil, exposing only the vented flask cap, where applicable. Following doxycycline incubation, cells were stimulated with 450 nm blue light from a 28.8 × 28.8 cm<sup>2</sup>, 22 W panel (26.5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>; Yescom YES3110) for a period of 2–8 min (depending on the experiment and sample). Plates or flasks were placed directly on top of the panel and agitated by hand once every 1–2 min to prevent settling of cells. Light stimulation was carried out at room temperature in a dark room with only red light sources as additional illumination for visual aid. Following light stimulation, cells were returned to tin foil wrapping and replaced in the 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 8–16 hr to allow for expression of the reporter construct. After expression, K562 cells were transferred to appropriate tubes for FACS analysis/sorting and placed on ice. For small-scale experiments, cells were sorted in their native RPMI medium. For the large-scale sorts, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000× and the media was removed and replaced with HEPES-buffered RPMI with 10% FBS. During this medium-replacement step, cells were concentrated to a density of 8–12 million cells/mL.</p><p>For HiLITR experiments with HeLa cells, light stimulation was carried out in an identical manner, except cells were cultured on 7 mm × 7 mm glass coverslips, they were not agitated during light stimulation, and they were subjected to immunofluorescence staining and fluorescence microscopy after reporter expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Model selection</title><p>A clonal K562 line was generated with a ‘matched’ HiLITR configuration, bearing a TA, mitochondrial TEV protease component and an SA, mitochondrial TF component. The clone was selected on the bases of good light/dark sensitivity, typical TEV protease expression levels, and HiLITR activation that was not atypically robust. Two additional K562 cell lines with ‘mismatched’ HiLITR configurations were generated, bearing the same mitochondrial TF and either a TA, ER TEV protease component or an NES-tagged, cytosolic TEV protease component. One day prior to selection, the density of each cell line was estimated using a Countess II FL automated cell counter. For each mismatched-HiLITR cell line, the matched-HiLITR clonal line was mixed at a 1:20, 1:2, 5:1, and 50:1 ratio of matched to mismatched cells, creating a calibration series over four orders of magnitude (~200 thousand cells/sample). Additional 1:20 population mixtures (~2 million cells/sample), as well as unmixed cell lines (~200 thousand cells/sample), were then subjected to the HiLITR activation protocol (doxycycline-induced TEV protease expression, 3.5 min light stimulation). Unmixed cell lines were analyzed by FACS (SONY SH800S), and the resulting activation profiles were used to design gates to maximally enrich the matched-HiLITR cell line from the pooled mixture. Just prior to sorting, a ‘pre-sort’ baseline of the mixed cell line sample was set aside from each pooled mixture. Sorting was conducted for about 20 min per sample, and about 150,000 cells were collected per sort. Immediately after sorting, RNA was extracted from the post-sort collected, pre-sort baseline, and calibration series populations.</p><p>RT-qPCR analysis was performed to measure the levels of matched (mitochondrial) TEV protease transcript and mismatched (cytosolic or ER) TEV protease transcript in each sample. Three technical replicates were measured per sample (separated into replicates after RNA extraction and reverse transcription), with the following sequencing primers:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Forward primer (same for all transcripts): 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">CATGGTGGAATTCGGTTCCACG</named-content>-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mitochondrial TEV protease reverse primer: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGTGAGGGCCTTCCACTACC</named-content>-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>ER TEV protease reverse primer: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGACTCCACGGTGGTGATTC</named-content>-3′</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cytosolic TEV protease reverse primer: 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">CGGCCAGCTCTCCACTACC</named-content>-3′</p></list-item></list><p>A 60°C annealing temperature was used in the qPCR reaction. For each sample, the ratio of matched protease transcript to mismatched protease transcript was used as a proxy for the ratio of cells from the corresponding populations. Comparison of the transcript ratios from the pre-sort and post-sort samples to the calibration series enabled calculation of the absolute ratio of matched protease to mismatched protease cells in each sample, from which the corresponding enrichment of cells bearing the matched protease could be derived.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA extraction</title><p>RNA extraction was performed using a RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen 74134).

The sample was then added to a mixture of 1 µL SuperScript III RT, 4 µL 5×X First-strand Buffer, and 2 µL 0.1 µM DTT (all from Invitrogen 18080044), with 1 µL RiboLock RNAse inhibitor (Thermo Scientific EO0382), and 2 µL RNAse-free water. Single-stranded DNA was generated by placing the mixture on a thermocycler for 10 min at 25°C, followed by 1 hr at 55°C and 15 min at 40°C, before holding at 4°C.</p><p>To analyze cDNA by qPCR, cDNA was first diluted 25-fold in water. Subsequently, 2 µL of cDNA was mixed with 2.4 µL water, 0.3 µL each of 10 µM forward and reverse primers, and 5 µL of Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific K0221). Samples were prepared on ice and arranged in a MicroAmp 48-well reaction place (Applied Biosystems 4375816), which was sealed with MicroAmp optical adhesive film (Applied Biosystems 4375323). Instrumental analysis was performed on a StepOne Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems 436907) using StepOne Software (version 2.2.2). Samples were quantified over 40 cycles of amplification, followed by melt curve analysis for quality control. Count values for each sample were obtained using automatic thresholding performed by the software, and count values were exported to Microsoft Excel for additional analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Whole-genome selection</title><p>The top five sgRNA per gene from a genome-wide CRISPRi library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horlbeck et al., 2016</xref>) were used for the genome-wide CRISPRi screen. After generation of lentivirus, the library was infected into the clonal K562 cell line generated for the model selection (mitochondrial TF, TA mitochondrial TEV protease). Infection was performed with 280 million K562 cells. Based on FACS analysis of BFP-positive cells, multiplicity of infection was 0.4, for a theoretical coverage of 1100× per library element. We selected for sgRNA incorporation with puromycin, split samples into two technical replicates, and 36 hr prior to FACS sorting, induced TEV protease expression with doxycycline. Cells were maintained at or above coverage for the culture duration. The cells were transferred to T150 flasks (60 mL) for light stimulation 12 hr prior to sorting, then returned to the spinner flask for reporter expression. Sorting was performed 9 days after infection. About 200 million cells were analyzed by FACS for each technical replicate. Gates were set to collect cells with the top 15% and bottom 15% of mCherry reporter expression, representing the cells with the greatest and least HiLITR activity. Based on sorting purity parameters, about 18 million cells were collected for each gate. Genomic DNA was harvested from cells (Qiagen 51192) immediately after completion of sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Matched sublibrary selections</title><p>The library for the three matched selections was designed based on the results from the whole-genome selection. The library featured sgRNAs targeting 586 genes (five sgRNAs per gene) as well as 500 nontargeting controls. Genes targeted were selected based on significance in the whole-genome selection and on lack of clear annotation related to transcription or translation. A smaller set of genes corresponding to known protein trafficking pathways was also included.</p><p>In addition to the clonal K562 cell line that was previously used in the whole-genome selection (TA cell line), two additional clonal K562 cell lines were generated. The first clonal cell line expressed the same mitochondrial TF as the whole-genome selection cell line, but the TEV protease was an SA mitochondrial construct (SA cell line). The second clonal cell line expressed a mutagenized TA mitochondrial TEV protease, which was sensitized for misincorporation into the ERM, and the TF construct in this cell line was localized to the ERM (ER cell line).</p><p>Each cell line was transduced with lentivirus of the sgRNA sublibrary at 50 million cell scale for the TA and SA cell lines, and 70 million cell scale for the ER cell line. Cell lines were split into two biological replicates immediately after infection, before cells began to divide. Multiplicity of infection was estimated as follows, based on proportion of BFP-positive, sgRNA-expressing cells: 0.8 for the TA cell line (5700× coverage per biological replicate), 1.4 for the SA cell line (10,000× coverage), and 0.16 for the ER cell line (1600× coverage). Cells were cultured in T150 flasks with linear shaking, and coverage levels were maintained during cell culturing and selection. TEV protease expression was induced with doxycycline 36 hr prior to sorting, and light stimulation was performed 12 hr prior to sorting. Sorting was performed 11 days after infection. For the TA cell line, cells with the top and bottom 16% of mCherry reporter expression were collected (11 million cells per condition). For the SA cell line, cells with the top 16% and bottom 33% of mCherry reporter expression were collected (12 million and 24 million cells, respectively). For the ER cell line, cells with the top 9% and bottom 30% of mCherry reporter expression were collected (6 million and 22 million cells, respectively).

After selection of sgRNA-positive cells with puromycin, samples were plated on coverslips on the eighth day after infection, and TEV protease expression was induced with doxycycline. The following day, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and subjected to immunostaining.

For each object, a mask was created on pixels that exceeded a threshold GRASP65 signal. A second mask was created for pixels that exceeded a threshold TOMM20 signal but not the GRASP65 threshold. Average EGFP intensity was calculated for each mask. After measuring all cells, the ratio of average EGFP intensity between the two masks was determined for each cell, then normalized to the median value for cells bearing the nontargeting control sgRNA.

This new tool will shed lights on the molecular mechanisms of protein trafficking and localization.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An engineered transcriptional reporter of protein localization identifies regulators of mitochondrial and ER membrane protein trafficking in high-throughput screens&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Heedeok Hong and the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jonathan P Schlebach (Reviewer #2); Liang Ge (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reviewers agreed that this is an outstanding study and additional experiments are not necessary. It is recommended that authors address the following Essential Revision points and other scientific concerns/suggestions raised by reviewers to further improve the vision, clarity and presentation of this work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More in-depth discussion on the limitation and future applicability of this method:</p><p>1– (i) While these screens are capable of identifying the central machinery involved in the targeting pathways of TA proteins, chimeric substrates represent an artificial substrate, and the characterization of such substrates may have limited impact on our understanding of topogenic pathways within the cell.</p><p>1– (ii) On the perspectives of HiLITR: The current version focuses on single membrane-spanning peptides as a localization signal and it is still unclear how this method can be used to study more complex problems in protein localization (e.g., membrane proteins with multiple TM segments or larger water-soluble domains). In such case, how could the accessibility issue between TF and protease be overcome?</p><p>2) More in-depth discussion on the role of the identified genes (SAE1 and EMC10):</p><p>Although this manuscript majorly focuses on the tool development, more molecular level explanation on the mechanistic role of SAE1 and EMC10 seems needed. For example, how can EMC10 play an antagonistic role in the insertion of TA proteins in ER membranes and what is its biological implications?</p><p>3) More discussion on how the HiLITR activity can be scaled vs the actual contribution of the identified genes:</p><p>Signal amplification can be a double-edged dagger since it can magnify small differences more than what is actual. A statement is needed how the HiLITR results can be translated into the actual effect of an identified component (e.g., HILITR vs Western blotting).</p><p>4) Call Figure 5D/E in the last paragraph in page 14 (section on EMC2/8/10 knockdown in HeLa).</p><p>5) In Figure S4G, could the authors explain why the mito-protease generated more mCherry than the peroxisome-protease since the TF is located on the peroxisome?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have one major scientific concern. A major scientific concern:</p><p>1. The validity of the antagonizing role of EMC10:</p><p>In the HiLITR ER screen of mTA* (Figure 5A), sgRNA-EMC10 yields a large increase in HiLITR signal. However, with the same sgRNA, the Western blotting test for the bona fide EMC client SQS displays a moderate increase (by ~20%, Figure 5E/F). Is this discrepancy due to the difference between mTA* and SQS (i.e., one client is more affected by EMC10 than the other) or to the sensitivity difference between the two methods?</p><p>Furthermore, in Figure S15, the band intensity of non-EMC client VTI1B (Western blotting result, Figure S15E) increases with sgRNA-EMC4 (assigned &quot;non-significant&quot; in Figure 5F). The degree of increase is apparently similar to that of the EMC client SQS with sgRNA-EMC10 (Figure S15F, assigned &quot;significant&quot; in Figure 5F). These arguments raise a concern whether the antagonizing role of EMC10 is substantial or minor.</p><p>More discussion seems to be needed whether the identified gene products would have uniform or different effects on different clients. Also, it would be nice to discuss how the signal amplification in HiLITR can be interpreted with regards to the actual contribution of the gene products to the TA protein insertion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Generally speaking, this article is very well written, and I have few complaints about the technical aspects of these experiments and the associated data. In fact, I believe strongly that this paper goes above and beyond what most would expect. Nevertheless, there were a few places where the text was not so clear, and I suggest a few stylistic changes in order to improve the readability of the paper as follows:</p><p>– I found myself referring back to Figures 2 C and D several times in order to make sure I understood how each variation of the screen worked. I think part of the reason this was not immediately clear is that these graphics show you how the system is normally oriented, but does not show how perturbations will effect the system. This is sort of made clear for the untargeted protease controls in Figure 2A, but not for the actual screen itself. I would suggest you make a version of Figure 2C/D where you show the configuration of the screen, then show what a positive hit does to the localization of the sensor and protease in each case (like in 2A). You could split off 2E into another figure, and simply dedicate Figure 2 to these schematics as well as the flow chart. Having a master figure like this would make it much easier for the reader to refer back to what the change in the signal for each screen/ counter screen would indicate at the molecular level.</p><p>– In the last paragraph in page 14 (section on EMC2/8/10 knockdown in HeLa) there it is unclear where these data are located. Please indicate the figure number.</p><p>– In Figure 5A, the presentation of the three-dimensional scatter is redundant and distracting considering how focused the Figure/ Section is intended to be. I might suggest adding, instead, a table that is focused on hits of interest that just shows their values for each of the three screens. This might make it easy to compare the relevant values across the EMC subunits (and other hits of interest).</p><p>– The box and whisker plots displaying the microscopy results have confusing axis labels. If this is indeed the best metric and best title for the axis, I would suggest the authors include a brief explanation of what this metric specifically reflects in quantitative terms within the Results section.</p><p>– It is unclear why the authors measure co-localization with a Golgi marker relative to co-localization with mitochondrial markers when validating these hits (i.e. Figure 4). The other parts of the paper suggest the mislocalized protein ends up in the ER. Why not measure co-localization with an ER marker? I am sure the authors chose this marker for a reason. They should at least add one sentence in the Results section explaining this experimental design.</p><p>– It is not clear to me why the SAE1 knockdown leads to an increase in the HiLITR signal in the SA assay (Figure 4A). Is there a clear interpretation? Does this matter? A brief explanation of the interpretation of these results in the text is warranted. Even if it is not important, it is a good example to explain how each result is interpreted (SA vs TA vs ER screens). Going through each result one by one might help clarify the logic for interpreting counter screen results. The bottom line is, if the reader can't exactly follow this logic, it could undermine their appreciation for this (admittedly beautiful) experimental design.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would be good to have the study quickly published to guide people in the community who are going to develop screening approaches for their interested directions.</p><p>Two suggestions:</p><p>1. In Figure 2A, the authors proposed three possibilities of the effect of the sgRNA: 1. blocking TA targeting of the protease, 2. affecting the level of the protease, and 3. no effect. I would suggest adding the fourth possibility. It is also likely that the sgRNA may also affect the correct targeting of the membrane anchored TF. To my understanding, as long as the protease is not able to meet the TF, no mCherry could be produced. Again this possiblity could be controlled by the SA experiments the authors have performed.</p><p>2. In Figure S4G, could the authors explain why the mito protease generated more mCherry than the peroxisome protease，since the TF is located on the peroxisome?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69142.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) More in-depth discussion on the limitation and future applicability of this method:</p><p>1– (i) While these screens are capable of identifying the central machinery involved in the targeting pathways of TA proteins, chimeric substrates represent an artificial substrate, and the characterization of such substrates may have limited impact on our understanding of topogenic pathways within the cell.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this caveat when describing the limitations of our approach in the Discussion section.

However, the protease must be cytosol-facing under some condition, so that it may release the TF. Some membrane proteins may not have a suitable cytosol-facing fusion site, although the protease is able to tolerate N- and C-terminal tagging and potentially even internal fusion. These points are now included in the edited discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More in-depth discussion on the role of the identified genes (SAE1 and EMC10):</p><p>Although this manuscript majorly focuses on the tool development, more molecular level explanation on the mechanistic role of SAE1 and EMC10 seems needed. For example, how can EMC10 play an antagonistic role in the insertion of TA proteins in ER membranes and what is its biological implications?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided additional content in the Discussion section speculating on the mechanistic effects of SAE1 and EMC10:</p><p>– SAE1: “it is possible that SUMOylation of these or other chaperones alters their activity, client specificity, or subcellular distribution. Alternatively, the effects of SAE1 knockdown may be mediated through changes to cell proliferation. SAE1 was one of several hits involved in regulation of the cytoskeleton and of mitosis. In our proteomics experiment, knockdown of SAE1 globally upregulated most mitochondrial proteins (relative to non-mitochondrial proteins), with the exception of tail-anchored proteins. Perhaps cellular and mitochondrial proliferation become uncoupled upon SAE1 knockdown. Tail-anchored proteins, which must be post-translationally inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane, may be less influenced by the factors which alter mitochondrial proliferation relative to cellular proliferation.”</p><p>– EMC10: “We propose that EMC10 plays a role in this regulation. EMC10 sits below the insertase cavity on the lumenal side and engages with both EMC1/7. Knockdown of EMC10 in our experiments produces results concordant with mutation of the EMC1/7 interface (Miller-Vedam et al., 2020). We therefore speculate that EMC10 stabilizes the EMC1/7 junction and the closed insertase conformation, and that EMC10 may dissociate from the EMC to promote increased insertase activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More discussion on how the HiLITR activity can be scaled vs the actual contribution of the identified genes:</p><p>Signal amplification can be a double-edged dagger since it can magnify small differences more than what is actual. A statement is needed how the HiLITR results can be translated into the actual effect of an identified component (e.g., HILITR vs Western blotting).</p></disp-quote><p>In general, HiLITR seems to be more sensitive than direct measures of endogenous protein levels, which can be observed in the Western blotting and proteomics data related to SAE1 knockdown and in the Western blotting related to EMC10 knockdown. This is likely a function of the signal amplification of HiLITR, as the reviewer notes, and the use of clonal selection for highly sensitive cell lines. In theory, if there are perturbations that will be known to give specific effect sizes, they could be used to calibrate the HiLITR readout. Otherwise, we would recommend against imputing a specific effect size from HiLITR results. We have added these comments to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Call Figure 5D/E in the last paragraph in page 14 (section on EMC2/8/10 knockdown in HeLa).</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure S4G, could the authors explain why the mito-protease generated more mCherry than the peroxisome-protease since the TF is located on the peroxisome?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this was a combination of two factors. First, despite several attempts, we were unable to generate a peroxisomal protease that localizes exclusively to peroxisomes. Imaging of the protease in Figure S4F suggests it is also localized to some extent to the mitochondria and/or ER, although this was not directly confirmed. Second, HiLITR activation increases with greater protease expression, and the mitochondrial protease is expressed at higher levels than the peroxisomal protease (compare 1st and 2nd FACS plots in row 2 of Figure 1 —figure supplement 4G). We have added this comment to the text accompanying figure 1 —figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have one major scientific concern.</p><p>1. The validity of the antagonizing role of EMC10:</p><p>In the HiLITR ER screen of mTA* (Figure 5A), sgRNA-EMC10 yields a large increase in HiLITR signal. However, with the same sgRNA, the Western blotting test for the bona fide EMC client SQS displays a moderate increase (by ~20%, Figure 5E/F). Is this discrepancy due to the difference between mTA* and SQS (i.e., one client is more affected by EMC10 than the other) or to the sensitivity difference between the two methods?</p></disp-quote><p>We have a few possible explanations for the magnitude difference seen in our ER-screen versus the SQS western blots:</p><p>– As discussed above, HiLITR is more sensitive than WB due to signal amplification.</p><p>– In addition, the HiLITR assay with the mTA* protease was performed in a clonal cell line, which was selected precisely for its sensitivity to perturbation.</p><p>– There are also biophysical differences between the mTA* protease reporter and SQS. The mTA* transmembrane domain is a hybrid substrate (combining features of mito TA and ER TA proteins) that is not optimized for ER insertion. Consequently, when we knock down EMC10, increased permissiveness at the ER membrane might strongly impact the population of mTA* protease which would be otherwise targeted to the mitochondria. In contrast, SQS is already an ideal substrate of the EMC. Increased permissiveness may salvage some SQS that would otherwise fail to insert and be degraded, but most SQS is already inserted into the ER membrane and the room for improvement is modest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, in Figure S15, the band intensity of non-EMC client VTI1B (Western blotting result, Figure S15E) increases with sgRNA-EMC4 (assigned &quot;non-significant&quot; in Figure 5F). The degree of increase is apparently similar to that of the EMC client SQS with sgRNA-EMC10 (Figure S15F, assigned &quot;significant&quot; in Figure 5F). These arguments raise a concern whether the antagonizing role of EMC10 is substantial or minor.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5F (now 6F), one replicate for VTI1B showed greater intensity from the EMC4 knockout sample. However, the other two replicates showed levels that were very similar to non-targeting control. For the SQS staining, we observed consistent and similar increases in protein levels in all three EMC10 knockout replicates. Since the insertase activity of EMC is constitutive, the antagonism by EMC10 is probably somewhat minor. We speculate that EMC10 can adopt different conformations within the EMC—or even dissociates completely—in order to boost insertase activity at critical junctures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More discussion seems to be needed whether the identified gene products would have uniform or different effects on different clients. Also, it would be nice to discuss how the signal amplification in HiLITR can be interpreted with regards to the actual contribution of the gene products to the TA protein insertion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have responded to these points above and made corresponding edits to the manuscript to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Generally speaking, this article is very well written, and I have few complaints about the technical aspects of these experiments and the associated data. In fact, I believe strongly that this paper goes above and beyond what most would expect. Nevertheless, there were a few places where the text was not so clear, and I suggest a few stylistic changes in order to improve the readability of the paper as follows:</p><p>– I found myself referring back to Figures 2 C and D several times in order to make sure I understood how each variation of the screen worked. I think part of the reason this was not immediately clear is that these graphics show you how the system is normally oriented, but does not show how perturbations will effect the system. This is sort of made clear for the untargeted protease controls in Figure 2A, but not for the actual screen itself. I would suggest you make a version of Figure 2C/D where you show the configuration of the screen, then show what a positive hit does to the localization of the sensor and protease in each case (like in 2A). You could split off 2E into another figure, and simply dedicate Figure 2 to these schematics as well as the flow chart. Having a master figure like this would make it much easier for the reader to refer back to what the change in the signal for each screen/ counter screen would indicate at the molecular level.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. We have modified the figure to show how perturbations will affect the readout for each screen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the last paragraph in page 14 (section on EMC2/8/10 knockdown in HeLa) there it is unclear where these data are located. Please indicate the figure number.</p></disp-quote><p>Noted and fixed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 5A, the presentation of the three-dimensional scatter is redundant and distracting considering how focused the Figure/ Section is intended to be. I might suggest adding, instead, a table that is focused on hits of interest that just shows their values for each of the three screens. This might make it easy to compare the relevant values across the EMC subunits (and other hits of interest).</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the scatter plot adds value because it clearly shows that EMC members have among the most pronounced effects within the ER screen, and it also demonstrates that the EMC (and EMC10 in particular) is in a distinct class of its own with respect to other genes targeted in the screens. However, in order to provide readers with a quick summary of results from the EMC, we have added the suggested table to the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The box and whisker plots displaying the microscopy results have confusing axis labels. If this is indeed the best metric and best title for the axis, I would suggest the authors include a brief explanation of what this metric specifically reflects in quantitative terms within the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added some language to the text and figure 4 legend to clarify the metric, as follows:</p><p>– Results: “…knockdown of SAE1 increases the mislocalization of this construct to ER/Golgi compartments, as measured by the ratio of GFP overlapping with Golgi versus mitochondrial markers.</p><p>– Legend: “The value plotted is the mean intensity of GFP-protease signal colocalized with Golgi divided by mean signal colocalized with mitochondria.”</p><p>A comprehensive description of how measurements were acquired and quantified is provided in the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear why the authors measure co-localization with a Golgi marker relative to co-localization with mitochondrial markers when validating these hits (i.e. Figure 4). The other parts of the paper suggest the mislocalized protein ends up in the ER. Why not measure co-localization with an ER marker? I am sure the authors chose this marker for a reason. They should at least add one sentence in the Results section explaining this experimental design.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question, and we have added some clarifying language in the description of tail-anchored protein trafficking, the gain-of-signal ER screen, and validation of hits. To address the question directly here, the literature on tail-anchored protein trafficking has established that all TA proteins of the endomembrane system are first inserted at the ER. The mTA* protease must also be mistargeted to the ER, but upon further anterograde trafficking through the endomembrane it accumulates most heavily in the Golgi. For this reason and for other technical reasons, it was easiest to image the Golgi reservoir of mTA* protease as an indicator of mislocalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is not clear to me why the SAE1 knockdown leads to an increase in the HiLITR signal in the SA assay (Figure 4A). Is there a clear interpretation? Does this matter? A brief explanation of the interpretation of these results in the text is warranted. Even if it is not important, it is a good example to explain how each result is interpreted (SA vs TA vs ER screens). Going through each result one by one might help clarify the logic for interpreting counter screen results. The bottom line is, if the reader can't exactly follow this logic, it could undermine their appreciation for this (admittedly beautiful) experimental design.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question, and something we have been trying to determine ourselves. The proteomics data which we acquired suggests that overall mitochondrial protein abundance (with the notable exception of tail-anchored proteins) is increased relative to the non-mitochondrial proteome upon knockdown of SAE1. If mitochondrial protein content is increased, then there will be more of the signal-anchored transcription factor and more of the signal-anchored protease, and thus increased TF release and reporter production. More focused validation experiments will be needed to confirm this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It would be good to have the study quickly published to guide people in the community who are going to develop screening approaches for their interested directions.</p><p>Two suggestions:</p><p>1. In Figure 2A, the authors proposed three possibilities of the effect of the sgRNA: 1. blocking TA targeting of the protease, 2. affecting the level of the protease, and 3. no effect. I would suggest adding the fourth possibility. It is also likely that the sgRNA may also affect the correct targeting of the membrane anchored TF. To my understanding, as long as the protease is not able to meet the TF, no mCherry could be produced. Again this possiblity could be controlled by the SA experiments the authors have performed.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree and have edited the manuscript to describe that this is another possible way by which the HiLITR signal could be reduced. As you mention, the purpose of using multiple screening configurations, such as the SA screen in addition to the TA screen, was to eliminate nonspecific hits as well as false positives that interfere with the membrane anchored TF (which would cause HiLITR signal reduction in both the TA and SA screens and not be of interest).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure S4G, could the authors explain why the mito protease generated more mCherry than the peroxisome protease，since the TF is located on the peroxisome?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this result is a consequence of two factors. First, despite several attempts, we were unable to generate a peroxisomal protease that localizes exclusively to peroxisomes. Imaging of the protease in Figure 1 —figure supplement 4F suggests it is also localized to some extent to the mitochondria and/or ER, although this was not directly confirmed. Second, HiLITR activation increases with greater protease expression, and the mitochondrial protease is expressed at higher levels than the peroxisomal protease (compare 1st and 2nd FACS plots in row 2 of Figure 1 —figure supplement 4G).
