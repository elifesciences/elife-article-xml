sequences in nucleosome-embedded postmitotic chromatin. Yet, the mechanisms controlling postmitotic neuronal chromatin accessibility are poorly understood. Here, we show that unique distal enhancers define the <italic>Pet1</italic> neuron lineage that generates serotonin (5-HT) neurons in mice. Heterogeneous single-cell chromatin landscapes are established early in postmitotic <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons and reveal the putative regulatory programs driving <italic>Pet1</italic> neuron subtype identities. Distal enhancer accessibility is highly dynamic as <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons mature, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors that reorganize postmitotic neuronal chromatin. We find that Pet1 and Lmx1b control chromatin accessibility to select <italic>Pet1</italic>-lineage-specific enhancers for 5-HT neurotransmission. Additionally, these factors are required to maintain chromatin accessibility during early maturation suggesting that postmitotic neuronal open chromatin is unstable and requires continuous regulatory input. Together, our findings reveal postmitotic transcription factors that reorganize accessible chromatin for neuron specialization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>serotonin neuron</kwd><kwd>neuronal maturation</kwd><kwd>single cell</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>Pet1</kwd><kwd>Lmx1b</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH117643</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deneris</surname><given-names>Evan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH062723</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deneris</surname><given-names>Evan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30 MH122173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xinrui L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007250</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xinrui L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201940009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tabuchi</surname><given-names>Nobuko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Overseas Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tabuchi</surname><given-names>Nobuko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kitt</surname><given-names>Meagan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH125918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deneris</surname><given-names>Evan S</given-names></name><name><surname>Spencer</surname><given-names>William C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Terminal selectors reorganize postmitotic neuronal chromatin to select cis-regulatory elements during 5-HT neuron maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Specialized neuronal identities are acquired through the differential expression of genes that specify transmitter usage, build dendritic and axonal architecture, and control synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hobert, 2011</xref>). The maturation of neuronal functions is an extended process that plays out over several weeks of mid fetal to early postnatal life in mice and through the first few years of life in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stiles and Jernigan, 2010</xref>), as postmitotic neuronal transcriptomes mature to a stable state. Unique combinations of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) selectively activate and repress genes to assemble the transcriptomes that encode individual neuron identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polleux et al., 2007</xref>). Genes with variants associated with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders exhibit enriched expression in maturing neurons and are often involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation; their developmental dysfunction is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heavner and Smith, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Selective expression of neuronal identity genes depends on selective accessibility of promoter and enhancer sequences embedded in postmitotic nucleosomal-organized chromatin to regulatory factor inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gallegos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perino and Veenstra, 2016</xref>). Chromatin accessibility is dynamic as brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2018</xref>) and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Preissl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stroud et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trevino et al., 2021</xref>) mature. Yet, we have a poor understanding of how the dynamics of accessible chromatin in postmitotic neurons prefigures acquisition of neurotransmitter identities and myriad other molecular and morphological features of specialized neurons. Further, the regulatory factors involved in selecting postmitotic accessible chromatin regions to enable sequence-specific activation of unique combinations of identity features have not been identified.</p><p>Control of 5-HT neuron development is of particular interest as 5-HT has expansive modulatory effects on central neural circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Celada et al., 2013</xref>). Altered serotonergic gene expression, brought about by either genetic or environmental factors, has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, stress-related anxiety disorders, autism, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deneris and Wyler, 2012</xref>). Postmitotic 5-HT neuron precursors terminally differentiate in the ventral hindbrain to acquire the capacity for 5-HT synthesis, reuptake, vesicular transport, and degradation through the coordinate expression of the 5-HT neurotransmission genes <italic>Tph2</italic>, <italic>Ddc</italic>, <italic>Gch1</italic>, <italic>Slc6a4</italic> and <italic>Slc22a3</italic>, <italic>Slc18a2</italic>, and <italic>Maoa/b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deneris and Gaspar, 2018</xref>). Subsequently, newborn 5-HT neurons enter a maturation stage during which serotonergic transcriptomes are highly dynamic as 5-HT neurons refine their terminal identities, migrate to populate the various raphe nuclei, acquire mature firing properties, and establish expansive connectivity throughout the brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deneris and Gaspar, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The ETS domain factor Pet1 and the LIM homeodomain (HD) factor Lmx1b are terminal selector TFs in 5-HT neurons as they are continuously expressed beginning at the postmitotic precursor stage, control their own expression through direct positive autoregulation, and are required for the acquisition of 5-HT neuron terminal identity through sequence-specific transcriptional activation of 5-HT pathway genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deneris and Gaspar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hobert, 2008</xref>). Pet1 and Lmx1b are also required for the acquisition of serotonergic firing characteristics and formation of long-distance profusely arborized 5-HT axon architectures throughout the brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donovan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wyler et al., 2016</xref>). Pet1’s function in 5-HT neurons is clinically significant as recent studies identified biallelic loss of function of <italic>FEV</italic>, the human ortholog of <italic>Pet1</italic>, in autism cases suggesting that defects in transcriptional control of 5-HT neurons are a potential path to human neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The low abundance of many postmitotic neuron types has hindered the assay of their accessible chromatin landscapes and cis-regulatory architectures. Here, we adapted bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), scRNA-seq, and ChIPmentation protocols to map accessible chromatin and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) of developing 5-HT neurons. We then used these combined maps along with Pet1 and Lmx1b knockout mouse models and occupancy mapping to identify a previously unrecognized function of these TFs in regulating the chromatin accessibility of 5-HT neurotransmission and synapse genes. Together, our findings show that Pet1 and Lmx1b control the maturation of 5-HT connectivity not only through sequence-specific activation of select terminal effector genes but also by reorganizing postmitotic accessible chromatin at putative CREs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The unique accessible chromatin landscape of maturing postmitotic <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons</title><p>5-HT neurons are generated from <italic>Pet1-</italic>positive postmitotic precursors located in the embryonic ventral hindbrain from the isthmus to the caudal region of the myelencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hendricks et al., 1999</xref>).

This TAC shows enrichment of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks suggesting the presence of an active enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Previous transgenic assays, in vivo, demonstrated that this upstream region directs robust reporter expression to developing and adult 5-HT neurons present in each of the midbrain, pontine, and medullary raphe nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krueger and Deneris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scott et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scott et al., 2005b</xref>), hence providing functional validation of serotonergic enhancers we have defined with ATAC-seq and ChIPmentation. As further validation, we intersected all identified <italic>Pet1</italic> neuron TACs with the VISTA enhancer database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Visel et al., 2007</xref>).

Lmx1b-cKO 5-HT neurons display axon defects in which most axonal projections fail to reach the dLS and remain stalled within the medial forebrain bundle during development. However, a small number of Lmx1b-cKO 5-HT axons do extend into the dLS where they come in close proximity to post-synaptic cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donovan et al., 2019</xref>). We found that by postnatal day 15 (P15), 5-HT pericellular baskets were readily identified in wildtype brains. Further, as expected, some 5-HT axons reach the dLS in Pet1-cKO, Lmx1b-cKO, and DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). However, pericellular baskets could not be found in the remaining 5-HT axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f–g</xref>).

How postmitotic epigenetic programs control gene expression trajectories to encode mature neuronal identities is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gallegos et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we have defined the accessible chromatin landscape and the cis-regulatory architecture of developing <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons that generate mature 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hendricks et al., 1999</xref>). We show that the cis-regulatory landscape of embryonic <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons is highly dynamic as postmitotic <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons acquire serotonergic identities. Our scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq analyses reveal that the chromatin landscapes of neurons derived from a single TF lineage are highly heterogeneous and established early to prefigure and likely encode 5-HT neuron subtypes including those expressing the glutamatergic marker, <italic>Slc17a8</italic>. Previous studies have demonstrated the key role of terminal selectors, Pet1 and Lmx1b, in the differentiation and maturation of 5-HT neurons through sequence-specific transactivation of serotonergic terminal effector genes. We show here that an additional functional attribute of Pet1 and Lmx1b is to reorganize postmitotic chromatin accessibility to enable sequence-specific activation of serotonergic neurotransmission and synapse genes. Thus, our findings identify developmental regulators of postmitotic neuronal chromatin accessibility.</p><p>We found that distal transcriptional CRE accessibility is heterogeneous not only between <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons and other cell types but also within the <italic>Pet1</italic>-lineage neurons. Diversity in regulatory sequence accessibility is predictive of the transcriptomic profile of single <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons. Furthermore, the maturation of <italic>Pet1</italic> neuron putative CRE accessibility is highly correlated with the expression trajectories of their target genes as serotonergic functional properties progressively emerge. TACs linked to genes involved in synapse organization and axon development gain accessibility while those associated with cell cycle control and early embryonic morphogenesis lose accessibility. Importantly, the chromatin landscape is more dynamic between E11.5 and E14.5 than between E14.5 and E17.5, suggesting that the early postmitotic period comprises a highly active stage of chromatin maturation. Since <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons have exited the cell cycle, the temporal changes in open chromatin cannot be explained as an altered abundance of <italic>Pet1</italic> neuron subtypes. Rather, chromatin landscape within individual <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons is dynamic during postmitotic maturation.</p><p>The regulatory factors controlling chromatin dynamics in postmitotic neurons are not well defined. TFs with known pioneer activity such as Ascl1 that are expressed in serotonergic progenitors are significantly downregulated or undetectable in postmitotic <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aydin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wyler et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, our data suggests that new postmitotic euchromatic regions dynamically appear while other euchromatic regions are lost as 5-HT neuron identity is being acquired, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors that shape postmitotic neuronal chromatin. Additionally, several recent studies computationally mined the genome-wide accessible chromatin sequences and identified TF binding sites that are enriched in regions of dynamic chromatin in neurons or brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Preissl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trevino et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our findings support a founding paradigm in which terminal selector TFs, at least Pet1 and Lmx1b in mouse 5-HT neurons, reorganize the postmitotic neuronal epigenome to select specific gene CREs. We show that targeting of <italic>Pet1</italic> and <italic>Lmx1b</italic> in the early stages of postmitotic maturation significantly alters the <italic>Pet1</italic> neuron accessible chromatin landscape. CUT&amp;RUN assays suggest that Pet1 and Lmx1b directly control the accessibility of 5-HT-specific CREs linked to genes encoding terminal effectors of 5-HT identity and neurotransmission. In fact, we provide evidence in support of a role for Pet1 in initiating the conversion to euchromatin of multiple nucleosome-protected cis-regulatory sequences in postmitotic neurons, including enhancers linked to the serotonin transporter gene, <italic>Slc6a4</italic>. We further show that Pet1 is required for accessibility of its own autoregulated enhancer region that directs 5-HT neuron expression. Autoregulation is thought to boost and maintain terminal selector expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leyva-Díaz and Hobert, 2019</xref>). We found that in the absence of <italic>Pet1</italic> expression, <italic>Pet1</italic> enhancer accessibility is significantly reduced but is not fully closed. This suggests that Pet1 boosts its own expression through augmenting auto-enhancer accessibility that was previously initiated by upstream pioneers but was insufficient for proper expression levels of Pet1.</p><p>We present evidence suggesting Pet1 and Lmx1b are required to maintain 5-HT-specific open chromatin regions. Whereas pioneer factors in progenitor cells can drive cell lineage commitment and induce, through transient input, stable ‘memories’ of epigenetic states that are transmitted through further cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D’Urso and Brickner, 2014</xref>), our findings suggest that postmitotic accessible chromatin landscapes are unstable and require continuous terminal selector input at least during early postmitotic maturation to sustain the euchromatin state of CREs controlling terminal effector genes. Surprisingly, a larger number of chromatin accessibility changes were found after <italic>Pet1</italic> conditional targeting compared to constitutive germline <italic>Pet1</italic> targeting. We do not have a straightforward explanation for this difference but it may be due to compensatory effects from other regulators. While Lmx1b maintains accessibility of a distinct set of CREs independent of Pet1, chromatin accessibility of many <italic>Pet1-</italic>lineage TACs requires direct and non-redundant co-regulation by both TFs, reminiscent of the cooperative activities of TFs and pioneer factors in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holmberg and Perlmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>). Because a large number of cognate motif sites can exist in the genome for each individual TF, selective chromatin accessibility controlled by collaborative postmitotic reorganizers may serve to ensure that neuron-type-specific effector genes are selectively activated only in the presence of multiple positive regulatory inputs. Other TFs may also perform similar function in other neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaway et al., 2021</xref>). The mechanism by which Pet1 and Lmx1b program neuronal chromatin is not understood, but could involve the recruitment of chromatin remodelers or direct cooperative displacement of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to neurotransmitter synthesis, neurons must develop axonal and synaptic connectivity in order to transmit signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kratsios et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spencer and Deneris, 2017</xref>). Pet1 and Lmx1b reorganize the access to CREs for both 5-HT neurotransmission and synaptic connectivity. As a result, the acquisition of distinct functional properties is developmentally coupled. A growing body of evidence supports the idea that alterations in 5-HT neurotransmission cause behavioral changes related to those that characterize neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Suri et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Paschalis Kratsios as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work mapped accessible chromatin regions and gene expression using bulk and single cell analysis, performed chromatin immunoprecipitation studies of Pet-1 and Lmx1b transcription factors and investigated effects of Pet1 and Lmx1b loss of function on chromatin accessibility. The study generated a useful resource of genomic data and provided new insights into the dynamic regulation of accessible chromatin regions in postmitotic neurons. Technically, this is a tour-de-force effort.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers think the manuscript does not require additional experimental data, but it does require additional analysis of the existing data (as listed in the detailed reviewer comments below) and major revisions of the text.</p><p>1. While the manuscript provides important new data, the model how serotonergic neuron specification is controlled by Pet1 and Lmx1b remains unclear. Most importantly, the authors need to integrate better the single cell analysis with the global analysis of chromatin accessibility and TF binding data. Specifically, it would be quite interesting to address whether the pan-serotonergic selector factors also contribute to subtype diversification.</p><p>2. Another important point that deserves more attention is the analysis of differentially enriched motifs in neuronal subtypes and along the temporal trajectory. We also agree that the discrepancy between proximal vs distal TF binding and changes in chromatin accessibility should be better analyzed and highlighted in the manuscript. On the other hand, we are not sure whether correlative analysis between Pet1/Lmx1b binding sites and gene expression will be that informative, as control of gene expression is typically a result of complex integrated regulatory inputs from multiple distal enhancers.</p><p>3. We would like to see a better description of the 11 single cell clusters, and it would be great if the authors attempted to correlate the cluster identity with published adult serotonergic single cell data. However, we do understand that such analysis might be challenging and hard to interpret, so we do not think that the publication should be made conditional on this analysis.</p><p>4. Despite the wealth of new genomic data, the focus of the manuscript is somewhat elusive. The goal seems to be to study the mechanisms that control chromatin accessibility in postmitotic serotonergic neurons during their subtype diversification. The manuscript will benefit from clearer writing, explicit stating what hypotheses are being tested and better explanation of the rationale for the performed experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Can the &quot;pioneer&quot; activity of Pet1 (or Lmx1b) be separated from its transcriptional activity? For example, ATAC-Seq and CUT&amp;RUN data show that open chromatin regions are bound by Pet1. So, if Pet1 binds at a single genomic location upstream of gene x, does this binding event triggers the chromatin to open AND transcription to start? And what happens in cases where multiple binding peaks for Pet1 are found upstream of a gene? Some peaks are responsible for opening chromatin, while others for transcriptional activation?</p><p>2. Addressing the following questions by editing the text and/or re-analyzing existing data (RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, and Cut&amp;RUN) could help the reader: Do all known Pet1 targets genes from previous RNA-Seq in serotonin neurons also require Pet1 to &quot;open&quot; their cis-regulatory regions? Are there any Pet1 targets whose expression is affected by Pet1 inactivation, but Pet1 does not open their cis-reg region? Lastly, are there any genes for which Pet1 only exerts a &quot;pioneer function&quot;? That is, it only opens their chromatin, but does not control directly the expression of these genes?</p><p>The same questions apply to Lmx1b.</p><p>3. It is very intriguing that the expression of 5-HT genes (Tph2, Slc6a4, Slc22a3) is low or undetectable at e14.5 despite their &quot;open&quot; chromatin status at this stage. Another intriguing observation comes from a previous study by the authors reporting that Pet1 switches its targets postnatally (Wyler et al., J Neurosci. 2016). One of the genes that is initially responsive to Pet1 is Tph2, but then, at postnatal stages, Tph2 expression does not depend on Pet1. Do the current data (e.g. CUT&amp;RUN, ATAC-Seq, ChIP-seq) on WT and Pet1 cKO neurons help explain how Pet1 switches its targets in 5-HT neurons? For example, is Pet1 required to open the chromatin surrounding Tph2 and also activate Tph2 transcription early, but at later postnatal stages Pet1 only opens the chromatin for other TFs to activate Tph2 transcription?</p><p>4. Are ATAC-seq experiments quantitative enough to allow for comparisons between genotypes? For example, the height of each peak is compared between WT and cKO conditions in Figures 5e and 6i,j.</p><p>5. The authors discovered a new function for Pet1 and Lmx1b and therefore propose that these TFs define a previously unrecognized category of TFs termed &quot;postmitotic neuron chromatin reorganizers&quot; (PnCRs) that act specifically during postmitotic neuron maturation to shape the accessible chromatin landscapes and thereby select enhancers required for acquisition of specialized neuronal identities. While it is tempting to &quot;name&quot; the TFs, I would suggest to simply &quot;name/state&quot; their new function, especially in light of the fact that Pet1 and Lmx1b have already been termed &quot;terminal selectors&quot;. To avoid confusion and help the reader, the authors should consider something along the following lines: Pet1 and Lmx1b exert a dual function: they not only act as terminal selectors, but also as chromatin reorganizers in postmitotic 5-HT neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should discuss the identity of the 11 major subtypes with unique chromatin accessibility patterns (Figure 2d; Supplemental Figure 2b) identified by scATAC and RNAseq analysis. How many of the clusters can be mapped on known serotonergic subtypes? How well do the subtypes map on published scRNAseq serotonergic neuron data?</p><p>Figure 3c: numbers do not match – gained and lost TACs do not add up to the numbers of peaks detected.</p><p>Figure3e: It is unclear how the enhancer-gene association was performed for this data. Were enhancer-gene associations used from the sc-seq data? Those were performed at e14.5 and would not have some of the peaks at e11.5 and e17.5 used in this plot. Were new enhancer-gene associations created from the temporal data- in this case this plot is making a circular argument (if the enhancer-gene associations are made based on co-regulation between expression and accessibility).</p><p>Figure 3i: needs more clear labeling of each of the gene sets in the four heatmaps</p><p>Figure 4a: pink dots in PCA seem extra?</p><p>Figure 4a: the PCA analysis shows that TACs are dominantly influenced by neuronal maturation, but such analysis does not reveal whether the Pet1-/- neurons changed identity. Instead, the authors should perform PCA analysis at one timepoint and include Pet1 negative wt neurons in the PCA analysis. This will address whether Pet1-/- neurons are more similar to Pet1 positive or Pet1 negative wt neurons.</p><p>Figure 4c-e: The analysis and interpretation of the correlation of chromatin accessibility with Pet1 binding in wt and mutant cells is extremely confusing. It is not clear what the main conclusion of this section is and what data support the conclusions. Figure 4c shows all TACs at different ages and plots their change in accessibility – the overall decrease of accessibility in Pet1-/- neurons is striking and surprising. Is this perhaps a technical issue? It is hard to believe that the loss of Pet1 TF that binds only to a subset of accessible sites results in a global ~4 fold reduction in chromatin accessibility. What is the number of TACs that gain, lose or do not change in Pet1-/- neurons? Is it correct that only 200 TACs are Pet1 regulated (i.e. bind Pet1 and change in KO)? How many Pet1 binding sites there are? How many of these binding sites are in TACs and how many are outside TACs? How are &quot;Pet1-dependent&quot; TACs defined?</p><p>The authors conclude that Pet1 is involved both in opening chromatin and in maintaining open chromatin. What differentiates Pet1 binding sites that gain accessibility compared from the sites that have high accessibility already at e11 (before Pet1 binds) or from the sites that loose accessibility in the conditional Pet1 knockout? Is it possible that sites that exhibit lower accessibility in conditional mice had not acquired full accessibility at e12.5 (i.e. the data cannot be interpreted as evidence for the role of TFs in the maintenance of TACs)</p><p>Figure 5: Pet1 cKO has a stronger effect on chromatin accessibility than the Pet1 full knockout. Is this a technical issue? If not, what are the chromatin regions affected in the cKO but not in full KO- are these enhancers based on chromatin profile (generated in Figure 1 at e14.5)? How do you explain these results?</p><p>The authors should integrate better the single cell analysis with analysis of Pet1 and Lmx1b binding and mutants. Do Pet1 and Lmx1b regulate TACs and expression levels of subtype specific genes in addition to pan-Pet1 lineage genes? Are these motifs co-enriched with other, more cell type specific motifs at subtype-specific peaks?</p><p>While majority of Lmx1b co-binds with Pet1, majority of Pet1 binds independently from Lmx1b. The data on Lmx1b and Pet1 binding overlap should be presented as a scatter plot rather than Venn diagrams. Are co-bound TACs regulated in a different way compared to TACs bound by Pet1 or Lmx1b only?</p><p>Considering that Pet1 expression depends on Lmx1b, the authors should address whether Pet1 expression is lost in Lmx1b CKO or whether it is maintained independently of Lmx1b.</p><p>Figure 7e: Legend says &quot;Differential expression (from E11.5 to E17.5) of the genes associated with Pet1- occupied TACs in Pet1-cKO vs. wildtype 5-HT neurons (left)…&quot;, however the y-axis in plot is labeled &quot;e17.5 KO/wt&quot;. If the plot is correctly labeled in the figure, it seems that genes associated with TACs are not changing expression in expected patterns. However, it does look like some synaptic genes do show reduced expression (Figure 7 and supp Figure 7). It would be interesting to know how gene expression is affected globally in cKO and DKO conditions, and if the genes affected are mainly pan-pet1 lineage genes (like 5-HT, synaptic, etc) or also subtype specific genes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In general, I felt the work, as it is presently written, does not flow very well, going back and forward in stages and techniques. I am aware it is a lot of data and different methods but maybe it would be better organized as: (1) longitudinal data e11, e14, e17; (2) mutants longitudinal 3) e14.5 single cell data</p><p>2. I find authors often focus on specific examples from already well-characterized targets of Pet1 and Lmx1b, such as 5HT pathway genes but I miss a more unbiased analysis. Also, it would be nice to include a more detailed and integrated analysis of the embryonic scATACseq and scRNAseq with the adult scRNAseq (Okaty et al. and/or Ren et al. reports) as well as a more profound study of differential TF expression and TF motif enrichment in different TACs of different 5HT neuron subclasses, that could maybe help identify new TFs involved in subtype specification. Similarly, those analysis could also be done comparing differential TF expression and motif enrichment in differentially accessible TACs along time (e11, e14 and e17 data) to try to unravel TFs involved in maturation or in specific transient events.</p><p>3. The abstract mentions several conclusions, I find some of them are not really novel or lack enough data to support them:</p><p>a) &quot;heterogeneous chromatin landscapes are established early&quot;: this has been already shown for other neuronal types.</p><p>b) &quot;reveal the regulatory programs driving subtype identities of Pet1-lineage</p><p>neurons that generate serotonin (5-HT) neurons&quot;: I don´t think present data identify regulatory programs (that is networks of TFs and their targets).</p><p>c) Dynamic enhancers in postmitotic neurons have been already shown.</p><p>d) &quot;We find that Pet1 and Lmx1b control chromatin accessibility to select Pet1-lineage specific enhancers for 5-HT neurotransmission and synaptogenesis&quot; The description of changes in chromatin accessibility is interesting, however, the role of Pet1 and Lmx1b controlling gene expression of 5HT neurotransmission and synaptogenesis is not new.</p><p>e) &quot;Required to maintain accessible chromatin in maturing neurons&quot;, also interesting however both TFs are already described to be required for gene expression maintenance</p><p>4. Regarding the mouse model: what is the % of 5HT neurons that are Pet1:YFP negative in each analysed time point? and vice versa, are all Pet1:YFP cells 5HT positive?</p><p>5. Why scATAC approach identifies 60,117 accessible sites not identified in the bulk Pet1? Are those uniquely identified TACs present only in subpopulations of Pet1 positive cells?</p><p>6. How do the 11 chromatin clusters of Pet1 scATAC correlate with adult scRNAseq data? It would be nice to have an integrated analysis of the embryonic and adult scRNAseq and the scATACseq data (including Okaty et al. and/or Ren et al. reports) to find the embryonic chromatin correlates of the adult 5HT subtypes.</p><p>7. Motif enrichment in scATAC clusters (Sup figure 3c). (1) Can the authors speculate on why ETS motif is only enriched in Tph2 cluster and LIM motif in Lrfn5 cluster? (2) could this motif enrichment analysis be combined with cluster specific or enriched TF expression for each family to identify TF candidates for subtype specification? For example, authors mention enriched expression of nkx6.1 for one cluster, which also shows enrichment in NK motifs (this double match TF expression with TF motif is very interesting and should be more clearly mentioned). Similar correlation analysis should be done for other TFs, TF motifs and clusters.</p><p>8. Sup figure 4j: motif enrichment of gained and lost TACs. Are the same motifs present in gained from e11 to e14 than those gained from e14 to e17? and the same question applies for the lost motifs. And as mentioned already, it would be advisable to merge TF expression dynamics with TF motif enrichment dynamics.</p><p>9. How does gene expression, gains and losses between wt and Pet1 mutants at different stages correlate with TACs: (1) What is the % of genes downregulated in Pet1 mutant compared to control that shows at least one assigned TAC in wt scATACseq or in bulk atacseq (2) from those, what is the % of downregulated genes in Pet1 mutant with TAC that lose accessibility in at least one assigned TAC? Similar analysis will be interesting for the &gt;1000 genes with gained expression in e11.5 Pet1 mutants reported in Wyler et al. 2016.</p><p>10. Are genes associated with TACs lost in Pet1 mutant expressed in specific clusters of 5HT or broadly expressed in 5ht neurons? are they 5HT specific?</p><p>11. Could authors speculate why Pet1-/- phenotype is milder than Pet1cKO? (372 TACs less accessible and 3 more accessible compared to 1834 and 391 in cKO), is there any compensatory effect in the regular mutant? How do these 372 TACs and 3 TACs and their respective assigned genes match with DEX genes in Pet1 mutants at e14?</p><p>12. What genes are assigned to the 391 TACs gained in Pet1cKO? do they correlate with gained gene expression in this mutant background? what motifs are enriched in these TACs? what GO terms?</p><p>13. Most differential TACs in Pet1 lineage are found in distal intergenic or introns, and show enhancer chromatin marks, however CUT and RUN binding for both Pet1 and Lmx1b is found preferentially at proximal regions (promoters). Could authors specify de % of proximal TACs with Pet1 or Lmx1b binding compared to % of distal TACs with binding? Is motif enrichment in TACs different in proximal and distal TACs? What is the mechanistic explanation of this discrepancy between CUT and RUN binding and differential TACs and lost TACs in the mutants?</p><p>14. Donovan et al. showed Lmx1b is upstream Pet1 expression, at least in some 5HT neurons, Is the effect on chromatin accessibility of Lmx1b mutant mediated, at least in part, by the loss of Pet1? How many lost TACs in Lmx1b are bound by Pet1 but not by Lmx1b?</p><p>15. I would remove the last section of the manuscript, as I don´t think the data support a role in synaptogenesis: Authors mention vglut3 and syt1 as panneuronal genes, however they are neuronal effector genes not expressed in all neurons but in specific neurons subtypes. Moreover, they are not involved in synaptogenesis but in synaptic function and neurotransmission. Finally, the analysis of pericellular baskets does not make much sense as these mutants show defects in axon projections to start with.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75970.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers think the manuscript does not require additional experimental data, but it does require additional analysis of the existing data (as listed in the detailed reviewer comments below) and major revisions of the text.</p><p>1.

Some peaks are responsible for opening chromatin, while others for transcriptional activation?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the simplest interpretation of our findings is that Pet1 is able to open partially or completely inaccessible chromatin and subsequently engage in transcriptional activation. However, the details of Pet1 action are likely more complex and will require future study to elucidate.</p><p>It is difficult to definitively separate the chromatin “pioneering” and transcriptional activities of TFs, but we do observe instances suggesting the two processes may be decoupled. For example, there is significant Pet1 and Lmx1b occupancy at gene promoters that correlates strongly with Pet1/Lmx1b dependent gene expression, yet ablating Pet1 and/or Lmx1b did not result in a significant loss of chromatin accessibility at those promoters, suggesting that factors other than Pet1 and Lmx1b could be responsible for maintaining accessibility in those TSS proximal regions. As another example, at E14.5 Pet1 and Lmx1b are detected in all <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons by scRNA-seq and the TACs of 5-HT neurotransmission genes <italic>Tph2</italic>, <italic>Slc6a4</italic>, and <italic>Slc22a3</italic> are in an accessible state, yet the expression of these genes is low or undetected in many individual <italic>Pet1</italic> neurons, suggesting that there is a delay in Pet1/Lmx1b transactivation and chromatin opening preceded gene transcription.</p><p>The reviewer raises a number of other interesting questions, some of which cannot be answered definitively with our present findings. For example, we do not believe our findings shed light on whether Pet1 occupancy at some of an array of binding sites strictly controls opening while others strictly control transcriptional activation. It seems addressing this question would require systematic editing of individual binding sites, in vivo, followed by chromatin mapping and expression analyses.</p><p>Single cell studies of dividing cells (Ma et al., 2020; Trevino et al., 2021) drew a similar conclusion that chromatin accessibility often occurs prior to mRNA expression.</p><p>The reviewer’s proposal that Pet1 binding at different sites could have different functions (some for opening chromatin, while others for transcriptional activation) is a very intriguing idea. However, it is difficult to test this idea because TAC regions usually contain the binding sites of multiple TFs, so ablating the TF or mutating a binding site of the TF that is maintaining chromatin access also prevents the regional binding of other TFs that could be responsible for gene transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Addressing the following questions by editing the text and/or re-analyzing existing data (RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, and Cut&amp;RUN) could help the reader: Do all known Pet1 targets genes from previous RNA-Seq in serotonin neurons also require Pet1 to &quot;open&quot; their cis-regulatory regions? Are there any Pet1 targets whose expression is affected by Pet1 inactivation, but Pet1 does not open their cis-reg region? Lastly, are there any genes for which Pet1 only exerts a &quot;pioneer function&quot;? That is, it only opens their chromatin, but does not control directly the expression of these genes?</p><p>The same questions apply to Lmx1b.</p></disp-quote><p>Our present findings suggest that not all known Pet1 target genes in serotonin neurons require Pet1 to open their cis-regulatory regions. There are Pet1 targets whose expression is affected by Pet1 inactivation, but Pet1 does not appear to open their associated CREs. Conversely, there are also examples for which Pet1 only exerts a “pioneer function” and does not control gene expression.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for these phenomena. First, not all differentially regulated genes in the Pet1 KO 5-HT neurons have direct nearby Pet1 occupancy, which suggests that some differential gene expression is due to either indirect or compensatory effects through the actions of other TFs, and therefore we do not expect to find Pet1 mediated chromatin accessibility changes near those genes. Secondly, Pet1 likely occupies CREs in combination with many other TFs similar to what we have shown between Pet1 and Lmx1b. In some instances, the removal of Pet1 is sufficient to destabilize the protein complex at a genomic region and result in the collapse of chromatin accessibility, whereas in other instances, chromatin accessibility in a genomic region is maintained in the absence of Pet1. We hypothesize that this difference can be attributed to the activities of the other regulatory factors that occupy CREs in combination with Pet1.</p><p>Lastly, as the reviewer proposed, it is very possible that the “pioneering” and transcriptional activities of TFs can be decoupled, though our data lack the resolution to definitively conclude this with certainty. To prioritize accuracy, we limited our TAC-to-gene association parameter so that TACs were only assigned to genes that were within 500kb, whereas enhancers are known to act across greater distances than 500kb, so we do not claim to have captured all TAC-to-gene interactions. In addition, CRE association with genes can be very fluid. For example, studies have shown that deletion of one TSS proximal enhancer can lead to compensatory activities from a more distal enhancer (e.g. Hong et al., 2008; Frankel et al., 2010; Perry et al., 2010). Therefore, it is possible that TACs dependent on Pet1 are not paired to all actual target genes.</p><p>Same for Lmx1b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is very intriguing that the expression of 5-HT genes (Tph2, Slc6a4, Slc22a3) is low or undetectable at e14.5 despite their &quot;open&quot; chromatin status at this stage. Another intriguing observation comes from a previous study by the authors reporting that Pet1 switches its targets postnatally (Wyler et al., J Neurosci. 2016). One of the genes that is initially responsive to Pet1 is Tph2, but then, at postnatal stages, Tph2 expression does not depend on Pet1. Do the current data (e.g. CUT&amp;RUN, ATAC-Seq, ChIP-seq) on WT and Pet1 cKO neurons help explain how Pet1 switches its targets in 5-HT neurons? For example, is Pet1 required to open the chromatin surrounding Tph2 and also activate Tph2 transcription early, but at later postnatal stages Pet1 only opens the chromatin for other TFs to activate Tph2 transcription?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the dynamic changes in gene target sensitivity to Pet1 are interesting; this observation is what initially motivated our interest in probing the dynamics of postmitotic chromatin accessibility. Unfortunately, we do not believe our current findings offer any insight into the switching mechanism. We envision many potential mechanisms: (1) At around birth, Pet1 is no longer needed to remodel chromatin around some serotonergic genes such as Tph2 and other TFs such Lmx1b are sufficient for this job. To begin to investigate this idea we would need to target Pet1 at around P0 to see if loss of Pet1 at that time no longer had an effect on chromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Are ATAC-seq experiments quantitative enough to allow for comparisons between genotypes?

The authors discovered a new function for Pet1 and Lmx1b and therefore propose that these TFs define a previously unrecognized category of TFs termed &quot;postmitotic neuron chromatin reorganizers&quot; (PnCRs) that act specifically during postmitotic neuron maturation to shape the accessible chromatin landscapes and thereby select enhancers required for acquisition of specialized neuronal identities. While it is tempting to &quot;name&quot; the TFs, I would suggest to simply &quot;name/state&quot; their new function, especially in light of the fact that Pet1 and Lmx1b have already been termed &quot;terminal selectors&quot;. To avoid confusion and help the reader, the authors should consider something along the following lines: Pet1 and Lmx1b exert a dual function: they not only act as terminal selectors, but also as chromatin reorganizers in postmitotic 5-HT neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We do appreciate the reviewer’s acknowledgment that we have discovered a chromatin reorganizing function for terminal selectors in maturing postmitotic neurons. We agree that our proposal to designate these as PnCRs, may be confusing since they already go by the descriptor, terminal selector. Yet, we maintain our findings reveal reorganization of postmitotic chromatin accessibility, which is a previously unrecognized functional attribute of how terminal selectors work. Thus, our findings advance the understanding of how terminal selectors determine specialized neuronal identities: terminal selectors, at least Pet1 and Lmx1b in mouse 5-HT neurons, remodel postmitotic accessible chromatin for selection of enhancers. Subsequently they transactivate via those selected enhancers, genes whose expression contributes to specialized neuronal identities. In this interpretation, Pet1 and Lmx1b do not possess dual and distinct terminal selector and chromatin reorganizing functions but rather the chromatin reorganizing function of these TFs is an inherent feature of their terminal selector action that operates prior to or together with transactivation. We believe it is reasonable and appropriate to discuss this duality of terminal selector action that has been inferred from the study of Pet1 and Lmx1b. How do these TFs reorganize postmitotic chromatin? One possibility is that they directly alter nucleosome positioning upon binding to ETS/HD motifs. Alternatively, we hypothesize that through their initial binding at ETS/HD motifs they recruit chromatin remodeling complexes that further open chromatin at these motifs for optimal sequence specific gene transactivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should discuss the identity of the 11 major subtypes with unique chromatin accessibility patterns (Figure 2d; Supplemental Figure 2b) identified by scATAC and RNAseq analysis.

(2019) study used <italic>Sert</italic> positive neurons in adult dorsal and median raphe. Our analysis included cells from all raphe nuclei at E14.5. Since there is a large time gap between our datasets, it can be difficult for the integration algorithm to identify anchors between the two datasets. Nevertheless, we performed a reciprocal unimodal UMAP projection of our E14.5 scRNA with the Okaty et al. ~2mo scRNA data. First, we projected our scRNA clustering and UMAP structure onto the adult scRNA data. 93% of Okaty 10X DRN cells map to our Tph2/Slc6a4 (1099) and Pax5/En1 (1082) clusters. Since Tph2, Slc6a4, and the rhombomere 1 markers (e.g. En1) are highest in these two clusters, it is not surprising that the adult DRN neurons, which are only derived from isthmus rhombomere 1, are the most highly correlated with these clusters. Next, we projected the Okaty DRN scRNA clustering/UMAP onto our E14.5 scRNA. Since we did not have the exact clustering from Okaty et al., we analyzed their data according to their methods as precisely as possible, although it was not possible to reproduce the clustering exactly. Despite this issue, our clustering (14 clusters) and UMAP are strikingly similar to the results in Okaty et al. Then, we used the top cluster marker genes from Okaty et al., to determine which of our clusters are most similar to the Okaty clusters. By projecting the adult UMAP structure onto our E14.5 scRNA, most of our cells mapped to adult cluster 13, which are high Slc17a8 and low Tph2+ cells. This is reasonable since most of our cells have high Slc17a8 expression. The next largest number of cells mapped to adult cluster 1, which are high Tph2 expressing cells. 138 cells were mapped to cluster 7, which co-express Tph2 and Slc17a8. Lastly, 35 cells map to cluster 12, which are the Met expressing cells. For clarity, we added the projection of the Okaty data onto the embryonic clusters the manuscript in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1, since we do not have exactly the same clustering as published for the adult data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3c: numbers do not match – gained and lost TACs do not add up to the numbers of peaks detected.</p></disp-quote><p>In our original figure panel, the gain/loss TAC numbers referred to the TACs with greater or equal than 2 fold change (increase = gain; decrease = loss) in accessibility and FDR &lt;0.01, not the number of TACs that entirely appear/disappear between time points, so it did not add up to the total number of peaks called at each developmental time point.

Furthermore, to ensure the best accuracy we used the stringent parameter that a pairing is made only if the detected TAC was within 500kb of the gene. As a result, we only paired a small fraction of TACs with candidate genes.

We present the findings this way to make the point that there is an overall decrease in accessibility of TACs in Pet1-/- neurons compared to wildtype. This supports our interesting and novel conclusion that Pet1 is mainly required for opening or maintaining chromatin accessibility in postmitotic neurons. 372 TACs lost accessibility and 3 TACs gained accessibility (fold change ≥2, FDR&lt;0.05) at E14.5 while the remaining E14.5 Pet1 neuron TACs did not change accessibility in a statistically significant manner. The reviewer is correct that only 200 of these TACs are Pet1 regulated (i.e. bind Pet1 and change in Pet1-/-). As shown in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1, Pet1 CUT&amp;RUN peak calling identified 23,594 Pet1 binding sites, 22,285 of which are in TACs and 3280 are outside of TACs.

One possible explanation for this is that while the majority of Pet1- or Lmx1b-regulated TACs are likely enhancers, a significant percentage did not have common enhancer or promoter associated histone modifications (e.g. Figures 5d and 6e) and could therefore be silencers that negatively influence target gene expression, or insulators that do not directly influence expression. For example, we have previously found that the loss of Pet1 can lead to the activation of repressed genes (Wyler et al., 2016), suggesting that Pet1 could have repressor activities. Another possibility is that enhancer usage is dynamic in neurons. When one enhancer becomes decommissioned in the KO neuron, shadow enhancers that act redundantly on the same gene may compensate to maintain gene expression.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer we added a panel to show how gene expression is affected globally in DKO condition in the figure supplement for Figure 7.

Our study reports dynamic enhancer accessibility in embryonic Pet1 lineage neurons, which we presented as a basis to predict (or raise the possibility) that certain factors exist to remodel postmitotic chromatin and thereby support postmitotic neuron maturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) &quot;We find that Pet1 and Lmx1b control chromatin accessibility to select Pet1-lineage specific enhancers for 5-HT neurotransmission and synaptogenesis&quot; The description of changes in chromatin accessibility is interesting, however, the role of Pet1 and Lmx1b controlling gene expression of 5HT neurotransmission and synaptogenesis is not new.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree that we have previously shown using RNAseq and RT-qPCR that Pet1 and Lmx1b control expression of 5-HT neurotransmission genes such as Tph2 and Slc6a4. So yes, we have already shown that these TFs control 5HT neurotransmission gene expression. We note however, that none of our previous papers have focused on gene expression underlying synaptogenesis or synapse functions. What is new in our present work is a deeper mechanistic understanding of how these TFs control gene expression: we show that Pet1 and Lmx1b remodel postmitotic chromatin accessibility to enable the expression of neurotransmission genes and genes needed for synaptogenesis in maturing 5-HT neurons. The identification of TFs that remodeling postmitotic neuronal chromatin is new and this discovery was made possible by our earlier published work at the level of 5HT neurotransmission gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) &quot;Required to maintain accessible chromatin in maturing neurons&quot;, also interesting however both TFs are already described to be required for gene expression maintenance</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is true that we have previously reported findings indicating that Pet1 and Lmx1b maintain the expression of 5-HT neurotransmission genes such as Tph2. That is not the point of our current paper. The current study builds on this knowledge to put forth a new and surprising finding: these TFs maintain gene expression by maintaining accessible CREs in postmitotic neurons. The remodeling of accessible chromatin by Pet1and Lmx1b is the most novel and interesting of our findings in our present manuscript and was made possible by our previous studies of these TFs.</p><p>Our findings suggest that by controlling chromatin accessibility, these TFs not only directly modulate transcription activation as previously shown, but also impact the global landscape of active CREs and available TF binding sites which, in turn, can alter the global network of regulatory factor inputs. It broadens our understanding of how neuronal identity is maintained in postmitotic neurons (e.g. not just maintenance of transcription activation but also maintenance of CRE landscape).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Regarding the mouse model: what is the % of 5HT neurons that are Pet1:YFP negative in each analysed time point? and vice versa, are all Pet1:YFP cells 5HT positive?</p></disp-quote><p>The number of 5-HT neurons that are Pet1YFP positive is nearly 100% at all three time point. Therefore the % that are Pet1YFP negative is close to zero or is zero. At 11.5, &lt;5% of Pet1YFP+ cells are 5-HT+, at E14.5 roughly 22% of Pet1YFP+ cells are 5-HT+, and at E17.5, roughly 42% of Pet1YFP+ cells are 5-HT+. In adult 5-HT neurons nearly all Pet1YFP+ cells are 5-HT+. This is consistent with our scRNA-seq findings showing that not all Pet1-lineage neurons are Tph2 positive at embryonic time points.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with Alonso et al. (2013) and the Allen Brain Atlas: Tph2 expression is very sparse and limited to a few rostral neurons at E11.5 and then gradually expands throughout Pet1-lineage neurons at E14.5 and E17.5 and into adulthood.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Why scATAC approach identifies 60,117 accessible sites not identified in the bulk Pet1?

The remainder may not be called peaks in the bulk ATAC due to more stringent peak calling parameters compared to standard scATAC-seq methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. How do the 11 chromatin clusters of Pet1 scATAC correlate with adult scRNAseq data? It would be nice to have an integrated analysis of the embryonic and adult scRNAseq and the scATACseq data (including Okaty et al. and/or Ren et al. reports) to find the embryonic chromatin correlates of the adult 5HT subtypes.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to Reviewer 2 first point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Motif enrichment in scATAC clusters (Sup figure 3c). (1) Can the authors speculate on why ETS motif is only enriched in Tph2 cluster and LIM motif in Lrfn5 cluster? (2) could this motif enrichment analysis be combined with cluster specific or enriched TF expression for each family to identify TF candidates for subtype specification? For example, authors mention enriched expression of nkx6.1 for one cluster, which also shows enrichment in NK motifs (this double match TF expression with TF motif is very interesting and should be more clearly mentioned). Similar correlation analysis should be done for other TFs, TF motifs and clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>Bulk ATAC-seq results suggest that ETS motifs are highly enriched in general in <italic>Pet1-</italic>lineage neurons compared to other cell types. Within Pet1 neurons, the scATAC-seq suggests that one subpopulation (“Tph2/Slc6a4” cluster) has slightly more accessible (&lt;2 fold) ETS motifs than the other clusters, but that does not mean that other clusters have no accessible ETS motifs. Similar scenario applies to the LIM homeodomain motifs in the Lrfn5/Nr2f2 cluster. The Tph2/Slc6a4 cluster maps to rostral Pet1 neurons with higher Tph2 and Slc6a4 expression. Rostral 5-HT neurons are known to mature and synthesize 5-HT a day earlier than caudal 5-HT neurons. Pet1::EYFP is also activated earlier in the rostral 5-HT neurons. We would therefore speculate that this cluster is capturing that subpopulation that is advancing the fastest in development, perhaps due to earlier Pet1 activity.</p><p>We present Figure 2 —figure supplement 2d as a list of TF candidates for 5-HT neuron subtype specification. In response to the reviewer’s suggestion we mentioned in the text a second TF, Meis2, from the single cell data in addition to Nkx6.1, which the reviewer found to be interesting. As the reviewer mentioned, there is a lot of data in this study, so for space saving reasons we chose to focus mostly on our bulk ATAC-seq analyses, as the TFs we tested, Pet1 and Lmx1b, are mainly responsible for the maturation of shared Pet1 neuron TACs. We show the candidate subtype specific TFs to emphasize that there is further heterogeneity even within Pet1-lineage neurons, which is an interesting topic for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Sup figure 4j: motif enrichment of gained and lost TACs. Are the same motifs present in gained from e11 to e14 than those gained from e14 to e17? and the same question applies for the lost motifs. And as mentioned already, it would be advisable to merge TF expression dynamics with TF motif enrichment dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>Motifs present in gained from E11 to E14 are roughly similar to those gained from E14 to E17, the same for loss TACs. Bioinformatics correlation of motifs to gene expression changes is challenging because many TFs that are known to be active in developing 5-HT neurons belong to the same TF families. For example, Meis1, Meis2, Lmx1b, En1, En2, Pbx2, Hox factors, and POU domain factors are all homeodomain proteins that are expressed in Pet1 neurons. As another example, multiple Rfx-related factors are expressed in developing Pet1 neurons. However, these TFs with very similar binding motifs have different spatiotemporal expression patterns. For instance, Rfx2 and Rfx4 are downregulated from E11.5-E17.5, but Rfx1 is significantly upregulated, whereas Rfx7 and Rfx3 show little change in expression level. Because these TFs within the same or related families bind very similar motif sequences, it is difficult to assign specific genomic sites containing their cognate motif to the activity of a specific TF. Overall, we could detect a significant correlation between TF expression and motif accessibility if all members of the TF family show the same general trend in gene trajectories (e.g. correlation in downregulated <italic>Sox2</italic> expression and reduction in Sox family motifs within TACs from E11.5 to E17.5), but when multiple TFs have similar motifs, the results are difficult to interpret.</p><p>Additionally, it is possible for TF levels to not be tightly correlated with binding site accessibility level because some TFs may lack chromatin remodeling activity of their own such that its genomic binding is dependent on the priming of the chromatin or recruitment by other TFs and regulatory factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

I would remove the last section of the manuscript, as I don´t think the data support a role in synaptogenesis: Authors mention vglut3 and syt1 as panneuronal genes, however they are neuronal effector genes not expressed in all neurons but in specific neurons subtypes. Moreover, they are not involved in synaptogenesis but in synaptic function and neurotransmission. Finally, the analysis of pericellular baskets does not make much sense as these mutants show defects in axon projections to start with.</p></disp-quote><p>Our reasoning is that for synaptogenesis to occur many effector genes must be activated to express presynaptic machinery e.g. Syt1. If this is prevented functional synapse formation is impaired. We showed that loss of Pet1 or Lmx1b impairs Syt1 chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Our interpretation is that these terminal selectors are needed to reorganize postmitotic chromatin to enable expression of genes needed for the formation of presynaptic machinery, hence synaptogenesis, but we agree with the reviewer that this wording choice can be confusing and have revised it to “synapse function” in the text. We would like to point out that while most axon projections to the dorsolateral septum fail to form some make it there. These successfully projections are the ones we investigated to determine whether they form pericellular baskets.</p></body></sub-article></article>
