For example, the facultative intracellular pathogen <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium that resides in warm estuarine environments with some strains acquiring virulence factors that can cause illness, even death in animals including shrimp and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). This pathogen can cause acute gastroenteritis due to the consumption of contaminated, undercooked seafood and possibly septicemia when infecting open wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> contains a number of virulence factors, including hemolysins secreted via T2SS (Type 2 Secretion System) and two Type 3 Secretion Systems (T3SS1 and T3SS2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makino et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>T2SS is primarily involved in exporting folded proteins from the periplasm of most Gram-negative bacteria into extracellular environment and is a part of the widely conserved general secretory (Sec) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Korotkov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douzi et al., 2012</xref>). T2SS is a specialized multicomponent assembly that consists of four major components: an outer membrane secretin, an inner membrane channel, the pseudopilus and an ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Silva et al., 2020</xref>). T2SS secreted protein repertoire includes various carbohydrate, lipid and protein hydrolyzing enzymes, pore-forming toxins, phosphatases, nucleases, etc. that are implicated in plant, animal and human pathogenesis and widely present in both intracellular and extracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nivaskumar and Francetic, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cianciotto and White, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cianciotto, 2005</xref>). In <italic>Vibrio</italic> species, hemolysins including TDH (Thermostable Direct Hemolysin), TRH (TDH-related Hemolysin) and the cholera toxin are known to be secreted via the T2SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sikora, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the more ancient T3SS1 is associated with all strains of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, whereas T3SS2, a more recent acquisition, correlates with clinical isolates and disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makino et al., 2003</xref>). To study the various virulence factors independently, deletions in particular genes are created to unmask the activity of a specific virulence mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Souza Santos and Orth, 2019</xref>). Herein, to study T3SS2, we utilize CAB2, a strain derived from the clinical isolate RIMD2210633 that is deleted for hemolysins and mutated for expression of the T3SS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The T3SS2, found on a pathogenicity island encodes a needle-like apparatus and effectors that mediate an invasive infection resulting in host cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang and Orth, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Souza Santos and Orth, 2014</xref>). T3SS2 translocates the effector VopC, a deamidase, to mediate membrane ruffling and uptake of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> by nonphagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Souza Santos and Orth, 2014</xref>). Once inside, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> escapes from an acidified endocytic compartment and proceeds to replicate in the cytoplasm of the host cell, reaching counts of 200–300 bacteria per host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Souza Santos and Orth, 2014</xref>). Other translocated effectors have been shown to manipulate host cell signaling, including the acetyltransferase VopA that blocks MAPK signaling and the actin assembly factor VopL that blocks production of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trosky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liverman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Souza Santos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trosky et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> ultimately escapes from this protective replicative niche to infect other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Souza Santos and Orth, 2014</xref>). In total, about a dozen T3SS2 effectors are thought to be delivered to the host cell, some with known molecular functions but with exception of the aforementioned effectors, understudied for their role in bacterial intracellular survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Souza Santos and Orth, 2019</xref>). After bioinformatic perusal of this pathogenicity island, there appeared to be no obvious candidate effector that would mediate the escape of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> from the endocytic compartment or the host cell.</p><p>To be a successful pathogen, an intracellular bacterium must egress after its replication in the host cell cytosol to re-infect neighboring cells and disseminate into tissues. Pathogens use various mechanisms for egress, including programmed cell death, non-lytic exit of host cells and manipulation of host-cell-derived membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hybiske and Stephens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flieger et al., 2018</xref>). Three forms of programmed cell death that include both non-lytic (apoptosis) and lytic pathways (pyroptosis and necroptosis) are observed in pathogen egress. For pathogen egress via apoptosis as seen with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, the invaded host cells are programmed to die without inducing inflammation. Thus, the pathogens cause less damage to the host leading to their dissemination within apoptotic bodies only to be engulfed by scavenging macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Zandbergen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peters et al., 2008</xref>). Pyroptosis, induced by gasdermin in a caspase-dependent pathway, involves formation of pores in the plasma membrane and is used as an exit mechanism by <italic>Francisella, Legionella, Shigella, Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Listeria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hybiske and Stephens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Traven and Naderer, 2014</xref>). Necroptosis, a programmed necrosis that is induced by the receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3/RIPK3) and the mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL) signaling pathway, is observed for dissemination of <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindgren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dallenga et al., 2017</xref>). Following non-lysing pathways, many intracellular pathogens such as <italic>Chlamydia, Rickettsia, Mycobacterium, Shigella, Listeria</italic> and <italic>Legionella</italic> exit host cells by membrane protrusion, budding, exocytosis and expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hybiske and Stephens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flieger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedrich et al., 2012</xref>) Parasites such as <italic>Trypanosoma, Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma gondi</italic> use active host cell lysis mediated by proteases and lipases as exit strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hybiske and Stephens, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pszenny et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we describe a novel mechanism deployed by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> for its egress from the host cells. We show that the lipase, VPA0226 is necessary for egress of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> from its host cell initially invaded in a T3SS2-mediated mechanism. However, VPA0226 is not secreted by the T3SS2, but rather it is constitutively secreted by the type two secretion system. Using lipidomic studies we found that, unlike other bacterial lipases, cytoplasmic VPA0226, but not its catalytically inactive forms (VPA0226-H/A or VPA0226-S/A), esterifies cholesterol using host polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), specifically those implicated in immune signaling. Esterification of cholesterol leads to a weakened plasma membrane that allows <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> to escape. Not only is this a novel mechanism that is using host-derived PUFA to esterify cholesterol for egress of an intracellular bacterial pathogen, this study exemplifies the resourcefulness and adaptability of bacteria to leverage an existing mechanism to survive and escape from a host cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The catalytic activity of VPA0226 is required for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> egress from host cell</title><p>Intracellular pathogens are known to use lipases to escape from membrane compartments.

Using SseJ as a probe in a bioinformatic search of the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> genome, we identified a lipase (VPA0226) with approximately 16% sequence identity and conservation of catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Previously, in vitro studies demonstrated that VPA0226 has lipase activity and structural studies on a related <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic> lipase revealed a chloride-dependent catalytic diad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shinoda et al., 1991</xref>). However, analysis of VPA0226 reveals a more classic catalytic triad of Ser-His-Asp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To test whether VPA0226 plays a critical role in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>’ intracellular lifecycle, we performed a gentamicin protection assay, whereby HeLa cells were infected with the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> CAB2 strain for 2 hr to allow invasion of the host, followed by treatment with gentamicin for the remainder of the infection to kill all extracellular, but not intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Souza Santos and Orth, 2014</xref>). We observed that the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> CAB2 containing a functional T3SS2 can efficiently invade, replicate (indicated by the increase in colony-forming units (CFU)), and escape from the host cell (indicated by the after-peak decrease in CFU due to exposure of egressed bacteria to gentamicin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, black bars). By contrast, a CAB2 strain deleted for <italic>vpa0226</italic> (CAB2Δ<italic>vpa0226</italic>) results in cells that have increasing amounts of bacteria with no significant decrease for up to 7 hr post-gentamicin treatment (PGT), indicating the inability of these bacteria to escape from an invaded cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, green bars).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>VPA0226 mediates bacterial egress from the host cell.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells were infected with CAB2 or CAB2Δ<italic>vpa0226</italic> for 1, 3, 5, and 7 hr PGT.

To further confirm that decrease in bacterial counts observed at 7 hr PGT in CAB2 or CAB2Δ<italic>vpa0226</italic>+WT invaded HeLa cells is not caused by gentamicin from the medium ultimately reaching intracellular bacteria, we performed an extended time course gentamicin protection assay in which HeLa cells were infected with <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> strains for 2 hr, treated with gentamicin at 100 µg/ml for 1 hr and then changed to 10 µg/ml for the remainder of the assay.

Previously, it was shown that lipases similar to VPA0226 can esterify cholesterol by the transfer of an acyl group from an acyl-containing lipid to cholesterol thereby converting free cholesterol to a cholesteryl ester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckley, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nawabi et al., 2008</xref>).

To confirm the lipase activity of VPA0226, we tested this enzyme with the EnzChek Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Purified wildtype VPA0226 but not the catalytically inactive VPA0226- S/A mutant resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence from a PLA2-specific fluorogenic substrate (BODIPY PC-A2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next assessed whether VPA0226 can directly modify cholesterol by incubating purified secreted wildtype or catalytically dead VPA0226- S/A with liposomes containing lipid mixtures of cardiolipin and cholesterol, followed by lipid extraction and thin layer chromatography. We observed that the wildtype but not the catalytically inactive VPA0226-S/A mutant facilitated the esterification of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether the expression of VPA0226 would change the global profile of esterified cholesterol in cells. To test whether VPA0226 alters lipids in cells, we transfected HeLa cells with an empty vector, wildtype VPA0226 and the catalytically inactive VPA0226-H/A mutant. Our attempts to use the catalytically inactive VPA0226-S/A construct for mammalian cell expression was not successful. Therefore, we created a second construct where the catalytic histidine (residue 393) in the catalytic triad was mutated to alanine. This mutant VPA0226-H/A functions similar to the VPA0226-S/A mutant in the gentamicin protection assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). At 14 hr post-transfection, we performed lipidomic analysis of cells transfected with empty vector, VPA0226 and the catalytically inactive VPA0226-H/A. Since cardiolipin is a lipid found exclusively in mitochondria and bacterial outer membranes and VPA0226, a constitutively secreted glycerophospholipid: cholesterol acyltransferase is localized to mitochondria, we speculated that VPA0226 might favor using fatty acids from cardiolipin (18:1,18:2,18:3) as a resource to esterify cholesterol. However, the levels of cholesteryl esters (CE) with cardiolipin fatty acids did not change significantly over the three samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Previously, the mechanism of entry for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> was discovered to be mediated by the deamidase activity of VopC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Further studies uncovered mechanisms used by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> to attenuate signaling pathways inside the infected cell, by effectors such as VopA and VopL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Souza Santos and Orth, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Souza Santos et al., 2017</xref>). Many other mechanisms remain to be elucidated for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>’s defense against the host. Herein, we find that the escape route for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> mediated host cell invasion is dependent on the Type two secreted lipase VPA0226, which compromises the integrity of the plasma membrane by using polyunsaturated fatty acids to esterify cholesterol in the infected cell. For this pathogen, VPA0226 provides an essential activity for the virulence of the T3SS2 pathogenicity island by providing a convenient mechanism for escape. When dissecting the activity mediated by VPA0226, we were struck by its many unconventional and somewhat perplexing properties, including its secretion, enzymology and biology.</p><p>VPA0226 is secreted, not by the T3SS2, but by the type two secretion system. These findings make it very clear that, although we attribute <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> virulence to T3SS2 (11,43), this bacterial pathogen uses many tools outside of this pathogenicity island for a successful infection. Other tools would include external host signaling factors, such as bile salts for activation of the system and adhesion proteins used to attach to host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krachler et al., 2011</xref>). Another example supporting notion is the fact that the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> T3SS1 uses an effector, VPA0450, located outside its pathogenicity island to mediate an orchestrated host cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broberg et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>VPA0226 appears to be constitutively secreted from <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> by the type two secretion system, as we saw no accumulation of VPA0226 inside <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cells, indicating that, as it is synthesized it is secreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Additionally, when media is collected from log-phase <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cultures, we were able to purify VPA0226 from the culture medium. We propose that VPA0226 is constitutively secreted by intracellular bacteria during infection because we only observe changes in the mitochondria, release of cytochrome C, TUNEL-positive cells and Sytox membrane permeability in host cells that are invaded with <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> expressing wild-type VPA0226. Therefore, VPA0226 targets host cell machinery from within the host cell and not from the outside.</p><p>With regard to its localization, we observe transfected VPA0226 localized to the mitochondria and during <italic>invasion</italic> of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>transfection</italic> o f VPA0226, the mitochondria are fragmented. Neighboring cells that are not invaded or transfected appear to have mitochondria with a normal phenotype. Although we have been unable to detect VPA0226 during an infection, we propose using molecular Koch’s postulate that the wildtype but not the catalytically inactive VPA0226 causes the fragmented mitochondrial phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falkow, 1988</xref>). As VPA0226 does not appear to encode a mitochondrial localization domain, how and why it localizes specifically to the mitochondria is unclear.</p><p>Secreted phospholipases have been associated with many virulence activities, including mucus degradation, hemolysis and phagosomal escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Díaz et al., 2016</xref>).

VPA0226 and homologs from other <italic>Vibrio</italic> species, together with the <italic>Salmonella</italic> phospholipase effector SseJ, are located in a mostly bacterial subfamily, closely related to plant and fungal GDSL lipases and only remotely related to animal GDSL lipases, for example human Phospholipase B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Based on this conservation, we predict that the presence of VPA0226 in the <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> genome predated the acquisition of the T3SS2 pathogenicity island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makino et al., 2003</xref>). From an evolutionary standpoint, it is interesting (and resourceful on the part of a bacterial pathogen) that this enzyme subsequently became an essential factor for escape of the invading <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> from cells. Interestingly, the bacterial-plant-fungal GDSL lipase subfamily includes a large plant group of extracellular lipases (e.g. more than 100 different proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>), many of which are involved in regulation of defense against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Fungal members of the subfamily are found in most fungal lineages, including several pathogenic, but excluding yeast-like ones. Majority of this subfamily members are predicted to be secreted by possessing a classical signal peptide while a number of bacterial members additionally possess the autotransporter ‘translocator’ domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benz and Schmidt, 2011</xref>). This may suggest an alternative, speculative evolutionary scenario for this subfamily, involving horizontal gene transfers between pathogens and hosts.</p><p>Our work confirms previous observations demonstrating that VPA0226 has lipase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shinoda et al., 1991</xref>). We went on to show both in vitro and upon ectopic expression of VPA0226 in mammalian cells VPA0226 can function as an acyl transferase. Interestingly, VPA0226 appears to act like a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) because, using lipidomics, we observe that VPA0226 specifically transfers an acyl group from position two from the glycerol backbone of a phospholipid to cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haas and Stanley, 2007</xref>). The products from this reaction are esterified cholesterol and lysophospholipids, both of which destabilize membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aikawa et al., 2015</xref>). The esterified cholesterol produced by VPA0226 are quite selective PUFAs, including 20:3, 20:4 (arachidonic acid) and 20:5 and 22:6 (fish oil lipids). This result was quite surprising for two reasons: first, the GDSL-like lipase from bacteria have been shown to use fatty acids (such as cardiolipin) as substrates as these are associated with bacteria; second, although eukaryotes produce cardiolipin, the substrate of choice for VPA0226 was clearly to use the aforementioned PUFAs to esterify cholesterol. Interestingly, these PUFAs (arachidonic acid and fish oil lipids) are implicated with immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tallima and El Ridi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicolaou et al., 2014</xref>).

After <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> escapes from the endosome, we postulate VPA0226 is secreted into the host cytosol, localizes to the mitochondria and esterifies cholesterol over the course of about 5–6 hr. During that time, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> reaches a density of about 300 bacteria/invaded cell and, due to mechanical stress (or possibly another unknown factor) egresses from the host cell. We observe that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> uniquely utilizes two independent secretion systems to support its intracellular lifestyle. From the perspective of virulence, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> appears to have utilized existing resources to evolve an efficient mechanism for invasion, propagation and escape. We speculate, considering the time pathogens have to evolve, that there is actually more interplay between secretion systems, providing unique, synergistic mechanisms to support a successful lifestyle of possibly pathogenicity, symbiosis and/or parasitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>The <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> CAB2 strain was derived from POR1 (clinical isolate RIMD2210633 lacking TDH toxins), the latter being a generous gift from Drs.

This is proposed to cause a weakening of host cell membranes, including of the plasma membrane, thereby promoting <italic>Vibrio</italic> egress. This is a potentially exciting and novel mechanism for pathogen egress, a mostly underexplored aspect of bacterial pathogenesis. However, the proposed model is essentially based in experiments performed in mammalian cells ectopically expressing VPA0226 or in biochemical experiments with purified VPA0226. The evidence to establish that the proposed egress mechanism occurs in infected cells must be strengthened.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is essential to show that free cholesterol levels are indeed decreased in infected cells by biochemical analysis of host lipids and/or (at the very least) by using analysis of the expression of HMGCR, HMGCS and DHCR24 as readout.</p><p>2) Another aspect that should be better addressed is the subcellular localization of VPA0226 during host cell infection, which could aid at a better understanding of its biological role. For example, it is unclear how the localization of ectopically expressed VPA0226 at the mitochondria relates to its proposed activity and function. With the available anti-VPA0226 antibody, or by using <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> transformed with epitope tagged VPA0226, it should be possible to monitor the presence and/or localization of the protein within infected cells by controlled protein fractionation and/or by immunofluorescence microscopy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by de Souza Santos et al. describes the characterization of VPA0226, a <italic>Vibrio</italic> protein required for egress of intracellular bacteria. The authors provide experiments in support of a model in which VPA0226 is secreted by the type 2 secretion system and is required for esterification of cholesterol, weakening the plasma membrane and allowing for bacterial egress. Although the absence of VPA0226 clearly leads to accumulation of bacteria inside cells at the time of observation, the presented experiments are not sufficient to unambiguously support the model proposed by the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The exact role of the T2SS</p><p>The notion that VPA0226 is a T2SS substrate relies on Western blot experiment in which the authors analyze the presence of VPA0226 in the bacterial pellet (expression) and in the supernatant (secretion). In agreement with the notion that VPA0226 is a T2SS substrate, it is not present in the supernatant of the T2SS mutant. However, it is not present in the pellet either. It seems cautious to conclude that VPA0226 is not expressed at all in the T2SS mutant. How could the authors then conclude that VPA0226 is a T2SS substrate? Finally, if VPA0226 requires the T2SS for function, then one would expect the T2SS mutant to display an egress defect. Is it the case?</p><p>2) Cholesterol esterification and weakening of the plasma membrane</p><p>Although the authors show modification of total cholesterol, they do not demonstrate that the modified version is in the plasma membrane, as implied by their model. Also, the papers cited in reference of cholesterol esterification leading to weakening of the plasma membrane are misused. In these studies, it was not esterification but depletion of total cholesterol that was tested, and the treatment did not lead to membrane weakening, but remodeling of tight junctions. As a consequence, there is no evidence that cholesterol esterification weakens the plasma membrane and the authors need to demonstrate what remains an assumption.</p><p>3) The exact role of VPA0266 in the observed egress defect</p><p>It is suggested that VPA02266-mediated cholesterol esterification leads to plasma membrane leakiness, thus facilitating egress. If this is true, then increasing cholesterol esterification (by an independent method, using manipulation of cholesterol metabolism for instance) should rescue the bacterial egress defect of the VPA0266 mutant.</p><p>4) Biological significance of the observed defects</p><p>The authors should consider studying the role of VPA0266 in egress using various epithelial cell types. Importantly, using Caco-2 cells instead of HeLa cells would address the potential role of cell polarity in VPA0226 function (and <italic>Vibrio</italic> infection). Perhaps more importantly, the authors should demonstrate the role of VPA0266 in existing models of <italic>Vibrio</italic> pathogenesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by de Souza Santos et al., describes the characterization of the secreted lipase VPA0226 and its requirement for cellular egress by <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>. The major findings include:</p><p>- the enzymatic activity of VPA0226 is required for bacterial escape from host cells;</p><p>- the somewhat surprising discovery that the lipase is not secreted by the type 3 secretion system 2. Instead, it enters the extracellular space through the type 2 secretion system;</p><p>- VPA0226 associates with mitochondria and causes mitochondrial fragmentation;</p><p>- while apoptosis is induced, it is not required for cell egress by <italic>V. para</italic>;</p><p>- VPA0226 esterifies cholesterol</p><p>The results are intriguing, the cell biology is convincing and the study represents a significant advance to the field, although the mechanism by which VPA0226 induces cell egress is not fully established. While the plasma membrane is destabilized as measured by Sytox permeability and sensitivity to osmotic stress following infection by <italic>V. para</italic> expressing active lipase and transfection of active lipase, respectively, it is not clear if this is due to esterification of cholesterol in the plasma membrane. Are we to assume that the effect is on plasma membrane cholesterol since the majority of cellular cholesterol is found in the plasma membrane? Why then is there such a dramatic effect on mitochondria that only contains a fraction of cellular cholesterol? The authors could isolate plasma membrane before performing lipidomic analysis rather than analyzing total cellular lipids to verify that plasma membrane cholesterol is modified.</p><p>A strain of <italic>V. para</italic> that is deleted for hemolysins and the T3SS1 was used in this study. What is the role of VPA0226 in wild type <italic>V. para</italic>? Is it required for cellular escape or is this phenotype masked in the presence of other virulence factors?</p><p>VPA0226 is capable of esterifying cholesterol using cardiolipin in vitro; however, another lipid source (s) of fatty acids is used in the host cell. Please address this difference. This lipase seems to have broad specificity.</p><p>Regarding the results in Figure 3A: &quot;a clear difference&quot; was not observed &quot;in the migration pattern of total lipids from VPA0226 WT transfected compared to those transfected with empty vector and the inactive VPA0226 HA mutant&quot; (subsection “VPA0226 esterifies cholesterol using host polyunsaturated fatty acids”). Please modify text.</p><p>The inactive VPA0226 that has the catalytic residue serine-153 substituted with alanine (VPA0226 S/A) was used in the infection experiments, while the transfection experiments used VPA0226 with a His393Ala substitution (VPA0226 H/A). VPA0226 S/A was purified and shown to lack acyl-transferase activity; however, that VPA0226 H/A is inactive was not verified. The activity of this variant should be determined. That VPA0226 S/A could not be expressed in the mammalian cells and an alternative mutant VPA0226 was made for the transfection experiments should be mentioned in the Results section.</p><p>The statistically significant reduction in entry into HeLa cells by <italic>V. para</italic> lacking VPA0226 was not addressed (Figure 1A). Is this restored with complementation? Does VPA0226 affect the plasma membrane from the outside?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Vibrio</italic> deploys Type 2 secreted lipase to esterify cholesterol with host fatty acids and mediate cell egress&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The pathogen would then fully benefit from the two types of secretion systems to invade and then to escape the cells. The reviewers have all reviewed a previous version of this article, and all agreed that the work had been significantly improved. There remains a contentious point however about the fact that VPA0226 is a T2SS substrate and reviewers propose a list of experiments to unambiguously demonstrate the claim:</p><p>1) Because the VPA0226 protein cannot be detected in the pellet of the T2SS mutant, it is hard to definitely conclude that the T2SS is required for secretion, as opposed to any indirect effect including expression or protein stability. It is quite possible that there is a global effect on gene expression in the T2SS mutant since this mutant is unable to invade host cells.</p><p>Please test by qPCR if the loss of intracellular VPA0226 detection is due to loss of expression. Then please express VPA0226 from a plasmid in the WT and T2SS mutant that allows for inducible expression and try to detect periplasmic accumulation of VPA0226. In the end, pulse-chase experiments to determine whether VPA0226 gets degraded in the periplasm of the T2SS mutant may be necessary.</p><p>2) Please address the question of timing of egress that you commented on were halted in the mutant as opposed to delayed with the bacteria ultimately dying in intact cells. To ensure that bacterial death is not due to gentamicin in the medium ultimately reaching intracellular bacteria, please repeat the experiment, killing the extracellular bacteria with gentamicin for an hour after invasion then replacing with fresh medium and very low levels of gentamicin. It would add to the paper if cytosolic bacteria could egress in the end, through host cell exhaustion, but <italic>Vibrio</italic> has evolved a very specific way of doing it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58057.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Is it the case?</p></disp-quote><p>The westerns for these experiments have been repeated with proper controls. The absence of a secreted protein in the pellet fraction may indicate that the enzyme may be toxic to the bacteria. In support of this hypothesis, we tried to express VPA0226 without its secretion signal and observed no protein in the bacterial pellet or the supernatant. <italic>V. para</italic> containing a T2SS mutant is unable to invade host cells, which could be explained by the lack of other unexplored T2SS factors that may be involved in the holistic process of invasion into a host cell (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Cholesterol esterification and weakening of the plasma membrane</p><p>Although the authors show modification of total cholesterol, they do not demonstrate that the modified version is in the plasma membrane, as implied by their model. Also, the papers cited in reference of cholesterol esterification leading to weakening of the plasma membrane are misused. In these studies, it was not esterification but depletion of total cholesterol that was tested, and the treatment did not lead to membrane weakening, but remodeling of tight junctions. As a consequence, there is no evidence that cholesterol esterification weakens the plasma membrane and the authors need to demonstrate what remains an assumption.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that infected cells should be tested for changes in levels of free cholesterol on the plasma membrane. To test for VPA0226-mediated changes in levels of cholesterol in infected cells, we treated CAB2 infected host cells with 100µM cholesterol resulting in the addition of free cholesterol to plasma membrane and discovered that CAB2 was no longer able to efficiently egress from Cholesterol treated cells. Similarly, we treated CAB2Δvpa0226 infected cells with hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HPCD), a compound that depletes cholesterol from membranes, and observed that CAB2Δvpa0226 could now escape from host cells. These studies support our model that changes in free cholesterol are important for egress of <italic>V. para</italic> from host cells.</p><p>We have also added new data wherein we have isolated plasma membrane fractions from HeLa cells transfected with VPA0226 or catalytically inactive VPA0226 H/A and observed that there was reduced free cholesterol content in cells expressing wild-type VPA0226 compared to those of the cells expressing either empty vector or catalytically inactive VPA0226 (Figure 5B). We have modified text to reflect the references cited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The exact role of VPA0266 in the observed egress defect</p><p>It is suggested that VPA02266-mediated cholesterol esterification leads to plasma membrane leakiness, thus facilitating egress. If this is true, then increasing cholesterol esterification (by an independent method, using manipulation of cholesterol metabolism for instance) should rescue the bacterial egress defect of the VPA0266 mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested and described above, we treated CAB2Δvpa02226 infected cells with hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HPCD), a compound that depletes cholesterol, and observed that CAB2Δvpa0226 could now escape from host cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Biological significance of the observed defects</p><p>The authors should consider studying the role of VPA0266 in egress using various epithelial cell types. Importantly, using Caco-2 cells instead of HeLa cells would address the potential role of cell polarity in VPA0226 function (and Vibrio infection). Perhaps more importantly, the authors should demonstrate the role of VPA0266 in existing models of Vibrio pathogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by this reviewer, we infected Caco-2 cells, and observed egress of CAB2 but not CAB2Δvpa0226 at 7 hours post gentamicin treatment (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by de Souza Santos et al., describes the characterization of the secreted lipase VPA0226 and its requirement for cellular egress by Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The major findings include:</p><p>• the enzymatic activity of VPA0226 is required for bacterial escape from host cells;</p><p>• the somewhat surprising discovery that the lipase is not secreted by the type 3 secretion system 2. Instead, it enters the extracellular space through the type 2 secretion system;</p><p>• VPA0226 associates with mitochondria and causes mitochondrial fragmentation;</p><p>• while apoptosis is induced, it is not required for cell egress by V. para;</p><p>• VPA0226 esterifies cholesterol</p><p>The results are intriguing, the cell biology is convincing and the study represents a significant advance to the field, although the mechanism by which VPA0226 induces cell egress is not fully established. While the plasma membrane is destabilized as measured by Sytox permeability and sensitivity to osmotic stress following infection by V. para expressing active lipase and transfection of active lipase, respectively, it is not clear if this is due to esterification of cholesterol in the plasma membrane. Are we to assume that the effect is on plasma membrane cholesterol since the majority of cellular cholesterol is found in the plasma membrane? Why then is there such a dramatic effect on mitochondria that only contains a fraction of cellular cholesterol? The authors could isolate plasma membrane before performing lipidomic analysis rather than analyzing total cellular lipids to verify that plasma membrane cholesterol is modified.</p></disp-quote><p>We observe fragmentation of the mitochondria that is consistent with esterification of cholesterol and the activation of SREBP signaling, indicative of decreased cholesterol in the cell. We have isolated plasma membrane fractions from HeLa cells transfected with VPA0226 or catalytically inactive VPA0226 H/A and observed that there was reduced free cholesterol content in cells expressing wild-type VPA0226 compared to those of the cells expressing either empty vector or catalytically inactive VPA0226 (Figure 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A strain of V. para that is deleted for hemolysins and the T3SS1 was used in this study.

In vitro, as this is a bacterial lipase, cardiolipin was the logical substrate to use for transferase experiments. However, we observe that when given a choice of all phospholipids in a host cell, the lipids transferred were 20:3, 20:4, 20:5 and 22:6 to induce the production of CE(20:3), CE(20:4), CE(20:5) and CE(22:6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the results in Figure 3A: &quot;a clear difference&quot; was not observed &quot;in the migration pattern of total lipids from VPA0226 WT transfected compared to those transfected with empty vector and the inactive VPA0226 HA mutant&quot; (subsection “VPA0226 esterifies cholesterol using host polyunsaturated fatty acids”).

VPA0226 S/A was purified and shown to lack acyl-transferase activity; however, that VPA0226 H/A is inactive was not verified. The activity of this variant should be determined. That VPA0226 S/A could not be expressed in the mammalian cells and an alternative mutant VPA0226 was made for the transfection experiments should be mentioned in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have mentioned that we used two different mutants and why in the Results section.</p><p>Since our S153A mutant was unable to be stably express in mammalian cells we have used a Histine 393 Alanine mutant that mutates another residue in the conserved catalytic triad that previously was documented (Akoh and Shaw et al., 2004).

It is quite possible that there is a global effect on gene expression in the T2SS mutant since this mutant is unable to invade host cells.</p><p>Please test by qPCR if the loss of intracellular VPA0226 detection is due to loss of expression. Then please express VPA0226 from a plasmid in the WT and T2SS mutant that allows for inducible expression and try to detect periplasmic accumulation of VPA0226. In the end, pulse-chase experiments to determine whether VPA0226 gets degraded in the periplasm of the T2SS mutant may be necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed the following experiments (subsection “VPA0226 is secreted by the type 2 secretion system”):</p><p>“As we did not observe VPA0226 in the pellet fraction of CAB2∆epsD, we performed qPCR analysis to confirm the expression of VPA0226 in CAB2∆epsD strain and observed a significant reduction in the expression level of VPA0226 in CAB2∆epsD compared to CAB2 (Figure 2C). However, when we overexpressed VPA0226 through a plasmid in CAB2∆epsD, we observed a slightly higher migrating band corresponding to the uncleaved version of VPA0226 in the pellet fraction along with a few other lower migrating bands indicating a possible degradation of VPA0226(Figure 2D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that VPA0226 is secreted by the type 2 secretion system (Figure 2E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please address the question of timing of egress that you commented on were halted in the mutant as opposed to delayed with the bacteria ultimately dying in intact cells. To ensure that bacterial death is not due to gentamicin in the medium ultimately reaching intracellular bacteria, please repeat the experiment, killing the extracellular bacteria with gentamicin for an hour after invasion then replacing with fresh medium and very low levels of gentamicin. It would add to the paper if cytosolic bacteria could egress in the end, through host cell exhaustion, but Vibrio has evolved a very specific way of doing it.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed a gentamycin protection assay with lower levels of gentamycin and confirmed that bacterial death is not due to experimental design.</p><p>Subsection “The catalytic activity of VPA0226 is required for <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> egress from host cell”: “…we performed an extended time course gentamicin protection assay in which Hela cells were infected with <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> strains for 2 hours, treated with gentamicin at 100µg/ml for 1 hour and then changed to 10µg/ml for the remainder of the assay (3, 6, 8,12 and 24 hours).
