Dysfunction of the primary cilium can lead to ciliopathies and cancer. The formation and organization of the primary cilium are highly associated with cell polarity proteins, such as the apical polarity protein CRB3. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CRB3 regulates ciliogenesis and the location of CRB3 remain unknown. Here, we show that CRB3, as a navigator, regulates vesicle trafficking in γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) assembly during ciliogenesis and cilium-related Hh and Wnt signaling pathways in tumorigenesis. <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice display severe defects of the primary cilium in the mammary ductal lumen and renal tubule, while mammary epithelial-specific <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice exhibit the promotion of ductal epithelial hyperplasia and tumorigenesis. CRB3 is essential for lumen formation and ciliary assembly in the mammary epithelium. We demonstrate that CRB3 localizes to the basal body and that CRB3 trafficking is mediated by Rab11-positive endosomes. Significantly, CRB3 interacts with Rab11 to navigate GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290, resulting in intact γTuRC assembly. In addition, CRB3-depleted cells are unresponsive to the activation of the Hh signaling pathway, while CRB3 regulates the Wnt signaling pathway. Therefore, our studies reveal the molecular mechanisms by which CRB3 recognizes Rab11-positive endosomes to facilitate ciliogenesis and regulates cilium-related signaling pathways in tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primary cilium</kwd><kwd>polarity protein</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>CRB3</kwd><kwd>γ-TuRC assembly</kwd><kwd>Rab11-positive endosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81872272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peijun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82173023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peijun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovation Capability Support Program of Shaanxi</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020TD-046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peijun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002412</institution-id><institution>Clinical Research Award of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XJTU1AF-CRF-2017-007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peijun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The apical polarity protein CRB3 is crucial for regulating vesicle trafficking in γ-tubulin ring complex assembly during ciliogenesis and cilium-related Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways in tumorigenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial tissues are the most common and widely distributed tissues in the body, and they perform several particular functions. Epithelial tissues are made up of epithelial cells. Establishing apical-basal cell polarity within epithelial cells is a crucial biological process for epithelial homeostasis. Unfortunately, the loss of apical-basal cell polarity is one of the most significant hallmarks of advanced malignant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wodarz and Näthke, 2007</xref>), and several reports have shown that the loss of some polarity proteins causes disordered cell polarity within epithelial cells, which cannot tightly control cellular growth and migration, ultimately leading to tumor formation, progression, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCaffrey and Macara, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etienne-Manneville, 2008</xref>). However, the relationship between polarity proteins and tumorigenesis remains incomplete.</p><p>The Crumb complex, located apically, is vital in regulating and maintaining apical-basal cell polarity within epithelial cells. In mammals, three Crumbs orthologs are CRB1, CRB2, and CRB3, and only CRB3 is widely expressed in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elsum et al., 2012</xref>). Our previous studies have shown that CRB3 is expressed at low levels in renal and breast cancers, and abnormal CRB3 expression leads to the disrupted organization of MCF10A cells in three-dimensional (3D) cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao et al., 2015</xref>). Inhibition of CRB3 impairs contact inhibition and leads to migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karp et al., 2008</xref>). Contact inhibition results in growth arrest and causes epithelial cells to enter the quiescent phase, inducing primary cilium formation.</p><p>The primary cilium, an antenna-like microtubule-based organelle, is a sensorial antenna that regulates cell differentiation, proliferation, polarity, and tissue organization in most types of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sánchez and Dynlacht, 2016</xref>). Dysfunction of the primary cilium can lead to developmental and degenerative disorders called ciliopathies, such as polycystic kidney disease, nephronophthisis, retinitis pigmentosa, and Meckel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). Remarkably, many cancers, including melanoma and breast, renal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, exhibit loss of the primary cilium, most likely during the early stages of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Menzl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seeley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hassounah et al., 2013</xref>). The primary cilium is a significant extension on the apical surfaces of epithelial cells and is maintained by polarized vesicular traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazellières et al., 2018</xref>). Studies have shown that CRB3b localizes in the primary cilium and that depletion of CRB3 leads to primary cilium loss in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2004</xref>), indicating that CRB3 is necessary for the initiation of ciliogenesis. However, how CRB3 promotes ciliogenesis on the apical surfaces of epithelial cells remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we describe a novel conditional deletion of <italic>Crb3</italic> in mice. Our results demonstrate that Crb3 is required to assemble the primary cilium in the mammary gland, kidney, and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells from <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice. Moreover, we found that <italic>Crb3</italic> deletion promotes breast cancer progression in vivo. Additionally, we observed that CRB3 knockdown destabilizes the assembly of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) during ciliogenesis. Specifically, CRB3 interacts with Rab11 and navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the basal body of the primary cilium in mammary epithelial cells. We also identified that CRB3 regulates the ciliary Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways in breast cancer. Thus, the polarity protein CRB3 is important for the assembly mechanism of the γTuRC in ciliogenesis and the cilium-related signaling pathways in tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Crb3</italic> deletion mice exhibit smaller size and anophthalmia</title><p>Since <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mice die shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Whiteman et al., 2014</xref>), we generated a novel transgenic mouse model with conditional deletion of <italic>Crb3</italic> using the Cre-loxP system.

To investigate the relationship between CRB3 and ciliary formation, we first examined CRB3 localization in MCF10A cells expressing CRB3-GFP.

Approximately 40% of cells showed this co-localization of exogenous CRB3b and pericentrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In order to prevent the potential accumulation of exogenously overexpressed CRB3 at the ER and Golgi, which could impact its co-localization with the centrosome, we further verified this phenomenon by observing the localization of endogenous CRB3 (both isoforms CRB3a and CRB3b) with another centrosome marker.

The knockdown of CRB3 did not affect Rab11 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Rab11 knockdown resulted in a predominant localization of CRB3 to the cell membrane and a reduction in intracellular foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). These results suggest that CRB3 co-localizes with EEA1, CD63, and Rab11 on endosomes, and in particular, Rab11-positive endosomes are involved in the intracellular trafficking of CRB3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CRB3 knockdown destabilizes γTuRC assembly during ciliogenesis</title><p>According to our findings, we assumed that CRB3 might be involved in polarized vesicle trafficking. The γTuRC is a central regulator of microtubule nucleation and a nucleation site of α-tubulin and β-tubulin at the microtubule-organizing center in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, the primary cilium, a microtubule-based structure attached to the basal body, is transformed from the mother centriole. As we found that CRB3 knockdown disturbed the accumulation of γ-tubulin, it prompted us to analyze γTuRC assembly in ciliogenesis. The γTuRC is composed of multiple copies of the γ-tubulin small complex (γTuSC), GCP2 and GCP3, plus GCP4, GCP5, and GCP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Our findings indicate that CRB3 downregulation did not affect the expression of γTuRC subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). However, we performed co-IPs directed against GCP6 in CRB3-depleted cells and assessed the relative levels of both γTuSC-specific proteins compared with the control shRNA-treated cells. Interestingly, CRB3 knockdown significantly reduced the interaction of GCP6 with GCP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). To verify this phenomenon, we observed the localization of GCP3 with GCP6 foci in MCF10A cells. Correspondingly, CRB3 downregulation significantly disturbed the co-localization of GCP3 with GCP6 foci in quiescence cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). To investigate whether CRB3 facilitates γTuRC assembly, we fractionated MCF10A cytoplasmic proteins on sucrose gradients according to published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farache et al., 2016</xref>). We noticed that γTuSC were sedimented mainly in fractions 3, while γTuRC sedimented in fractions 6. However, CRB3 downregulation caused most of GCP6 and GCP5 to be precipitated independently of γTuRC in the low-density fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the depletion of CRB3 disrupts molecular interactions between the γTuRC proteins, resulting in a failure of microtubule formation in the primary cilium. However, this depletion may not affect the expression of these molecules during γTuRC assembly. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that CRB3 could facilitate the polarized vesicle trafficking of some γTuRC-specific proteins through Rab11-positive endosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>CRB3 interacts with Rab11</title><p>To fully prove this hypothesis, we first examined the interaction of CRB3 with Rab11-positive endosomes and γTuRC-specific proteins in MCF10A cells.

We reviewed the identification of CRB3 interacting proteins and found some centriolar proteins. CEP290, for example, is located in the transition zone of the primary cilium and is required for the formation of microtubule-membrane linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craige et al., 2010</xref>). Then, we verified that exogenous CRB3b could bind to CEP290, Rab11, GCP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and Rab11 also interacted with CEP290, CRB3-GFP, and GCP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, the amount of GCP6 bound to Rab11 was reduced within CRB3 knockdown. Importantly, CRB3 knockdown made it difficult for Rab11 to bind CEP290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We corroborated these findings by checking the co-localization of the basal body foci of GCP6 and γ-tubulin, γ-tubulin and Rab11 in MCF10A and MEF cells. In quiescence control cells, GCP6 foci and γ-tubulin formed a prominent focus at the basal body of the primary cilium, as observed by immunofluorescence. However, CRB3 downregulation eliminated this focus and significantly disturbed the basal body foci of GCP6 and γ-tubulin in MCF10A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), and γ-tubulin and Rab11 in MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

However, in MCF10A cells treated with SAG, CRB3 knockdown did not promote SMO translocation into the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). After SAG treatment, the mRNA expression of GLI1 was significantly decreased in CRB3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

These important phenotypic changes are due to the disruption of epithelial polarity homeostasis, which may ultimately lead to tumorigenesis.</p><p>In addition, we observed the absence of primary cilia in the mammary ductal lumen and renal tubule in the <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mouse model.

Furthermore, CRB3 was localized in the inner segments of photoreceptor cells and concentrated with the connecting cilium throughout the development of the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herranz-Martín et al., 2012</xref>). These ocular defect phenotypes closely resemble those of EHD1 knockout mice, which regulate ciliary vesicle formation in primary cilium assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rainey et al., 2010</xref>).

However, our findings indicate that it is mainly located on the basal body of the primary cilium in mammary epithelial cells. The immunofluorescence results in these literatures showed that CRB3 was scattered on the primary cilia, with a strong foci at the basal body. Notably, in rat kidney-collecting ducts, the localization of CRB3 on primary cilia was significantly reduced, while the obvious localization was at the basal body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2004</xref>). Another study also reported the co-localization of CRB3b and γ-tubulin in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan et al., 2007</xref>). This finding is consistent with our conclusion, and we also verified its co-localization with the centrosome by overexpressing CRB3b in mammary epithelial cells, indicating that CRB3 mainly localizes to the basal body of the primary cilium. Since CRB3b also alters primary cilium formation in the mammary epithelium, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which CRB3 regulates primary cilium formation. Subsequently, we used mass spectrometry to identify the CRB3b-binding protein. Our findings indicate that CRB3b not only binds to some centrosomal proteins, but also plays a significant role in Golgi vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). These results are consistent with the results of the endogenous CRB3 staining by laser confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Specifically, endogenous CRB3 localizes to the centrosome and strongly accumulates in an undefined intracellular structure near the cell nucleus, likely to be the Golgi. However, when we compared the fluorescence microscopy analysis of exogenous CRB3b staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we found that the main localization was observed at the cell tight junctions, which is consistent with the reported molecular function. Additionally, there was a strong accumulation of staining around the cell nucleus, with a shape different from the endogenous staining around the cell nucleus. We speculate that this may be due to excessive overexpression of exogenous proteins, which obstruct the protein secretion pathway and result in the accumulation of the exogenous protein at the ER and Golgi. To better study the cell localization of exogenous CRB3b, a conditional induction expression or knock-in tag on the endogenous CRB3 gene could be used.</p><p>Polarized vesicular traffic plays a crucial role in extending the primary cilium on apical epithelial surfaces. However, the molecular mechanism and its relationship to tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here, we reveal that Rab11-positive endosomes mediate the intracellular trafficking of CRB3 and that CRB3 can navigate GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290, promoting correct γTuRC assembly during primary cilium formation. When cells form tight junctions, CRB3 is mainly localized to the cell membrane, and subsequently, the endosomes participate in the intracellular degradation process of CRB3 on the cell membrane. The intracellular CRB3 can bind to Rab11, which in turn participates in primary cilium assembly. Additionally, in the presence of CRB3, the epithelium can form contact inhibition and an intact primary cilium in quiescence to achieve cellular homeostasis. In contrast, the loss of contact inhibition and primary cilium formation with CRB3 deletion can activate the Wnt signaling pathway, affect the Hh signaling pathway, and disrupt the imbalance of this cellular homeostasis, resulting in significant cell proliferation during tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic model of CRB3 regulating ciliary assembly.</title><p>Graphic summary of prominent phenotypes observed after CRB3 deletion.

Inside the cell, Rab11-positive endosomes mediate the intracellular trafficking of CRB3, and CRB3 navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290. Then, GCP6 is involved in normal γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) assembly in ciliogenesis. In CRB3 deletion cells, the primary cilium fails to assemble properly, and the Wnt signaling pathway is activated through β-catenin upregulation and nuclear localization, but the Hh signaling pathway fails to be activated.

In growing RPE1 cells, Rab8a is localized to cytoplasmic vesicles and the Golgi/trans-Golgi network, while Rab8-positive vesicles are rapidly redistributed to the mother centriole by binding to Rab11-positive recycling and endosomes under serum starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das and Guo, 2011</xref>). The EHD1 protein converts these DAVs to form larger ciliary vesicles, which elongate through continuous fusion with Rab8-positive vesicles to produce the primary cilium membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knödler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rainey et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, as important transporters, are necessary for primary cilium formation and centriole-basal-body transition in the early phase. Our study found that CRB3 could bind to some members of Rab small GTPase family, significantly participating in Golgi vesicle transport and vesicle organization pathways through mass spectrometry identification. Coexpression and co-IP results showed that CRB3 interacted with Rab11, which mediated the intracellular trafficking of CRB3 within Rab11-positive endosomes at different cell densities.</p><p>Unlike motile cilia, primary cilia have a 9+0 structure, consisting of only nine outer doublet microtubules without a central pair.

The γTuRC consists of multiple copies of γTuSC, which is composed of two copies of γ-tubulin and one each of GCP2 and GCP3. Then, GCP2 and GCP3 interact with GCP4, GCP5, and GCP6 to form γTuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Our experiments showed that CRB3 knockdown did not affect the expression of the γTuRC-specific proteins GCP3, GCP6, and γ-tubulin, but inhibited the interaction between GCP6 and GCP3, leading to the destabilization of γTuRC. Further analysis revealed that significant co-localization was observed between GCP6- and Rab11-positive vesicles at low cell density, while at high cell density, GCP6 accumulated at the centrosome with GCP3. CRB3 knockdown resulted in the disappearance of this accumulated GCP6. These results indicated that GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles must be transported to the basal body for ciliogenesis. While it is still unclear how CRB3 interferes with γTuRC assembly during primary cilium formation, we hypothesize that Rab11-positive endosomes mediate the intracellular trafficking of CRB3 and that CRB3, as a navigator interacting with CEP290, can navigate GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to the transition zone for γTuRC assembly during primary cilium formation.</p><p>CEP290 is a centriolar or ciliary protein that localizes to the centrosomes in dividing cells, the distal mother centriole in quiescent cells, and the transition zone in the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Mutations in <italic>CEP290</italic> are associated with various diseases, such as the devastating blinding disease Leber’s congenital amaurosis, nephronophthisis, Senior Lǿken syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, and lethal Meckel–Gruber syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drivas and Bennett, 2014</xref>). In particular, the phenotypes of CEP290-associated ciliopathies are very similar to those in our <italic>Crb3</italic> knockout mouse model, with lethality and ocular and renal abnormalities. CEP290 knockdown significantly decreased the number of cells with primary cilia, and CEP290 knockout mice showed mislocalization of ciliary proteins in the retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tsang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, the depletion of CEP290 disrupts protein trafficking to centrosomes and affects the recruitment of the BBSome and vesicular trafficking in ciliary assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stowe et al., 2012</xref>). Although CEP290 serves as a hub to recruit many ciliary proteins, it has not been reported to be involved in polarized vesicle trafficking or localization. Our study verified that CEP290 could interact with the polarity protein CRB3. CRB3 knockdown disrupts the interaction between CEP290 and Rab11-positive endosomes. Thus, these results validate our hypothesis. Although CRB3 navigates GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290, we further need to detect the region of CRB3 interacting with CEP290 and what other cargos are transported by CRB3/Rab11 trafficking vesicles in ciliary assembly.</p><p>In addition, our results showed that CRB3 knockdown failed to activate the Hh signaling pathway with SAG in MCF10A cells. Under untreated conditions, PTCH1 located at the ciliary membrane inhibits SMO, and Suppressor of Fused (SuFu) sequesters Gli transcription factors, leading to their degradation. SAG can activate the Hh signaling pathway, resulting in dissociation into the nucleus to regulate the expression of downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wheway et al., 2018</xref>). The Hh signaling pathway mainly regulates cellular growth and differentiation and is abnormal in different types of tumors. Some studies indicate that cilia are double-sided, promoting and preventing cancer development through the Hh signaling pathway in vivo. It is thought that cilia deletion could activate SMO to inhibit tumor growth, while promoting carcinogenesis was induced by activated Gli2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2009</xref>). Although SAG cannot activate the Hh signaling pathway in CRB3-depleted cells, further research is needed to determine the role of CRB3 in the carcinogenic process through the ciliary Hh signaling pathway in PyMT-cKO-Crb3 mice. Additionally, another canonical Wnt signaling pathway was altered after CRB3 knockdown. The Wnt signaling pathway is an important cascade regulating development and stemness, and aberrant Wnt signaling has been reported in many cancer entities, especially colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhan et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, CRB3 downregulated the expression of β-catenin. Thus, CRB3 can affect cilium-related signaling pathways in tumorigenesis.</p><p>In summary, our study provides novel evidence for the role of the apical polarity protein CRB3 in regulating viability, mammary and ocular development, and primary cilium formation in germline and conditional knockout mice. Deletion of CRB3 caused irregular lumen formation and ductal epithelial hyperplasia in mammary epithelial-specific knockout mice. Further study uncovered a new function of CRB3b in interacting with Rab11, navigating GCP6/Rab11 trafficking vesicles to CEP290 for γTuRC assembly during ciliogenesis. In addition, CRB3 also participates in regulating cilium-related Hh and Wnt signaling pathways in tumorigenesis. Understanding these polarity protein-mediated vesicle trafficking mechanisms will shed new light on luminal development and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of floxed <italic>Crb3</italic> mice</title><p>All animal experiments were verified and approved by the Committee of Institutional Animal Care and Use of Xi'an Jiaotong University (permit number: XJTUAE2018-1801).

Next, they create a conditional knockout mouse specifically lacking CRB3 in mammary gland epithelial cells and show that this leads to ductal epithelial hyperplasia, impaired branching morphogenesis and tumorigenesis. To study the mechanism by which CRB3 affects mammary epithelial development and morphogenesis the authors turn to MCF10A cells and find that CRB3 shRNA-mediated knockdown in these cells impairs their ability to form properly polarized acini in 3D cultures. Furthermore, they find that MCF10A cells lacking CRB3 display reduced primary ciliation frequency compared to control cells, which is supported by rescue experiments and is in agreement with previous studies implicating CRB3 in primary cilia biogenesis. Using a combination of biochemical, molecular- and imaging approaches the authors then provide evidence indicating that CRB3 promotes ciliogenesis by mediating Rab11-dependent recruitment of gamma-tubulin ring complex (gamma-TuRC) component GCP6 to the centrosome/ciliary base, and they also show that CRB3 itself is localized to the base of primary cilia. Finally, to assess the functional consequences of CRB3 loss on ciliary signaling function, the authors analyze the effect of CRB3 loss on Hedgehog and Wnt signaling using cell-based assays or a mouse model.</p><p>Overall, the described findings are interesting and in agreement with previous studies showing an involvement of CRB3 in epithelial cell biology, tumorigenesis and ciliogenesis. The results showing a role for CRB3 in mammary epithelial development and morphogenesis in vivo seem convincing. Although the authors provide evidence that CRB3 promotes ciliogenesis via (indirect) physical association with Rab11 and gamma-TuRC, the precise mechanism by which CRB3 promotes ciliogenesis remains to be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id

Based on your suggestions, we performed the rescue experiments to observe any alterations in the primary cilia of CRB3-depleted MCF10A cells with overexpressed CRB3.

Figure 3G: it is very difficult to see that the red stained structures are primary cilia.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the staining structure of primary cilia in mammary ductal lumen are less clear than that of individual cells and in renal tubule in Figure 3G. We used recognized acetylated tubulin and γ-tubulin to stain the primary cilia, which were clearly labeled in individual cells. However, the labeled primary cilia in renal tubule were longer length and demonstrated a more pronounced structure than those in the mammary ductal lumen. In the mammary ductal lumen of the 10 mice we analyzed, the primary cilia showed shorter length and staining structure than the others shown in Figure 3G. This difference may be due to the distinct characteristics of primary cilia in different tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Figure 8E: if cells do not make cilia when CRB3 is lost (Figure 3), how is it possible to analyze SMO localization to cilia in these cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We used immunofluorescence techniques, with acetylated tubulin and SMO co-staining, to analyze the localization of SMO to cilia. The results of immunofluorescent staining of primary cilium and statistical analysis in Figure 3 showed that the proportion of cells with primary cilium was significantly lower in the CRB3 knockdown group, but cells with primary cilium were still present. We used laser confocal microscopy micrographs to identify cells with primary cilium by staining acetylated tubulin, then analyzed the co-localization under the SMO channel, and finally analyzed the proportion of SMO-positive cilia. Several publications (J Cell Biol. 2020;219(6):e201904107; Science. 2008;320(5884):1777-81; Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012;109(34):13644-9.) have demonstrated that knocking down genes can affect primary cilium formation, and this method has also been used to examine the localization of SMO-related signaling pathway molecules on primary cilium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 366-366: based on the relative low magnification of the images in Figure 8H it is difficult to assess the subcellular localization of GLI1 and whether there is a difference between wild type and the Crb3 mutant cells. For example, it is not clear if GLI1 is localizing to the centrosome-cilium axis. Please modify the text accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your good suggestions. As you mentioned, IHC cannot observe the subcellular localization of GLI1 on the centrosome-cilium axis. However, since GLI1 is a transcriptional effector at the terminal end of the Hh signaling pathway, we may not have made it clear that what we observed in the IHC results was the localization of GLI1 in the nucleus. Therefore, we have revised the description accordingly, as described in line 368 and lines 520-521.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

In this study, the authors never mention this fact and when using approaches to KO or KD CRB3A/B they are likely to deplete both isoforms which have been shown to have different C-terminal domains and functions (Fan et al., 2007). This is also important for the CRB3 antibodies used in the study since according to the material and methods section they are either against the extracellular domain common to both isoforms or the intracellular domain which is only similar in the domain close to transmembrane between the 2 isoforms. Since the antibodies used in each figure are not detailed it is impossible to know if the authors are detecting CRB3A or B or both. Please provide the information and correct for the actual isoform detected in the data and conclusions.</p></list-item></list><p>From the revised version we know now that CRB3B is used for exogenous expression. It has been shown that each isoform has a different role and localization in cells so why focus only on CRB3B for this study?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comments. First, previous literature has reported that CRB3b localizes in the primary cilium of MDCK cells. We have corrected the Introduction to specify CRB3b (line 81). Secondly, in the methodology section, we show that the CDs sequence of CRB3b was PCR-amplified from RNA extracted from MCF10A cells. We also designed primers specific to CRB3a but were unable to amplify them, indicating that CRB3b is significantly more expressed in epithelial cells than CRB3a. Finally, according to the company recommended by Genecards website for purchasing CRB3 cloning products, the only CRB3 sequence available in the CRB3 cDNA ORF Clone in Cloning Vector, Human (Cat: HG14324-G) from Sino Biological is CRB3b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The authors use GFP-CRB3A/B, it is not stated which isoform, over-expression to localize CRB3A/B in MCF10A cells (figure 4A). The levels of expression appear to be very high in the GFP panel and it is likely that the secretory pathway of the cells is clogged with GFP-CRB3A/B in transit from the ER to the plasma membrane. Thus, the co-localization with pericentrin might be due to the accumulation of ER and Golgi around the centrosome. This co-localization should be done with the endogenous CRB3A/B and with a better resolution.</p></list-item></list><p>The authors do not answer about the potential mislocalization of overexpressed exogenous protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer's perspective. The large amount of exogenous protein overexpression in the cell could potentially obstruct the protein secretion pathway, resulting in the accumulation of the exogenous protein at the ER and Golgi. Such accumulation could create the false impression of co-localization between CRB3b and the centrosome. To provide additional details (lines 215-217 and lines 426-433), we re-expressed the results exogenously and subsequently used staining of endogenous CRB3 and γ-tubulin in Figure 4C to confirm the co-localization of CRB3 and the centrosome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The staining for CRB3A/B in Figure 4C (red) is striking with a very strong accumulation in an undefined intracellular structure and the authors do not provide any explanation for such a difference with the GFP-CRB3A/B just above.</p></list-item></list><p>The authors explain that two different photonic techniques are used (classical versus confocal) but in a cell biology manuscript confocal microscopy is now the standard technique.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have included a discussion on the partial concordance between CRB3's endogenous staining and exogenous expression results in the &quot;Discussion&quot; section, specifically in lines 420-435.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>In addition, the authors claim (Line 251/252) that Rab11 is necessary for the transport of CRB3A/B but they should KD Rab11 to show this.</p></list-item></list><p>The author's answer is that blocking endocytosis with dynasore is as good as knocking down Rab11 to show its interaction and role in CRB3A/B transport which is not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. As requested by the reviewers, we have conducted experiments to knockdown Rab11 and detect CRB3 intracellular trafficking, as shown in the new Figure 5-Supplement 2B and added lines 258-260. These results provide additional support for our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The domain of CRB3A/B that is necessary for the interaction with Rab11 is the N-terminal part of the extracellular domain. This domain is thus inside the transport vesicles and not accessible from the cytoplasm. Given that Rab11 is a cytoplasmic protein, how the 2 proteins could interact across the membrane? The authors do not even discuss this essential point for their hypothesis.Comment on the revised version: the authors still do not understand the basic of cell biology since they claim that the extracellular domain of CRB3 can be in contact with Rab11 after endocytosis. Even after endocytosis the extracellular domain of CRB3A/B is inside the lumen of the endosome and not in contact with the cytosol where Rab11 is located. Lines 420-421 of the revised manuscript still claim this interaction between the two proteins without providing the link between the cytosol where Rab11 is and the endosome lumen where the extracellular domain of CRB3A/B is. Please correct.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive comments. After carefully studying the relevant knowledge, we strongly agree with the reviewer's point of view. We have toned down our claim and removed the description regarding the binding of Rab11 endosomes to specific structural domains of intracellular CRB3 that we were unable to confirm (see lines 443-444 and lines 465-466).</p></body></sub-article></article>
