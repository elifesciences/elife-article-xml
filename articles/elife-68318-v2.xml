Data on self-reported sexual partner age distributions are available from a variety of sources. We sought to explore statistical models that accurately predict the distribution of sexual partner ages over age and sex. We identified which probability distributions and outcome specifications best captured variation in partner age and quantified the benefits of modelling these data using distributional regression.

Consequently, sexual age-mixing has been of great interest to researchers studying the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the beginning of the global epidemic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 1992</xref> used a model of partnership formation to predict that mixing between young women and older men would amplify the already-substantial effect of HIV on population growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garnett and Anderson, 1994</xref> used a mathematical model to show that patterns of age-mixing could substantially influence the magnitude and timing of hypothetical epidemic trajectories, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hallett et al., 2007</xref> demonstrated that delaying sexual debut and increasing age-similar partnerships could reduce an individual’s risk of HIV infection in a highly endemic setting.</p><p>These modelling studies have been complemented by analyses of survey and population cohort data on age-mixing patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gregson et al., 2002</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schaefer et al., 2017</xref> observed that individuals with older partners were at greater risk of HIV infection in a general-population cohort in Zimbabwe. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ritchwood et al., 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maughan-Brown et al., 2016</xref> found that larger age differences were associated with more risky sexual behaviour in surveys of young South African people. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akullian et al., 2017</xref> found that partner age was an important risk factor for HIV infection in a cohort study in rural South Africa. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harling et al., 2014</xref> found that age-disparate relationships were not associated greater risk of HIV acquisition in young women in South Africa.</p><p>These results underscore the importance of considering age-mixing dynamics when designing and evaluating HIV prevention strategies, and, consequently, the importance of measuring them accurately. For example, an intervention aiming to prevent new HIV infections among young women could be attenuated by high prevalence among older men. Identifying changes in sexual partner age distributions and attributing them to interventions might even be a valuable end by itself, in which case accurate measurement must be complemented by an effective modelling strategy.</p><p>Data about sexual partner age-mixing are routinely collected by long-term cohort studies (such as those that comprise the Analysing Longitudinal Population-based HIV/AIDS data on Africa, or ALPHA, Network) and large-scale household surveys (such as the Demographic and Health Surveys) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">The DHS program, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reniers et al., 2016</xref>). Typically, these data consist of the respondent’s age and sex and the ages of their sexual partners in the last 12 months. These data are highly variable, skewed, and often deviate substantially from conventional parametric distributions, such as the normal distribution or the gamma distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beauclair et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>One may consider statistical modelling approaches for the distribution of partner age as a function of respondent age and sex. Some notable previous approaches to modelling partner age distributions include (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morris, 1991</xref>), who developed a log-linear modelling framework to quantify selective mixing from contingency tables, and applied the model to ordinal categorical data on husbands’ and wives’ ages in the United States. Hallett et al. used a log-logistic distribution to continuously model partner age differences for women aged 15–45 years, assuming that the partner age difference distributions did not vary over respondent age. More recently, as an input to a model of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Smid et al., 2018</xref> fit skew normal distributions to each age-/sex-specific partner age distribution and used a secondary regression model to smooth the estimated skew normal parameters across respondent age. They observed substantial changes in the estimated skew normal parameters with respect to respondent age. Although this method allows for non-linear variation across respondent age, their two-stage estimation process makes uncertainty propagation complex. Replacing this process with a single ‘distributional’ regression model, in which all distributional parameters (e.g. the location, scale, skewness, etc.) are modelled as functions of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kneib and Umlauf, 2017</xref>), allows for complex variation across respondent age while still robustly incorporating uncertainty. Another elegant approach has been the development of exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) to infer full partnership networks from individuals reports of the partnerships (’ego-centric’ observations of the network) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krivitsky and Morris, 2017</xref>). These stochastic methods, along with the broader suite of ERGMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hunter et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hunter et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krivitsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krivitsky and Handcock, 2014</xref>), can model social network data accurately with robust incorporation of covariates, and tools exist to incorporate their estimates into epidemic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morris, 1993</xref>).</p><p>We focused on evaluating parametric models for continuously representing the distribution of sexual partner ages conditional on the respondent’s age. We were specifically interested in distributions that introduce parameters to control tail weight, which may capture intergenerational mixing that could sustain endemic HIV and STI transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akullian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schaefer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harling et al., 2014</xref>). This led us to test the ability of the four-parameter ‘sinh-arcsinh’ distribution originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones and Pewsey, 2009</xref> to fit to these data.</p><p>We hypothesised that integrating the sinh-arcsinh distribution into a distributional modelling framework would allow us to replicate observed partner age distributions more accurately than prior modelling strategies. We tested this theory by comparing a variety of candidate strategies, which varied along three dimensions: the parametrisation of the dependent variable, the choice of distribution, and the method for incorporating variability across respondent age and sex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data</title><p>In this work, we compared a set of probability distributions and regression specifications to identify a modelling strategy that produced stable and accurate estimates of sexual partner age distributions with well-quantified uncertainty. We conducted two model comparison experiments to identify which of a set of strategies best replicated partner age distributions. First, in our probability distribution comparison, we identified which of a set of distribution-dependent variable combinations fit best to age-/sex-specific data subsets, and then, in our distributional regression evaluation, we tested whether distributional regression methods could be used to estimate age-/sex-specific partner age distributions by sharing strength across observations. In distributional regression, all parameters of a distribution can vary with respect to data, so it allowed us to smooth and interpolate even higher order moments of observed partner ages. We divided the model comparison into two separate experiments to make the probability distribution comparison as fair as possible (accounting for the possibility that certain distributions would perform particularly well under certain regression specifications).</p><p>We analysed data on sexual partner age distributions from three sources: the Africa Centre Demographic Information System, a health and demographic surveillance site in uMkhanyakude district, South Africa collected by the African Health Research Institute (AHRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gareta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gareta et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gareta et al., 2020b</xref>), the Manicaland General Population Cohort in Zimbabwe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gregson et al., 2017</xref>), and the 2016–2017 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Haiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Institut Haïtien de l’Enfance, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The AHRI and Manicaland studies are multi-round, open, general population cohort studies designed to measure the dynamics of HIV, sexual risk behaviour, and demographic change in sub-Saharan African settings. We used rounds one through six of the Manicaland study, collected between 1998 and 2013. The AHRI data we used were collected annually between 2004 and 2018. The 2016–17 Haiti DHS was a large, nationally representative household survey conducted in 2016 and 2017. We did not incorporate the weights associated with the survey into this analysis because our primary interest was in statistical modelling of partner age distribution as a function of respondent age, not producing population representative statistics for the Haitian population.</p><p>These data sets consisted of individuals’ reports of their own age and sex and the ages of each of their sexual partners from the last year.

These questionnaires do not ask specifically about partner sex, but self-reporting of non-heterosexual partnerships in these populations is thought to be low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias Garcia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">World Health Organization and UNAIDS, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Respondents in each of these data sets are disproportionately likely to report that their partners’ ages are multiples of five or multiples of five away from their own age, leading to distinct ‘heaping’ in the empirical partner age (or age difference) distributions at multiples of five. For example, if a questionnaire asks ‘how many years older or younger is your partner than you?', respondents might be disproportionately likely to report a multiple of five, leading to age <italic>differences</italic> that are heaped on multiples of five. We tested the sensitivity of our results to heaping by developing a simple ‘deheaping’ algorithm, applying it to the AHRI data, and running each analysis on the deheaped AHRI data. We present these results in Appendix section ‘Age heaping'.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Probability distribution comparison</title><p>To identify the best probability distribution for modelling sexual partner age distributions, we split all three data sets into 12 subsets by sex and five-year age bin ranging from 20 to 50, resulting in 36 subsets, and fit a number of distribution-dependent variable combinations to each subset.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Distributions</title><p>We tested five candidate probability distributions: normal, skew normal, beta, gamma, and sinh-arcsinh. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> summarises the domains, parameters, and probability density functions (PDFs) of these distributions. Because the gamma distribution is always right-skewed and men typically partner with women who are younger than them, we transformed data among male respondents to be right-skewed when using the gamma distribution. Specifically, we multiplied the men’s partners’ ages by −1 to reflect the distribution horizontally across the y-axis, and added 150 to the reflected ages to ensure that all resulting values were positive. Similarly, the beta distribution is only defined on the interval (0, 1), so, only when using a beta distribution, we scaled all partner ages to be between zero and one using upper and lower bounds of 0 and 150.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Details of the five distributions tested in this analysis.</title><p>We define <inline-formula><mml:math

This approach presents a number of advantages over previous methods. First, like Smid et al., it allows a unique distribution for every age-sex combination. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> illustrates, partner age distributions can exhibit substantial, systematic variation across age and sex in any of the first four moments, so we must consider modelling strategies that allow for such variation. Second, distributional regression offers a principled method to propagate uncertainty through this estimation process.</p><p>Finally, distributional regression implemented through brms provides access to a deep set of hierarchical modelling tools that could enable estimation in a variety of low-data settings. We evaluated a small set of relatively simple distributional models in this work, but, theoretically, each distributional parameter could have its own, arbitrarily complex hierarchical regression model. Using these tools, one could estimate unique partner age distributions across levels of stratification that are substantively interesting but do not provide sufficient sample size for independent estimation (e.g. study sites or geographic areas).</p><p>We have identified several limitations in this approach. First, the amount of data required to produce usefully precise estimates is not tested. Each additional distributional parameter introduces model parameters, so this method is more complex than conventional regression. The sinh-arcsinh distribution did fail to produce the highest ELPD in our smallest data subset (N = 170), but it was not significantly worse than the best distribution. More importantly, by integrating these data into a distributional modelling framework, we gain the ability to impose structure on these parameters, which could easily offset the cost of any additional model parameters.</p><p>Interpreting the inferred model parameters in sinh-arcsinh regression can also be difficult. Although conventional regression estimates the effects of covariates on expected values, the sinh-arcsinh distribution is parametrised in terms of a location parameter. This parameter correlates closely with the central tendency of the distribution, but it is not strictly equal to the mean. We can reparametrise the distribution so that we estimate a mean (and therefore effects of covariates on the expected value), but it is not currently possible in the probabilistic programming software that underlies brms.</p><p>Third, our analysis assumed that we were operating at a level of stratification at which partnerships are basically comparable, but any number of factors could lead to fundamentally different partner age distributions. For example, we did not control for whether the partnership was same-sex or the type of the partnership (married, casual, etc.). That said, our distributional framework would allow us to incorporate data on any of those factors directly into the model.</p><p>There are two sources of possible non-independence in our data sets that were not modelled. First, in the two cohort studies, participants are eligible to participate in multiple survey rounds, in which case the same partnership could be reported multiple times in our data set. Second, many individuals report multiple partners in the same survey, and the age of one partner may be correlated ages of other partners, for example due to individual preferences for partnerships. Because we modelled multiple observations of the same individual as conditionally independent, we anticipate that these correlations may artificially increase the precision of our estimates.</p><p>Finally, our model does not address any reporting biases in self-reported partnership data. If certain relationship types are perceived as less socially acceptable, respondents might be less likely to report them, resulting in systematic missingness. Our method could still be appropriate to model the age distribution from the data reported about an under-reported partnership type, but it cannot predict whether or not a given partnership exists. However, if under-reporting correlates with partner age (or age difference), then the empirical distributions will be biased and our method will only smooth and interpolate the biased data.</p><p>Despite these limitations, we believe that the strategy we present will work well in future projects that require estimates of partner age distributions. We plan to use these methods to produce age-mixing matrices to inform epidemic models of HIV, but there are a number of additional directions that could be explored. We are specifically interested in leveraging the spatio-temporal structure of the survey data used here. Hierarchical mapping exercises with household survey data are increasingly common in epidemiology, but estimating spatially varying partner age distributions would require an evaluation of how best to model higher order moments over space. We would, for example, need to consider how the variance of partner age distributions varies by urbanicity.</p><p>Similarly, population-based studies typically collect far more detailed information on partnerships than we took advantage of here. Relationship type is a key confounder of the association between respondent age and partner age (that we ignored for the purposes of our experiments). We might expect the age distributions of casual partners to vary substantially from those of long-term cohabiting partners. Because we have built our model in an existing regression framework, incorporating new covariates into any of the distributional regression specifications is straightforward. The distribution regression framework with the sinh-arcsinh may also be a useful parametric model for continuous representation of marginal distributions within sexual mixing models or network models, such as the ERGM framework.</p><p>We believe that our framework offers a flexible, accurate, and robust method for smoothing and interpolating sexual partner age distributions, but these methods are not specific to partner age distributions. The sinh-arcsinh distribution is relatively easy to implement without incurring high computational cost, so it could be applied in many settings. Even without the distributional regression framework, we have used here, allowing the third and fourth moments of the distribution to vary from the ‘default’ normal values could be valuable across a variety of applications.</p><p>Distributional regression is also underutilised in social science applications. We often work with large surveys that would comfortably support models for higher order parameters. Data requirements will vary by application and model, but, as we have shown here, even a simple distributional model can improve fit and avoid biasing estimates.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>JWE, SG, and KAR acknowledge funding support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1190661, OPP1164897).

heaping</title><p>Respondents in each of these data sets are disproportionately likely to report that their partners’ ages are multiples of five or multiples of five away from their own age, leading to distinct ‘spikes’ in the empirical partner age (or age difference) distributions at multiples of five. The left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> illustrates this phenomenon among women aged 24 years in the AHRI data. These spikes, widely referred to as ‘heaping’, could bias our results towards certain probability distributions, so we developed a simple deheaping algorithm, applied it to the AHRI data.</p><p>To account for the possibility that heaping affected the results, we developed a simple deheaping algorithm and treated the deheaped AHRI data as a fourth data set. Due to the structure of the questionnaire (‘how many years older or younger is your partner than you?’), the AHRI partner age data exhibit strong heaping on partner ages that are multiples of five years from the respondent’s age. For example, among women aged 24 years, we observe far more partners aged exactly 29 years than expected.</p><p>Let <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf58"><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> be the number of observed partnerships with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf59"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf61"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Include more discussion about biases in self-reported data, including misreporting of partnership characteristics, selection bias, and missing data; also, discuss how these biases may affect the modelling of age mixing patterns.</p><p>2) Some methods could be further clarified by including text from the appendix into the main text.</p><p>3) Discuss how your results compare with and add to previous statistical frameworks for age mixing, notably log-linear models for mixing and Exponential-family Random Graph Models</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Wolock et al. compare the ability of different distributions to fit sexual age mixing patterns in a variety of settings, and provide a modeling framework for fitting these distributions across all ages without having to partition the data into separate datasets. They convincingly demonstrate that a sinh-arcsinh distribution will better fit the data than many other commonly used distributions, and also explore various ways of parameterizing age differences between partners. In general, the sinh-arcsinh produced both better fit statistics and more visually pleasing fits to the data. Moreover, the results confirm that more complex distributional assumptions with more parameters are in many cases warranted to fit age mixing patterns.</p><p>Particular strengths of this study are the exhaustive examination of multiple distributional assumptions, the use of multiple datasets to test the generalizability of results across regions, and use of objective fit statistics to discriminate between models and distributions. I do not see any major weaknesses, apart from maybe the issue of how possible it would be to fit these more complex distributions and models to smaller datasets, where there is less data to inform parameters.</p><p>As the authors point out, the methods outlined in this paper could be extended by including further stratification factors predicting age mixing, or potentially also mixing by some other continuous characteristics that are not expected to follow a normal distribution. The authors provided some sample code for fitting these distributions to the data, which should help others implement their proposed methods.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>• I had a lot of difficulty following the methods for the second aim, the regression component. I was very unclear on what was the outcome (dependent variables) being modeled and what were the parameters of the model. The appendix on model specifications helped to explain this a bit more. I think the manuscript would benefit from putting the model specification details from the appendix in the main text, as I could not understand what was being done without this further information.</p><p>• I find the heaping of ages surprising. This might have occurred due to the way the question about partner age was framed to participants. It might be useful to comment on the wording of this question across the different studies, and if there was a particular way of wording the question that led to more heaping in one study than in others.</p><p>• P. 8 I was initially confused as to why there are 36 subsets, given that there are only 2 sexes and 6 age groups between 20 and 50. It was not clear that there was a third stratification (survey).

The authors use data from three population-level surveys where respondents report the ages of their most recent sexual partners. The authors use a Bayesian distributional regression approach to fit probability distribution parameters to the data and assess model performance. In this way, the authors demonstrate that a unique distribution of partnership ages can be reconstructed for each age and sex combination. The best fitting distributions and parameterizations are presented in the paper and the authors found that the sinh-arcsinh distribution most accurately reconstructed the distribution of partnership ages for each of the three geographies. Results from this analysis will be highly useful as a component of HIV (or other STI) risk prediction or to reconstruct sexual networks for mathematical models of STI transmission.</p><p>The main strength of this analysis is the simplicity of their modeling approach, which uses probability distributions with few parameters to capture the age distribution of sexual partnerships. This approach will allow researchers to easily simulate age- and sex-specific partnership probabilities and inherent uncertainty in those estimates without the need for complex empirical distributions.</p><p>Weaknesses of the analysis center around the inherent limitations of self-reported data on sexual partnership age. The authors use data on self-reported age(s) of a respondent's partnership(s) in the last 12 months. The authors don't consider potential reporting biases and missing data associated with self-report that may be differential by age, gender, and relationship type. For example, some individuals may selectively report certain types of partners over others – perhaps stable partnerships versus transient ones. Missing data is quite common for sensitive questions on sexual histories and thus the results presented here should be interpreted with that in mind. It is important to consider that some relationship types may be under-represented and may lead to biased age distributions.</p><p>Nonetheless, the results support the conclusions made by the authors. This paper makes an important methodological contribution to the literature on sexual networks and has broad application to understanding the transmission of STI's, especially HIV in diverse settings.</p><p>Overall this paper has a sound methodological approach and is clearly written.</p><p>1.Page 12, line 241, the number of partnerships is indicated for each geography but not the number of respondents. Would be good to understand how many individuals reported just one partner versus more than one. Also, I assume the same partner could be reported multiple times at different survey rounds for the two longitudinal datasets, which could create pseudo replication. Could the authors discuss how this type of correlated data might influence the uncertainty estimates?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The primary weakness with this manuscript is that the authors appear to be unaware of two robust statistical frameworks that have been used to estimate age mixing (and other forms of heterogeneous mixing) for many years.</p><p>The first is the use of log-linear models for mixing matrices (Morris, 1991, 1993). These models can be used to fit a wide array of mixing patterns, both discrete and continuous, and are also quite general. They offer everything from parsimonious summary parameterization (with assessments of goodness of fit) to dummy parameterization for each cell in the matrix to get exact fits. They benefit from the well developed statistical theory and methods that support generalized linear models. While they can be generalized to include random effects for persons, the limitations of these models is that they can not be used to represent &quot;edge dependence&quot; (think monogamy bias – the presence of one spouse (&quot;edge&quot;) has a profound effect on the probabilty of another spouse for the same individual). The papers above integrate the resulting estimates into a standard deterministic compartmental model for epidemic simulation.</p><p>The second is the more recent Exponential-family Random Graph Models (ERGMs, and their temporal cousins TERGMs – references provided below). These models are also a form of GLM, but extend the log-linear framework with the capability to represent dependent edges. They are designed primarily for use with stochastic network epidemic models, and are sufficiently well established that they serve as the foundation for the EpiModel (Jenness et al. 2018) software package.</p><p>In both cases, the benefit of these models is that they are a general, principled statistical framework, with well understood properties and established methods for model testing and evaluation. This enables the analyst to model not only age mixing, but other forms of heterogeneous mixing (e.g., by sex, or geographic location, or race/ethnicity), and, in the case of TERGMs, degree distributions and higher order network configurations, along with heterogeneous edge duration. All of these terms can be estimated jointly, from sampled network data, and simulations from the estimated model will reproduce the sufficient statistics in expectation. This latter property makes these models a natural foundation for epidemic simulation.</p><p>As a result, the added value of this distributional regression strategy is unclear. And this statement: &quot;More broadly, no previous work has systematically evaluated the wide variety of distributions potentially available to model partner age distributions&quot; is simply untrue. Both frameworks above provide general methods for fitting and assessing a wide variety of distributions.</p><p>References:</p><p>Morris, M.

The reviewers raise a good point about missingness and bias. Our method cannot resolve the limitations inherent in self-reported data, but, for certain types of missingness, it could be used to smooth and interpolate missing data. We have included a paragraph (lines 456-463) addressing this limitation:</p><p>“Finally, our model does not address any reporting biases in self-reported partnership data. If certain relationship types are perceived as less socially acceptable, respondents might be less likely to report them, resulting in systematic missingness. Our method could still be appropriate to model the age distribution from the data reported about an under-reported partnership type, but it cannot predict whether or not a given partnership exists. However, if under-reporting correlates with partner age (or age difference), then the empirical distributions will be biased and our method will only smooth and interpolate the biased data.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some methods could be further clarified by including text from the appendix into the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback.

We focused our analysis on a relatively narrow problem of identifying continuous parametric models for sexual partner ages conditional on an individual’s age and sex. We agree with the editors and reviewer that it is valuable to connect our work to the broader context of more general and flexible statistical approaches to model sexual partner mixing matrices and sexual network, and greatly appreciate the suggestion.</p><p>We have elaborated the introductory paragraph on previous approaches to modelling sexual partner age distributions to also draw connections to this wider literature (lines 52-77; revisions emphasised below):</p><p>“One may consider statistical modelling approaches for the distribution of partner age as a function of respondent age and sex.
