Only in favourable cases is it possible to provide atomic-level descriptions of sparsely populated and transiently formed alternative conformations. Here we benchmark the ability of enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations to determine the free energy landscape of the L99A cavity mutant of T4 lysozyme. We find that the simulations capture key properties previously measured by NMR relaxation dispersion methods including the structure of a minor conformation, the kinetics and thermodynamics of conformational exchange, and the effect of mutations. We discover a new tunnel that involves the transient exposure towards the solvent of an internal cavity, and show it to be relevant for ligand escape. Together, our results provide a comprehensive view of the structural landscape of a protein, and point forward to studies of conformational exchange in systems that are less characterized experimentally.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17505.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17505.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17505.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are the workhorses of cells, where they perform a wide range of roles. To do so, they adopt specific three-dimensional structures that enable them to interact with other molecules as necessary. Often a protein needs to be able to shift between different states with distinct structures as it goes about its job. To fully understand how a protein works, it is important to be able to characterize these different structures and how the protein changes between them.</p><p>Many of the experimental techniques used to study protein structure rely on isolating the individual structural forms of a protein. Since many structures only exist briefly, this can be very difficult. To complement experimental results, computer simulations allow researchers to model how atoms behave within a molecule. However, a number of factors limit how well these models represent what happens experimentally, such as the accuracy of the physical description used for the modeling.</p><p>Wang et al. set out to test and benchmark how well computer simulations could model changes in structure for a protein called T4 lysozyme, which has been studied extensively using experimental techniques. T4 lysozyme exists in two different states that have distinct structures. By comparing existing detailed experimental measurements with the results of their simulations, Wang et al. found that the simulations could capture key aspects of how T4 lysozyme changes its shape.</p><p>The simulations described the structure of the protein in both states and accurately determined the relative proportion of molecules that are found in each state. They could also determine how long it takes for a molecule to change its shape from one state to the other. The findings allowed Wang et al. to describe in fine detail – down to the level of individual atoms – how the protein changes its shape and how mutations in the protein affect its ability to do so. A key question for future studies is whether these insights can be extended to other proteins that are less well characterized experimentally than T4 lysozyme.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17505.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17505.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>free energy landscape</kwd><kwd>conformational exchange</kwd><kwd>kinetics</kwd><kwd>nuclear magnetic resonance</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindorff-Larsen</surname><given-names>Kresten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindorff-Larsen</surname><given-names>Kresten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004893</institution-id><institution>Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindorff-Larsen</surname><given-names>Kresten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular simulations can capture key aspects of the conformational exchange in a protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins are dynamical entities whose ability to change shape often plays essential roles in their function. From an experimental point of view, intra-basin dynamics is often described via conformational ensembles whereas larger scale (and often slower) motions are characterized as a conformational exchange between distinct conformational states. The latter are often simplified as a two-site exchange process, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>⇌</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, between a highly populated ground (G) state, and a transiently populated minor (or ‘excited’, E) state. While the structure of the ground state may often be determined by conventional structural biology tools, it is very difficult to obtain atomic-level insight into minor conformations due to their transient nature and low populations. As these minor conformations may, however, be critical to protein functions, including protein folding, ligand binding, enzyme catalysis, and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulder et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baldwin and Kay, 2009</xref>) it is important to be able to characterize them in detail. While it may in certain cases be possible to capture sparsely populated conformations in crystals under perturbed experimental conditions, or to examine their structures by analysis of electron density maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fraser et al., 2009</xref>), NMR spectroscopy provides unique opportunities to study the dynamical equilibrium between major and minor conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baldwin and Kay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sekhar and Kay, 2013</xref>) via e.g. chemical-exchange saturation transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vallurupalli et al., 2012</xref>), Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>), or indirectly via paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2007</xref>) or residual dipolar coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lukin et al., 2003</xref>) experiments. In favourable cases such experiments can provide not only thermodynamic and kinetic information (i.e. the population of G and E states and the rate of exchange between them), but also structural information in the form of chemical shifts (CS), that can be used to determine the structure of the transiently populated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sekhar and Kay, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite the important developments in NMR described above, it remains very difficult to obtain structural models of minor conformations, and a substantial amount of experiments are required. Further, it is generally not possible to use such experiments to infer the mechanisms of interconversion, and to provide a more global description of the multi-state free energy landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhuravlev and Papoian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). In the language of energy landscape theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Onuchic et al., 1997</xref>), free energy basins and their depths control the population and stability of functionally distinct states, while the relative positions of basins and the inter-basin barrier heights determine the kinetics and mechanism of conformational exchange. As a complement to experiments, such functional landscapes can be explored by in silico techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, that may both be used to help interpret experimental data and provide new hypotheses for testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karplus and Lavery, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eaton and Muñoz, 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the general applicability of simulation methods may be limited by both the accuracy of the physical models (i.e. force fields) used to describe the free energy landscape and our ability to sample these efficiently by computation. We therefore set out to benchmark the ability of simulations to determine conformational free energy landscapes.</p><p>The L99A variant of lysozyme from the T4 bacteriophage (T4L) has proven an excellent model system to understand protein structure and dynamics. Originally designed a ‘cavity creating’ variant to probe protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eriksson et al., 1992b</xref>) it was also demonstrated that the large (150 Å<sup>3</sup>) internal cavity can bind hydrophobic ligands such as benzene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eriksson et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). It was early established that the cavity is inaccessible to solvent in the ground state, but that ligand binding is rapid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feher et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting protein dynamics to play a potential role in the binding process. This posts a long-standing question of how the ligands gain access to the buried cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mulder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>NMR relaxation dispersion measurements of L99A T4L demonstrated that this variant, but not the wild type protein, displayed conformational exchange on the millisecond timescale between the ground state and a minor state populated at around 3% (at room temperature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulder et al., 2001</xref>). Such small populations generally lead only to minimal perturbations of ensemble-averaged experimental quantities making structural studies difficult, and hence it was difficult to probe whether the exchange process indeed allowed for ligand access to the cavity. A series of additional relaxation dispersion experiments, however, made it possible to obtain backbone and side chain CSs of the minor E state of L99A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mulder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouvignies et al., 2011</xref>). The backbone CS data were subsequently used as input to a CS-based structure refinement protocol (CS-ROSETTA) to produce a structural model of the E state (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) of the L99A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouvignies et al., 2011</xref>).

Because the cavity is filled and solvent inaccessible in the E-state, the structure did, however, not reveal how ligands might access the cavity.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17505.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structures of the major G and minor E states of L99A T4L and the hidden state hypothesis.</title><p>The X-ray structure of the G state (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>; PDB ID code 3DMV) has a large internal cavity within the core of the C-terminal domain that is able to bind hydrophobic ligands.

The G and E states are overall similar, apart from the region surrounding the internal cavity.

We used enhanced-sampling MD simulations in explicit solvent and with state-of-the-art force fields to map the free-energy landscape including the exchange between the major and minor conformations of the protein. We used a series of recently developed metadynamics methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laio and Parrinello, 2002</xref>) to sample the conformational exchange process and associated structure and thermodynamics, as well as to determine the kinetics and mechanisms of exchange. We obtained additional insight into the structural dynamics of the E state using simulations that employed the experimental CSs as replica-averaged restraints. Our results provide a coherent picture of the conformational dynamics in L99A and extend the insights obtained from recent simulations of a triple mutant of T4L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vallurupalli et al., 2016</xref>), by providing new information about the mechanisms of exchange and the transient exposure of the internal cavity. Together with previous results for Cyclophilin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Papaleo et al., 2014</xref>) the results described here reiterate how simulation methods have now reached a stage where they can be used to study slow, conformational exchange processes such as those probed by NMR relaxation dispersion even in cases where less information is available from experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping the free-energy landscape</title><p>As the average lifetime of the G and E states are on the order of 20–50 ms and 1 ms, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mulder et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouvignies et al., 2011</xref>), direct and reversible sampling of the G-E transition at equilibrium would be extremely demanding computationally. Indeed, a recent set of simulations of a triple mutant of T4L, which has a substantially faster kinetics, was able only to observe spontaneous transitions in one direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vallurupalli et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore resorted to a set of flexible and efficient enhanced sampling methods, collectively known as ‘metadynamics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laio and Parrinello, 2002</xref>), that have previously been used in a wide range of applications. In metadynamics simulations, a time-dependent bias is continuously added to the energy surface along a small number of user-defined collective variables (CVs). In this way, sampling is enhanced to reach new regions of conformational space and at the same time allows one to reconstruct the (Boltzmann) free-energy surface. The success of the approach hinges on the ability to find a set of CVs that together describe the slowly varying degrees of freedom and map the important regions of the conformational landscape.</p><p>We first performed a set of metadynamics simulations in the well-tempered ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barducci et al., 2008</xref>) using so-called path CVs (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:msub><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Branduardi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saladino et al., 2012</xref>) with the aid of recently developed adaptive hills to aid in the convergence of the sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branduardi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dama et al., 2014</xref>) (see details in Appendix and <xref ref-type="table" rid="AP-tbl1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).

Indeed, NMR data demonstrated that the triple mutant roughly inverts the populations of the two states so that the minor state structure (of L99A) now dominates (with a 96% population) the triple mutant. We repeated the calculations described above for L99A also for the triple mutant. Remarkably, the free energy profile of the triple mutant obtained using metadynamics simulations reveals a free energy landscape with a dominant minimum around <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf55"><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>=0.7 and a higher energy conformation around <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf56"><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>=0.15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, like our previous observations for a ‘state-inverting mutation’ in Cyclophilin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Papaleo et al., 2014</xref>), we find here that the force field and the sampling method are sufficiently accurate to capture the effect of point mutations on the free energy landscape. Further, we note that the barrier height for the conformational exchange in the triple mutant is very similar to the value recently estimated using a completely orthogonal approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vallurupalli et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, we attempted to determine the free energy landscape of the L99A,G113A double mutant, which has roughly equal populations of the two states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouvignies et al., 2011</xref>), but this simulation did not converge on the simulation timescales at which the two other variants converged.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Calculating conformational free energies</title><p>With a free-energy surface in hand and a method to distinguish G- and E-state conformations, we calculated the free energy difference, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf57"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, between the two conformational states, and compared with the experimental values.

Although a stricter definition of how to divide the reaction coordinate certainly helps the precise calculation, here we just used this simple definition to make an approximate estimation of the free energy difference. Further, since the barrier region is sparsely populated, the exact point of division has only a modest effect on the results. By summing the populations on the two sides of the barrier we calculated <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf59"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> as a function of the simulation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Initially during the simulations the free energy profile varies substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the free energy difference equally fluctuates. As the simulations converge, however, the free energy difference between the two states stabilize to a value at approximately <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>=3.5 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, black line).

Combining these two free energy differences we find that the G113A, R119P mutations cause a shift in the G-E free energy of 5.1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> in simulations compared to 4.0 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> obtained by experiments. Thus, we find that the simulations with reasonably high accuracy are able to capture the thermodynamics of the conformational exchange between the two states. While the generality of such observations will need to be established by additional studies, we note here that comparably good agreement was obtained when estimating the effect of the S99T mutations in Cyclophilin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Papaleo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In our previous work on Cyclophilin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Papaleo et al., 2014</xref>) we sampled the conformational exchange using parallel-tempering metadynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonomi and Parrinello, 2010</xref>) using four CVs that we chose to describe the structural differences between the G and E states in that protein. We note here that we also tried a similar approach here but unfortunately failed to observe a complete G-to-E transition, even in a relatively long trajectory of about 1 μs per replica (CVs summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="AP-tbl2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>, parameters shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="AP-tbl1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). This negative result is likely due to the CVs chosen did not fully capture the relevant, slowly changing degrees of freedom, thus giving rise to insufficient sampling even with the use of a parallel tempering scheme.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Calculating the rates of conformational exchange</title><p>Enhanced-sampling simulations such as those described above provide an effective means of mapping the free-energy landscape and hence the structural and thermodynamic aspects of conformational exchange. While the same free-energy landscape also determines the kinetics and mechanisms of exchange it may be more difficult to extract this information from e.g. path-CV-based metadynamics (PathMetaD) simulations. To examine how well simulations can also be used to determine the rates of the G-to-E transitions, quantities that can also be measured by NMR, we used the recently developed ‘infrequent metadynamics’ method (InMetaD, see details in Appendix) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tiwary and Parrinello, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Salvalaglio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tiwary et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2015b</xref>). Briefly described, the approach calculates first-passage times for the conformational change in the presence of a slowly-added bias along a few CVs, here chosen as the path CVs also used to map the landscape. By adding the bias slowly (and with lower amplitude) we aim to avoid biasing the transition-state region and hence to increase the rate only by lowering the barrier height; in this way it is possible to correct the first-passage times for the bias introduced.</p><p>Using this approach on L99A T4L we collected 42 and 36 independent trajectories with state-to-state transition starting from either the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf64"><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> state or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf65"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> state, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="AP-fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AP-fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref> ).

In particular, the relatively close agreement between the two independent computational estimates lends credibility both to the free energy landscape and the approach used to estimate the kinetics. The observation that both values for L99A are slightly larger than the experimental number suggests that this discrepancy (ca. 1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>) can likely be explained by remaining force field deficiencies rather than lack of convergence or the computational approach used.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Simulations of the minor state using chemical shift restraints</title><p>While the simulations described above used available structural information of G and E states to guide and enhance conformational sampling, the resulting free energy surfaces represent the Boltzmann distributions of the force field and are not otherwise biased by experimental data.

In ABMD the system is perturbed by a ‘ratcheting potential’, which acts to ‘select’ spontaneous fluctuations towards the ligand-free state. In particular, the biasing potential is zero when the reaction coordinate (here chosen to be the RMSD of the ligand to the cavity-bound state) increases, but provides a penalty for fluctuations that brings the ligand closer to the cavity. In this way, we were able to observe multiple unbinding events in simulations despite the long lifetime (1.2 ms) of the ligand in the cavity. Most of trajectories (15 of the 20 events observed) reveal that benzene escapes from the cavity by following tunnel <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf157"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">#</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="AP-tbl6">Appendix 1—table 6</xref>).

We have studied the L99A variant of T4L as a model system that displays a complicated set of dynamical processes which have been characterized in substantial detail. Our results show that modern simulation methods are able to provide insight into such processes, paving the way for future studies for systems that are more difficult to study experimentally.</p><p>Using a novel method for defining an initial reference path between two conformations, we were able to sample the free energy landscape described by an accurate molecular force field. In accordance with experiments, the simulations revealed two distinct free energy basins that correspond to the major and minor states found by NMR. Quantification of the free energy difference between the two states demonstrated that the force field is able to describe conformational free energies to an accuracy of about 1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>. This high accuracy is corroborated by previous studies of a different protein, Cyclophilin A, where we also calculated conformational free energies and compared to relaxation dispersion experiments and found very good agreement. For both proteins we were also able to capture and quantify the effect that point mutations have on the equilibrium between the two states, and also here found good agreement with experiments. We note, however, that comparable simulations of the L99A/G113A mutant did not reach convergence.</p><p>Moving a step further, we here also calculated the kinetics of conformational exchange using a recently developed metadynamics method. For both the L99A variant and a population-inverting triple mutant we find that the calculated reaction rates are in remarkably good agreement with experiments. The ability to calculate both forward and backward rates provided us with the opportunity to obtain an independent estimate the calculated free energy difference. The finding that the free energy differences estimated in this way (for both L99A and the triple mutant) are close to those estimated from the free energy landscape provides an important validation of both approaches, and we suggest that, when possible, such calculations could be used to supplement conventional free energy estimates.</p><p>The free-energy landscape suggested that the E state is relatively broad and contains a wider range of conformations. To validate this observation, we used the same chemical shift information as was used as input to Rosetta and performed replica-averaged CS-restrained simulations. The resulting ensemble demonstrates that the experiments and force field, when used jointly, indeed are compatible with a broader E state. Thus, we suggest that the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf158"><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> structure and CS-restrained ensemble jointly describe the structure and dynamics of the E state.</p><p>While NMR experiments, in favourable cases, can be used to determine the structure, thermodynamics and kinetics of conformational exchange, a detailed description mechanism of interconversion remains very difficult to probe by experiments. We explored potential mechanisms of conformational exchange between the two states, finding at least two distinct routes. One route involved a direct transition with the central F114 entering the cavity within the protein, whereas a different possible mechanism involves transient partial-loosening of the protein. In both cases, the mechanism differs from the reference path that we used as a guide to map the free energy landscape, demonstrating that high accuracy of the initial guess for a pathway is not absolutely required in the metadynamics simulations, suggesting also the more general applicability of the approach.</p><p>Finally, we observed a set of conformations with a transiently opened tunnel that leads from the exterior of the protein to the internal cavity, that is similar to a recently discovered path that is exposed when the cavity is filled by ligands of increasing size. The fact that such a tunnel can be explored even in the absence of ligands suggests that intrinsic protein motions may play an important role in ligand binding, and indeed we observed this path to be dominant in simulations of ligand unbinding.</p><p>In total, we present a global view of the many, sometimes coupled, dynamical processes present in a protein. Comparison with a range of experimental observations suggests that the simulations provide a relatively accurate description of the protein, demonstrating how NMR experiments can be used to benchmark quantitatively the ability of simulations to study conformational exchange. We envisage that future studies of this kind, also when less is known about the structure of the alternative states, will help pave the way for using simulations to study the structural dynamics of proteins and how this relates to function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>System preparation</title><p>Our simulations were initiated in the experimentally determined structures of the ground state of L99A (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf159"><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>; PDB ID code 3DMV) or minor, E state (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf160"><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>; 2LCB).

As the first transition times should obey Poisson statistics, the reliability of the kinetics estimated from InMetaD can be assessed by a statistical analysis based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Salvalaglio et al., 2014</xref>).

It has previously been shown that reconnaissance metadynamics makes it possible to determine a path from a large set of input collective variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Söderhjelm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tribello et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>Infrequent Metadynamics (InMetaD)</title><p>We used the recently described ‘infrequent metadynamics’ (InMetaD) to obtain the rates of the conformational exchange process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tiwary and Parrinello, 2013</xref>). In standard metadynamics simulations it is very difficult to obtain kinetic properties because the biasing potential is added both to the free energy basins as well as the barriers that separate them. While it is potentially possible to determine the rates from the height of the free energy barriers, this requires both that the CVs used represent the entire set of slowly varying degrees of freedom, and also a good estimate of the pre-exponential factor to convert barrier height to a rate.</p><p>The key idea in InMetaD to circumvent these problems is to attempt to add the bias to the system more slowly than the barrier crossing time but faster than the slow inter-basin relaxation time, so that the transition state region has a lower risk of being biased, and therefore the transitions are less affected. By filling up a free energy basin by a known amount it is possible to determine how much the barrier has been decreased, and hence remove this bias from the rates determined. Thus, as described in more detail below, the approach works by performing a large number of individual simulations to obtain first passage times between the individual basins, which are then corrected by the known enhancement factors to obtain estimates of the unbiased rates. This method has been successfully used to reproduce the kinetics of conformational change of alanine dipeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tiwary and Parrinello, 2013</xref>) unbinding of the inhibitor benzamidine from trypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tiwary et al., 2015a</xref>) and slow unbinding of a simple hydrophobic cavity-ligand model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tiwary et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>In these simulations we used a deposition frequency of 80 or 100 ps (see parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="AP-tbl1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>), a value much lower than the deposition frequency of 1 ps used in the PathMetaD simulations described above.

However, unfortunately, we only observed partial G-to-E transitions, even in a relatively long trajectory of about 1 μs for each replica. This negative result suggested that these manually chosen CVs did not contain all the necessary slow degrees of freedom.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s29" sec-type="appendix"><title>Tunnel analysis</title><p>We used CAVER3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chovancova et al., 2012</xref>) to analyse the structures and CAVER Analyst1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kozlikova et al., 2014</xref>)(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.caver.cz/">http://www.caver.cz/</ext-link>, see also parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="AP-tbl4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>) to separate the tunnels into different clusters. CAVER Analyst is a standalone program based on CAVER3.0 algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chovancova et al., 2012</xref>). The settings for the tunnel calculations can be set through the Tunnel Computation window, while the advanced parameters can be set in the Tunnel Advanced Settings window. We used the center of mass of the cavity-related region (residue 93-124) as the position of the starting point. Average-link hierarchical clustering algorithm is performed to build a tree hierarchy of tunnel axes based on their pairwise distances. The size of the resulting clusters is dependent on the Clustering threshold parameter which specifies the level of detail at which the tree hierarchy of tunnel clusters will be cut. We used the default value so that the tree hierarchy of tunnel clusters is cut at the value of 3.5.</p></sec><sec id="s30" sec-type="appendix"><title>Adiabatic bias molecular dynamics</title><p>Adiabatic biased molecular dynamics (ABMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marchi and Ballone, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paci and Karplus, 1999</xref>) is an algorithm developed to accelerate the transition from the reactant state to the productive state, here corresponding to the ligand bound state and ligand-free state, respectively.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mapping transiently formed and sparsely populated conformations on a complex energy landscape&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Yibing Shan, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is James S Fraser (Reviewer #3), and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors employ state-of-art enhanced sampling techniques, including multiple variants of metadynamics, replica-averaged restrained MD and well-tempered replica-exchange MD, to conduct a systematic characterization of conformational dynamics of the L99A variant of T4L. This simulation study, which is shown to be in agreement with experimental measures of transition rates and kinetics, provides insights on the possible mechanism of conformational exchange between the ground state and the excited state. In particular, the excited state is shown to be conformationally broad and heterogeneous, and the transition path between the two states to be diverse. The work also identifies an key intermediate state for the transition, although its confirmation requires further experimental evidence.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Appreciating the thoroughness and the technical sophistication of the computation work and its robust connections with experimental data, the reviewers recognize the manuscript's value in benchmarking state-of-art simulation techniques and especially, in benchmarking conformational free energy calculations.</p><p>One of the more interesting parts of the of this study concerns the calculation of kinetic rate of the transition for L99A and the results is very encouraging. Because of its potential importance, this work would benefit greatly from additional calculations on mutants besides L99A. Specifically, the transition kinetics of L99A/G113A and L99A/G113A/R119P have been experimentally characterized. Calculating the kinetic rates of these two mutants and comparing the results with the experimental data would much strengthen case for the validity of such calculations.</p><p>The manuscript's attempt to elucidate the mechanism of ligand entrance is relatively weak. Further studies, for example, using simulations with ligand placed at the putative entrance to the channel in a partially open conformation would strengthen this part of the manuscript. If unsuccessful, the authors should consider weaken the related claims and de-emphasize the part of the work.</p><p>Relatedly, the reviewers think the manuscript's value lies more in benchmarking and validating state-of-art free energy calculation, than in providing significant new insight into the mechanism and function of T4L conformational transition. We would like to see revisions that de-emphasize the T4L specific claims and additional discussions with respect to benchmarking quantitative characterization of free energy landscapes using atomistic simulations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17505.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Appreciating the thoroughness and the technical sophistication of the computation work and its robust connections with experimental data, the reviewers recognize the manuscript's value in benchmarking state-of-art simulation techniques and especially, in benchmarking conformational free energy calculations.</italic> </p><p><italic>One of the more interesting parts of the of this study concerns the calculation of kinetic rate of the transition for L99A and the results is very encouraging.

As discussed in more detail below, we agree that the benchmarking aspects of our work are important. We have therefore extended our work and performed additional simulations and analyses. In particular, we have calculated the kinetics of exchange of the L99A/G113A/R119P triple mutant. As in the case of the L99A variant, we found results that were in good agreement with experiment. Specifically, the rates of exchange are within a factor of 10 from the experimental rates, and the free energy difference estimated from the rates (-1.2 kcal/mol) is very similar to the value (-1.6 kcal/mol) obtained from the equilibrium sampling. These results are presented in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers we have also performed extensive simulations of the L99A/G113A double mutant. At the end of a 1 microsecond long PathMetaD simulation, the free energy difference obtained is ~ -0.5 kcal/mol, in apparently good agreement with experiment (0.3 kcal/mol). In contrast to the results from L99A and the triple mutant we, however, find that this value appears not to be converged with substantial fluctuations and a (non-converged) free energy landscape that differs in shape from that of L99A and L99A/G113A/R119P. Thus, the calculated free energy difference is (in contrast to L99A and the triple mutant) more sensitive to how the major and minor states are separated. Thus, the good agreement that we observe could very well be fortuitous, and we have therefore opted not to include them in the revised manuscript. Instead we mention that we have performed these simulations, but that they did not converge.</p><p><italic>The manuscript's attempt to elucidate the mechanism of ligand entrance is relatively weak. Further studies, for example, using simulations with ligand placed at the putative entrance to the channel in a partially open conformation would strengthen this part of the manuscript. If unsuccessful, the authors should consider weaken the related claims and de-emphasize the part of the work.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the link between the transiently opened tunnel and the pathway for ligand binding and release was weak (as indeed we stated). While we believe that a more quantitative study lies outside the scope of this work, we have now performed and include the results from a set of simulations aimed to demonstrate a more direct link between the tunnel observed in the apo protein and the pathway for ligand (un)binding. In particular, we have used so-called adiabatic biased molecular dynamics (ABMD) to study the mechanism by which the ligand escapes its internal binding site. In these simulations, a bias is introduced for the ligand to leave its binding site, but leaving the specific pathway to be determined by the molecular simulations. Of the 20 ligand unbinding events we observed in such simulations, 15 take a path located in the same region as the transiently opened tunnel we found in the apo protein. To examine the extent to which this result depends on the amount of bias used, we performed these simulations with two different strengths of the biasing force, and reassuringly found the same results in both cases (i.e. 15/20 in both cases). These new results are included in the manuscript. We now also explicitly show the tunnel induced by binding of an alkyl-benzene to the protein.</p><p><italic>Relatedly, the reviewers think the manuscript's value lies more in benchmarking and validating state-of-art free energy calculation, than in providing significant new insight into the mechanism and function of T4L conformational transition. We would like to see revisions that de-emphasize the T4L specific claims and additional discussions with respect to benchmarking quantitative characterization of free energy landscapes using atomistic simulations.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a key result of our work lies in the testing and benchmarking of the ability of molecular simulations to map conformational free energy landscapes and determine the free energy and kinetics associated with conformational exchange. Prompted by the suggestion of the reviewers we have thus strengthened these aspects in several parts of the manuscript. This also includes the newly described kinetics for the triple mutant, as well as the fact that for both L99A and the triple mutant we find good agreement between the kinetic and equilibrium estimate of the free energy difference. In addition, we have toned down some of the more specific points that mostly relate to T4L. For example, we have now completely removed the section and results describing our studies of domain-domain motions in the minor state of L99A T4L. We have also shortened somewhat the description of the results relating to the mechanism of conformational exchange, and finally we have reorganized the sections to bring together the validation parts more coherently. We believe that these changes together make the focus of the paper stronger.</p></body></sub-article></article>
