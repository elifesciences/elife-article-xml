and metabolite transport. Its loss is a cardinal feature of aging and mitochondrial diseases, and cells closely monitor membrane potential as an indicator of mitochondrial health. Given its central importance, it is logical that cells would modulate mitochondrial membrane potential in response to demand and environmental cues, but there has been little exploration of this question. We report that loss of the Sit4 protein phosphatase in yeast increases mitochondrial membrane potential, both by inducing the electron transport chain and the phosphate starvation response. Indeed, a similarly elevated mitochondrial membrane potential is also elicited simply by phosphate starvation or by abrogation of the Pho85-dependent phosphate sensing pathway. This enhanced membrane potential is primarily driven by an unexpected activity of the ADP/ATP carrier. We also demonstrate that this connection between phosphate limitation and enhancement of mitochondrial membrane potential is observed in primary and immortalized mammalian cells as well as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These data suggest that mitochondrial membrane potential is subject to environmental stimuli and intracellular signaling regulation and raise the possibility for therapeutic enhancement of mitochondrial function even in defective mitochondria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial membrane

processes, including ATP production, redox control, biosynthetic programs, and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chandel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pagliarini and Rutter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Spinelli and Haigis, 2018</xref>). Each function—critical for cell homeostasis—relies on the ability of mitochondria to maintain a membrane potential across the inner membrane of this double-membrane organelle. This mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨm) directly provides the energy to power ATP synthesis, mitochondrial protein import, and metabolite and ion transport. Either directly or indirectly, it also provides signaling mechanisms to assist in adapting cellular behavior that can be critical to cell health.</p><p>Therefore, it is not surprising that impaired MMP is highly correlated with cellular dysfunction in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hagen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Leprat et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mansell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sastre et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sugrue and Tatton, 2001</xref>) and a variety of diseases, including primary mitochondrial disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Burelle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">James et al., 1996</xref>) and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cluntun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sharov et al., 2005</xref>). While it is likely that MMP reduction plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of these diseases, the tools to formally test its impact on each disease are limited. In the context of aging, activating an artificial proton pump in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> restores the loss of MMP typical of aging and is sufficient to extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berry et al., 2022</xref>), which suggests causality in this case. In addition, using the same manipulation to ectopically increase MMP improves the survival of <italic>C. elegans</italic> treated with electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berry et al., 2020</xref>). These data raise the possibility that low MMP might cause pathology in the context of aging, and perhaps other diseases, and that strategies to restore membrane potential in cells might therefore be therapeutically transformative.</p><p>The canonical mechanism to generate MMP is by complexes I, III, and IV of the ETC, which pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space (IMS). This intricate process extracts high-energy electrons and passes them through the ETC complexes while using the resultant energy to pump protons from the matrix to IMS. The energy of these protons passing back to the matrix is then used to power ATP synthase, metabolite carriers, and protein translocases. However, several studies have described an alternative mechanism for the generation of MMP, namely ATP synthase running in reverse—hydrolyzing ATP to ADP and using the energy to pump protons to the IMS and augment the MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Junge and Nelson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Okuno et al., 2011</xref>). For example, Vasan et al. reported that the MMP is maintained in complex III-deficient cells through this ATP synthase mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vasan et al., 2022</xref>). Despite this long-standing hypothesis, there is conflicting data that argues against this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vowinckel et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, observations for alternative MMP generation mechanism via ATP hydrolysis illustrate that cells will sacrifice hard-earned ATP to sustain their membrane potential, underlining the essentiality of MMP for cell well-being and insinuating the existence of control mechanisms to maintain MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martínez-Reyes et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>MMP is required for viability and proliferation in most eukaryotic cells, but the strength of the MMP is highly variable between cells of different tissue origins and is dynamic across biological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mitra et al., 2009</xref>). For example, relative to normal cells, cancer cells tend to have a higher MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Davis et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heerdt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Summerhayes et al., 1982</xref>) as do cells experiencing amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). Generally, nutrient and other biological stress scenarios also modulate MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hübscher et al., 2016</xref>, p. 70; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pan et al., 2011</xref>); in particular, oxidative stress has been shown to decrease MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Korshunov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Satoh et al., 1997</xref>). This heterogeneity in MMP amongst cell types and contexts led us to hypothesize that each cell might have an MMP setpoint that is tuned to the energetic and biosynthetic demands of the cell, and is perhaps responsive to nutrients and stressors in the environment. While there are well-appreciated negative consequences when MMP is too low, inappropriately elevated MMP can lead to toxic metabolic byproducts, such as reactive oxygen species. We only have sparse knowledge of whether cells actually have an MMP setpoint. If they do, how is it determined? What are the stimuli that are monitored to determine the setpoint? What are the signaling molecules that communicate this information? How is the machinery of mitochondrial bioenergetics altered to enact the setpoint and maintain this optimal MMP? Answering these questions will provide a much clearer understanding of the connection between cell physiology, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and human disease.</p><p>We became interested in MMP and its regulation through our previous studies of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) system. We and others showed that loss of this pathway results in the absence of the lipoic acid cofactor as well as loss of acylated acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is required for the assembly and activation of many mitochondrial complexes, including each ETC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angerer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brody et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nowinski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>). Using a genetic screen in yeast to identify genes required for the transcriptional alterations induced in mtFAS mutants, we found that the deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> induces high MMP even in the absence of the ETC and ATP synthase. Building on this information, we identified genetic and environmental manipulations that increase MMP via ETC-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including a non-canonical role for the ADP/ATP carrier. These results support the hypothesis that cells leverage available machineries to establish an MMP setpoint that is responsive to internal and external cues. We also identified signaling pathways and molecules that regulate this MMP setpoint. This study describes machinery involved in the modulation of MMP and provides effective tools to better understand the interplay between MMP and cellular health.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>SIT4</italic> deletion hyperpolarizes mitochondria</title><p>To understand the transcriptional reprogramming that occurs during the loss of mtFAS, and by extension, the interplay between dysfunctional mitochondrial and cell health, we reanalyzed an RNA-sequencing dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berg et al., 2023</xref>) generated from a yeast mutant lacking mtFAS function (<italic>mct1</italic>Δ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schneider et al., 1997</xref>) before and after transitioning from glucose- to raffinose-containing medium—a manipulation that induces mitochondrial biogenesis.

Instead, the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ mutant increased mRNA abundance of genes encoding proteins primarily related to mechanisms for acetyl-CoA production—a gene response signature that was not exhibited in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data clearly indicate robust signaling from dysfunctional mitochondria to the nucleus, either to compensate or minimize the damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Epstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Garipler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>). To better understand these mitochondria-to-nucleus transcriptional responses, we designed a genetic screen to identify the genes required for the transcriptional aberrations observed in <italic>mct1</italic>Δ cells. We selected one of the most upregulated genes (<italic>CIT2</italic>) to act as a reporter, and a gene with unchanged expression (<italic>BTT1</italic>) to act as a control. We integrated Firefly luciferase at the <italic>CIT2</italic> locus, Renilla luciferase at the <italic>BTT1</italic> locus, and the full-length <italic>CIT2</italic> and <italic>BTT1</italic> genes at the <italic>HO</italic> locus in the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Preliminary hits were reanalyzed using the dual luciferase experiment in a low-throughput manner wherein we could control the optical density of the culture. We identified 73 mutants (displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) with a confirmed reduced ratio of expression from the native <italic>CIT2</italic> and <italic>BTT1</italic> promoters (i.e., reduced Firefly luciferase:Renilla luciferase ratio), suggesting an impaired <italic>mct1</italic>Δ mitochondrial dysfunction transcriptional signature.</p><p>We validated all 73 mutants by performing RT-qPCR on four additional genes that were upregulated in <italic>mct1</italic>Δ cells, <italic>DLD3</italic>, <italic>ADH2</italic>, <italic>CAT2,</italic> and <italic>YAT1</italic>, and which we thus use as reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Some mutants still induced the expression of these genes, and others showed an absence of induction in only a subset of the four target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Of the mutants that reduced the abundance of all four transcripts, we focused on <italic>SIT4</italic> for two reasons. First, a <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant generated in our laboratory, as verification of this screening result, also displayed impaired induction of <italic>CIT2</italic>, <italic>DLD3</italic>, <italic>ADH2</italic>, and <italic>CAT2</italic> in response to <italic>MCT1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> not only attenuated induction of these four genes, but also induced the expression of several genes encoding ETC subunits, including <italic>QCR2</italic> and <italic>RIP1</italic>, that were repressed in the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> alone—without a concomitant loss of <italic>MCT1</italic>—alters the abundance of these mRNAs tested, indicating that this transcriptional effect of <italic>SIT4</italic> deletion is independent of the underlying mitochondrial defects.

First, we measured the MMP in <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells with or without deletion of <italic>MCT1</italic> using the membrane potential-dependent fluorescent dye, MitoTracker Red, which, when used at the appropriate concentration, accumulates in mitochondria in an MMP-dependent manner, such that the staining positively correlates with MMP. We used both microscopic imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) as complementary methods to visualize and quantify MMP. With microscopic imaging, we were able to restrict the quantification of MitoTracker Red signal to that which co-localizes with mitochondria as marked by Tom70-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that cells lacking <italic>SIT4</italic> alone exhibited very high MMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The increased MMP observed in <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutants was also maintained in <italic>mct1</italic>Δ <italic>sit4</italic>Δ double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This was surprising given that <italic>mct1</italic>Δ cells lack assembly of the ETC, the major producer of MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>mct1</italic>Δ <italic>sit4</italic>Δ double mutant also exhibited a modest increase in mitochondrial area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and changes in mitochondrial morphology. Therefore, we analyzed the localization pattern of Tom70-GFP and categorized the mitochondrial morphology of each cell as reticular, aggregated/fragmented, or mixed. We found that <italic>mct1</italic>Δ cells exhibited a more fragmented mitochondrial morphology, consistent with previous observations in other respiratory-deficient strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> resulted in more reticular and less fragmented or aggregated mitochondria, both in the presence or absence of the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>The import of many mitochondrial proteins from the cytosol depends upon and thus serves as a proxy for MMP. We used a yeast strain expressing a C-terminally FLAG-tagged Ilv2 at its endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dasari and Kölling, 2011</xref>). Upon import into mitochondria, the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of Ilv2-FLAG is cleaved, thereby allowing us to distinguish between imported and unimported species and providing a quantitative measurement of Ilv2-FLAG import as assessed by immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates. In wild-type cells, the majority of Ilv2-FLAG is present as a lower molecular weight form with the MTS cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>); however, a portion of the Ilv2-FLAG protein is visible as a higher molecular weight form, suggesting it has not been cleaved and thus imported into mitochondria. Depletion of the MMP either by treatment for 6 hr with the ionophore CCCP or by deletion of <italic>MCT1</italic> reduced Ilv2-FLAG import and led to accumulation of the uncleaved protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). In contrast, deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> caused a complete loss of uncleaved Ilv2-FLAG, whether or not <italic>MCT1</italic> was also deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). We interpret these data as suggesting that Ilv2-FLAG is more efficiently imported into mitochondria in the absence of <italic>SIT4</italic>. However, another explanation for the disappearance of the band corresponding to the unimported Ilv2-FLAG is more efficient protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shakya et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we sought to more closely examine the relationship between MMP and accumulation of uncleaved Ilv2-FLAG. We used various doses of the protonophore CCCP to dose-dependently reduce the MMP. We found that <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells treated with 75 μM CCCP have an MMP that is comparable to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). These cells exhibited a similar level of unimported Ilv2-FLAG as wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>). We therefore concluded that it is most likely that the decrease of uncleaved Ilv2-FLAG that we observed in our assays is reflective of increased mitochondrial import and increased MMP. These data demonstrate that loss of <italic>SIT4</italic> results in a mitochondrial phenotype suggestive of an enhanced energetic state: higher MMP, hyper-tubulated morphology, and more effective protein import.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>SIT4</italic> deletion increases electron transport chain complex abundance</title><p>Because the changes in mitochondrial function observed in the <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant occur even in the mtFAS mutant background, which on its own creates a profound defect in mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly and energetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>), we next asked how the deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> increases MMP. RNA sequencing revealed that the <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant exhibited elevated expression of most of the genes encoding subunits of the ETC and ATP synthase, which could potentially promote ETC complex formation and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To directly assess the abundance of each ETC complex and supercomplexes, we performed blue-native PAGE (BN-PAGE) analysis on mitochondria isolated from wild-type, <italic>mct1</italic>Δ, <italic>sit4</italic>Δ, and <italic>mct1</italic>Δ <italic>sit4</italic>Δ strains. This enables assessment of the assembly status of respiratory complex II, III, and IV, as well as the ATP synthase. Complex I is not included in our analysis due to its yeast homolog lacking the ability of proton pumping. As previously reported, mitochondria from <italic>mct1</italic>Δ mutant showed a complete loss of all the ETC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Strikingly, deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> also completely reversed the absence of and further enriched the abundance of ETC and ATP synthase complexes in <italic>mct1</italic>Δ cells. One potential explanation for this could be the restoration of mtFAS function in the <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant; however, <italic>mct1</italic>Δ <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells still lacked acylated ACP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and lipoic acid as measured by lipoylation of Lat1 and Kgd2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that mtFAS remains inactive upon deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic>.

We therefore asked whether the increase of MMP and ETC complex assembly could be the result of impaired glucose repression. Normally, yeast cells activate a glucose repression program when grown in media with abundant glucose as a way of optimizing nutrient utilization. During this mode of growth, cells repress mitochondrial biogenesis and rely on glycolysis to provide the ATP required for rapid proliferation. We measured the MMP of wild-type and <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells grown in glucose medium or in raffinose medium, which causes a loss of glucose repression. As expected from the increased expression of ETC genes, wild-type cells grown in raffinose-containing media had a higher MMP than glucose-grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant increased MMP to a similar degree in either growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This result indicates that the increased MMP caused by <italic>SIT4</italic> deletion cannot be explained by glucose de-repression.</p><p>The presence of assembled ETC complexes in <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutants raises the possibility that they are functional and contributing to MMP via proton pumping. To address this question, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in all four yeast strains. As expected, the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ mutant exhibited a profound decrease in OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells exhibited an elevated OCR consistent with their increased abundance of ETC complexes. The <italic>mct1</italic>Δ <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells showed an OCR that was increased relative to the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ single mutant, but still significantly lower than the wild-type OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, we concluded that these ETC complexes are at least partially functional but are not sufficient to rescue the oxygen consumption defects found in the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ mutant. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arndt et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dimmer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jablonka et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells failed to grow on media containing a non-fermentable carbon source such as glycerol that requires mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This defect was rescued by re-expression of <italic>SIT4</italic> on a plasmid, confirming that <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells do not have an irreversible loss of mtDNA as would be observed in a <italic>rho</italic><sup>0</sup> stain. As expected, the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ <italic>sit4</italic>Δ double mutant also failed to grow under respiratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In conclusion, deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> promotes the assembly of partially functional ETC complexes, but this is insufficient to rescue the respiratory defects of the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ mutant. Moreover, the observed modest increase in oxygen consumption is insufficient to explain the profound increase in MMP observed in the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ <italic>sit4</italic>Δ double mutant relative to the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ single mutant.</p><p>The yeast Hap complex has been shown to transcriptionally induce the expression of OXPHOS components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bonander et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mao and Chen, 2019</xref>). We assessed whether increased expression of OXPHOS components by the Hap complex might be sufficient to increase MMP similar to what we observed in <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells. Overexpression of <italic>HAP4</italic>, the catalytic component of the HAP complex, was sufficient to increase the abundance of each OXPHOS complex as assessed by BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, <italic>HAP4</italic> overexpression failed to rescue the loss of any of the OXPHOS complexes observed in the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Loss of <italic>HAP4</italic> suppressed, but did not eliminate, the increased MMP observed in <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells partially require the Hap complex to generate higher MMP, but overexpressing <italic>HAP4</italic> is insufficient to increase MMP.</p><p>As a result of the OXPHOS complex abundance and activity data, we asked whether the enhanced MMP in <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutants was dependent upon ETC proton pumping. We deleted subunits that are necessary for complex III (<italic>QCR2</italic>) and IV (<italic>COX4</italic>) assembly and function in both wild-type and <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant strains. Whether or not complex III or IV was inactivated, deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> was sufficient to increase MMP, albeit not to the same extent as in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As mentioned previously, in the absence of a functional ETC, the mitochondrial ATP synthase has been shown to reverse direction and use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane and generate a membrane potential. We treated wild-type cells and the <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant with oligomycin, an inhibitor of the F<sub>o</sub> portion of the ATP synthase, to examine the directionality of the ATP synthase activity. Inhibiting the ATP synthase led to an increase of MMP in both wild-type and <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>), suggesting that ATP synthase operates in the direction of MMP consumption and ATP generation in <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells.</p><p>To orthogonally test whether the <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant can use mechanisms independent of ETC and ATP synthase, we obtained <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells that completely lack mtDNA and therefore have no functional ETC or ATP synthase. In spite of repeated efforts and success generating <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells in wild-type or other mutant backgrounds, we were unable to generate <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells in a <italic>sit4</italic>Δ strain. Therefore, we genetically eliminated the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, <italic>RPO41</italic>, which is required to transcribe all mtDNA-encoded transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Greenleaf et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang and Shadel, 1999</xref>). As a result, the <italic>rpo41</italic>Δ mutant lacks the proton-pumping ETC complexes III and IV as well as the protein-transducing F<sub>o</sub> component of the ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). As expected, the MMP of the <italic>rpo41</italic>Δ mutant is very low, even significantly lower than that of <italic>mct1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> in the <italic>rpo41</italic>Δ mutant background restored the MMP to a level similar to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Intriguingly, complex II, which does not contain any mtDNA-encoded subunits, accumulated more assembled complex upon <italic>SIT4</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). These results demonstrated that although ETC activity is required for the majority of the enhanced MMP observed in <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells, <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutants clearly leverage additional ETC- and ATP synthase-independent mechanisms to increase mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant exhibits a phosphate starvation response</title><p>To discover the mechanisms through which the <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutants generate MMP independent of the ETC or ATP synthase, we performed phosphoproteomics, as Sit4 is a protein phosphatase.

All organisms acquire phosphate from the environment to build nucleic acids, phospholipids, and phosphorylated sugars and proteins. The synthetic media commonly used for growing yeast contains 7.5 mM inorganic phosphate. We depleted phosphate by growing yeast cells in media with close-to-normal phosphate levels (10 mM) or a series of lower phosphate concentrations (100, 50, 10, or 1 μM) and then measured the MMP using flow cytometry. It is important to note that all media were buffered at the same pH (pH 4.1). Over an 8 hr time course, we observed an increase in the MMP of wild-type cells grown in low phosphate concentrations (50, 10, or 1 μM), but not in cells grown in either 100 μM or 10 mM phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Having found that <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells exhibited increased MMP even in the absence of the ETC and the F<sub>o</sub> subunit of ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we performed a similar phosphate depletion experiment in <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells, which lack all components of these two proton-pumping systems. Indeed, <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells exhibited elevated MMP in response to phosphate depletion (1 μM Pi), although the response was delayed compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We also confirmed this observation using fluorescence microscopy to capture the MMP and mitochondrial morphology after depleting phosphate in the media for 4 hr in wild-type cells and overnight in <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The quantification of the MitoTracker Red signal co-localized within Tom70-GFP agreed with the measurement of MMP using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). At the same time, no significant change in mitochondrial area was observed by depleting phosphate from the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, the quantification of mitochondrial morphology suggested that phosphate deprivation does not induce massive changes in mitochondrial morphology in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, the fragmented and aggregated mitochondria in <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells was partially rescued by phosphate depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Because electron transfer through complexes III and IV is tightly coupled to one another and with proton pumping, the complex III inhibitor antimycin A (AA) is sufficient to block the activities of both complexes. Most of the membrane potential was lost in cells treated with antimycin A in either normal or low phosphate-containing media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>); however, even in the presence of antimycin A, low phosphate still triggered a similarly fold elevation in membrane potential. Together with the BN-PAGE results, we concluded that ETC complexes are slightly enriched with phosphate depletion, but this is not required for the increase in MMP.</p><p>Bongkrekic acid is an inhibitor of the ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lauquin and Vignais, 1976</xref>), which resides on the mitochondrial inner membrane and normally imports ADP and exports ATP to sustain mitochondrial ATP synthesis and cytosolic ATP consumption. Treatment of wild-type cells with bongkrekic acid significantly dampened the phosphate depletion-mediated increase in MMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, combination treatment with both antimycin A and bongkrekic acid completely blocked the induction of MMP in response to low phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As a genetic alternative to antimycin A inhibition of the ETC, we grew <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells, which have no complex III and IV nor a complete ATP synthase, in low and high phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As shown before, phosphate depletion triggers an enhanced MMP in <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells, but this is completely eliminated by bongkrekic acid in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>These experiments suggest a mechanism whereby the depletion of phosphate increases MMP in an ETC- and ATP synthase-independent manner. When the ADP/ATP carrier imports ATP<sup>4-</sup> and exports ADP<sup>3-</sup>, a net export of a positive charge occurs out of the matrix to the IMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This activity must be coupled to ATP hydrolysis within the mitochondrial matrix. It would also be coupled to the export of phosphate from the matrix, which is co-transported with a proton through the phosphate carrier. Our data suggest that when cells lack the proton-pumping ability of the ETC—either by chemical treatment (i.e., antimycin A) or genetic inhibition (mtDNA loss in <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells)—and particularly during phosphate depletion, they instead rely on the ADP/ATP carrier to increase MMP to sustain critical mitochondrial functions. We refer to this alternative mechanism to generate MMP as the mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Phosphate starvation signaling induces mitochondrial membrane potential</title><p>The phosphate signaling system in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kaffman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mouillon and Persson, 2006</xref>) employs the cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase, Pho80 and Pho85, respectively.

In the context of the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ mutant strain, however, deletion of <italic>PHO85</italic> had no effect on the complete loss of ETC complexes. We reasoned that this lack of rescue was different from <italic>SIT4</italic> deletion because <italic>pho85</italic>Δ cells exhibit no increase in the abundance of mRNAs encoding ETC and ATP synthase subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>, compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> for <italic>sit4</italic>Δ, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

In particular, <italic>mct1</italic>Δ <italic>pho85</italic>Δ cells exhibit a much higher MMP compared to the <italic>mct1</italic>Δ mutant, and this appears to largely be mediated by ETC- and ATP synthase-independent mechanisms.</p><p>We demonstrated that phosphate depletion utilizes mainly the mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis pathway, via the exchange of differentially charged nucleotides, to generate MMP. Similar models have been proposed previously, and it was suggested that the F<sub>1</sub> subunit of the ATP synthase (Atp1 and Atp2) catalyzes the ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">ATP synthase of yeast mitochondria—GIRAUD - 1994, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lefebvre-Legendre et al., 2003</xref>).

This line of inquiry led to a series of observations that demonstrated a previously unappreciated role of environmental sensing and cellular signaling in controlling MMP (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As a result, we propose a putative model that, based on energetic demand, environmental status, and intracellular signaling, cells establish and maintain a MMP ‘setpoint’, which is tailored to maintain optimal mitochondrial function. We find that cells deploy multiple ETC-dependent and -independent strategies to maintain that setpoint. Critically, we find that cells often prioritize this MMP setpoint over other bioenergetic priorities, even in challenging environments, suggesting an important evolutionary benefit.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of observations in <italic>sit4</italic>Δ cells or cells depleted with phosphate.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Measurement</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Background</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="2">Perturbation</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>sit4</italic>Δ</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Phosphate depletion</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="3">MMP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>mct1</italic>Δ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Higher than <italic>mct1</italic>Δ cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rpo41</italic>Δ or <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Higher than <italic>rpo41</italic>Δ cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Higher than <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Mitochondrial protein import efficiency</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">More efficient</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">More efficient</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>mct1</italic>Δ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">More efficient</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">More efficient than <italic>mct1</italic>Δ cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">ETC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Enriched</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Unchanged</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>mct1</italic>Δ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">More enriched than <italic>mct1</italic>Δ cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Complex III, IV: remain absent<break/>Complex II:<break/>More enriched</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We first made the observation that deletion of the <italic>SIT4</italic> gene, which encodes the yeast homologue of the mammalian PP6 protein phosphatase, reversed many of the defects caused by loss of mtFAS, including gene expression programs, ETC complex assembly, mitochondrial morphology, and especially MMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Garipler et al., 2014</xref>) reported that the deletion of <italic>SIT4</italic> increased MMP in <italic>rho</italic><sup>-</sup> cells, although the mechanism underlying the phenomenon was not defined. We show herein that increased MMP in a <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant is independent of mtDNA damage and occurs in an otherwise wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The mechanism whereby <italic>SIT4</italic> deletion elicits these mitochondrial effects seems to involve the induction of two gene expression programs: mitochondrial ETC biogenesis and the phosphate starvation response. Through these effects, and perhaps other mechanisms, the <italic>sit4</italic>Δ mutant rescues the ETC assembly failure caused by loss of mtFAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Indeed, the ETC complex abundance and MMP of an <italic>mct1</italic>Δ <italic>sit4</italic>Δ double mutant is substantially enhanced relative to a wild-type strain. This has important implications for our understanding of how mtFAS supports, but is not essential for, ETC assembly.</p><p>The transcriptional and phosphoproteomic effects of <italic>SIT4</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) led us to the observation that phosphate deprivation, or the perception of phosphate starvation by elimination of the Pho85-dependent phosphate sensing system, was sufficient to increase MMP. Unlike phosphate starvation, the <italic>pho85</italic>Δ mutant has elevated intracellular phosphate concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that the phosphate effect on MMP is likely to be elicited by cellular signaling downstream of phosphate sensing rather than some direct effect of environmental depletion of phosphate on mitochondrial energetics. However, the mechanistic details underlying the induction of phosphate starvation signaling by <italic>SIT4</italic> deletion remain unanswered.</p><p>One of the more surprising findings from this work is that the phosphate starvation response increases MMP independently of either of the two well-established MMP generation mechanisms, proton pumping by the ETC or ATP hydrolysis-dependent proton pumping by the ATP synthase. Phosphate starvation or the deletion of <italic>PHO85</italic> has minimal effects on the assembly of the respiratory complexes and does not restore detectable complexes to an <italic>mct1</italic>Δ strain, but still increases MMP. Phosphate deprivation even increases MMP in a mutant lacking the entire mitochondrial genome, and hence has no assembled ETC complex III or IV and no ATP synthase. Instead, our data suggest that the ADP/ATP carrier and the mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis pathway are utilized to increase MMP in response to phosphate starvation signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). The import of ATP<sup>4-</sup> produced by glycolysis, hydrolysis to ADP<sup>3-</sup> and inorganic phosphate, and export of ADP<sup>3-</sup> through the AAC, is an electrogenic process that is sufficient to sustain or enhance the MMP. Meanwhile, the inorganic phosphate released during ATP hydrolysis is exported with a proton through the phosphate carrier, which is an electroneutral process but contributes to the proton gradient. It was reported previously that <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells rely on the reverse transport of ATP and ADP through the ADP/ATP carrier in conjunction with ATP hydrolysis in the mitochondrial matrix to generate a minimal MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angerer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buchet and Godinot, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen and Clark-Walker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dupont et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kovácová et al., 1968</xref>). We now show that intracellular signaling triggers a process that can lead to an increased MMP even beyond the wild-type level in the absence of the mitochondrial genome.</p><p>The elevated MMP setpoint has significant functional consequences, as demonstrated by the partially mitochondrial Ilv2-FLAG protein becoming completely imported and cleaved upon loss of Sit4 or phosphate depletion. It is likely that many other proteins either gain or enhance their mitochondrial matrix localization and activity as well. It has been previously described that reduction in MMP can alter the import properties of proteins and thereby trigger cellular signaling events related to mitophagy, transcriptional responses, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2012</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berry et al., 2021</xref>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Miceli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rolland et al., 2019</xref>). The scope of responses elicited in cells experiencing high MMP, however, has not been previously interrogated to the same extent as cells with reduced MMP.</p><p>What is the evolutionary advantage of the mitochondrial ATP hydrolysis pathway, which uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to increase the MMP? We propose a speculative hypothesis that this mechanism enables the liberation of needed phosphate from the most abundant labile store of phosphate, ATP. However, cleaving the phosphodiester bonds of ATP releases energy in addition to releasing phosphate. Using this mitochondrial mechanism enables the cell to capture that energy in the form of the MMP rather than having it be simply lost as heat. As a result, the elevated MMP is able to fuel mitochondrial processes and empowers the cell to better combat nutrient scarcity. This phenomenon also appears to be evolutionarily conserved as cellular phosphate depletion also increases MMP in primary and immortalized human cells and in cells of the fly midgut in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Our results across the eukaryotic kingdom indicate that the higher MMP induced by phosphate deprivation contributes to improved mitochondrial energetics, morphology, and overall robustness, which could have profound implications for the many diseases, as well as the aging process itself, that are characterized by reduced MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hagen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Leprat et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mansell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sastre et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sugrue and Tatton, 2001</xref>).

In both the fly and mouse, it was also conversely demonstrated that excessive phosphate shortens lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bergwitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kuro-o et al., 1997</xref>). In these studies, the exact mechanisms whereby phosphate abundance and sensing affect lifespan were not established. We observed increased MMP in flies treated with PFA, which limits phosphate uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Other measurements showed improvement in gut integrity and negative geotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). From the evidence presented herein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as well as the previous study showing that PFA treatment extends lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bergwitz et al., 2013</xref>) and enhances intestinal health in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Xu et al., 2023</xref>), we hypothesize that phosphate deprivation increased MMP and overall mitochondrial health, and thereby enabled lifespan extension. This connection is supported by a recent study that demonstrated that boosting MMP by photo-activation of an ectopically expressed proton pump is sufficient to prolong lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berry et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>This work identified genetic and environmental interventions that appear to elevate the setpoint of MMP. This improves mitochondrial protein import efficiency, results in more connected mitochondrial morphology, and reverses other deficiencies found in mutants that have low MMP. This work thus proposes that MMP can be modulated through cellular signaling, including augmentation of MMP above that typically observed in a wild-type cell. It also demonstrates that this MMP augmentation can occur in the absence of a functional respiratory chain. As a result, these observations lay the foundation for future studies to identify interventions that can impact the signaling mechanisms that control MMP for therapeutic benefit.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> BY4743 (MATa/a, his3/his3, leu2/leu2, ura3/ura3, met15/MET15, lys2/LYS2) was used as a parental strain to generate all knockout strains.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Benoît Kornmann as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Johannes M Herrmann (Reviewer #1); Jean-Paul di Rago (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. There are a number of issues that are necessary to improve this interesting study with the most important ones specified below and in the individual comment section of the reviewers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study shows only data on glucose. Thus the role of carbon sources, and the HAP complex, needs to be considered.</p><p>2) A method, independent from mitotracker, should be included to measure membrane potential.</p><p>3) The role of amino acid metabolism should be clarified due to its central relevance for this study.</p><p>4) The authors should discuss the early literature on the petite negativity and the phosphate cycle.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Page 7: ‚as do cell experiencing amino acid starvation' should read 'as do cells experiencing amino acid starvation'.</p><p>2. Figure 1G shows the quantification of Ilv2 precursors relative to Pgk1. It would be better to compare the signal of the precursor to that of the mature Ilv2-FLAG protein. The result would be presumably similar but since the overall Ilv2 levels might vary, a comparison of the precursor vs. total Ilv2 seems more appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) page 15: &quot;Whether or not complex III or IV was inactivated, deletion of SIT4 was sufficient to increase MMP (Figure 2D) &quot;.</p><p>This statement is partially incorrect. Indeed, in the absence of QCR2 or Cox2, about 80% of the MPP increase induced by the loss of Sit4p is lost (Figure 2D).</p><p>2) Page 16: &quot;These results demonstrated that although ETC activity is required for the majority of the enhanced membrane potential observed in sit4D cells, sit4D mutants clearly leverage additional ETC- and ATP synthase-independent mechanisms to increase mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 2F)&quot;.</p><p>This conclusion is premature (and possibly not valid) because cells lacking functional mtDNA need the F1 component of ATP synthase to maintain a sufficient MMP (in combination with Aac2) and hence viability.</p><p>3) page 16: &quot;Among the most enriched phosphoproteins, Pho84, Vtc3, and Spl2, are all involved in the regulation of intracellular phosphate levels (Figure 3A, Supplementary File 3).&quot;</p><p>What about Mir1, the protein responsible for the import of phosphate into the mitochondrial matrix?</p><p>4) page 18: &quot;However, depleting phosphate in rho0 cells failed to rescue the absence of the complexes&quot;.</p><p>This comment looks a bit ridiculous (the petite mutation is irreversible and without mtDNA Complexes III, IV and V cannot be synthesized at all).</p><p>5) Page 19: &quot;Importantly, combined treatment with both antimycin A and bongkrekic acid completely blocked the induction of MMP in response to low phosphate (Figure 4B). As a genetic alternative to antimycin A inhibition of the ETC, we grew rho0 cells, which have no complex III and IV nor complete ATP synthase, in low and high phosphate (Figure 4C). As shown before, phosphate depletion triggers an enhanced MMP in rho0 cells, but this is completely eliminated by bongkrekic acid in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C).&quot;</p><p>The authors have missed several previously published studies where the effects of these inhibitors on the MMP have been described. Would they want to keep these data, the authors should indicate that this was already observed previously and quote the corresponding papers.</p><p>6). Page 19: &quot;These experiments suggest a mechanism whereby the depletion of phosphate increases MMP in an ETC- and ATP synthase-independent manner&quot;.</p><p>As above (point 2), the authors should consider the possible involvement of F1 in the modulation of MMP by phosphate availability.</p><p>7) Page 20: &quot;When the ADP/ATP carrier imports ATP4- and exports ADP3-, a net export of a positive charge occurs out of the matrix to the inter-membrane space (Figure 4D). This activity must be coupled to ATP hydrolysis within the mitochondrial matrix by an as yet unidentified ATPase.</p><p>True but this ATPase has been identified (Giraud and Velours, EJB 1994, Lefebvre-Legendre et al., Mol. Microbiol. 2003): it is the F1 component of ATP synthase.</p><p>8). Page 20: &quot;Our data suggest that when cells lack the proton pumping ability of the ETC--either by chemical (treatment with antimycin A) or genetic (loss of mtDNA in rho0 cells) inhibition--and particularly during phosphate depletion, they instead rely on the ADP/ATP carrier to increase MMP to sustain critical mitochondrial functions&quot;.</p><p>Again, this is known and has been described already (see point 7).</p><p>9) Page 26: &quot;It was reported previously that rho0 cells rely on the reverse transport of ATP and ADP through the ADP/ATP carrier in conjunction with ATP hydrolysis in the mitochondrial matrix to generate a minimal MMP (Appleby et al., 1999; Buchet and Godinot, 1998; X. J. Chen and Clark-Walker, 2000; Dupont et al., 1985; Kov.čov. et al., 1968).&quot;</p><p>The authors should add the two references showing that it is the F1.ATPAse that works in conjunction with Acc2 to maintain a sufficient MMP in cells that lack functional mtDNA or unable to respire (Giraud and Velours, EJB 1994, Lefebvre-Legendre et al., Mol. Microbiol. 2003).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The choice to focus on SIT4 after the screen has not fully been justified. If the authors have done a screen for gene expression of their 17 validated hits for expression of the ETC genes QCR2 and RIP1, then they ought to show that data for all the hits, rather than just SIT2. In their conclusion the authors mention that</p><p>&quot;A previous study (Garipler et al., 2014) reported that the deletion of SIT4 increased MMP in rho- cells&quot;.</p><p>If that is the case, perhaps this should be mentioned as part of the rationale for focusing on SIT4.</p><p>The authors state</p><p>&quot;Consistent with a previous report (Jablonka et al., 2006), sit4D cells failed to grow on media containing a non-fermentable carbon source such as glycerol that requires mitochondrial respiration (Figure S2C). This defect was rescued by re-expression of SIT4 on a plasmid, confirming that sit4D cells have functional mtDNA.&quot;</p><p>It is unclear to me how reexpression on a plasmid shows anything about whether or not the mtDNA are functional without Sit4p. Surely if Sit4p is expressed on a plasmid, growth in that strain can say nothing about whether mtDNA is functional without Sit4p. The strain with SIT4 expression from a plasmid in a sit4del background does not appear to be listed in the list of strains used in the study.</p><p>It is the case with any scientific inquiry that some questions will be answered and some new questions will arise. I would have appreciated the discussion more if some of these remaining unanswered questions were highlighted. In particular the link between SIT4 deletion and phosphate starvation signaling is still unresolved; SIT4 deletion rescues MMP and ilv2p import defects in an mct1D background while phosphate starvation does not. Linking this discussion to a schematic summarizing the study's findings related to phosphate starvation, SIT4 and the genes of the ETC (perhaps as a final panel in the last figure) might also be helpful.</p><p>Figure S1A:</p><p>The caption should indicate that this is a reanalysis of previously published data and reference the paper.</p><p>Figure S1A, the authors state that deletion of MCT1 deletion demonstrates induction of mRNAs encoding subunits of ETC and ATP Synthase. It is hard to assess these observations just by looking at the gene names. It is not clear how genes were selected for figure S1A. For instance, COB and QCR9 seem to be missing from the complex III genes and one of the cytochrome C isoforms, CYC7 is missing. It would be more convincing if the statement was quantified – a percentage of the genes related to the ETC and ATP synthase (e.g. from the go term, yeast pathway annotation, or a list from a reference) that meet some threshold of induction in WT cells but not in mct1Del cells. A similar point can be made for genes related to acetyl-CoA production in Figure S1B.</p><p>Also in both those figures, the legend was hard to read and the caption did not explain the experiment (i.e. that the culture was switched from glucose to raffinose at Time 0). For figure S1B the blue, red, and green text was not explained in the caption.</p><p>The validation S1D would have been more convincing if it had included RTQPCR with CIT2.</p><p>For Figure 1A – it seemed like expression of Yat2 in the independently generated Sit4 mutant was missing. I assume the authors were unable to collect the data for some technical reason, but one would expect a change in Yat 2 as well as it was one of the selection criteria.</p><p>For Figure 1C it would be useful to show the expression of CIT2 alongside BTT1 in the gene expression data to help introduce and illustrate the screen.</p><p>A supplementary figure with a scatterplot of the data from the dual luciferace screen indicating the ratio used as a cutoff to select hits would give more confidence in the data. Also it is not clear if replicates were done for the screen and what cutoffs were used to define reduced expression. I assume the authors mean reduced expression at some time point after switching from Glucose to Raffinose relative to the parental strain with the dual luciferase construct, but cannot be sure. In particular the caption of Figure 1D is confusing.</p><p>For Fig1D, the captions says that normalized mitochondrial membrane potential is plotted. It is not clear from the methods how the flow cytometry measurements were normalized. Were they normalized to WT in each experiment like the microscope, or to Side Scatter or Forward Scatter which is related to cell size and which is often correlated with intensity in flow cytometry.</p><p>The conditions under which mRNA abundance was measured for the sit4del and WT strain for Figure 2A (SC overnight) ought to be mentioned in the caption (and possibly in the text) especially as these conditions differ from the Raffinose conditions that the previous RNA-seq experiments were performed in.</p><p>On Page 14: &quot;As expected, the mct1D sit4D double mutant also failed to grow under respiratory conditions (Figure S2D).&quot;, refers to the wrong figure, it should refer to S2C.</p><p>For Figure 2C, the authors state &quot;'Moreover, the observed modest increase in oxygen consumption is insufficient to explain the profound increase in MMP observed in the mct1D sit4D double mutant.&quot;</p><p>This is confusing wording because there is not an increase in Oxygen Consumption relative to WT in the mct1del sit4del double mutant, but rather a decrease. I assume the authors mean increase with respect to the mct1del mutant.</p><p>In Figure S2F it would be helpful to label the F0 component of the ATP synthase if that is what disappears in the rpo41del strains. I was a bit confused because the antibody for Atp2p, part of the F1 component was shown.</p><p>Figure 2F is a bit hard to interpret because the authors suggest that the mitochondrial membrane potential is not increased by reversal of the ATP synthase. After reading through the relevant text it seems like what the authors want to say is that they have ruled out the reversal of ATP synthase as a driver of the increased MMP in sit4del yeast. The dark arrow towards Mitochondrial Membrane potential makes it look like reversal of the ATP synthase is contributing to the increase of mitochondrial membrane potential. Perhaps it would be easier to interpret if there was a red cross below reversal of the ATP Synthase as well?</p><p>Figure 4B shows fold increases with and without Phosphate – that would also be useful to show on other such comparisons (1A, 1B, 2C, 2D).</p><p>Figure 4C. Caption does not list both drugs.</p><p>Figure 4D: It would be helpful to show BKA on this schematic.</p><p>While deletion of PHO85 in combination with deletion of MCT1 helps to establish a link between phosphate starvation and mitochondrial integrity (FiguresS4B-D) it would be more direct to test phosphate starvation directly in an mct1del background.</p><p>The phrase &quot;The scope of responses elicited in cells experiencing high MMP, however, has not been previously interrogated.&quot; is hard to evaluate. It seems from the authors previous sentence that a lot has already been done to interrogate the scope of responses to high MMP. It is also not obvious that this study fully interrogates the scope of responses. This statement may need to be qualified or made more clear.</p><p>In the methods section for the Mitochondrial Protein Import Assay it is unclear what '10OD of total culture at an OD600 between 0.3 and 0.5' means. Approximate total number of cells or a volume should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84282.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Genes in red and blue font in heat maps were followed up in the qPCR experiment shown in Figure 1A-B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The validation S1D would have been more convincing if it had included RTQPCR with CIT2</p></disp-quote><p>During the query strain construction for SGA, we swapped the original <italic>CIT2</italic> locus with firefly luciferase. Even though we re-expressed <italic>CIT2</italic> at <italic>HO</italic> locus, the <italic>CIT2</italic> expression does not accurately reflect what it would be in a more wild-type strain. Therefore, we chose other genes that were also upregulated in <italic>mct1</italic>D cells as a proxy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 1A – it seemed like expression of Yat2 in the independently generated Sit4 mutant was missing. I assume the authors were unable to collect the data for some technical reason, but one would expect a change in Yat 2 as well as it was one of the selection criteria.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not a technical reason but simply that we want to keep four target genes. When we made <italic>sit4</italic>D cells in-house without all the luciferase construct in the genome, we could measure <italic>CIT2</italic> expression. We think <italic>CIT2</italic> expression is a more meaningful data point than <italic>YAT1</italic> because it is to what the original screen readout used was (in the form of firefly luciferase). Therefore, we did not include <italic>YAT1</italic> in the qPCR experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 1C it would be useful to show the expression of CIT2 alongside BTT1 in the gene expression data to help introduce and illustrate the screen.</p></disp-quote><p>Both <italic>BTT1</italic> and <italic>MRL2</italic> expression do not change between perturbations according to the RNA-seq data. Thus, for practical reasons we chose one over the other for different experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A supplementary figure with a scatterplot of the data from the dual luciferace screen indicating the ratio used as a cutoff to select hits would give more confidence in the data. Also it is not clear if replicates were done for the screen and what cutoffs were used to define reduced expression. I assume the authors mean reduced expression at some time point after switching from Glucose to Raffinose relative to the parental strain with the dual luciferase construct, but cannot be sure. In particular the caption of Figure 1D is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have the ability to show this data as a meaningful and interpretable scatterplot. The initial screen had a lot of plate-to-plate variability, which makes it hard to calculate a threshold for each plate. In addition, each mutant had different growth rates and reached different ODs before the luciferase assay, which further complicates the interpretation of data and the interpolate normalization required to display all of this screen in one succinct scatterplot. However, it is important to note that because of this plate-to-plate variability, we performed an extensive secondary screen and validated all the hits. We picked promising hits from the first round to re-run the dual luciferase assay in a low throughput and more precise manner, which allowed for better control for the OD at harvest. We now include these details in the updated manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Fig1D, the captions says that normalized mitochondrial membrane potential is plotted. It is not clear from the methods how the flow cytometry measurements were normalized. Were they normalized to WT in each experiment like the microscope, or to Side Scatter or Forward Scatter which is related to cell size and which is often correlated with intensity in flow cytometry.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the median fluorescent intensity of 10,000 cells measured by flow cytometer. We analyzed and plotted three biological replicates of each strain with the average fluorescent intensity of wild-type cells set to 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conditions under which mRNA abundance was measured for the sit4del and WT strain for Figure 2A (SC overnight) ought to be mentioned in the caption (and possibly in the text) especially as these conditions differ from the Raffinose conditions that the previous RNA-seq experiments were performed in.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this detail in the Figure 2 legend as suggested. The sentence now reads “Volcano plot of the transcriptomics data of <italic>sit4</italic>D vs. wild-type (WT) cells grown in synthetic media containing 2% glucose.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On Page 14: &quot;As expected, the mct1D sit4D double mutant also failed to grow under respiratory conditions (Figure S2D).&quot;, refers to the wrong figure, it should refer to S2C.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this observation and have corrected this mistake in the updated manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 2C, the authors state &quot;'Moreover, the observed modest increase in oxygen consumption is insufficient to explain the profound increase in MMP observed in the mct1D sit4D double mutant.&quot;</p><p>This is confusing wording because there is not an increase in Oxygen Consumption relative to WT in the mct1del sit4del double mutant, but rather a decrease. I assume the authors mean increase with respect to the mct1del mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased this sentence. It now reads “… is insufficient to explain the profound increase in MMP observed in the <italic>mct1</italic>D <italic>sit4</italic>D double mutant in comparison to <italic>mct1</italic>D single mutant.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure S2F it would be helpful to label the F0 component of the ATP synthase if that is what disappears in the rpo41del strains. I was a bit confused because the antibody for Atp2p, part of the F1 component was shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have the antibody for any component in Fo subunit, but the molecular weight on our BN-PAGEs corresponds to the expected full ATP synthase complex. We thus used Atp2 to indicate ATP synthase abundance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2F is a bit hard to interpret because the authors suggest that the mitochondrial membrane potential is not increased by reversal of the ATP synthase. After reading through the relevant text it seems like what the authors want to say is that they have ruled out the reversal of ATP synthase as a driver of the increased MMP in sit4del yeast. The dark arrow towards Mitochondrial Membrane potential makes it look like reversal of the ATP synthase is contributing to the increase of mitochondrial membrane potential. Perhaps it would be easier to interpret if there was a red cross below reversal of the ATP Synthase as well?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and now use dotted arrow to indicate that this is a theoretical way of generating MMP but is not utilized in <italic>sit4</italic>D cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4B shows fold increases with and without Phosphate – that would also be useful to show on other such comparisons (1A, 1B, 2C, 2D).</p></disp-quote><p>We now display all relevant fold changes in Figure 1A, 1B, 2C, and 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4C. Caption does not list both drugs.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed only used bongkrekic acid for this experiment. There is no complex III in <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells. Therefore, treating <italic>rho<sup>0</sup></italic> cells with bongkrekic acid alone was enough to abolish the MMP increase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4D: It would be helpful to show BKA on this schematic.</p></disp-quote><p>We included BKA on the schematic as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While deletion of PHO85 in combination with deletion of MCT1 helps to establish a link between phosphate starvation and mitochondrial integrity (FiguresS4B-D) it would be more direct to test phosphate starvation directly in an mct1del background.</p></disp-quote><p>We think including more data such as phosphate starvation in <italic>mct1</italic>D cells will be repetitive and will not add much additional information to the current story. We want to do our best to keep the story concise, yet thorough, and only show essential data to support our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The phrase &quot;The scope of responses elicited in cells experiencing high MMP, however, has not been previously interrogated.&quot; is hard to evaluate. It seems from the authors previous sentence that a lot has already been done to interrogate the scope of responses to high MMP. It is also not obvious that this study fully interrogates the scope of responses. This statement may need to be qualified or made more clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We should have been more specific with the previous sentence and relevant citations. All of those literatures describe responses to reduced MMP. We rephased these sentences to emphasize that compared to the cellular responses to low MMP, we lack understanding of how cells respond to high MMP. This sentence now reads “The scope of responses elicited in cells experiencing high MMP, however, has not been previously interrogated nearly to the same extent as cells with reduced MMP.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the methods section for the Mitochondrial Protein Import Assay it is unclear what '10OD of total culture at an OD600 between 0.3 and 0.5' means.
