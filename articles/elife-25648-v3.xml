Because protein-protein interactions require that proteins be in close proximity, and often require binding in specific configurations, it could be of great benefit to know, for a particular cell, where all its proteins were at one point in time and how they were oriented. Given sufficient precision, this information would not only tell us which proteins are interacting (or, conversely, which are unlikely to do so), but would also allow us to understand better how higher-order, cooperative modes of molecular assembly lead to specific cellular activities and functional states. Much could be inferred from atomic-resolution snapshots of cells, although this is known to be impossible due to radiation damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breedlove and Trammell, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henderson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glaeser, 2008</xref>). What is possible, however, is the detection of unlabeled proteins in cells on the basis of template matching.</p><p>Template matching applied to electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM)-based tomograms aims to determine whether certain proteins are present in experimental images by comparing computed protein templates, derived from solved atomic models, to 3D reconstructions of samples. This approach has made it possible to map the 3D locations and orientations of individual ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ortiz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pfeffer et al., 2015</xref>) and proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asano et al., 2015</xref>) in thin regions of unstained frozen-hydrated cells. The optical resolution of a tomogram (~4 nm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oikonomou and Jensen, 2016</xref>) allows the 3D locations of individual structures, once detected, to be determined accurately. Detectability is limited, however, to structures large enough to be distinct in shape at this resolution; in practice, only a few protein complexes in the megadalton range have been detected reliably using information in tomograms alone (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kühner et al., 2009</xref>). Template matching in tomograms is difficult in crowded regions of cells because nearby macromolecules can obscure the protein-of-interest’s outline and thus interfere with detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frangakis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grünewald et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asano et al., 2016</xref>). Use of a protein's fine internal structure for template matching should allow more robust detection, but also requires higher resolution.</p><p>Here we introduce an approach to determine the locations and orientations of proteins in crowded environments by using the high-resolution information that is now available in single cryo-EM images. The approach is based on the fact that–at a sufficiently high spatial resolution–the projected (2D) potential of a protein, and thus the pattern of phase shifts imparted on the electron wave as it passes through the sample, is unique for a particular protein and projection direction. Projection-matching concepts have been used in single-particle analysis (SPA) to select (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Penczek et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Penczek, 2004</xref>) and align (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grigorieff, 2007</xref>) particle images, although low-resolution templates are preferred in order to limit bias in any resulting reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henderson, 2013</xref>). Different from the SPA case, which aims to determine new high-resolution structures, we are here concerned with using existing high-resolution structural information for the unambiguous detection of single proteins, which is not affected by template bias.</p><p>We find that effects of macromolecular background are greatly reduced by using close-to-focus images and matched filtering, both of which suppress low-frequency information. We show experimentally that we can reliably detect proteins down to a size limit of 150 kDa in vitreous ice. Simulations that include a macromolecular background suggest that this limit should increase to 300 kDa in a 100 nm thick tissue slice. Even better detectability might be achieved using higher-resolution reference structures. Experiments involving viral proteins in intact rotavirus particles demonstrate detectability in the presence of protein and nucleic acid background.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Detection of proteins in isolation</title><p>One way to determine whether there is a (target) protein of known identity and orientation at a particular location in an image is to compare the spatial distribution of detected electrons around that location to what is expected for the protein in that orientation and at that location. The expectation value for the electron count in each pixel can be calculated directly from the known three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in the target and the optical parameters of the electron microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rullgard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vulović et al., 2013</xref>). By suitably varying the projection direction we can generate a set of two-dimensional templates that represent all possible electron distributions (for a given resolution) that this protein could produce in such an image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whether an image is likely to contain the target can be established by cross-correlating the image with that template. Cross-correlation allows a match to be detected even when multiple proteins overlap in projection as long as the image-intensity modulation is approximately equal to the sum of the individual proteins’ contributions, as is the case for weak-phase objects (e.g. ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reimer and Kohl, 2008</xref>, p. 316). Cross-correlation is able to extract matching information even if individual pixels are dominated by noise as long as the spatial resolution of the microscope as such is preserved, which is the case when using motion-corrected electron movies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brilot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013a</xref>).</p><p>Searching a single cryo-EM image for a target protein with a high-resolution reference structure requires cross-correlating millions of templates (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), each corresponding to a different orientation of the target with an image (typically megapixel-sized), or in other words, searching a space of location-orientation combinations (LOCs) with more than 10<sup>12</sup> entries. Since the computational cost of a search goes up linearly with the number of templates, we chose a set of orientations spaced as evenly as possible, thereby minimizing, for a given number of orientations, the largest rotation that is necessary to bring any orientation into alignment with a member of the set. Unlike in Euclidean space, where a regular grid pattern with discrete translational symmetry fulfills this criterion, no simple solution for this problem exists in orientation space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saff and Kuijlaars, 1997</xref>) and, after considering several approaches, we settled on a method based on the Hopf fibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yershova et al., 2010</xref>) (Materials and methods). In a set of ≈2.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> orientations generated in this way, the incremental rotation angle between one set member and its closest neighbor was 1.88 degrees. Out of 10,000 random orientations, none required a rotation of more than 1.51 degrees to bring it into alignment with one of the members of the Hopf set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>After confirming in simulated images that correlation-based projection-matching can correctly identify proteins and determine their locations and orientations (data not shown), we tested whether this could also be done in experimental images. We acquired pairs of images of apoferritin (PDB: 2W0O) embedded in vitreous ice, the first image acquired close to the Gaussian focus, where we expected the best detectability given the optical properties of the microscope (see below), and the second image at a more typical underfocus of 2000 nm or more, which readily allowed us to recognize likely target molecules by eye.</p><p>For images taken close to focus, where the target molecules are not detectable by eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), there were typically only a small number of orientations for which the corresponding cross-correlograms (CCGs) contained any (and when they did, only a few) pixels with values of the SNR (the ratio of the peak height and the standard deviation of the CCG noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saxton and Frank, 1976</xref>], Materials and methods) that were exceptionally high, i.e., substantially exceeded those expected for a Gaussian noise distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). High-value CCG pixels were typically clustered at locations that—in high-underfocus images—were encircled by the dark ring typical for apoferritin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The angular differences within the set of orientations associated with a cluster of high-valued CCG pixels were less than three degrees away from the best-detected orientation after taking into account the octahedral symmetry of apoferritin (97.9% of values both &gt;7.32 and within one pixel of any peak, N = 17 peaks).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25648.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Protein detection in vitreous ice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) From the left: apoferritin structure, template at 220 nm underfocus, image of a single apoferritin in ice at 220 nm underfocus with 1200 electrons/nm<sup>2</sup>.

To test this, we created a number of model structures that contained only a subset of the atoms in the original apoferritin structure. For each of these fragments, which ranged in molecular weight from 50 to 200 kDa, we calculated templates using the orientations that had provided optimal matches for the whole protein and the other 23 orientations linked by octahedral symmetry. Then, cross-correlating the fragment templates with the experimental images, we found that the average SNR varied with the MW as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, fitting y = a*(MW)<sup>α</sup> to the CCG values for the 5 × 24 fragments and the full template yielded α = 0.508 ± 0.009 and α = 0.514 ± 0.003 for experimental and simulated images, respectively; two particles). This suggested that we should be able to detect proteins down to a MW of roughly 150 kDa when using an SNR of 7.32 as the detection threshold, which should generate about one false alarm (CCG values above the threshold due to noise) per image of 1850<sup>2</sup> pixels (Materials and methods). To confirm this, we performed full searches (using our standard set of orientations) for three of the fragments (200, 150, and 100 kDa). We found, respectively, 259, 58, and 10 CCG values &gt;7.32, of which most (256, 56, and 8) were within 0.3 nm of locations where peaks had been detected using the full-protein templates (440 kDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mismatch sensitivity</title><p>Some or all target proteins in an image might remain undetected if the wrong microscope parameters are assumed or if the search-space is undersampled with respect to orientation or position. To determine how well we need to know the experimental defocus and magnification, and how densely we need to sample location and orientation, we mapped for both experimental and simulated images how the peak height in the CCG varied with these parameters. We found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–e</xref>) that a reduction in the SNR by 20% was caused by a positional misalignment of 0.15 nm in experimental images (0.13 nm in simulations), a focus mismatch of 21.0 nm (15.5 nm), or a magnification error of 1.9% (1.6%). The sensitivity to errors in template orientation depends on the rotation axis. While for the axis perpendicular to the image plane (z-axis) a mismatch of 0.95 degrees (0.89 in simulations) was sufficient for a 20% drop in SNR, for an axis parallel to the image plane 1.92 degrees (1.34) were needed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). The lower sensitivity for rotations around an in-plane axis is likely caused by the foreshortening of the atomic movements as their z-components are lost upon projection. Using simulations, we also explored the effect of the focus setting on detection and found that at 2000 nm underfocus the peaks in the CCG flare out towards a broad base but still possess a sharply defined maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) with a peak SNR quite comparable to that seen for much smaller defocus values. This means that, at least for isolated target proteins, the detectability did not depend strongly on the defocus.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25648.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Detection against background.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Simulated images of a single apoferritin in ice without (left) and with (right) a dense protein background (BSA at 37.5 kDa-nm<sup>−2</sup>), at 70 nm and 2000 nm underfocus as well as for a perfect phase-plate microscope (PPM).

While in brain tissue only about 10% of the mass density is due to lipid and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McIlwain and Bachelard, 1985</xref>) with the remainder being mostly water, it is likely that other proteins will interfere with the detection of a target protein much more strongly than water at the same projected mass density because proteins resemble each other more than they resemble vitreous water. We explored this situation by simulating, at 70 nm and 2000 nm underfocus, images of a synthetic sample that contained apoferritin as the target protein, and a background of randomly oriented and placed BSA proteins at an average density of 37.5 kDa/nm<sup>2</sup>. The apoferritin target could not be detected by eye in either image, yet searching the 70 nm image yielded a clear peak at the correct location albeit with reduced SNR compared to the background-free case (14.4 <italic>vs</italic>. 16.9). Template matching was, however, no longer able to reliably detect the target in the 2000 nm image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We suspected that the reason for this difference is that the defocus setting profoundly affects the contrast transfer function (CTF). As the defocus becomes smaller, low spatial frequencies are increasingly suppressed, the number of phase reversals is reduced, and the suppression of high spatial frequencies, which is caused by the fact that the illumination is only partially coherent, becomes much less severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To determine which of these effects, if any, are responsible for the observed behavior, we first simulated images as they would be generated by a (hypothetical) phase-plate microscope (PPM) with a CTF that is constant in both amplitude and phase (except for the 90 degree phase shift due to the phase plate everywhere but near zero spatial frequency) and thus attenuates neither high nor low spatial frequencies. In simulated PPM images the target protein was neither visible by eye nor could it be detected by cross-correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was somewhat surprising because PPM images contain nearly all the phase-contrast information that is available; no information is lost to partial coherence or to phase reversals. This suggested that the loss of detectability against protein background seen for simulated PPM and large-defocus images is caused by low-spatial-frequency noise that happens to be suppressed by the close-to-focus CTF.</p><p>For simulations that included protein background, the image noise was dominated by low-frequency components, both at 2000 nm defocus and for the PPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This suggested that to optimize detection one needs to use the full matched-filtering concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McDonough et al., 1995</xref>), which includes, in addition to template matching, a whitening filter that flattens the power spectrum of the image noise, maximizing detectability against a spectrally inhomogeneous background. Our whitening filter comprised the reciprocal square root of the radially averaged power spectral density (PSD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), and was applied by Fourier-space multiplication to both the transformed image and template before calculating each cross-correlation (Materials and methods).</p><p>We found that whitening, in fact, restored detectability: CCGs now showed strong and narrow peaks at the correct locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Detectability was best (SNR = 20.5) for the PPM followed by 70 nm (SNR = 14.3) and 2000 nm (SNR = 7.7) underfocus. For the PPM and for 2000 nm underfocus, the whitening filter strongly suppressed low-frequency information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). These simulation results confirm that a major reason for compromised detectability in strongly defocused images is that there the CTF, unlike in close-to-focus images, does not suppress the low-frequency noise that dominates images with a high density of macromolecules.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25648.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Optimized detection.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Whitened templates and simulated images together with the corresponding maximum-projected CCGs for apoferritin with a BSA background of 37.5 kDa/nm<sup>2</sup> (same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> right except for whitening).

This increased the SNR at 2000 nm by 42% (from 7.7 to 10.9), but only by 8% at 70 nm (from 14.3 to 15.4). The remaining difference in SNR is likely due to the fact that near the Scherzer focus (70 nm defocus) the CTF remains very high in a part of the spatial frequency range that provides much information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>We also explored the SNR for a whole range of defocus values from 500 nm overfocus to 2000 nm underfocus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Within this range, the best SNR was seen at 70 nm. Against a protein background the SNR varied strongly with defocus near the Scherzer setting and then fell steadily with focus distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), mitigated somewhat by whitening. In contrast, a background comprising randomly placed carbon atoms, which produced a spectrally flat noise distribution (data not shown), reduced protein detectability uniformly for all defocus settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Why don’t coherence effects reduce the SNR at large underfocus without protein background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>)? One possibility is that a gain in low-frequency information, which is eliminated by the whitening filter in the protein-background case, compensates for the loss of high-frequency information caused by the coherence envelope.</p><p>We next determined how much different spatial frequencies contribute to target detectability by removing all spatial frequencies above a variable frequency threshold and observing the effect this has on the SNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>). For an isolated apoferritin molecule in vitreous ice, the average SNR for five of the particles in the experimental image increased until it reached a value of about 12 at a spatial frequency of 3 nm<sup>−1</sup> after which it essentially stayed constant. In a simulation using the same parameters the SNR closely followed the experimental curve up to a resolution of 2.4 nm<sup>−1</sup> beyond which it diverged upward to reach a value of 17.6 at 5.2 nm<sup>−1</sup>. The difference could be due to residual magnification or focus mismatch, uncorrected sample drift, or astigmatism in the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). In simulations with protein background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), the SNR for matched-filter detection reached maximum values of 14.7 and 8.3 at defocus settings of 70 and 2000 nm, respectively.

Rotavirus DLPs are 70 nm in diameter and have at their core a densely-packed double-stranded RNA genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estrozi et al., 2013</xref>). The genome is contained inside a protein shell assembled in perfect icosahedral symmetry from two protein types, the inner capsid protein, VP2 (120 copies, approximately 90 kDa each), and the outer capsid protein, VP6 (780 copies, 45 kDa each), which together form 60 asymmetric subunits (ASUs, 720 kDa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> inset). In addition to these structural proteins, each DLP contains at least two enzymatic proteins, VP1 (at least 11 copies, 115 kDa each) and VP3 (at least 11 copies, 90–100 kDa each), which together are responsible for synthesizing and capping single-stranded RNA molecules before they are extruded into the infected host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogden et al., 2014</xref>).

This means that for proteins below a certain size a meaningful search of the entire LOC space is no longer possible, which puts many proteins out of reach. Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) suggest that the size limit is around 150 kDa for isolated targets, and should be about twice that with protein background, which reduces the SNR by about 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

Given that we know the LOCs of all ASUs, the number of LOCs that need to be searched is reduced from about 10<sup>12</sup> to below 10<sup>3</sup>. The search was based on a hybrid molecular model (PDB: 4F5X) that combines the structure of VP1, as determined by X-ray crystallography (PDB: 2R7O), and an independently determined structure of the ASU (PDB: 3KZ4, see also Materials and methods). The dataset contained 4,178 DLP images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grant and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>), taken at focus settings between 300 and 1900 nm. First, we determined possible LOCs for VP1 by searching with a template set based on only the ASU portion of the hybrid model. We retained only those DLPs (3,296) where we found all 60 ASUs when using a threshold that returned one false alarm per image (750 by 750 pixels). Then, using only the VP1 portion of the model, we searched only those LOCs that agreed exactly with the orientation of one of the ASUs and were within one pixel (0.1 nm) of its location.</p><p>Using a threshold of 2.03, which yielded, on average, 0.059 false alarms per ASU LOC for a set of control templates (Materials and methods), we found 9.63 VP1s per DLP. Assuming 11 bound VP1s per DLP, about 2.9 (0.059 × (60-11)) of those should be false alarms leaving 6.73 true positives, a recall of 71.2%. The prevalence of vertices that contained one detected VP1 was substantially larger (and those with zero, two, or three substantially smaller) than the binomially distributed prevalence one would expect for independent binding and what one gets with the binding sites randomly shuffled within each DLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). This is consistent with the assumption that steric hindrances prevent the binding of more than one VP1 per vertex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estrozi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The SNR of 2.28, estimated from CCG histograms (Materials and methods), is smaller than the value of 2.98 that one gets by extrapolation from 7.45, the mean peak value seen when searching for ASUs, using the square-root dependence of the SNR on the molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This is likely due to differences between the X-ray-derived and the in situ structure of VP1 (see below). Note also that even 2.98 is still substantially smaller than 4.3, the value expected using the SNR of around 6.16 seen for an apoferritin fragment with about the same MW as VP1 (100 kDa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and taking into account the roughly 30% reduction in SNR caused by the macromolecular background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).</p><p>The ability to detect individual VP1s allowed us to reconstruct, by direct Fourier inversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grigorieff, 1998</xref>), the structure of VP1 bound to one of the five sites at the fivefold vertex.

The resulting potential distribution includes a well-resolved VP1 molecule attached to one of the five possible binding sites near an ssRNA exit portal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>).

While some of the issues that arise are also encountered when determining molecular structures by single-particle averaging, the need to ensure high sensitivity and high selectivity in the presence of a dense background of other biological macromolecules is not one of them. We found that operating close to focus helps in the detection of target proteins first by suppressing low spatial-frequencies (which are critical when picking particles for single-particle averaging) caused by the presence of other proteins and, second, by preserving high frequency information crucial for sensitivity and selectivity. While the suppression of low frequencies can also be achieved by filtering the acquired images, the irreversible loss of high-frequency information that occurs due to partial-coherence effects becomes more severe at larger defocus and was responsible for the degraded detection sensitivity seen in simulated large-defocus images.</p><p>While the inclusion of higher spatial frequencies in both templates and in the image improves the detection sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), it also exacerbates the differences between a particular reference structure (usually determined in a non-native context such as a crystal) and its conformation in situ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Searches may, therefore, need to include template sets for a whole range of possible conformations. Finally, magnification and focus will need to be estimated more precisely and the orientation, in particular, sampled more densely.</p><p>Without prior knowledge about their location and orientation but otherwise optimal conditions we can detect proteins with a molecular weight above about 150 kDa when suspended in vitrified ice. Whether detection of proteins above 300 kDa is possible in 100 nm-thick slices of vitrified biological material should be testable with the help of modern cryo-sectioning techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Amoudi et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>How does our detection sensitivity compare to the ultimate limit, given by the number of scattered electrons? At 300 keV and an exposure of 1000 electrons/nm<sup>2</sup>, a single apoferritin molecule scatters about 1436 (Materials and methods) electrons elastically, of which about 20% are available at a resolution of 0.4 nm. Taking into account that due to the oscillation in the CTF only half of those are usable we expect a SNR of ≈12 ((1436 × 0.2 × 0.5)<sup>0.5</sup>), which is close to what is seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). If all scattered electrons could be used, the SNR would increase to almost 38. The minimal molecular weight—assuming perfect electron-optical resolution, a B-factor of 0, no background, and a SNR of about seven needed for detection—would then be around 16 kDa.</p><p>Detection of the rotavirus RNA polymerase and the mapping of the occupied binding sites inside the virus capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–e</xref>) illustrates how one can analyze partially stochastic protein assemblies, in which a ligand protein (here, VP1) binds at only some of the available binding sites on a molecular host (the virus capsid). Such assemblies play an important role, for example, during the establishment and control of synaptic function. Often the structures of key components and their interaction partners are known, but whether in a particular synapse this interaction is utilized may be impossible to determine by conventional methods yet might yield to this type of analysis. If the steric constraints of the interaction are known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–e</xref>), even ligands below the unconstrained detection limit should be detectable.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>Apoferritin samples were prepared to a final protein concentration of 0.25 mg/mL in PBS from horse-spleen apoferritin (#A3660, lot #SLBF8335V, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and contained 15 nm gold particles (#1115, Nanoprobes, Yaphank, NY).

The sample was then transferred into liquid nitrogen and stored until imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Microscope alignment and calibration</title><p>Electron cryo-microscopy was performed on a transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 300 kV (Titan Krios, FEI, Hillsboro, OR) in parallel illumination mode. The objective aperture was removed and the condenser aperture was set to 70 <italic>µ</italic>m, the spot size to 4, and the illuminated area diameter to 1.70 <italic>µ</italic>m. State-of-the-art low-dose procedures were used to limit sample exposure during microscope alignment and low-magnification (40X-1700X) inspection of the sample, which preceded each high-resolution imaging session. Particular attention was paid to positioning the specimen near the microscope’s eucentric focus as well as to minimizing astigmatism and coma, using the objective stigmator controls and coma-free alignment tools in the Titan User Interface (FEI).</p><p>Reference images to calibrate the direct electron detector (DED) pixel dark current and gain were acquired immediately before each set of experiments with the column closed (for dark current) or by imaging an open square (for gain reference). Exposure rates were estimated for the illumination and detection configurations used for high-resolution image acquisition of each sample (see below) and, when necessary, the spot size and beam intensity settings were changed to keep the rates below five electrons pixel<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, in order to limit coincidence losses to around 6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013b</xref>). Microscope and DED were controlled by SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>) and Digital Micrograph (K2 Summit, Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Image data were recorded as movies with an exposure time of 25 msec per frame at a nominal magnification of 59,000 in counting mode, which resulted in a sample-referred pixel pitch of 0.0482 nm. The dark current was subtracted at the point of acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data pre-processing</title><p>Movies were gain-corrected by multiplying all frames by the gain reference. A pixel location was considered ‘hot’ if it had a mean value of more than seven times the standard deviation above the mean of all pixels in the movie. Each hot pixel was set to the mean of the eight surrounding pixel values in each frame. Typically, fewer than 20 out of 1.4 × 10<sup>7</sup> pixels were hot. Each frame in the movie was then cropped to a centered square, down-sampled by a factor of two using Fourier cropping, and real-space cropped to a final size of 1850 × 1850 pixels.</p><p>To estimate the motion-correction shifts for each movie frame, the down-sampled movies were low-pass filtered with a cosine-edge mask rolling off between 4.6–4.8 cycles nm<sup>−1</sup> and then analyzed with a custom algorithm that progressively incorporated movie frames into a registered stack (R) while also iteratively refining the alignment of frames within R. As a first step, movie frames 10–30 (of 40) were each cross-correlated against their higher-index neighbors. Of the pair that yielded the cross correlogram (CCG) with the highest peak value, the frame with the higher index became the first frame of R. In every iteration step, each movie frame was correlated with the sum of all frames in R, excluding the frame itself. The frame with the highest CCG peak among those not yet in R was aligned to the frame sum and incorporated into R. The alignment of any frame already in R was adjusted if the cross-correlation peak amplitude had increased compared to the last iteration. This iterative re-adjustment was continued for at most 100 iterations even after all movie frames had been incorporated into R, until the sum of all cross-correlation peak amplitudes re-occurred. Shift values were determined by 20-fold Fourier padding a 10 × 10 pixel region around the cross-correlation peak and taking the location of the maximum. Motion-correction shifts were then applied with sub-pixel resolution as linear phase shifts in Fourier space to the gain-corrected and down-sampled but unfiltered movie frames. Starting from the beginning of the movie, movie frames were then summed until an accumulated electron exposure of 1200 or 1600 electrons/nm<sup>2</sup> for apoferritin or DLP images, respectively, was reached. Gold fiducial particles in apoferritin images were masked after these processing steps by substituting all pixel values in those regions of the image with the mean value of the remaining image pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Template generation</title><p>Templates were computed using the structural information in the target’s PDB coordinate file retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_012820">SCR_012820</ext-link>).

The orientations were generated by an algorithm based on the Hopf fibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yershova et al., 2010</xref>). Orientations were represented by unit quaternions and were converted into rotation matrices where needed. The following results were stored: for each CCG value larger than a given threshold (for most searches equal to 5) the value and the corresponding LOC; for each orientation the maximum CCG value and its location; for each location, the maximum, the mean, and the variance of the distribution of CCG values across all orientations; a histogram of all CCG values. One full search (including the generation of the templates) of a single 1850 × 1850 pixel image required approximately 1000 CPU-hours using compute nodes with 2.7 GHz Intel Sandy Bridge E5-2680 processors and 8 GB of RAM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Precision-recall curves</title><p>Precision-recall curves were determined by comparing the ground-truth LOCs to locations and orientations in the list of all CCG values larger than five. For DLP images, only those elements in the list were considered that fell within 32.5 nm of the DLP center. Parsing the list in order of descending CCG value, we incorporated an element from that list into the list of true positives whenever the element’s LOC fell within both five pixels and three (simulations) or five (experiments) degrees of any ground-truth LOC (see below) but only if no previously examined element had already met those criteria for that particular ground-truth LOC. If the element’s LOC was not close to any ground-truth LOC it was incorporated into the list of false positives but only if it was not close to any LOC already in that list, using the same distance criteria. The true positive and false positive counts (<italic>n<sub>tp</sub></italic> and <italic>n<sub>fp</sub></italic>) for a particular threshold were then determined by simply counting the elements in the corresponding lists with CCG values above that threshold. Each time an element increased <italic>n<sub>tp</sub></italic>, the recall was calculated as the ratio between <italic>n<sub>tp</sub></italic> and the number of ground-truth LOCs and the precision as <italic>n<sub>tp</sub></italic> /(<italic>n<sub>tp</sub></italic> + <italic>n<sub>fp</sub></italic>). Precision-recall curves representing multiple datasets (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) were calculated as the mean of all datasets’ precision values at a given recall.</p><p>To determine the ground-truth LOCs for a particular DLP image, the image was cropped closely (65 pixel margin) and searched using a complete set of ASU templates (PDB: 3KZ4, one copy of chains A-O) generated using our standard set of orientations. For each group of neighboring pixels with at least one CCG MIP value &gt;7.11 the orientation corresponding to the highest-valued CCG in that neighborhood was expanded into a full icosahedrally symmetric set with 60 elements. All such sets of orientations were combined and then clustered using a rotation threshold of three degrees. From the largest cluster we selected the element with the largest CCG value and searched the neighborhood of its orientation in 0.31 degree increments using templates based on the full DLP capsid structure (PDB: 3KZ4) and a whitening filter. The orientation that gave the largest CCG peak was thereafter used as the particle’s orientation.</p><p>To determine the expected ASU locations in a DLP image, we calculated the 3D coordinates for the center of mass of each ASU reported in the PDB file and rotated them about the particle center to the particle orientation, and projected them onto the image plane. The shift of this pattern relative to the center of the image was calculated as follows: we generated ASU templates at the 60 orientations obtained by expanding the particle’s orientation into a full icosahedrally symmetric set. These templates were then whitened and cross-correlated with the whitened image. The resulting CCGs were then combined into a maximum intensity projection (MIP) and cross-correlated with a location reference image. The location of the maximum in that CCG corresponds to the pattern shift vector sought. The location-reference image was created by shifting a discrete-delta-function image (where the pixel at the center was set to one and all other pixels were set to zero) with subpixel resolution to the expected locations of all ASUs whose CCG included a value above 5.47 (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mtext>erfc</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>60</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>850</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, see SNR) in the combined MIP and maximum intensity projecting the resulting images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Rotavirus VP1 reconstruction</title><p>Capsid-bound VP1 molecules were detected as follows.

First, using for each DLP the orientation and defocus from a list generously provided by T. Grant, we performed a search for the 60 ASUs (target structure PDB: 4F5X, one copy of chains A-O only) constrained to the 60 orientations consistent with the DLP orientation provided. Only those images (3,296 of 4,178) where each of the 60 ASUs could be detected within a radius of five pixels (0.5 nm) of its location expected given the orientation of the entire DLP were kept for further analysis, using the coordinates of the CCG peaks instead of the locations expected.</p><p>The search for VP1 LOCs was performed by cross-correlating the image with a set of 60 templates generated using only the VP1 fragment of the structure (PDB: 4F5X, one copy of chain W only) with all B-factors set to 100.0 Å<sup>2</sup> and at the orientations expected. The locations were constrained to a 1-pixel radius (five pixels per CCG) of the detected ASU locations. CCGs were corrected for variations in mean and variance with the radius from the center of the DLP, which were estimated by searching with control templates (the real templates rotated by 180 degrees around the center of mass in the squared template image), binning the CCG values generated according to the distance of the corresponding pixels from the DLP center, calculating for each bin the mean and standard deviation, and radially smoothing the results using a 5-pixel wide 1<sup>st</sup>-order Savitzky-Golay filter.</p><p>The searches for VP1 yielded a set of 2 × 3296 × 12 × 5 × 5 CCG values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), which represent five values (for the predicted pixel and the four closest pixels) for each of the five possible VP1 locations in each of the 12 five-fold vertices in each of the 3,296 particles using two templates (target and control). To produce <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, all potential VP1 locations for which the maximum across the pixel-neighborhood (the last index of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), was above 2.03 were counted as detected VP1s. To produce the VP1 reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>) we used a higher threshold (2.56) to reduce the number of expected false alarms to one per DLP, and furthermore counted a VP1 as detected only if no other VP1 was detected at the same vertex. For each detected VP1 in the dataset (15,265 in total), we generated a copy of the original image, padded it to 2048 × 2048 pixels, shifted it to position the associated ASU at the center pixel, and together with the expected orientation and defocus, incorporated it into a set that was then provided as input to a development version of Frealign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grigorieff, 2007</xref>), which was used to calculate the reconstruction directly, using no refinement, classification, or imposed symmetry.</p><p>The 3D difference map comparing the experimental reconstruction to a model was generated in Diffmap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/diffmap">http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/diffmap</ext-link>).

This means that when searching with the real template the average number of false alarms that we need to subtract from the number of detections (<italic>n<sub>d</sub></italic>) to get at the number of true detections (<italic>n<sub>tp</sub></italic>) is only 49/60 times as large as that for the control template (n<italic><sub>fp</sub></italic>).

eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single-protein detection in crowded molecular environments with high specificity using cryo-EM&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Steven J Ludtke (Reviewer #2); Robert M Glaeser (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The method proposed allows one to detect characteristic signatures of macromolecular assemblies in crowded cellular environments without labels. This method is complementary to cryo-EM tomography (cryo-ET) in the sense that the size limit of what can be mapped is much lower than that of cryo-ET, but it appears that sample thicknesses has to be much less than what it can be in tomography. It was felt that this method will be taken up by a large community, and it will make a big impact.</p><p>The major claims made for this new method, which are well supported by the data, are:</p><p>1) Proteins as small as 150 kDa can be reliably detected in vitreous ice.</p><p>2) In a crowded environment, like that of the interior of brain tissue, the molecular weight limit should increase to 300 kDa.</p><p>3) Identification of macromolecules is highly specific.</p><p>This manuscript demonstrates that it is possible to use very fine-grained template matching to identify component molecules in CryoEM images even when obscured by other material. This study focuses on the unique high resolution features present in individual molecules, rather than the low resolution &quot;shape&quot; information often relied upon in single particle picking software. The method is based on the well-known approach of template matching by cross correlation, in which the templates are known, high-resolution structures of macromolecules whose locations and orientations are being sought. The novel result presented in this manuscript is that such template matching works best when low spatial-frequencies are suppressed, leaving mainly the high-frequency components to dominate the cross-correlation search. It is shown, for example, that the method works best when images are taken so close to focus that one cannot see the particles by eye. This result is highly unexpected, since it is known that the SNR is far better at low frequency than at high frequency. Furthermore, there is well-justified concern in the field that the use of a high-resolution template can produce model-dependent bias. This manuscript properly addresses that concern by setting the threshold for identification very high. This is an interesting study, and worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While it is very nice to see a manuscript on a topic like this really cover the subject in depth and with sufficient technical detail for others to follow in the author's footsteps, the discussion of the various trials and overall discussion seemed at times rather repetitive, covering the same points multiple times. The main manuscript could be considerably streamlined without reducing its scientific content. A bewildering number of points are discussed, and a large number of panels are grouped into just 4 figures. For the sake of clarity, the authors should undertake a major simplification of the manuscript. Even the overall structure of the presentation itself should be reconsidered and improved. For example, it would help if fewer image-panels were used, sufficient to illustrate the concept behind this method and to document that it really works. Further supporting details might then be moved to Supplemental Material.</p><p>The method has clearly demonstrated its ability to work on isolated particles and on particles obscured by the bulk of other molecules (the virus substructure example). A key point in this manuscript seems to be the argument that this may be used for molecular localization as an alternative to tomography in cellular material. This study does not make a convincing argument that this will be possible for two reasons:</p><p>1) in-situ molecules are likely to undergo substantial structural variations, and will often be complexed with other molecules which will lead to conformational variation. The question of whether the templates being searched for will be sufficiently similar to the actual molecules has not really been addressed. What level of variability would begin to cause failure? This might be addressed very briefly.</p><p>2) Their estimate of a 100nm thick layer as being typical for cellular tomograms seems inaccurate. For Cryo studies either very small whole cells are vitrified, which are typically ~500nm thick, or cells are cryo-sectioned or FIB-milled, which are also frequently considerably thicker than 100nm. Perhaps the authors might want to state that while a 100 nm thick sample might be desired for high resolution tomography, this is usually not possible.</p><p>For these reasons, it was felt that either the authors need to show some sort of proof of concept on CryoEM of cellular material, or downplay their claims of usefulness for cellular material somewhat. The reviewers are not stating that the method will not work for cells, simply that this manuscript currently provides insufficient evidence to make this claim.</p><p>There were some concerns about the use of the term SNR in this manuscript. SNR is widely used in CryoEM for various purposes and the definition here, while somewhat acceptable from a pure image processing perspective, may be confusing to people in CryoEM. Canonically SNR or SSNR are measures of power or intensity ratios. In that &quot;space&quot; coherent averaging scales as amplitude squared and incoherent averaging scales linearly, producing SSNR which scales linearly with &quot;amplitude&quot; whatever that means in a specific situation. In image processing, SNR is sometimes defined as a ratio between a peak and the standard deviation of the background similarly to this manuscript, but this definition produces an amplitude ratio rather than an intensity ratio, giving the SNR here different scaling properties than the SNR and SSNR elsewhere in CryoEM. Very often the SNR in image processing is also squared for this reason. If the authors opt to continue with this definition, it is important that this discrepancy be described in the SNR methods section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25648.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>While it is very nice to see a manuscript on a topic like this really cover the subject in depth and with sufficient technical detail for others to follow in the author's footsteps, the discussion of the various trials and overall discussion seemed at times rather repetitive, covering the same points multiple times.

We have also streamlined the Discussion by shortening the list of potential applications, and by eliminating a paragraph that restated points made in the Introduction.</p><p>Since the Research Article format at <italic>eLife</italic> does not include a separate section for Supplemental Material, our understanding is that text must be either in the manuscript or omitted entirely.</p><p>As the reviewers themselves point out, the fact that the method works best for images taken close to focus is surprising. We think that a thorough treatment of the reasons why this is true is beneficial to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>The method has clearly demonstrated its ability to work on isolated particles and on particles obscured by the bulk of other molecules (the virus substructure example).

This might be addressed very briefly.</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct to point out that differences between a reference structure and real structures <italic>in situ</italic> should, once sufficiently large, lead to a failure to detect the expected structure. We agree that this topic should be addressed, and have done so as follows:</p><p>1) We now include as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> a brief analysis that considers how detectability might be affected by differences between a reference structure and a real structure.</p><p>When a part of a protein assumes a different conformation that no longer matches the model, the SNR should be reduced by the ratio between the mass of unchanged part and that of the total protein mass in the original templates. If it is known which parts of the protein are likely to differ from the model, those parts of the model can be removed. In that case the SNR should scale again as the square root of the molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>2) We now make the following point in the Discussion section: “While the inclusion of higher spatial frequencies in both templates and in the image improves the detection sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), it also exacerbates the differences between a particular reference structure (usually determined in a non-native context such as a crystal) and its conformation <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Searches may, therefore, need to include template sets for a whole range of possible conformations.”</p><p><italic>2) Their estimate of a 100nm thick layer as being typical for cellular tomograms seems inaccurate. For Cryo studies either very small whole cells are vitrified, which are typically ~500nm thick, or cells are cryo-sectioned or FIB-milled, which are also frequently considerably thicker than 100nm. Perhaps the authors might want to state that while a 100 nm thick sample might be desired for high resolution tomography, this is usually not possible.</italic></p><p>It is becoming more common to prepare cryo-sections of vitrified cells or tissue samples for tomography that are cut to a thickness of 100 nm or less (see, e.g., reviewer refs. <sup>1-13</sup>). To clarify that this is the type of application we have in mind, we have modified the text referring to sample thickness in the Discussion section so that it now reads: “Whether detection of proteins above 300 kDa is possible in 100 nm-thick slices of vitrified biological material should be testable with the help of modern cryo-sectioning techniques (Al-Amoudi, Diez, Betts and Frangakis, 2007).”</p><p><italic>For these reasons, it was felt that either the authors need to show some sort of proof of concept on CryoEM of cellular material, or downplay their claims of usefulness for cellular material somewhat. The reviewers are not stating that the method will not work for cells, simply that this manuscript currently provides insufficient evidence to make this claim.</italic></p><p>The reviewers correctly point out that we have not demonstrated the usefulness of this approach in actual cellular material. To emphasize this, we have modified the manuscript in the following ways:</p><p>1) The Abstract now refers to an estimated detection limit in “in 100 nm thick samples of dense biological material” rather than in “100 nm thick tissue sections.”</p><p>2) The Introduction now describes an approach “to determine the locations and orientations of proteins in crowded environments” rather than “to determine the intracellular locations…”</p><p>3) We have eliminated all text in the Discussion section in which detectability with our approach was compared directly to tomography (which has in fact been tested in cellular material).</p><p><italic>There were some concerns about the use of the term SNR in this manuscript.
