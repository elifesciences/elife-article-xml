They are thought to exert their therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases, modulation of NF-κB activity, and direct activation of AMPK. However, the full spectrum of their activities is incompletely understood. Here we show that salicylate specifically inhibits CBP and p300 lysine acetyltransferase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> by direct competition with acetyl-Coenzyme A at the catalytic site. We used a chemical structure-similarity search to identify another anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, that inhibits p300 more potently than salicylate. At concentrations attainable in human plasma after oral administration, both salicylate and diflunisal blocked the acetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins in cells. Finally, we found that diflunisal suppressed the growth of p300-dependent leukemia cell lines expressing AML1-ETO fusion protein <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results highlight a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of action for salicylate and derivative drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11156.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11156.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11156.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>People have been using a chemical called salicylate, which was once extracted from willow tree bark, as medicine for pain, fever and inflammation since ancient Greece. Aspirin is derived from salicylate but is a more potent drug. Aspirin exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by shutting down the activity of proteins that would otherwise boost inflammation. Aspirin achieves this by releasing a chemical marker, called an acetyl group, to be added to these proteins via a process known as protein acetylation. However, salicylate cannot trigger protein acetylation and so it was not clear how it reduces inflammation.</p><p>An anti-diabetes drug that is converted into salicylate in the body reduces inflammation by inhibiting a protein called NF-κB. In 2001, a group of researchers reported that NF-κB becomes active when an enzyme called p300 adds an acetyl group to it. This raised the question: does salicylate reduce inflammation by blocking, instead of triggering, protein acetylation.</p><p>Now, Shirakawa et al. – who include a researcher involved in the 2001 study – show that salicylate does indeed block the activity of the p300 enzyme. Shirakawa et al. then searched a database looking for drugs that have salicylate as part of their molecular structure. The search led to a drug called diflunisal, which was even more effective at blocking p300 in laboratory tests.</p><p>Some cancers, including a blood cancer, rely on p300 to grow; diflunisal was shown to stop this kind of cancer cell from growing, both in the laboratory and in mice. Together, the experiments suggest that salicylate and drugs that share some of its structure might represent useful treatments for certain cancers, as well as other diseases that involve the p300 enzyme.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11156.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11156.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>salicylate</kwd><kwd>diflunisal</kwd><kwd>histone acetyltransferase</kwd><kwd>acetylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI083139-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ott</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Shirakawa</surname><given-names>Kotaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCSF Gladstone Institute of Virology &amp; Immunology Center for AIDS research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIA 5T32AG000212-20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shirakawa</surname><given-names>Kotaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of California Berkeley Fogarty International AIDS Training Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shirakawa</surname><given-names>Kotaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001167</institution-id><institution>Larry L.

One of its widely used derivatives, acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin), inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis by irreversibly inactivating cyclooxygenases via non-enzymatic acetylation of a single serine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Warner et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, salicylic acid does not possess this acetylating activity (since it is lacking the acetyl group) and does not inhibit cyclooxygenase <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>However, salicylic acid blocks cyclooxygenase expression at the transcriptional level thereby explaining its anti-inflammatory properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, both salicylic acid and aspirin inhibit nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kopp and Ghosh, 1994</xref>) by inhibiting IκB kinase β (IKKβ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yin et al., 1998</xref>). Other possible mechanisms of action have been proposed that include JNK pathway inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwenger et al., 1997</xref>) and direct allosteric activation of AMP kinase (AMPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hawley et al., 2012</xref>). However, the pleiotropic effects of salicylate treatment on different cell types remain incompletely understood.</p><p>Salsalate, a salicylate precursor, is an effective therapy for type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldfine et al., 2010</xref>), a metabolic disorder associated with insulin resistance and a strong pro-inflammatory component dependent on NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donath and Shoelson, 2011</xref>). The efficacy of salicylates on insulin resistance is thought to reflect its anti-inflammatory activity and to be mediated by IKKβ inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yin et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, examination of the chemical structure of anacardic acid, a previously reported p300 inhibitor, revealed that it contained a salicylic acid moiety linked to a long alkyl chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balasubramanyam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sung et al., 2008</xref>). Previously, we showed that full activation of NF-κB activity requires the reversible acetylation of NF-κB by CBP/p300 histone acetyltransferases (HATs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we have tested the possibility that salicylic acid might exert its transcriptional inhibitory activity by directly affecting NF-κB acetylation via inhibition of CBP/p300 acetyltransferase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Salicylate inhibits CBP/p300 acetyltransferase activity by directly competing with acetyl-CoA <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To determine whether salicylate inhibits p300 and other acetyltransferases, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> acetylation assays with purified histones and a recombinant p300 catalytic domain.

A p300 HAT domain construct (residues 1279–1666) bearing an inactivating Tyr1467Phe mutation to facilitate purification of homogeneously hypoacetylated p300 was expressed and purified with an N-terminal 6-His tag from <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. The protein was further purified by chromatography and incubated with increasing concentrations of sodium salicylate for 30 min and with SYPRO orange dye (Invitrogen). Thermal melt curves were obtained by heating the protein from 20–95°C and monitoring fluorescence at 590 nm. This experiment revealed that the thermal unfolding temperature of p300/acetyl-CoA was 48.6°C, while treatment with 10 and 25 mM salicylate reduced the unfolding temperature to 46.1°C and 40.8°C, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Kinetic analysis of p300 acetyltransferase activity with various concentrations of acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and histone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) substrates revealed that salicylate exhibits direct competitive p300 inhibition against acetyl-CoA and noncompetitive inhibition against histones. Taking this data together, we surmised that salicylate inhibits p300 acetyltransferase activity by directly competing with acetyl-CoA binding near its binding site on CBP and p300.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Salicylate inhibits specific lysine acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins independently of AMPK activation</title><p>To determine whether salicylate induces histone deacetylation directly in cells, we treated HEK293T cells with various concentrations of salicylate.

To investigate a potential application of our newly characterized salicylate- and diflunisal-mediated inhibition of CBP/p300 activity, we tested the effects of various doses of salicylate and diflunisal on two AML1-ETO expressing cancer cell lines (human Kasumi-1 cells and a mouse AE9a-driven AML cell line that we generated). In support of our model, K24 and K43 acetylation of AML1-ETO were decreased in a dose-dependent manner by salicylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left) and by diflunisal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right). Salicylate inhibited cell proliferation at concentrations as low as 1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This growth inhibition was caused in part by increased apoptosis, as shown by annexin V/7AAD double staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Diflunisal also increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Additional measurements of nuclear DNA distribution showed a dose-dependent increase of the sub-G1 cell fraction, highly suggestive of apoptotic fragmentation by salicylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and diflunisal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We also noted an increased fraction of G1 cells and a decreased fraction of S and G2/M cells after salicylate treatment, consistent with reports that CBP/p300 is required for the G1/S transition (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Si-Ali et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iyer et al., 2007</xref>).

We also found that diflunisal, an FDA-approved drug containing a salicylic acid substructure, inhibited CBP/p300 more potently than salicylate. Both drugs inhibited p300-dependent AML-ETO leukemic cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, diflunisal and salicylate have promise as a oral therapy for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia associated with a t(8;21) translocation, an exciting potential application of our observations..</p><p>In plants, from where it was originally isolated, salicylate acts as an immune signal to induce systemic acquired resistance. It specifically activates the transcription cofactor NPR1 (nonexpressor of PR genes 1) by binding to its paralogs NPR3 and NPR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Since plants contain an ortholog of p300/CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bordoli et al., 2001</xref>), some of its activities in plants could also be mediated by inhibition of the plant ortholog of p300 or CBP.</p><p>In animals, salicylate is an extensively studied small compound widely used as an anti-inflammatory drug. Many mechanisms of action have been proposed for the anti-inflammatory effects of salicylate in mammalian cells, including weak inhibition of cyclooxygenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Warner et al., 1999</xref>), inhibition of IKKβ inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yin et al., 1998</xref>) and topoisomerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox et al., 2011</xref>), modulation of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kopp and Ghosh, 1994</xref>), and activation of AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hawley et al., 2012</xref>). The simple structure of salicylate might enable it to interact with different affinities with many cellular proteins, which could explain its pleiotropic effects. While we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the effects of salicylate on acetylation may derive in part from off-target effects, in addition to the direct interaction with CBP/p300 reported here, our study demonstrate a direct inhibition of p300 and CBP by salicylate, diflunisal and their metabolites (see discussion below).</p><p>We observed that the acetylation of both histones and non-histone proteins (NF-κB) is suppressed in cells treated with either salicylate or diflunisal. We identified histone AcH3K56 as the most sensitive histone acetyl mark to inhibition by both drugs. This results is highly consistent with the literature showing that CBP (also known as Nejire) in flies and CBP and p300 in humans acetylate H3K56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2009</xref>). We also note that the pattern of histone marks inhibition are remarkably similar between the two drugs, but at different concentrations in agreement with their relative abilities to inhibit p300/CBP <italic>in vitro</italic>. In terms of what is observed for the other histone aceylated sites, the situation is more complex. Indeed, many histone modifications are regulated by multiple HAT enzymes. For example, acetyl H4K5 is regulated by HAT1, CBP, p300, Tip60, HB01 whereas acetyl H3 K14 is regulated by CBP, p300, PCAF, gcn5, ScSAS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). We therefore interpret the observed lack of inhibition of some histone H3 or H4 acetylation sites by salicylate or diflunisal to reflect the compensating activities or other histone acetyltransferases that target the same sites.</p><p>We also observed inhibition of NF-κB acetylation by both salicylate and diflunisal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). The NF-κB subunit RelA is acetylated on lysines 218, 221, and 310 and these modifications are required for full NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2002</xref>). Therefore, salicylate’s NF-κB inhibitory effect can be at least partly explained by p300 inhibition. AMPK is reported to inhibit p300 acetyltransferase activity by phosphorylating p300 at serine 89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that AMPK activation by allosteric salicylate binding might inhibit p300 indirectly. However, our findings clearly showed that salicylate does not inhibit p300 by activating AMPK since the p300 inhibition is insensitive to an AMPK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our findings suggest that many of the pleiotropic effects of salicylate on different cell types and in diseases, including leukemia, are mediated by specific inhibition of CBP/p300 acetyltransferase activity, leading to deacetylation of histones and non-histone proteins.</p><p>Interestingly, the IC<sub>50</sub> for p300 inhibition by both salicylic acid and diflunisal was significantly lower in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) than in HAT assays <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A number of mechanisms discussed below could account for these differences.</p><p>First, AMPK activation in cells might enhance the p300 inhibitory effect of salicylate in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Second, we have also observed that short-term treatment of cells with salicylate or diflunisal is associated with a decreased in the expression p300 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). This phenomenon is accentuated when cells are treated longer with salicylate or diflunisal (data not shown). Other molecules have been shown to induce p300 degradation through the activation of different signaling transduction cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Li, 2011</xref>) and the autoacetylation of p300 is important for its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>). While we have not further explored this interesting observation here, we could envisage a mechanism by which inhibition of p300 autoacetylation would both contribute to the inactivation of the enzyme but also to a change in its stability.</p><p>Third, metabolism of salicylic acid and diflunisal may also contribute to increased cellular potency <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, we have found that salicyl-CoA, a known major intermediate of salicylate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knights et al., 2007</xref>), inhibits CBP/p300 with 28-fold increased potency in comparison with salicylate: IC<sub>50</sub>=220 μM for salicyl-CoA vs 6.12 mM for salicylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A similar 52-fold increase in potency is observed with diflunisal-CoA in comparison to diflunisal: IC<sub>50</sub>=20 μM for diflunisal-CoA vs 1.05 mM for diflunisal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although further investigation will be required to understand the relative contribution of both salicylic acid, diflunisal and their metabolites to the novel <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of salicylate reported here, these observations provide a potential mechanistic basis for the potent cell-based effects of these compounds.</p><p>Fourth, it should be noted that a fragment of p300 consisting of its HAT domain is used in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and in all other published studies using recombinant p300 protein. It is possible that the sensitivity of this subdomain to salicylate inhibition might be significantly different from the full-length protein present in cells.</p><p>Most of the non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, although they vary in their relative potencies against the two isozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Patrignani et al., 1997</xref>). However, salicylate does not, unlike its acetylated derivative aspirin, inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vane, 1971</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vargaftig, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mitchell et al., 1993</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cromlish and Kennedy, 1996</xref>). However, salicylate has been shown to exert a comparable analgesic and anti-inflammatory action as aspirin. Salicylates have been proposed to exert their pharmacological effects via inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor NF-|B and other targets. In these experimental systems, the concentrations used were in the same range as used in the experiments described in our paper (5–20 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kopp and Ghosh, 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pierce et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oeth and Mackman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwenger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">1999</xref>).</p><p>Further, it should also be noted that salicylate plasma concentrations in patients taking salicylic acid (3–4 g/day) range between 1–3 mM, a concentration at which partial inhibition of p300/CBP is observed. These data are therefore consistent with the proposed model that partial or complete inhibition of p300 by salicylate represents one of its relevant biological targets. It is important to note that a small molecule the size of salicylic acid used at such high concentrations is expected to interact with a number of cellular proteins and that our discovery that salicylic acid targets p300 does not imply that previous targets are not also part of the cellular response to these drugs.</p><p>Several other FDA-approved drugs with substructures similar to that of salicylate also directly inhibited p300 acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The salicylate substructure is now identified in three HAT inhibitors, including anacardic acid (6-nonadecyl salicylic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balasubramanyam et al., 2003</xref>), salicylic acid and diflunisal and might therefore represent an important scaffold for developing new p300 inhibitors.</p><p>Recently, p300 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for respiratory diseases, HIV infection, metabolic diseases, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dekker and Haisma, 2009</xref>). Indeed, our findings show that salicylate and the related compound diflunisal exhibit anti-tumor activity against a specific leukemia carrying a t(8;21) translocation, a tumor previously reported to be dependent on p300 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). We have tested whether other NSAIDs, including acetaminophen and indomethacin, also inhibit p300 acetyltransferase <italic>in vitro</italic>, but did not detect any inhibitory activity (data not shown). Importantly, NSAIDs that lack p300 inhibitory activity failed to inhibit Kasumi-1 cells growth (data not shown).</p><p>These results identify a novel epigenetic therapeutic target for salicylate, the epigenetic regulator CBP/p300. Further efforts will focus on unraveling the relative roles of different cellular targets of salicylate, such as CBP/p300, cyclooxygenases, IKKβ, and AMPK. Our results also suggest that salicylate may be useful for treating inflammation, diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and other pathologies in which CBP/p300 has a critical role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> HAT assay</title><p>Recombinant HAT (1 mg), either p300, CBP, PCAF, or GCN5 (Enzo Life Sciences), and 10 µg of histones (Sigma) were incubated with sodium salicylate (Sigma) in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mM) at 30°C for 30 min and then with 0.1 mCi of <sup>14</sup>C acetyl-CoA at 30°C for 60 min.

Cells were grown at 37°C until they reached an optical density (600 nm) of 0.8, incubated with 0.5 mM IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) overnight at 18°C to induce protein expression, harvested, and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM ®-mercaptoethanol). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and applied to a Ni-NTA affinity column. The protein was eluted from the column with increasing concentrations of imidazole in lysis buffer (20–250 mM) and treated overnight with TEV protease to cleave the 6-His tag. The protein was further purified by passage through a HiTrap SP HP ion-exchange column and a size-exclusion Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol.</p><p>X-ray crystallography showed that the purified p300 HAT domain protein binds to acetyl-CoA or CoA (apparently from the bacterial cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maksimoska et al., 2014</xref>) In thermal stability experiments in a 384-well ABI plate (Applied Biosystems), the p300 HAT domain bound to acetyl-CoA/CoA was incubated with increasing concentrations of sodium salicylate for 30 min. The final concentration of p300 was 2 μM in reaction buffer (0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol). Then, 4 μl of a 1:200 dilution of stock SYPRO orange dye (Invitrogen) in reaction buffer was added to achieve a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Thermal melt curves were obtained by heating the protein from 20–95°C and monitoring fluorescence at 590 nm with a 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). All curves were obtained in triplicate and averaged.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Evaluation of NSAID-CoA metabolites as p300 inhibitors</title><p>Salicyl-CoA and diflunisal-CoA were synthesized from their parent carboxylic acids and HPLC purified according to previously reported methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Padmakumar et al., 1997</xref>).

P300 inhibition assays were performed using direct microfluidic mobility shift analysis as previously described. Briefly, p300 reaction mixture (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% Triton-X-100, 50 nM p300, 2 μM FITC-histone H4 peptide) was plated in 384-well plates and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 10 min. Reactions were initiated by addition of acetyl-CoA (final concentration = 5 μM), bringing the final assay volume to 30 μL. Assays were quenched after 10 min (&lt;15% product accumulation) by addition of 5 μL of 0.5 M neutral hydroxylamine and transferred to a Perkin-Elmer Lab-Chip EZ-Reader instrument for analysis. Separation conditions were: downstream voltage of −500 V, upstream voltage of −2500 V, and a pressure of −1.5 psi. Percent conversion was calculated by ratiometric measurement of substrate/product peak heights. Percent activity represents the percent conversion of KAT reactions treated with inhibitors relative to untreated control KAT reactions, and corrected for nonenzymatic acetylation. Dose-response analysis of p300 inhibition was performed in triplicate and analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression fit to Y = 100/(1 + 10∧(Log IC50 – X)*H), where H = Hill slope (variable). IC50 values represent the concentration that inhibits 50% of KAT activity.

This finding is surprising but also important for several reasons. First, salicylate is widely known for its anti-inflammatory property by targeting mainly COX1/2 and other proteins. The finding that this molecule also acts on CBP/p300 adds another functionally important target to appreciate the role of salicylate. Second, the Nimer lab previously showed the importance of CBP/p300 for the survival of ETO AML and herein demonstrated that salicylate and diflunisal are effective against ETO AML at the dose relevant to depletion of several acetylation marks.

It seems that the authors solely based on the observation that diflunisal is structurally similar to salicylate and then concluded that the two compounds act via the same modes of mechanism. The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, 1C</xref> and in particular 2B, C and D should be performed for diflunisal as well.</p><p>2) For the efficiency of the two compounds against ETO AML, it is not clear whether the effect is achieved by targeting CBP/p300 alone or other targets alone or multiple targets in a combined manner. If the latter are the case, the flow of the work will be disrupted and the impact of the work will be significantly dampened (the potential target(s) of the therapeutic outcome of the two compounds were not CBP/p300). The reviewer strongly feels that the rescue experiments with wild-type and catalytically dead p300 should be carried out at a cellular level in parallel with the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (required) and even better for the animal experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Shirakawa et al. assess salicylate derivatives as potential p300/CBP HAT inhibitors based on the fact that other recently developed HAT inhibitors contain a salicylic acid moiety. They first show that salicylate inhibits p300/CBP Hat activity in vitro with an IC<sub>50</sub> in the 10 mM range. They show that they can inhibit some, but not other histone modifications that are known to be a result of p300/CBP in cells. They go on to identify the small molecule diflunisal as a Hat inhibitor and show that it can inhibit acetylation of AML1-ETO and growth in mice. The data are of interest but there are significant issues regarding specificity of mechanism.</p><p>1) The IC<sub>50</sub> of 10mM for salicylate seems high. Can the authors put this into some context as to the concentrations at which salicylate works against other targets?</p><p>2) The fact that salicylate inhibits acetylation of specific histone residues is interesting, but the fact that not all p300/CBP dependent modifications are inhibited is concerning in terms of mechanism. The authors explain this by potential redundant enzymes. Anything that can be done here to help explain this result would be very helpful.</p><p>3) A significant concern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is that the in vitro IC<sub>50</sub> for diflunisal is that the in vitro IC<sub>50</sub> is 1mM and the cellular half-maximal inhibition is 100µM. Can this be explained? It seems strange that the IC<sub>50</sub> in cells would be less than the IC<sub>50</sub> in vitro.</p><p>4) The data on inhibition of AML1-ETO cell growth in vitro and in vivo is of interest, however there still remains a specificity issue. The authors need to test growth inhibition on other cell lines without AML1_ETO rearrangement or show that indeed inhibition of AML1-ETO acetylation is the reason for the antiproliferative effect. Also, there needs to be assessment of inhibition of acetylation in the leukemia cells in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The IC<sub>50</sub> of salicylate for p300/CBP seems to be too high to be specific for HAT/KATs. The authors should show the specificity, using in vivo acetylation of nonhistone substrate, such as p53 acetylation by p300/CBP and PCAF (specific commercial antibodies are available).</p><p>Is it really inhibiting KAT activity in the animal system? The authors may consider to feed the animal (mice) and do immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of liver tissue.</p><p>Inhibition of cancer progress has been claimed by the authors. The data is quite convincing. Is it possible to show that it is due the inhibition of p300/CBP KAT activity by salicylate?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled, &quot;Salicylate and diflunisal are CBP/p300 inhibitors with anticancer activity,&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. Please note that the reviewers have requested modifications in the text that need to be implemented before the manuscript can be accepted. We have included the reviewers' comments below for you and look forward to receiving your revised manuscript and the rebuttal letter fully addressing the reviewers' comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The revised paper addressed the most of the previous concerns. In particular, the new model of the formation of &quot;salicyl-CoA&quot; and &quot;diflunisal-CoA&quot;, if they are indeed the cases, may explain many conflicting data in vitro. However, for such situations, the in vitro biochemical data may not be relevant anymore to evaluate these compounds because they will act differently upon the formation of CoA-adduct. In contrast, the weak interaction of salicyl or diflunisal only argues that HATs contain binding pockets to accommodate these moieties. The reviewer strongly suggests revising the wording of &quot;salicyl or diflunisal as inhibitors of HATs)&quot; into &quot;HATs contain the binding pockets of salicyl or diflunisal to engage the corresponding interaction in vitro and in cellular contexts&quot;. By this way, it leaves the possibility that salicyl or diflunisal may be subject to the formation of CoA-adduct and thus act as pro-drugs inside cells. The paper can even be further strengthened by showing the formation of &quot;salicyl-CoA&quot; and &quot;diflunisal-CoA&quot; in a cellular setting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is improved as a result of the new experiments provided. However, while the authors respond to all of the concerns by the reviewers, there is no evidence that these discussions made it into the manuscript. It would be helpful if the authors added some discussion in the manuscript that focus on the reviewers’ questions given it is likely readers will have the same questions.</p><p>Also, it is not clear why the authors did not expand their assessment of cell lines beyond Kasumi/AML1-ETO. This is not difficult and thus makes one wonder if the compound it toxic to many cell lines.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed most of reviewers’ concerns. I am satisfied with the revised version of the manuscript. It can be accepted for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11156.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>We urge you to consider the following additional efforts:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Perform further studies on the analysis of diflunisal to help explain the differences observed in its IC<sub>50</sub> in vivo and in vitro as this information would make the paper much stronger.</italic></p><p>We have conducted additional analysis of diflunisal as suggested. Overexpression of WT p300 suppressed the effect of diflunisal in a dose-dependent manner and increased H2B<sub>K12/K15</sub> acetylation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), but overexpression of catalytically inactive p300 mutants did not (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Diflunisal also suppressed acetylation of the nonhistone proteins NF-κB p65<sub>K310</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and p53<sub>K382</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Here also, Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, suppressed p-ACC accumulation in response to diflunisal, but did not inhibit deacetylation of acetylated H2B<sub>K12/K15</sub> or acetyl-p53<sub>K382</sub>, indicating that AMPK is not necessary for these effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These findings support the model that diflunisal also targets p300 acetyltransferase activity independently of AMPK.</p><p>Further, we have observed that salicylic acid/diflunisal metabolism may also contribute to the increased cellular potency observed in vivoin comparison to in vitro. Indeed, we have found that salicyl-CoA, a known major intermediate of salicylate metabolism (Knights, Sykes, and Miners 2007), inhibits CBP/p300 with 28-fold increased potency in comparison with salicylate: IC<sub>50</sub> =220 µM for salicyl-CoA vs. 6.12 mM for salicylate (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A similar 52-fold increase in potency is observed with diflunisal-CoA in comparison to diflunisal: IC<sub>50</sub> =20 µM for diflunisal-CoA vs. 1.05 mM for diflunisal (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although further investigation will be required to understand the relative contribution of these phenomena to the novel in vivoeffects of salicylate reported here, these observations provide a potential mechanistic basis for the potent cell-based effects of these compounds.</p><p><italic>2) Perform further studies to rule out off-target effects perhaps by characterizing one or two of the commonly known targets of diflunisal.</italic></p><p>As described above, during the revision of this manuscript, we have conducted additional experiments with overexpressed p300 to demonstrate that the effects of diflunisal are dependent on p300 when examining histone acetylation. We have also tested the effect of p300 overexpression on the anticancer effect of diflunisal on Kasumi cell lines using lentiviral expression vectors for p300 or empty control (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Cells transduced with the empty vector showed inhibition of growth by diflunisal, similar to untransduced cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In contrast, p300-transduced cells were significantly more resistant to diflunisal (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, H and I</xref>), and exhibit less apoptosis measured by annexin V positive cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) and sub-G1 fraction (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). These results support the model that diflunisal kills Kasumi-1 cells by apoptosis due to p300 inhibition.</p><p>With respect to the suggestion of other possible targets of diflunisal, a review of the literature indicates that the only other reported targets of diflunisal is prostaglandin synthetase, also known as cyclooxygenase (Br J Clin Pharmacol. 1977 Feb; 4 Suppl 1:15S-18S, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1981 Apr; 78(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">4</xref>): 2053-6.). In contrast to aspirin/acetylsalicylic acid, diflunisal does not covalently modify prostaglandin synthetase and probably acts at a site similar to aspirin since diflunisal inhibits acetylation of the enzyme by aspirin (Br J Clin Pharmacol. 1977 Feb; 4 Suppl 1:15S-18S).</p><p>The identification of p300 and CBP as novel targets for diflunisal and salicylic acid in addition to cyclooxygenase suggest that diflunisal and salicylic acid could have important novel activities such as inhibition of p300-dependent tumors, as we report here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>In this manuscript, Shirakawa and coworkers characterized salicylate and diflunisal as novel CBP/p300 inhibitors.

We have tested whether other NSAIDs, including acetaminophen and indomethacin, also inhibit p300 acetyltransferase in vitro, but did not detect any inhibitory activity (not shown). Diflunisal is a known COX-1/2 inhibitor with IC<sub>50</sub> of 113µM (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">13</xref>): 7563-8), but other NSAIDs that lack p300 inhibitory activity failed to inhibit Kasumi-1 cells growth (data not shown).

They first show that salicylate inhibits p300/CBP Hat activity in vitro with an IC<sub>50</sub> in the 10 mM range. They show that they can inhibit some, but not other histone modifications that are known to be a result of p300/CBP in cells. They go on to identify the small molecule diflunisal as a Hat inhibitor and show that it can inhibit acetylation of AML1-ETO and growth in mice. The data are of interest but there are significant issues regarding specificity of mechanism.</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The</italic> IC<sub>50</sub><italic>of 10mM for salicylate seems high. Can the authors put this into some context as to the concentrations at which salicylate works against other targets?</italic> </p><p>Most of the NSAIDs inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, although they vary in their relative potencies against the two isozymes (Patrignani, P., Panara, M. R., Sciulli, M. G., Santini, G., Renda, G., and Patrono, C. (1997) J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 48, 623–631). However, salicylate does not, unlike its acetylated derivative aspirin, inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 activity in vitro (Vane, J. R. (1971) Nature New Biol. 231, 232–235; Vargaftig, B. B. (1978) J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 30, 101– 104; Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1993 Dec 15; 90(24):11693-7; Cromlish, W.A., and Kennedy, B.P. (1996) Biochem.Pharmacol. 52, 1777–1785). However, salicylate has been shown to exert a comparable analgesic and anti-inflammatory action as aspirin. Salicylates have been proposed to exert their pharmacological effects via inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor NF-κB and other targets. In these experimental systems, the concentrations used were in the same range as used in the experiments described in our paper (5-20 mM) (Kopp, E., and Ghosh, S. (1994) Science265, 956–959 17; Pierce, J. W., Read, M. A., Ding, H., Luscinskas, F. W., and Collins, T. (1996) J.

Physiol179, 109–114).</p><p>It should also be noted that salicylate plasma concentrations in patients taking salicylic acid (3-4 g/day) range between 1-3 mM, a concentration at which partial inhibition of p300/CBP is observed. In addition, our inhibition data in cell lines show a lower IC<sub>50</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> ~5mM for H2B<sub>K12/15</sub>) and new data show that a salicylic acid metabolite, salicyl-CoA inhibits CBP/p300 with 28-fold increased potency in comparison with salicylate: IC<sub>50</sub> =220 μM for salicyl-CoA vs 6.12 mM for salicylate (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data are consistent with the proposed model that partial or complete inhibition of p300 by salicylate represents one of its relevant biological targets. It is important to note that a small molecule the size of salicylic acid used at such high concentrations is expected to interact with a number of cellular proteins. The observations presented in this manuscript support the hypothesis that some of the biological activities of salicylic acid and diflunisal are mediated via p300 inhibition.</p><p><italic>2) The fact that salicylate inhibits acetylation of specific histone residues is interesting, but the fact that not all p300/CBP dependent modifications are inhibited is concerning in terms of mechanism. The authors explain this by potential redundant enzymes. Anything that can be done here to help explain this result would be very helpful.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>, we identified histone AcH3K56 as the most sensitive histone acetyl mark to inhibition by both diflunisal and salicylate. This result is highly consistent with the literature showing that the histone acetyl transferase CBP (also known as Nejire) in flies and CBP and p300 in humans acetylate H3K56 (Das C, Lucia MS, Hansen KC, Tyler JK. CBP/p300-mediated acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56. Nature. 2009 May 7; 459 (7243): 113-7). We also note that the pattern of histone marks inhibition are remarkably similar between the two drugs, but at different concentrations in agreement with their relative abilities to inhibit p300/CBP in vitro. In terms of what is observed for the other sites, the situation is more complex. Indeed, many histone modifications are known to be regulated by a variety of HAT enzymes. For example, acetyl H4<sub>K5</sub> is regulated by HAT1, CBP, p300, Tip60, and HB01 whereas acetyl H3 K14 is regulated by CBP, p300, PCAF, gcn5, and ScSAS3 (Cell128 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">4</xref>): 693-705.). We interpret the observed lack of inhibition of histone H3 or H4 acetylation by salicylate or diflunisal to reflect the compensating activities or other histone acetyltransferases that target the same sites.</p><p><italic>3) A significant concern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is that the in vitro</italic> IC<sub>50</sub><italic>for diflunisal is that the in vitro</italic> IC<sub>50</sub><italic>is 1mM and the cellular half-maximal inhibition is 100µM. Can this be explained? It seems strange that the</italic> IC<sub>50</sub><italic>in cells would be less than the</italic> IC<sub>50</sub><italic>in vitro.</italic> </p><p>We think that two distinct mechanism account for this difference. First, as we have discussed in detail in our response to reviewer #1 above, we have repeatedly observed that both salicylic acid and diflunisal treatment lead to the degradation of p300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3F</xref>) indicating that the drugs work both by direct inhibition of the enzyme and drug-induced target degradation. Second, we have also observed that the diflunisal-CoA shows a 52-fold increase in potency in comparison to diflunisal: IC<sub>50</sub> =20 µM for diflunisal-CoA vs. 1.05 mM for diflunisal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We speculate that these mechanisms might explain the discrepancy.</p><p><italic>4) The data on inhibition of AML1-ETO cell growth in vitro and in vivo is of interest, however there still remains a specificity issue. The authors need to test growth inhibition on other cell lines without AML1_ETO rearrangement or show that indeed inhibition of AML1-ETO acetylation is the reason for the antiproliferative effect. Also, there needs to be assessment of inhibition of acetylation in the leukemia cells in vivo.</italic></p><p>As we discuss above, Kasumi cells dependency on p300 for tumorigenesis has been well characterized by the Nimer lab (Science. 2011 Aug 5; 333 (6043): 765-9). We have tested whether other NSAIDs, including acetaminophen and indomethacin, also inhibit p300 acetyltransferase in vitro, but did not detect any inhibitory activity (not shown). Diflunisal is a known COX-1/2 inhibitor with IC<sub>50</sub> of 113µM (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA96 (13): 7563-8), but other NSAIDs that lack p300 inhibitory activity failed to inhibit Kasumi-1 cells growth (data not shown). Further, we have also tested the effect of p300 overexpression on the anticancer effect of diflunisal on Kasumi cell lines using lentiviral expression vectors for p300 or empty control (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Cells transduced with the empty vector showed inhibition of growth by diflunisal, similar to untransduced cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In contrast, p300-transduced cells were significantly more resistant to diflunisal (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, H and I</xref>), and exhibit less apoptosis measured by annexin V positive cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) and sub-G1 fraction (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). These results collectively support the model that diflunisal inhibits Kasumi-1 cells due to p300 inhibition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The IC<sub>50</sub> of salicylate for p300/CBP seems to be too high to be specific for HAT/KATs.

Is it possible to show that it is due the inhibition of p300/CBP KAT activity by salicylate?</italic></p><p>Direct demonstration that inhibition of p300/CBP KAT activity in the context of tumor growth in vivo would have required the generation of multiple clonal cell lines overexpressing p300 and control cell lines with the empty vector, their characterization (for stability of p300 expression etc…) and a large number of xenograft experiments showing that overexpression of p300 in vivo suppresses the ability of diflunisal to inhibit tumor growth. Given the short time allowed for resubmission, we elected to conduct this experiment on Kasumi cells in vitro. The results presented in our revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and 4I</xref> show that p300 overexpression increases cell line growth in vitro and suppresses the ability of diflunisal to inhibit cell growth. These important experiments support the model that p300 is critical for the inhibitory effect of diflunisal on the growth of Kasumi cells.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>The revised paper addressed the most of the previous concerns. In particular, the new model of the formation of &quot;salicyl-CoA&quot; and &quot;diflunisal-CoA&quot;, if they are indeed the cases, may explain many conflicting data in vitro. However, for such situations, the in vitro biochemical data may not be relevant anymore to evaluate these compounds because they will act differently upon the formation of CoA-adduct. In contrast, the weak interaction of salicyl or diflunisal only argues that HATs contain binding pockets to accommodate these moieties. The reviewer strongly suggests revising the wording of &quot;salicyl or diflunisal as inhibitors of HATs)&quot; into &quot;HATs contain the binding pockets of salicyl or diflunisal to engage the corresponding interaction in vitro and in cellular contexts&quot;. By this way, it leaves the possibility that salicyl or diflunisal may be subject to the formation of Co-A adduct and thus act as pro-drugs inside cells. The paper can even be further strengthened by showing the formation of &quot;salicyl-CoA&quot; and &quot;diflunisal-CoA&quot; in a cellular setting.</italic></p><p>We have modified the title of the manuscript in the following manner: “Salicylate, diflunisal <italic>and their metabolites</italic> inhibit CBP/p300 and exhibit anticancer activity”.
