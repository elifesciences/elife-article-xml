an organ's cell types and understanding of physiologic function is paramount. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing to examine heterogeneity of murine pancreatic duct cells, pancreatobiliary cells, and intrapancreatic bile duct cells. We describe an epithelial-mesenchymal transitory axis in our three pancreatic duct subpopulations and identify osteopontin as a regulator of this fate decision as well as human duct cell dedifferentiation. Our results further identify functional heterogeneity within pancreatic duct subpopulations by elucidating a role for geminin in accumulation of DNA damage in the setting of chronic pancreatitis. Our findings implicate diverse functional roles for subpopulations of pancreatic duct cells in maintenance of duct cell identity and disease progression and establish a comprehensive road map of murine pancreatic duct cell, pancreatobiliary cell, and intrapancreatic bile duct cell homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>pancreatic duct ligation</kwd><kwd>Osteopontin</kwd><kwd>Geminin</kwd><kwd>duct heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 CA221114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hendley</surname><given-names>Audrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002135</institution-id><institution>Hirshberg Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seed Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hendley</surname><given-names>Audrey M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA222862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collisson</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA172045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hebrok</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014547</institution-id><institution>Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICI Opportunity Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hebrok</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010324</institution-id><institution>UCSF Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UCSF Bakar ImmunoX Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Arjun A</given-names></name><name><surname>Fragiadakis</surname><given-names>Gabriela K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses and functional studies define heterogeneity within the pancreatic ductal tree and unique properties of subpopulations of duct cells including an epithelial-mesenchymal transcriptomic axis and roles in chronic pancreatic inflammation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic duct cells, while a minority of the composition of the pancreas, play an integral role in secretion and transport of digestive fluid containing proenzymes synthesized by acinar cells, electrolytes, mucins, and bicarbonate. They can serve as a cell of origin for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple other diseases including cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilschanski and Novak, 2013</xref>) and pancreatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apte et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Heterogeneity of a cell type becomes increasingly important in the context of disease and regeneration since different subpopulations can be the driving forces behind pathogenesis. The function of exocrine pancreatic cells is required for survival, yet these cells exhibit limited regenerative capabilities in response to injury. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. The underlying mechanisms for PDA progression in CP patients are incompletely understood and are likely multifactorial, including both genetic and environmental insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Etemad and Whitcomb, 2001</xref>). Studies have shown that cytokines and reactive oxygen species generated during chronic inflammation can cause DNA damage. It has been hypothesized that pancreatic cells might acquire DNA damage in the protooncogene <italic>KRAS</italic> or tumor suppressor genes <italic>TP53</italic> or <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, thereby accelerating malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Whitcomb and Greer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dhar et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms by which DNA damage occurs in the setting of CP. Duct obstruction is one cause of CP, and the ability of ductal cells to acquire DNA damage in the setting of CP is incompletely understood.</p><p>In this report, we conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on homeostatic murine pancreatic duct, intrapancreatic bile duct, and pancreatobiliary cells using a DBA<sup>+</sup> lectin sorting strategy, and present a high-resolution atlas of these murine duct cells. By extensively comparing our subpopulations to previously reported mouse and human pancreatic duct subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qadir et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grün et al., 2016</xref>), we both corroborate several previous findings and identify and validate novel duct cell heterogeneity with unique functional properties including roles for subpopulation markers in CP. Our findings suggest that multiple duct subpopulations retain progenitor capacity, which is influenced by expression of markers driving subpopulation identity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scRNA-seq identifies multiple pancreas cell types with DBA lectin sorting</title><p>Previously reported subpopulations of murine pancreatic duct cells were identified by single-cell analysis of pancreatic cells obtained using an islet isolation procedure; thus, exocrine duct cells were of low abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baron et al., 2016</xref>). To circumvent this issue, we employed a DBA lectin sorting strategy that has been extensively used to isolate and characterize all murine pancreatic duct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reichert et al., 2013</xref>), to investigate murine duct heterogeneity. We isolated live DBA<sup>+</sup> cells from the pancreata of four adult female C57BL/6J littermates and performed scRNA-seq on the pooled cells using the 10X Genomics platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After filtering out doublets and low-quality cells (defined by low transcript counts), our dataset contained 6813 cells. Clustering analysis identified 16 distinct cell populations with an average of 5345 transcripts per cell and 1908 genes per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Our dataset comprises 2 populations of ductal cells, a cluster of endothelial cells, 1 cluster of fibroblasts, and 12 immune cell clusters.

We identified DBA<sup>+</sup>Collagen I<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts and DBA<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+</sup> immune cells by immunofluorescence (IF). CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells are not DBA<sup>+</sup>.

A static transcriptional picture in time has highlighted a very dynamic view of pancreas duct cell heterogeneity. Our study provokes reinterpretation of several previously published lineage tracing reports using ductal-specific Cre mouse lines and will help plan future lineage tracing studies.</p><p>Cluster 0 workhorse pancreatic duct cells comprise the largest pancreatic duct subpopulation identified. Although clusters 0 and 2 share many markers, we found compelling differences in metabolic states as manifested in part by an overall lower gene and transcript count for cluster 2. IPA suggested that subpopulations of pancreatic duct cells may use different predominant mechanisms for bicarbonate secretion such as CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishiguro et al., 2009</xref>) for cluster 0 and calcium signaling for cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ishiguro et al., 2012</xref>). One notable difference between clusters 0 and 2 vs. 1 is the molecules that regulate the xenobiotic metabolism CAR signaling pathway.

These genes play central roles in homeostasis of pancreatic duct cells, and it is possible that distinct ductal cell subpopulations that are actively expressing these pathways may have different predispositions to PDA with mutations in these genes, heterogeneity which may also contribute to the development of different subtypes of PDA.</p><p>The role of <italic>Spp1</italic> in homeostatic pancreatic duct cells has been elusive since <italic>Spp1</italic> KO mice have no apparent pancreatic duct phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kilic et al., 2006</xref>).

Taken together, these phenotypes, along with upregulation of pathways regulating mammalian development (Notch signaling and Hox genes) manifested by GSEA, suggest that <italic>SPP1</italic> loss promotes human duct cell dedifferentiation.</p><p>During pancreas development, the multipotent epithelial progenitors become increasingly compartmentalized into tip and trunk progenitors that give rise to acinar and endocrine/ductal cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>).

We were unable to detect DNA damage with Geminin loss in homeostatic pancreatic duct cells, which may be due to the low proliferation rate of pancreatic duct cells and/or the presence of compensatory mechanisms with redundant function, such as ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CDT1 at the time of replication licensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arias and Walter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kerns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li and Blow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maiorano et al., 2005</xref>). Compensatory mechanisms are not sufficient to rescue the effects of Geminin loss in pancreatic duct cells in the context of CP, the result of which is accumulation of sustained DNA damage evident by γ-H2AX, but not ATR labeling. It has been previously reported that ATR is activated in Geminin-depleted colon cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin and Dutta, 2007</xref>).

The R package Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Satija et al., 2015</xref>) was used to process the unique molecular identifier count matrix and perform data normalization (gene expression measurements for each cell were normalized by total expression, and log-transformed), dimensionality reduction, clustering, duct cell isolation, and differential expression analyses. We identified three clusters enriched in genes from two different cell types including (1) acinar and T cell, (2) acinarand macrophage, and (3) acinar and duct cell. Because our dataset does not contain a population of acinar cells (they are not DBA<sup>+</sup>), doublet detector algorithms will not remove acinar cell doublets from our dataset. Based on this reasoning, we removed these clusters containing a high threshold level of expression of acinar cell genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of <italic>Gmnn</italic> conditional floxed allele</title><p>The general strategy to achieve Cre recombinase-mediated conditional gene ablation was to flank exons 3 and 4 of <italic>Mus musculus Gmnn</italic> by loxP sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The arms of homology for the targeting construct were amplified from BAC clone RP23-92G13 by PCR with high-fidelity Taq polymerase. One primer contained a loxP site and a single SphI site, which was used to verify the presence of the loxP site associated with it. Finally, the selectable cassette <italic>CMV-hygro-TK</italic> was incorporated into the targeting vector. The selectable marker itself was flanked by two additional loxP sites generating a targeting vector containing three loxP sites. Such a strategy allows the generation of ES cells with both a KO allele and a conditional KO allele after Cre-mediated removal of the selection cassette <italic>in vitro</italic>. The targeting vector was sequenced to guarantee sequence fidelity of exons 3–4 and the proper unidirectional orientation of the three loxP sites. The complete left arm of homology was about 3,200 bp in length, and the right arm of homology was 2,100 bp in length.</p><p>V6.5 ES cells were electroporated (25 µF, 400V) with the three loxP sites-containing targeting construct, and hygromycin selection was performed to identify correctly targeted ES cells. Successfully targeted ES cells (3loxP) were identified with Southern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These 3loxP ES cells were then electroporated with a Cre-expressing plasmid and counter-selected with ganciclovir. ES cells that contained either one loxP or two loxP sites, respectively, were identified by Southern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). An ES cell clone was chosen that carried the conditional KO allele (two loxP sites flanking exons 3 and 4) and was used for blastocyst injections to generate chimeric founder mice. <italic>Gmnn<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice displayed normal litter sizes.

The DNA was transferred to a Hybond-XL membrane (GE-Healthcare) in a custom transfer setup. Before assembly, the agarose gel was treated for 15 min in depurination solution (21.5 ml 37% HCl in 1L H<sub>2</sub>O), briefly rinsed in H<sub>2</sub>O, and then soaked in denaturing solution (20 g NaOH pellets, 87.6 g NaCl in 1 l H<sub>2</sub>O) for 30 min. After transfer, the DNA was crosslinked to the membrane with UV light. The PCR-amplified external Southern blot probes were labeled with <sup>32</sup>P using the Prime-It II Random Primer Labeling kit from Stratagene. After hybridization of the probe and washing of the membrane, Kodak MS film was exposed to it and subsequently developed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Mice</title><p>NSG mice from Jackson Labs (Stock 005557) were used.

Their analysis unveils important heterogeneity within the pancreatic ductal populations and identifies unique cellular states. Overall, the results presented here suggest there are distinct functional roles for subpopulations of ductal cells in the maintenance of duct cell identity that could have broader implications for chronic pancreatic inflammation. Furthermore, the detailed analysis of the pancreatic subpopulations could also be relevant in the context of cancer biology and provides novel information that may help in elucidating the transition from pancreatitis to pancreatic cancer and/or different predispositions to cancer.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single cell transcriptome analysis defines heterogeneity of the murine pancreatic ductal tree&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The extensive text describing the gene expression analyses and the different clusters should be streamlined to emphasize the take home message. This could be accompanied by a schematic figure that includes representative genes in each cluster. There should also be more limited &quot;conclusions&quot; made from the gene expression data; many of these are overstated.</p><p>2. Provide additional data to support the presence of an &quot;EMT axis&quot; or downplay this conclusion.</p><p>3. Provide rationale for choosing Anxa3, SPP1 and Geminin for further analysis and indicate why analysis Anxa3 wasn't pursued further. Also several other genes were mentioned in this section with reasoning as to why they weren't pursued further, but it isn't clear why they were chosen in the first place.</p><p>4. As indicated by reviewer 2, there are several parts of the text that should include rationale for the experiments. For instance, choice of cell line, etc.</p><p>5. Although a lot of effort went into generating the mutant models for functional analyses of SPP1 and Geminin, the analysis is incomplete. In their current form, the phenotypes of the different mutants show potential, but the analysis is still incomplete. The authors should acknowledge this and indicate that future experiments will be necessary to fully understand their roles.</p><p>6. The proliferation analysis of the KO HPDE lines is not convincing and the authors should provide cell counting over a time course.</p><p>7. Improve the IF staining as indicated by reviewer 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

Although a lot of effort went into generating the mutant models for functional analyses of SPP1 and Geminin, the analysis is incomplete seem to be added as an afterthought at the end of the study. In their current form, the phenotypes of the different mutants show potential, but the analysis is too incomplete and actually compromise the first half of the paper. The authors should either flesh out one of the studies or remove them from the paper.</p><p>5. The proliferation analysis of the KO HPDE lines is not convincing – the authors would need to provide cell counting over a time course.</p><p>6. Additional quantification for all of the experiments is required. For SPP, the number of Ngn3/<italic>Sox9</italic> cells and endocrine cells formed vs exocrine. For Geminin, the percent of cells showing H2AX loci should be quantified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The expression profile of Kcn3 and Sparc does not appear to correlate well with cluster 2 (figure 2C).</p><p>2. IPA analyses are presented selectively eg for cluster 2 arginine metabolism pathways are mentioned but not cysteine metabolism which shows stronger p-value. In any case, these are all speculations and as such they are not appropriate for main figures (figure 2D).</p><p>3. The authors suggest that cluster 5 of cycling cells represents cells of clusters 3 and 4 but the distance in the UMAP from cluster 4 and the poor Pearson correlation (figure 3B) do not support the relationship with cluster 4. Also the pseudo-temporal ordering suggested that clusters 3 and 5 are not related to the other clusters.</p><p>4. The authors write in the beginning of the 2nd paragraph in page 9 : 'Our analysis thus far has identified and validated multiple transcriptional programs.… ´. This is a clear over interpretation – bioinformatics analysis alone cannot validate transcriptional programs.</p><p>5. Functional analyses of some marker genes was undertaken using immortalized HPDE cells (page 9). Apart from the general concern for the validity of results using immortalized cell lines, it is not explained what is the rationale for selecting this particular cell line and why Anxa3 was selected. It is also not clear why they mention here that PAH and WFDC3 are not expressed in this cell line. If these genes are important should they not be analyzed in another context ?</p><p>6. It is mentioned that SPP1 knockout lines had prominent filopodia but this is not shown or commented upon – what does it mean ? There is evidence from the RNA Seq for EMT and it will be essential if the authors further establish that by immunofluorescence analyses.</p><p>7. The evidence for increased proliferation of SPP1 KO lines is not strong enough. The CGT assays detect endogenous ATP levels and such increase does not necessarily mean increased cell proliferation. Similarly, increased relative spheroid size does not mean much if it is accompanied by a reduction in the number of spheroids. Cell counts at successive passages would be necessary.</p><p>8. Even if there is increase in the proliferation rate of this transformed line as well as taking into account the RNA seq data, the conclusion that loss of SPP1 leads to a progenitor like state is not warranted. Nothing is mentioned on the expression at the transcript or protein level of established markers such as eg NKX6.1, PDX1, HNF3B etc. These are straightforward experiments to bolster the analysis.</p><p>9. The authors proceed with further analysis of two of the four knock out SPP1 lines. The criteria for selecting these two are not clear.</p><p>10. The authors attempt to document SPP1 downregulation, changes in Vimentin and CK19 expression by immunofluorescence (figure 6J, K). Controls (scr gRNA) are shown in different magnification than knock down lines. This makes it harder to document changes and it is questionable practice. I am not convinced by the claim for changes in SPP1 and Vimentin expression for either of the two lines. Regarding CK19, only one of the two stainings appears convincing. This is problematic particularly regarding SPP1 – this is supposed to be a nearly complete KO (figure 6B). It may be a matter of levels in which case IF is not appropriate. Flow cytometry profiles could resolve this.</p><p>11. The differentiation potential of SPP1 knocked out cells was then tested five days after subcutaneous transplantation by immunofluorescence. The Glucagon and Ngn3 stainings are not convincing. Also, whereas there appear to be several C-pep+ cells the NkX6.1+ and PDX1+ among them are very scarce. This would not be expected from a differentiation into genuine b cells.</p><p>12. Geminin is expressed in very few ductal cells even after PDL (0.05%, figure 8B). It is not explained what are the quantitated ´γ-H2AX+ foci´. Do these correspond to γ-H2AX +cells ? It should be stated clearly; what is the % of cells that are γ-H2AX+ ?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Few concerns that should be addressed are listed below:</p><p>– Some of immunofluorescence (IF) staining experiments could be optimized and replaced with better image qualities. For instance, in Figure 7E Pdx1+ cells are not visible in the transplanted HPDE cells stained for Synaptophysin/Pdx1/C-peptide. Similarly, in the IF on human pancreatic tissue (see Figure 8A) the distribution of Geminin is not clearly visible. The IF should be repeated and the images showing the individual channels should be included?</p><p>– The study reports some interesting observations on the pancreatobiliary and intrapancreatic bile duct cells. It would be helpful to include spatial characterization of these cells or a schematics to indicate the location of these populations. Are they only in the intrapancreatic bile common duct?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67776.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have retained the points we believe are important including those which are referenced in the Discussion section as well as remarks that necessarily reference the figure panels, datasets, and tables in chronological order. We retained a longer description of cluster 4 as we believe the points are important to annotate this population as pancreatobiliary cells. We have also provided additional data to support several bioinformatics analyses as detailed below. Additionally, we tried to modify the language regarding the bioinformatics analyses that is not supported with experiments to reflect speculation rather than conclusions. As requested, we have included a new schematic word cloud of the top differentially expressed genes in each duct cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Provide additional data to support the presence of an &quot;EMT axis&quot; or downplay this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the data supporting the EMT axis, which was limited to the CK19 and Vimentin co-IF in Figure 5F, could be strengthened. We examined additional EMT markers in human and mouse ductal cells and found heterogenous expression of SNAI1 and fibronectin in both mouse and human ductal cells. Fibronectin was scarce while SNAI1 expression was abundant in both mouse and human duct cells. Due to lack of space in the figures in this part of the manuscript to add additional data, we included images for only the human duct cells for SNAI1 and fibronectin co-IF in Figure 5—figure supplement 1E.</p><p>With regards to <italic>SPP1</italic>, a gatekeeper of the EMT axis, we have provided additional evidence for EMT in the HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO lines.

Additional quantification for all of the experiments is required. For SPP, the number of Ngn3/Sox9 cells and endocrine cells formed vs exocrine. For Geminin, the percent of cells showing H2AX loci should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand and share the reviewer’s caution regarding the formation of cells with endocrine properties. We cautiously mention that a small subset of cells have an endocrine-like appearance demonstrating expression of NKX6.1, synaptophysin, PDX1, and c-peptide (Figure 7), while also noting that being able to demonstrate full transdifferentiation to mature endocrine cells would require functional and full transcriptome analyses that, due to the low number of such cells, are beyond the scope of this manuscript. We have included a quantification of the c-peptide/NKX6.1/PDX1 positive cells in Figure 7F that supports the notion of cells with endocrine potential forming while also indicating that these are rare events. The number of Ngn3/<italic>Sox9</italic> cells is also quite rare as indicated in the IF pictures in Figure 7. Considering that we provide quantification of the more relevant c-peptide/NKX6.1/PDX1 positive cells, we just mention the equally rare nature of the NGN3/SOX9 cells without quantification. Additionally, with regards to quantification of γ-H2AX foci in Geminin mutant samples, please see comment #12 from Reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The expression profile of Kcn3 and Sparc does not appear to correlate well with cluster 2 (figure 2C).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not describing the nature of Cluster 2 more clearly. Cluster 2 is characterized by low level or lack of expression of multiple ductal cell markers (<italic>Cftr</italic>, <italic>Kcne3</italic>, <italic>Sparc</italic>, <italic>Mmd2, Krt7</italic>) found in other clusters (Figure 2B-C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1G). Most markers in Cluster 2 are also present in Cluster 0 (please see Figure 3D). When comparing Clusters 0 vs 2, only 9 DEGs come up. None of these genes have an expression pattern specific for Cluster 2. Characterizing a cluster by lack of specific gene expression is something with precedent in the single cell sequencing field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. IPA analyses are presented selectively eg for cluster 2 arginine metabolism pathways are mentioned but not cysteine metabolism which shows stronger p-value. In any case, these are all speculations and as such they are not appropriate for main figures (figure 2D).</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the pathway analysis is not conclusive, but would argue that it provides important information regarding the diverse nature of the various clusters. Figure 2D shows the top 8 deregulated pathways when comparing a cluster to all other clusters using IPA. We have removed the mention of arginine metabolism for cluster 2 in the text, in an effort to streamline the extensive text describing the gene expression analyses and the different clusters as suggested by the editor and Reviewer #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors suggest that cluster 5 of cycling cells represents cells of clusters 3 and 4 but the distance in the UMAP from cluster 4 and the poor Pearson correlation (figure 3B) do not support the relationship with cluster 4. Also the pseudo-temporal ordering suggested that clusters 3 and 5 are not related to the other clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment and have removed this suggestion in an effort to streamline the extensive text describing the gene expression analyses and the different clusters as also suggested by the editor and Reviewer #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors write in the beginning of the 2nd paragraph in page 9 : 'Our analysis thus far has identified and validated multiple transcriptional programs.… ´.

We have reworded this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Functional analyses of some marker genes was undertaken using immortalized HPDE cells (page 9). Apart from the general concern for the validity of results using immortalized cell lines, it is not explained what is the rationale for selecting this particular cell line and why Anxa3 was selected. It is also not clear why they mention here that PAH and WFDC3 are not expressed in this cell line. If these genes are important should they not be analyzed in another context ?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see comment #3 from Essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It is mentioned that SPP1 knockout lines had prominent filopodia but this is not shown or commented upon – what does it mean ? There is evidence from the RNA Seq for EMT and it will be essential if the authors further establish that by immunofluorescence analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>The filipodia are evident in the higher magnification images in Figure 6D. We have added yellow arrows to make them clearly visible to the reader. In Figure 6E, we show increased proliferation in HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO cells when compared to HPDE6c7 scr gRNA cells. We mention filipodia in the manuscript because they are often prominent in migratory cells, serving as sensors of the environment and playing roles in cell migration and wound healing. The prominent filipodia in HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO cells hint at potentially enhanced migration, in addition to proliferation, and we plan to pursue follow up studies to better characterize the migratory features of these cell lines, which are out of the scope of this manuscript. Additionally, please see comment #2 from Essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The evidence for increased proliferation of SPP1 KO lines is not strong enough. The CGT assays detect endogenous ATP levels and such increase does not necessarily mean increased cell proliferation. Similarly, increased relative spheroid size does not mean much if it is accompanied by a reduction in the number of spheroids. Cell counts at successive passages would be necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment and have removed the CTG assays and spheroid data from the manuscript and replaced it with the requested cell counting experiment in Figure 6E. Additionally, many pathways involved in positive regulation of cell cycle signaling were identified in the GSEA analysis for HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO cell lines (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Even if there is increase in the proliferation rate of this transformed line as well as taking into account the RNA seq data, the conclusion that loss of SPP1 leads to a progenitor like state is not warranted. Nothing is mentioned on the expression at the transcript or protein level of established markers such as eg NKX6.1, PDX1, HNF3B etc. These are straightforward experiments to bolster the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up another important point. To strengthen our assessment of a progenitor-like state in HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO cell lines, we have performed qPCR for pancreatic progenitor markers <italic>Pdx1</italic>, <italic>Ptf1a</italic>, <italic>Gata4</italic>, <italic>Gata6</italic>, <italic>Prox1</italic>, <italic>Myt1</italic>, and <italic>Rxrg</italic> and added our analysis to Figure 6K. Towards support for a progenitor-like state for HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO cell lines, we also reference the GSEA analysis in Figure 6—figure supplement 1E-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The authors proceed with further analysis of two of the four knock out SPP1 lines. The criteria for selecting these two are not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid bias, the selection of HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO lines for experiments was random. All HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO lines display similar levels of <italic>SPP1</italic> knockdown (Figure 6B) and similar levels of gene expression for all genes, according to the normalized counts file for the RNA-seq data. When 2 or 3 lines are selected randomly for experiments, they show similar results; thus, we believe this selection criteria is unbiased, and a valid approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors attempt to document SPP1 downregulation, changes in Vimentin and CK19 expression by immunofluorescence (figure 6J, K). Controls (scr gRNA) are shown in different magnification than knock down lines. This makes it harder to document changes and it is questionable practice. I am not convinced by the claim for changes in SPP1 and Vimentin expression for either of the two lines. Regarding CK19, only one of the two stainings appears convincing. This is problematic particularly regarding SPP1 – this is supposed to be a nearly complete KO (figure 6B). It may be a matter of levels in which case IF is not appropriate. Flow cytometry profiles could resolve this.</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to point out that controls and KO’s are shown in the same magnification. The HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO cell lines are smaller cells with a different morphology, as shown in Figure 6D. Knockdown of <italic>SPP1</italic> in HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO cell lines is shown by WB in Figure 6B and normalized RNA-seq counts data in Figure 6G. We have replaced the Vimentin and OPN immunocytochemistry images in Figure 6I for the HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> KO cell lines with better quality images. We believe the issue with the previous images was autofluorescence. We have added flow cytometry profiles to Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, and removed one of the GSEA plots to make space for them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The differentiation potential of SPP1 knocked out cells was then tested five days after subcutaneous transplantation by immunofluorescence. The Glucagon and Ngn3 stainings are not convincing. Also, whereas there appear to be several C-pep+ cells the NkX6.1+ and PDX1+ among them are very scarce. This would not be expected from a differentiation into genuine b cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see comment #6 from Reviewer #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Geminin is expressed in very few ductal cells even after PDL (0.05%, figure 8B). It is not explained what are the quantitated ´γ-H2AX+ foci´. Do these correspond to γ-H2AX +cells ? It should be stated clearly; what is the % of cells that are γ-H2AX+ ?</p></disp-quote><p>In the methods section under histology and immunostaining, we write, “For quantification of BrdU, cleaved caspase 3, Geminin, Ki67, γ<italic>-</italic>H2AX, and ATR, at least 60 cells from 3 different ducts were analyzed.” These 60 cells were not chosen based on any specific criteria.

Similarly, in the IF on human pancreatic tissue (see Figure 8A) the distribution of Geminin is not clearly visible. The IF should be repeated and the images showing the individual channels should be included?</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the IF staining experiments for Figure 7E and Figure 8A and replaced most images. For Figure 7E Synaptophysin/Pdx1/C-peptide immunostaining, after repeating the IF staining, the images already in the figure for HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> gRNA6 remained the best quality images we were able to generate, and thus, we left these images in the panel. We have replaced the images for HPDE6c7 <italic>SPP1</italic> gRNA8 to show an area with a higher cell density. To clarify the location of PDX1+, synaptophysin+, and c-peptide+ triple positive cells, we have included yellow arrows in the revised panel. HPDE6c7 scr gRNA cells are uniformly negative for PDX1, synaptophysin, and c-peptide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The study reports some interesting observations on the pancreatobiliary and intrapancreatic bile duct cells.

Our examination of markers characterizing these populations transcriptionally: Acetylated α tubulin (<italic>Tuba1a</italic>) for Cluster 3 (intrapancreatic bile duct cells) and CXCL5 for Cluster 4 (pancreatobiliary cells) showed positive cells in both pancreatobiliary and intrapancreatic bile ducts (Figure 2—figure supplement 2-3) in mouse and human.
