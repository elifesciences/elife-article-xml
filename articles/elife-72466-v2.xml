components. During the development of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, many somatic and germ cells undergo apoptosis. These cells are engulfed and degraded by their neighboring cells. We discovered a novel role of autophagosomes in facilitating the degradation of apoptotic cells using a real-time imaging technique. Specifically, the double-membrane autophagosomes in engulfing cells are recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells and subsequently fuse to phagosomes, allowing the inner vesicle to enter the phagosomal lumen. Mutants defective in the production of autophagosomes display significant defects in the degradation of apoptotic cells, demonstrating the importance of autophagosomes to this process. The signaling pathway led by the phagocytic receptor CED-1, the adaptor protein CED-6, and the large GTPase dynamin (DYN-1) promotes the recruitment of autophagosomes to phagosomes. Moreover, the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with phagosomes requires the functions of the small GTPase RAB-7 and the HOPS complex components. Further observations suggest that autophagosomes provide apoptotic cell-degradation activities in addition to and in parallel of lysosomes. Our findings reveal that, unlike the single-membrane, <italic>L</italic>C3-<italic>a</italic>ssociated <underline>p</underline>hagocytosis (LAP) vesicles reported for mammalian phagocytes, the canonical double-membrane autophagosomes facilitate the clearance of <italic>C. elegans</italic> apoptotic cells. These findings add autophagosomes to the collection of intracellular organelles that contribute to phagosome maturation, identify novel crosstalk between the autophagy and phagosome maturation pathways, and discover the upstream signaling molecules that initiate this crosstalk.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>autophagosome</kwd><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>degradation</kwd><kwd>phagosome</kwd><kwd>C. elegans</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM067848</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Zheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The crosstalk between autophagy and the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, two cellular clearance pathways, promotes the fusion of the double-membrane autophagosomes to the phagosomes and plays an important role in the degradation of engulfed apoptotic cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During metazoan development and adulthood, a large number of cells undergo apoptosis or cell suicide; these dying cells are engulfed by phagocytes and degraded inside phagosomes, vacuoles composed of the lipid bilayers originated from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reddien and Horvitz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagata, 2018</xref>). Swift engulfment and degradation of apoptotic cells are critical for tissue remodeling, the resolution of the wound area, and the prevention and suppression of harmful inflammatory and autoimmune responses induced by the content of the dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagata, 2018</xref>). Critical to the degradation of phagosomal contents is the fusion of intracellular organelles, including lysosomes and early endosomes, to phagosomes, which results in the delivery of the content of these organelles to the phagosomal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levin et al., 2016</xref>). Lysosomes, which contribute many kinds of hydrolytic enzymes, including proteases, nucleases, lipases, and hydrolyzing enzymes for polysaccharides to the lumen of phagosomes, are the most pivotal organelles that support phagosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levin et al., 2016</xref>). The fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes also helps acidify the phagosomal lumen, creating a low pH condition in which the digestive enzymes are active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levin et al., 2016</xref>). Besides lysosomes and endosomes, whether other kinds of intracellular organelles fuse to phagosomes and contribute to the degradation of the apoptotic cells inside remains elusive.</p><p>Mammalian microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain <underline>3</underline> (MAP1-LC3, or LC3) protein is a member of the ATG8 protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schaaf et al., 2016</xref>). LC3 molecules conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are most often observed on the surfaces of autophagosomes, double-membrane organelles that are a key structure of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schaaf et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, LC3 is a well-established marker for autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schaaf et al., 2016</xref>). In mammalian cells, lipidated LC3 molecules were also reported to label a novel kind of vesicles referred to as LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) vesicles, which are single-membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanjuan et al., 2007</xref>). LAP vesicles were reported to be the third kind of intracellular vesicles that fuse to phagosomes and facilitate the degradation of apoptotic cells in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Green et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martinez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular event that plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by enveloping harmful protein aggregates and damaged cellular organelles in double-membrane autophagosomes and subsequently degrading them via fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morishita and Mizushima, 2019</xref>). Autophagy also supports cell survival during nutrient starvation by capturing intracellular organelles into autophagosomes and converting them to nutrients and energy sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morishita and Mizushima, 2019</xref>). Autophagosome formation requires the organized action of a set of proteins known as <bold><underline>a</underline></bold>u<bold><underline>t</underline></bold>opha<bold><underline>g</underline></bold>ic related (ATG) proteins. It is a process of three sequential steps: initiation, nucleation, and expansion, until an autophagosome fully forms and closes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakatogawa, 2020</xref>). After formation, autophagosomes undergo a maturation process through fusion with lysosomes, which provide digestive enzymes to degrade autophagosomal contents, generating a fusion product referred to as ‘autolysosomes‘ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakatogawa, 2020</xref>). In the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, several autophagy genes have been reported to facilitate the clearance of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is unknown whether autophagosome, as a particular type of cellular organelle, is involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells or whether these <italic>atg</italic> genes have additional functions, such as forming LAP vesicles.</p><p>Although both are labeled with LC3, mammalian LAP vesicles and autophagosomes are different in several key aspects. First, LAP vesicles are single-membrane vesicles, whereas autophagosomes are double-membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanjuan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakatogawa, 2020</xref>). In addition, although the formation of LAP vesicles relies on many autophagy genes, <italic>ulk1</italic>, <italic>atg13</italic>, and <italic>atg14</italic>, three genes whose products act in the initiation complexes for autophagosomes, are dispensable for the generation of LAP vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanjuan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). During the initiation of autophagosomes formation, which starts with the appearance of a membrane structure known as a phagophore, ULK1, a serine-threonine kinase, forms a protein complex with ATG13 and two other proteins and phosphorylates the class-III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) VPS34 as well as the rest of the VPS34 complex (ATG6, ATG14, and VPS15), triggering the production of PtdIns(3)P on the phagosphore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakatogawa, 2020</xref>). These distinct features of autophagosomes and LAP vesicles are critical for distinguishing whether an LC3-labeled vesicle is an autophagosome or a LAP vesicle.</p><p>During <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryonic development, 131 somatic cells undergo apoptosis and are swiftly engulfed and degraded by neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sulston et al., 1980</xref>). Apoptotic cells display a ‘button-like’ structure under the Differential Contrast Interference (DIC) microscopy and are referred to as cell corpses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sulston et al., 1980</xref>). Mutants defective in the clearance of cell corpses exhibit an increased number of persistent cell corpses, a phenotype known as <italic>ce</italic>ll <italic>d</italic>eath abnormal (Ced) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ellis et al., 1991</xref>). In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite gonad, 300–500 germ cells undergo apoptosis and are cleared by the neighboring gonadal sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gumienny et al., 1999</xref>). Previous genetic studies revealed two parallel, partially redundant pathways that primarily drive the clearance of <italic>C. elegans</italic> cell corpses. These include a signaling pathway led by CED-1, a phagocytic receptor for apoptotic cells, CED-6, an adaptor protein for CED-1, and DYN-1, a large GTPase playing many roles in membrane trafficking, and the other pathway led by the small Rac1 GTPase CED-10, and CED-5 and CED-12, the bipartite nucleotide exchange factor for CED-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mangahas and Zhou, 2005</xref>). Unlike the CED-10 pathway, which primarily regulates cell corpse engulfment, the CED-1 pathway has two separate functions, regulating both the engulfment and degradation of cell corpses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). CED-1 on neighboring engulfing cells recognizes the ‘eat me’ signal on the surfaces of cell corpses and is enriched to the region of the plasma membrane facing a cell corpse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). This enrichment initiates the extension of pseudopods along the cell corpse and the subsequent closure of the phagocytic cup to form a nascent phagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, CED-1 plays a distinct role in initiating the degradation of phagosomal contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). CED-1 remains transiently enriched on the surface of nascent phagosomes, where it facilitates the CED-6 and DYN-1-mediated sequential recruitment of the Class II phosphatidylinositol 3-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3)P) kinase PIKI-1, the Class III PtdIns(3)P kinase VPS-34, and the small GTPases RAB-5 and RAB-7 to phagosomal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). The robustly produced PtdIns(3)P and the RAB-5 and RAB-7 GTPases further recruit effectors for PtdIns(3)P and the RAB proteins, respectively, which drive the recruitment and fusion of early endosomes and lysosomes to a phagosome, leading to the degradation of the cell corpse inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu and Zhou, 2012</xref>). RAB-7, in particular, is essential for the fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy and phagocytosis are two distinct lysosomal-mediated cellular degradation pathways designated to eliminate intracellular and extracellular components, respectively. Previously, whether canonical autophagosomes were involved in the degradation of phagosomal contents was unknown. We report here that, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, during the maturation of phagosomes that contain apoptotic cells, LC3-labeled, double-membrane canonical autophagosomes are recruited to phagosomal surfaces and subsequently fuse to these phagosomes. We have further discovered that this event facilitates the degradation of apoptotic cells and is driven by the signaling pathway led by CED-1. This autophagosome-phagosome fusion represents a novel mechanism that contributes to the degradation of phagosomal contents and reveals a new function of autophagosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Vesicles labeled with GFP-tagged LC3 are recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes</title><p>The ATG8 protein family is composed of two subfamilies, the LC3 subfamily and the GABARAP subfamily, which are very close to each other in sequence; the ATG8 family is also referred to as the LC3/GABARAP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schaaf et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> has two LC3/GABARAP family members, LGG-1 and LGG-2, which belong to the LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manil-Ségalen et al., 2014</xref>).

To further monitor the fate of the LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta after they are recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes, we replaced GFP with mCherry (pKa &lt;4.5) or mNeonGreen (mNG) (pKa = 5.1), both of which are more resistant than GFP to the acidic pH environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shinoda et al., 2018</xref>), allowing fluorescence signal inside the phagosomal lumen to be detected. Co-expressed with the mCherry::LGG or mNG::LGG reporter are the CED-1::GFP or PH(hPLCγ)::mRFP reporters, which were used in the time-lapse experiments as markers for the extending pseudopods, allowing us to determine the moment when the pseudopods sealed up and a nascent phagosome was born (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F, H1</xref>, top panels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2013</xref>). In time-lapse image series of the clearance process of C1, C2, and C3, we found that like the GFP::LGG reporters, the mCherry::LGG and mNG::LGG reporters were enriched on the surfaces of phagosomes; moreover, unlike the GFP::LGG reporters, the mCherry and mNG-tagged reporters subsequently entered phagosomal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F, H1</xref>). The fluorescence signal intensity increases over time with the continuous recruitment of the LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta on phagosomal surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F, H1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1 fig1video2 fig1video3">Figure 1—videos 1–3</xref>).

The appearance of the membrane-attached mCherry::LGG and mNG::LGG signal in the phagosomal lumen indicates that the LGG<sup>+</sup> vesicles fuse with the phagosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). They further suggest that these vesicles are composed of double membranes labeled with the LGG reporter molecules on both the outer and inner membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). If these LGG<sup>+</sup> vesicles were single-membrane, no membrane-attached LGG reporter would end up inside the phagosomal lumen because, as a result of fusion, the reporter molecules will be retained on the phagosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Indeed, when CTNS-1, a lysosomal transmembrane protein, is tagged with mRFP, which is acid-resistant (pKa = 4.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>]), on its C-terminus, the lysosome-phagosome fusion event resulted in the incorporation of the mRFP signal into the phagosomal membrane; as a result, the CTNS-1::mRFP signal is only observed on the phagosomal surface, not in the phagosomal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The LGG<sup>+</sup> vesicles that are incorporated into phagosomes are canonical autophagosomes</title><p>The observation that the LGG<sup>+</sup> vesicles incorporated into phagosomes are likely double-membrane vesicles reminded us of canonical autophagosomes rather than LAP vesicles.

In TEM images, germ cell corpses are identified by their higher density than live germ cells and complete cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>rab-7(ok511</italic>) mutants are maternal-effect embryonic lethal. <italic>rab-7(ok511</italic>) adult hermaphrodites are viable and produce dead embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>rab-7(ok511</italic>) mutant adult gonads, many undegraded phagosomes containing germ cell corpses are observed inside the sheath cell in thin (50 nm) TEM sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, in the <italic>rab-7</italic> mutant gonad, mCherry::LGG-1 expressed in sheath cells (under P<italic><sub>ced-1</sub></italic>) is observed to accumulate on the surfaces of phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), like in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutant embryos (see Results section ‘The small GTPase RAB-7 and the HOPS complex are essential for the fusion between autophagosomes and phagosomes’ below). This result is consistent with the observation of LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta on phagosomal surfaces in embryos. In <italic>rab-7</italic> mutant gonad, we did identify multiple double-membrane vesicles in close contact with the phagosomal surfaces in TEM thin sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–H</xref>). Besides being composed of double membranes, these vesicles also resemble autophagosomes identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kovacs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).

The above observations support our conclusion that the LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta that are recruited to phagosomal surfaces are indeed canonical autophagosomes. They further suggest that the autophagosome-phagosome interaction is general rather than a cell-specific phenomenon.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Double-membrane vesicles were observed to attach on the surfaces of phagosomes bearing germ cell corpses All samples are from the distal gonadal arms of <italic>rab-7(ok511</italic>) adult hermaphrodites.</title><p>(A) In the gonadal arm of a <italic>rab-7(ok511</italic>) hermaphrodite expressing P<italic><sub>ced-1</sub> mCherry::lgg-1</italic> in gonadal sheath cells, mCherry<sup>+</sup> puncta (arrows) are found on the surfaces of phagosomes carrying germ cell corpses (white (a) and black (b) asterisks).

The recruitment event can be evaluated by the level of enrichment of mCherry puncta on the surfaces of phagosomes, whereas the subsequent fusion event can be measured by the level of accumulation of the mCherry signal inside the phagosomal lumen. In <italic>rab-7(ok511</italic>)(m<sup>-</sup>z<sup>-</sup>) mutant embryos produced by <italic>rab-7(ok511</italic>)(m<sup>+</sup>z<sup>-</sup>) mothers, robust enrichment of both the mCherry::LGG-1<sup>+</sup> and::LGG-2<sup>+</sup> puncta to phagosomal surfaces are prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–H</xref>), indicating that the recruitment of autophagosomes was normal.

We quantified the time between the moments a phagosome was just born and that when an obvious mCherry signal was observed inside the phagosomal lumen. In the wild-type embryos, this time is &lt;30 min in 100% of the samples analyzed, and the median value is 14 and 18 min for LGG-1<sup>+</sup> and LGG-2<sup>+</sup> autophagosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(E and H)</xref> and <bold>8(I-J</bold>)).

For over half of the samples, the observation period was extended beyond 90 min after phagosome formation, and still, no mCherry signal was observed in the phagosomal lumen within this period.

The lack of autophagosome-phagosome fusion observed in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants led us to subsequently examine the <italic>vps-18</italic> null mutant embryos.

However, whereas in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants, the accumulation of the mCherry signal in the phagosomal lumen was blocked completely in all samples, in some <italic>vps-18</italic> mutant embryos, the entry of mCherry signal still occurred, <italic>albeit</italic> severely delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–J</xref>). In contrast, in other samples, the entry was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–J</xref>), indicating a fusion defect that is less severe than that caused by the <italic>rab-7</italic> null mutation and suggesting the existence of the residual HOPS function in <italic>vps-18</italic> mutants. Together, our observations indicate that RAB-7 and the HOPS complex play a critical and specific role in driving the fusion between autophagosomes and phagosomes.</p><p>To evaluate the defect in phagosome degradation caused by the <italic>rab-7(ok511</italic>) null mutation, which abolishes the fusion of both lysosomes and autophagosomes to phagosomes, we measured the phagosome lifespan in <italic>rab-7(ok511)(m<sup>-</sup>z<sup>-</sup></italic>) embryos using the phagosome lifespan analysis used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>.

The difference in severity in the phagosome degradation defects displayed by <italic>rab-7</italic> and autophagy mutants suggest that autophagosomes and lysosomes both contribute to phagosome degradation, and that autophagosomes provide a phagosome degradation activity in an additive and possibly independent manner to lysosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The CED-1 pathway drives the recruitment of autophagosomes to phagosomes</title><p>The signaling pathway led by the phagocytic receptor CED-1 plays essential roles in initiating the maturation of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>).

As a portion of the autophagosomes would fuse with lysosomes and become autolysosomes that retain lysosomal features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morishita and Mizushima, 2019</xref>), it is possible that among all LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta, the autolysosomes are the sole portion that contributes to phagosome degradation by depositing lysosomal luminal proteins to the phagosomal lumen. To test whether this is the case, we examined whether mutations that specifically impair autophagosomes biogenesis would reduce the amount or speed of the incorporation of organelles with lysosomal features into phagosomes. <italic>C. elegans</italic> NUC-1 is an endonuclease belonging to the DNase II family and resides in the lysosomal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2010</xref>). Using a NUC-1::mCherry reporter expressed in engulfing cells as a lysosomal luminal marker, we quantified the level and rate of lysosome-phagosome fusion over time. In wild-type embryos, in phagosomes containing cell corpses C1, C2, and C3, we observed first the attachment of NUC-1::mCherry puncta on the surfaces of phagosomes and subsequently the accumulation of the mCherry signal inside the phagosomal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). This dynamic process represents the recruitment and the subsequent fusion of lysosomal particles to phagosomes, which result in the delivery of NUC-1::mCherry into the phagosomal lumen. We next monitored NUC-1::mCherry inside the phagosomal lumen in <italic>lgg-1(tm3489</italic>), <italic>lgg-2(tm5755</italic>), and <italic>atg-7(bp411</italic>) embryos, which are defective in the biogenesis of autophagosomes. In these mutants, numerous mCherry::NUC-1 puncta are enriched on the surfaces of phagosomes C1, C2, and C3 and are subsequently fused to phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B–D</xref>). As a result, the accumulation of the mCherry signal is observed in the phagosomal lumen in all samples like in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B–E</xref>). Quantitative analysis of 15 phagosomes for each genotype found that 60 min after phagosome formation, the average folds of increase of the luminal mCherry signal over the ‘0 min’ time point in <italic>lgg-</italic>1, <italic>lgg-2</italic>, and <italic>atg-7</italic> mutants are not significantly different from that observed from wild-type samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>). In addition, the median value of the first time point when NUC-1::mCherry signal was detected inside the phagosomal lumen was not significantly different in all four genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>).

We found that, unlike a previous report that concluded that the NUC-1 endonuclease acts in cells undergoing programmed cell death to generate chromatin DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2000</xref>), NUC-1 actually acts in engulfing cells, in the phagosomal lumen to degrade chromatin DNA of engulfed apoptotic cells (Pickett J., Auld N., Lucas, L., Pena-Ramos O., and Zhou, Z., unpublished results).

Histone b H3.3, together with other histones and the DNA wrapping around them, form the nucleosome, the fundamental subunit of the chromatin.

We have identified a novel function of autophagosomes in facilitating the degradation of apoptotic cells through fusing to phagosomes. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> cells that engulf apoptotic cells, autophagosomes are recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes and subsequently fuse to the phagosomal membrane. Through this previously unknown interaction, autophagosomes facilitate the degradation of apoptotic cells inside phagosomes, presumably through providing certain materials to phagosomes. We have further identified a signaling pathway that promotes the recruitment and subsequent fusion of autophagosomes to phagosomes. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism through which the pathways that control autophagy and phagocytosis converge, underlining the importance of this mechanism in the degradation of apoptotic cells. We propose that this mechanism might be conserved in the metazoans and has a significant impact in the regulation of the immunological consequences of dying cells inside human bodies.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>canonical autophagosomes play an essential role in the degradation of apoptotic cells</title><p>Previously, <italic>C. elegans</italic> autophagy genes have been implicated in facilitating the clearance of apoptotic cells.

All the above findings suggest that the autophagy genes examined might have separate functions in the degradation of phagosomal contents unrelated to their canonical roles in autophagosome biogenesis. Our work reported here, on the other hand, presents a different discovery regarding how the autophagy machinery regulates phagosome degradation.</p><p>We found that the canonical double-membrane autophagosomes actively participate in the degradation of apoptotic cells inside phagosomes. In the time-lapse recording series, we first observed that vesicles labeled with LGG-1/or –2 reporters are recruited to phagosomal surfaces; subsequently, the LGG-tagged reporters enter the phagosomal lumen. We propose that the entry of the LGG reporters is a result of the fusion of the outer membrane of a double-membrane vesicle with the membrane of a phagosome based on two lines of evidence. First, the fusion between these two membranes would allow the release of the inner vesicle into the phagosomal lumen. Moreover, the RAB-7 GTPase and its effector—the HOPS complex, are well-known membrane tethering factors that promote the fusion between two intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stenmark, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013</xref>). Their essential roles in supporting the entry of the LGG reporters into the phagosomal lumen that we have discovered strongly indicate that this event is a result of the fusion between the outer membrane of autophagosomes and phagosomes. Formally, other possible explanations of the entry of the LGG reporters exist, such as that phagosomes engulf the LGG-labeled vesicles. However, currently, there are no reported findings that phagosomes would engulf intracellular vesicles.</p><p>Using the immuno-electron microscopy technique, Segalen et al previously found that the LGG-1 and –2 are specifically enriched on double-membrane autophagosomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manil-Ségalen et al., 2014</xref>). Five critical sets of evidence we report here further indicate that the LGG-1- and –2-labeled vesicles that are incorporated into phagosomes are double-membrane autophagosomes, not the single-membrane LAP vesicles. First, only when the vesicles are composed of double membranes and when the LGG-1/ or –2 reporter molecules label both the inside and outside membranes, the entry of the reporters into phagosomal lumen is possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Conversely, if the LGG-1 or –2 labeled vesicles are of a single membrane, after vesicle-phagosome fusion, the reporter signal would remain on the phagosomal membrane, just like the membrane-bound lysosomal marker CTNS-1::mRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, these vesicles are also labeled with GFP-tagged ATG-9, an integral membrane protein inserted into the autophagosomal membranes. Third, we found that besides in embryos, in the gonad of adult hermaphrodites, many LGG-1-labeled vesicles are also attached to the surfaces of phagosomes that contain germ cell corpses in the <italic>rab-7</italic> mutant background in which membrane fusion is presumably blocked. Also, in the <italic>rab-7</italic> mutant adult hermaphrodites, thin-section transmission electron micrographs reveal multiple double-membrane vesicles that are in close contact with the phagosomal membranes. These vesicles resemble autophagosomes in morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kovacs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Fourth, the production of these vesicles relies on genes pivotal for autophagosome biogenesis, such as <italic>atg-3</italic>, <italic>atg-7</italic>, and <italic>atg-9</italic>. Last but not least, genes encoding the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of mammalian ULK1, ATG13, and ATG14, which are dispensable for the generation of LAP vesicles in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Green et al., 2016</xref>), are required for the formation of the LGG-labeled vesicles discussed here and for the efficient clearance of apoptotic cells, further verifying that these vesicles are distinct from the single-membrane LAP vesicles.

However, whether the LGG markers attached to phagosomes carrying midbodies or polar bodies represent double-membrane or single-membrane vesicles have not been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fazeli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fazeli et al., 2016</xref>). Whether LAP vesicles exist in <italic>C. elegans</italic> cells still needs to be demonstrated. On the other hand, we found that in <italic>atg-13</italic> mutant embryos, in which the biogenesis of the LAP vesicles is not supposed to be affected, the LGG-labeled puncta largely disappeared, indicating that these puncta are primarily autophagosomes instead of LAP vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> <bold>–2</bold>). This observation does not support the existence of a substantial population of the LAP vesicles in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, at least not in the cells in which the LGG reporters are expressed.</p><p>The observation of the LGG-1 or –2 signals inside the phagosomal lumen is made using the mCherry reporter. The mCherry protein is resistant to acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>). Phagosome luminal pH value reduces from 5.5 to 6.0 to 4.5–5.5 after incorporating lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vieira et al., 2002</xref>), leading to the inactivation of the fluorophore in the commonly used GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsien, 1998</xref>). In fact, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> engulfing cells, GFP-tagged LGG-1 or –2, unlike the mCherry-tagged reporters, are only observed on the surfaces but not in the lumen of phagosomes, presumably due to the acidic environment of the phagosomal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It is thus conceivable that in other experimental systems, a mCherry-tagged LC3 marker might disclose a previously overlooked fusion between autophagosomes and phagosomes.</p><p>Based on the evolutionary conservation of almost all molecular mechanisms, in particular the strong conservation of the known mechanisms that control phagocytosis and autophagy in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu and Zhou, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang and Baehrecke, 2015</xref>), we propose that in mammalian cells, besides LAP vesicles, canonical autophagosomes might also contribute to the degradation of apoptotic cells in phagosomes. The demonstration of an autophagosome-phagosome fusion event in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a well-established model organism for studying cell-death-related events, opens a path to investigate whether the event and mechanism of autophagosome-phagosome fusion is an evolutionarily conserved event. In addition, the autophagosome-phagosome fusion might contribute to the degradation of other kinds of phagosomal cargos besides apoptotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LGG-1 and LGG-2 define three subpopulations of autophagosomes that are incorporated into phagosomes</title><p>LGG-1 and –2 are close homologs that each labels autophagosomes. We have observed three separate classes of autophagosomes that are incorporated into phagosomes: LGG-1<sup>+</sup> LGG-2<sup>-</sup>, LGG-1<sup>-</sup> LGG-2<sup>+</sup>, or LGG-1<sup>+</sup> LGG-2<sup>+</sup>. These subpopulations might represent autophagosomes at different stages of maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manil-Ségalen et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, we have found that the <italic>lgg-1; lgg-2</italic> double mutants display a further enhanced Ced phenotype than that displayed by each of the <italic>lgg-1</italic> or <italic>lgg-2</italic> single mutants. Together, these results indicate that autophagosomes at different stages of maturity all contribute to the degradation of apoptotic cells. These results are also consistent with our finding that the autophagosome-phagosome fusion is primarily independent of lysosome-phagosome fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) (Also see the next section).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>What do autophagosomes contribute to the degradation of apoptotic cells</title><p>We have found that the blockage of the biogenesis of autophagosomes or the recruitment or fusion of autophagosomes to phagosomes results in a significant delay in the degradation of phagosomal content and, consequently, the persistent appearance of engulfed cell corpses. Among other possible mechanisms, the incorporation of autophagosomes into phagosomes presumably delivers certain substances to the lumen and/or membrane of phagosomes, substances that are important for the degradation of phagosomal contents. Here, we discuss several possible candidates and mechanisms supporting the roles of autophagosomes in phagosome degradation.</p><p>We have observed that the LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta inside engulfing cells are a collection of two subpopulations: autophagosomes that are already fused to lysosomes and become autolysosomes (LGG<sup>+</sup> NUC-1<sup>+</sup>) and autophagosomes that are not fused to lysosomes (LGG<sup>+</sup> NUC-1<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). The autolysosome populations, which occupied 40.7% and 36.5% of the LGG-1<sup>+</sup> and LGG-2<sup>+</sup> puncta observed on phagosomal surfaces, respectively, might contribute both autosomal and lysosomal materials to the phagosomes. In <italic>atg-7</italic> mutants, in which the biogenesis of autophagosomes is virtually blocked, the acidification of the phagosomal lumen and the degradation of the nuclear DNA of engulfed apoptotic cells are modestly defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figures 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">14</xref>). These defects might be partially attribute to the lack of autolysosomes that are incorporated into phagosomes. However, in cells that maintain a stable lysosome population, the lack of autophagosomes to fuse with lysosomes is not expected to influence the overall activities of lysosomes. In <italic>atg-7</italic>, <italic>lgg-1</italic>, and <italic>lgg-2</italic> mutant embryos, we found that the lack of autophagosomes does not significantly affect the efficiency of lysosome-phagosome fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). This result could be due to that in an engulfing cell, the population of autolysosomes, comparing to that of lysosomes, is a rather minor population. It supports the notion that the autophagy pathway primarily regulates activities that are additive to the lysosomal activities for promoting phagosome degradation, although the assay might not be sensitive enough to detect a modest decrease. Moreover, in <italic>rab-7(m<sup>-</sup>z<sup>-</sup></italic>) mutant embryos in which the fusion of both the lysosomes and the LGG<sup>+</sup> particles to phagosomes are blocked, the phagosome degradation defect is much more severe than in autophagosome biogenesis mutants. These results suggest that the collected population of LGG<sup>+</sup> vesicles contribute to phagosome degradation in a manner in parallel to lysosomes. In addition to the autolysosomal subpopulation, the LGG-1<sup>+</sup> NUC-1<sup>-</sup> (59.3% of the LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta) or LGG-2<sup>+</sup> NUC-1<sup>-</sup> (63.5% of the LGG2<sup>+</sup> puncta) subpopulations that fuse to phagosomes are likely to contribute certain unique, lysosome-independent activity(ies) to the phagosomes.</p><p>What could be the unique activities or mechanisms provided by the autophagosomes? Through fusion to phagosomes and releasing the inner vesicles to the phagosomal lumen, autophagosomes might deliver certain protein or lipid molecules to facilitate the degradation of phagosomal cargos. For example, the outer membrane of the autophagosomes might provide important signaling molecules to the phagosomal membrane. One such candidate is PtdIns(3)P, a membrane signaling molecule essential for many membrane trafficking events. On the phagosomal surfaces, PtdIns(3)P recruits PtdIns(3)P-binding proteins, including the sorting nexins SNX-1, SNX-6, and LST-4/SNX-9 and the HOPs complex, which subsequently drive multiple membrane remodeling events that promote phagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu and Zhou, 2012</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, PtdIns(3)P is presented on phagosomal membrane over time in a two-peak pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Autophagosomes are coated with PtdIns(3)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakatogawa, 2020</xref>). Judging by the timing of autophagosome-phagosome fusion, autophagosomal membranes are likely to contribute PtdIns(3)P for the rise of the second peak of PtdIns(3)P.</p><p>Alternatively, the autophagosome-phagosome fusion incorporates membrane materials to the phagosomal membrane and thus should increase the size of phagosomal membrane. Increasing the overall amount of phagosomal membrane might aid the degradation of the apoptotic cell by facilitating the recruitment of lysosomes to the phagosomal surfaces. We previously reported that phagosomes extend transient lipid tubules to capture lysosomal particles in the cytoplasm and bring these particles back to the phagosomes for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2011a</xref>). The increased phagosomal membrane material might support the extension of these lipid tubules. A substantial body of future investigation is required to discover the mechanisms employed by autophagosomes that facilitate phagosome degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The CED-1 signaling pathway drives the incorporation of autophagosomes to phagosomes</title><p>Autophagosomes are incorporated into phagosomes in two sequential steps: (1) they are recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes, detected by the enrichment of punctated LGG-1 or –2 fluorescence reporters on phagosomal surfaces, and (2) they subsequently fuse to phagosomes, detected by the enrichment of the LGG-1 or –2 reporter signals inside the phagosomal lumen. RAB-7 and its effector, the HOPS complex, are known to act as tethering factors that facilitate the fusion of various intracellular organelles, including autophagosomes, to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manil-Ségalen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spang, 2016</xref>). Closely related to this study, RAB-7 and VPS-18 are pivotal for the fusion between lysosomes and phagosomes and for the degradation of apoptotic cells inside phagosomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kinchen et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we observed that 100% of the LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta attached to phagosomal surfaces were also labeled with RAB-7. We further discovered that RAB-7 and VPS-18 played essential and specific roles in the fusion but not for the recruitment of autophagosomes to phagosomes. Our finding adds a new pair of organelles that depend on the RAB-7/HOPS complex for fusion to each other. As RAB-7 is enriched on the surfaces of both phagosomes and autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A-D</xref>), and as the HOPS complexes in mammalian cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic> are known to interact with the SNARE complex, the membrane fusion machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takáts et al., 2014</xref>), we propose that the RAB-7/HOPS complex acts on the surfaces of phagosomes and autophagosomes to facilitate autophagosome-phagosome fusion via promoting the interaction between the SNARE complexes on phagosomes and autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>). Currently, the specific SNARE proteins that catalyze the autophagosome-phagosome fusion have not been identified.</p><p>The CED-1 signaling pathway, which initiates the maturation of phagosomes that bear apoptotic cells, is essential for the enrichment of GTP-bound RAB-7 to the surfaces of phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Here we have found that CED-1, CED-6, and DYN-1 drive the incorporation of autophagosomes to phagosomes, in addition to driving the incorporation of early endosomes and lysosomes previously discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>ced-1</italic> mutants, for example, the recruitment of autophagosomes to the surfaces of phagosomes is almost completely blocked. Due to the severe recruitment defect, whether the <italic>ced-1</italic> null mutation further impairs the fusion between autophagosomes and phagosomes cannot be readily visualized. However, since a <italic>ced-1</italic> null mutation impairs the recruitment of RAB-7 to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref> and the production of PtdIns(3)P on phagosomal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2012</xref>), and since the recruitment of the HOPS complex to the surfaces of intracellular organelles requires both RAB7 and PtdIns(3)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stroupe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jeschke and Haas, 2018</xref>), we predict that the CED-1 pathway would also control the RAB-7/HOPS complex-mediated autophagosome-phagosome fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9K</xref>). Identifying the CED-1 signaling pathway as the driving force for the incorporation of autophagosomes to phagosomes helps to reveal the molecular mechanisms behind the crosstalk between autophagy and phagocytosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OP50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OP50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type Bristol N2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VC308</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rab-7(ok511) /mIn1 II</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZH0989</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2008</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>unc-76(e911) enIs36 [punc-76(+), Pced-1 ced-1::gfp, Pced-1 2xFYVE::mRFP] V</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> Available from the Zhou Lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ZH2059</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>unc-76(e911)V;

To track fluorescence markers on pseudopods, on the surfaces of phagosomes, or inside phagosomal lumen during the clearance process of cell corpses C1, C2, and C3, embryos were monitored on their ventral surface starting at ~310 min post-first cleavage using an established time-lapse imaging protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2009</xref>).

To measure phagosome duration, a co-expressed phagosomal surface marker mCherry::2xFYVE was used to track the diameter of the phagosome over time.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Shai Shaham, as the Reviewing Editor, and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Barbara Conradt (Reviewer #2); Marc Freeman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors developed a time-lapse recording protocol that allows them to observe formation and degradation of phagosomes in specific phagocytic cells of developing <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos. Using this protocol in combination with specific reporters, they find that LC3-positive vesicles fuse with phagosomes and that these vesicles are double-membraned. They provide evidence that these LC3-positive vesicles are autophagosomes and demonstrate that preventing fusion results in a general engulfment defect due to a defect in the degradation of phagosomal content. RAB-7 and the HOPS complex are necessary and the CED-1, CED-6, DYN-1 pathway are also necessary for recruiting autophagosomes to phagosomes. Preventing autophagosome-phagosome fusion does not affect lysosome-phagosome fusion, ruling out indirect effects. This is a very rigorous and convincing study that will have significant impact on understanding cell corpse engulfment and degradation. It also uncovers a novel function of autophagosomes. There are no major experimental weaknesses, however, some of the interpretations are not fully supported and additional experiments could significantly solidify the underlying hypothesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see below the reviewers have made a number of important and useful comments on the manuscript, and you should address these with either new experiments or text revisions. Three issues about which new experiments may be revealing are:</p><p>1) Organelle identity: is it possible to perform EM or use previous EM imaging to demonstrate the existence of organelles that have fused with autophagosomes?</p><p>2) Mechanism: Can the authors use pH-sensitive reporters to understand the role of autophagosomes in phagosome maturation? Are there differences in pH of phagosomes in autophagosome mutants? Is it possible to assay hydrolytic enzyme activity in phagosomes? If so, are there differences in enzyme activity between WT and mutants lacking autophagosomes?</p><p>3) Genetic pathway: What are the effects of double mutants blocking both lysosome-phagosome fusion and autophagosome-phagosome fusion?</p><p>In the event that there are major technical limitations to performing these studies, please explain these.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Rather than using red and green for fluorescence images, I suggest using magenta and green, especially in those figures were the two colors our overlaid.</p><p>2. The authors use a visual assay and genetics to provide evidence that the LC3-positive vesicles that fuse with phagosomes are double-membrane vesicles and autophagosomes. Is there any evidence for double-membrane vesicles from EM images that the authors may have or are aware of in the literature?</p><p>3. Figure 6. Could the authors provide a quantification of LGG-1, LGG-2 and double positive vesicles? And could RAB-7 specifically be on LGG-1- and LGG-2 positive vesicles (Figure 7)?</p><p>4. ced-1 is required first for phagosome formation and subsequently for phagosome degradation. How can the authors look at autophagosome-phagosome fusion in ced-1 null mutants? Is the phagosome formation defect only partially penetrant?</p><p>5. Do the authors know whether blocking lysosome-phagosome fusion AND autophagosome-phagosome fusion results in a more severe engulfment defect compared to blocking only one of these fusion events? Basically, is there an additive or synergistic effect?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My main concern is really intepretation and the model. Do autophagosomes fuse with phagosomes and contribute to corpse digestion as suggested?</p><p>EM showing double-membrane nature of these autophagosomes seems like it is missing and might be needed. The arguments are all based on marker topology, which is reasonable, but a phagosome is a dynamic thing. For instance, as phagosomes digest contents like corpses, they get smaller. Does that membrane get internalized into the phagosome? If so, how does that affect the interpretation of the markers going inside the phagosome at later time points?</p><p>What if this is a mechanism that allows phagosomes to grow their lipid membranes, rather than fusion to digest what's in the autophagosome? Atg2/9 drive the transfer of lipids from the ER to autophagosomes, that's how autophagosomes grow. Maybe autophagosomes in this situation are intermediates that serve as important lipid sources for phagosomes? Is there an autophagosome target (inside) or component not in phagosomes that one could track to show actual deposition and subsequent degradation? How else can these possibilities be discriminated?</p><p>The argument that they don't fuse is reasonable, but what if autophagosomes themselves are engulfed completely into the phagosome? They show a lysosomal marker doesn't do that as an argument, which is fine, but that really only says lysosomes are acting as they normally do in this context and that their assays would detect that. What if autophagosomes are different? In the next section on ATG7 they assert this (internal fluorescence) as a marker for insertion of the internal part of a double-membrane vesicle into a phagosome, but it may or may not be.</p><p>What if LAPs in worms don't need ulk1/atg13/atg14, and they are single-membrane LAPs that are made differently? The data suggest these vesicles are double-membrane, but there are alternate interpretations (e.g. single vesicles that go in, and the stable reporters are showing that). How else are these different, or the same as LAPs in mammals?</p><p>The idea here is that the autophagosomes are needed for digestion of corpses, but what if corpses and stuff in autophagosomes are co-degraded in phagosomes? In this model, the autophagosomes would be additional material digested in what started as a phagosome. If that is blocked with mutations affecting autophagy, it could be that the delays in digestion of corpses observed are due to a checkpoint that is relevant to autophagosome fusion/digestion, rather than there being a direct role for autophagosomes in cell corpse degradation.</p><p>I think the authors have done a great job convincing me that autophagosomes are important, and that all the genes they describe are needed, but I am not fully convinced of the model they have landed on. It seems like there are many other possibilities. I think those need to be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should try to assess the pH and hydrolytic activity inside the phagosomes that matured in the presence or absence of autophagosomes to more convincingly demonstrate that lysosomal fusion occurred normally and that, importantly, a new, heretofore unappreciated factor is required for proper degradation of the contents.</p><p>They should also establish the nature of the fusing structures: are they truly double-membraned autophagosomes or have they undergone fusion with lysosomes (i.e. become autolysosomes)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72466.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see below the reviewers have made a number of important and useful comments on the manuscript, and you should address these with either new experiments or text revisions.

This result established the legitimacy</p><p>During the revision period, to address the above request, we characterized the phagosomes that contain germ cell corpses and the vesicles that are in close proximity to the phagosomal surfaces in the adult hermaphrodite gonads using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

On the other hand, we had previous experience performing TEM analysis in the adult gonads, which host many apoptotic germ cells. Furthermore, accumulative studies in the literature have indicated many common features and common mechanisms that are employed during the clearance of the apoptotic cells in embryos and in the adult hermaphrodite gonad. We thus decided to do the TEM analysis in the adult gonads.</p><p>In wild-type adult hermaphrodites, very few germ cell corpses remain in the gonad due to the efficient engulfment and phagosome degradation processes. In contrast, in rab-7 loss-of-function mutants, a large number of germ cell corpses remain in the gonad due to the lack of phagosome degradation [2]. In this study, we found that in rab-7(-) embryos, LGG-labeled vesicles are normally recruited to phagosomes yet fail to fuse with phagosomes, resulting in the accumulation of LGG+ vesicles on phagosomal surfaces. We observed that in rab-7(-) adult gonad, many LGG-1 puncta were attached to phagosomal membranes, suggesting that the fusion between autophagosomes and phagosomes might be blocked, like in rab-7(-) embryos (new Figure 4A). In this case, in rab-7(-) adult gonads, the chance of catching LGG-1-labeled puncta on phagosomal surfaces in 50-nm thin sections should be much increased. We thus decided to perform TEM analysis in the adult gonads of rab-7(-) hermaphrodites.</p><p>We analyzed a collection of thin section (50 nm sections) transmission electron micrographs of the gonads in rab-7(-) mutant adult hermaphrodites. We observed multiple examples of double-membrane vesicles in close contact with phagosomal surfaces. These vesicles resemble the morphology of the autophagosomes published in the literature (double membrane, with irregular space between the two lipid bilayers, the diameter is between 100 and 1000 nm, the content containing ribosomes). Our observation of double-membrane vesicles on phagosomal surfaces is consistent with this conclusion that autophagosomes are recruited to phagosomal surfaces. We reported this result in the new Figure 4, and in Results, in a subsection entitled, “The autophagosomes-phagosome interaction is a general phenomenon observed in embryos and the adult gonad”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Mechanism: Can the authors use pH-sensitive reporters to understand the role of autophagosomes in phagosome maturation? Are there differences in pH of phagosomes in autophagosome mutants? Is it possible to assay hydrolytic enzyme activity in phagosomes?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the above request, we developed an acidification reporter for the phagosomal lumen and used it to measure the degree of acidification of the phagosomal lumen in wild-type and <italic>atg-7</italic> mutant embryos. As a negative control, we also did the measurement in <italic>cup-5</italic> mutants in which lysosomal biogenesis and functions are severely defective. This reporter, P<italic><sub>his-72</sub> his-72::gfp::mCherry</italic>, expresses a HIS-72 (histone H3.3)::GFP::mCherry fusion protein in all cells, including cells that undergo apoptosis. Inside the phagosomal lumen, in the nucleus of a cell corpse, the GFP signal gradually diminishes due to its sensitivity to the acidic pH whereas mCherry is resistant to acidic pH and its signal persists over time. The ratio between GFP and mCherry signal has been commonly used to represent the degree of acidification in a number of studies. We quantified the GFP/mCherry signal ratio in the phagosomal lumen over time and normalized it against the “0 min” time point when a nascent phagosome had just formed. We refer to this normalized value as an “acidification index”. As shown in the new Figure 13, in wild-type embryos, the acidification index of the phagosomal lumen is reduced continuously after phagosome formation. In contrast, in <italic>cup-5</italic> mutants, the reduction of the acidification index is minimal, demonstrating that without the functional lysosomes, phagosome acidification is blocked or severely defective. In <italic>atg-7</italic> mutants, a moderate acidification defect is observed. This moderate defect likely contributes to the phagosome degradation defect observed in <italic>atg-7</italic> mutants, which is severely defective in the formation of autophagosomes. Autophagosomes thus contribute to the acidification of the phagosomal lumen. We have described these results in “Results”, in a section entitled “Impairing autophagosomes biogenesis results in moderate defects in phagosome acidification and the digestion of apoptotic-cell DNA”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If so, are there differences in enzyme activity between WT and mutants lacking autophagosomes?</p></disp-quote><p>During the revision period, we have developed one particular assay for the hydrolytic enzyme activity – the endonuclease activity inside the phagosomal lumen. This activity, which is primarily carried out by a lysosomal DNaseII named NUC-1, catalyzes the degradation of the chromatin DNA of apoptotic cells inside phagosomes. We have established a HIS-72::mCherry fusion protein as a reporter for chromatin DNA degradation. HIS-72, a histone B H3.3, is a subunit of the nucleosome, the building unit of the chromatin. HIS-72::mCherry labels the nucleus of an apoptotic cell inside a phagosome. We found that the degradation of chromatin DNA of the engulfed cell corpse mediated by NUC-1 caused the shrinkage of the cell corpse nucleus over time in the wild-type background (Figure 14). In contrast, in <italic>cup-5</italic> mutant embryos, which are severely defective in the lysosomal biogenesis and functions, minimum DNA degradation activity was detected, consistent with the notion that the DNA degradation activity in phagosomes is primarily provided by lysosomes (Figure 14). In comparison, in <italic>atg-7</italic> mutant embryos, a relatively moderate defect in the DNA degradation efficiency was observed (Figure 14). These new results are reported in “Results”, in a section entitled “Impairing autophagosomes biogenesis results in moderate defects in phagosome acidification and the digestion of apoptotic-cell DNA”, and in a new Figure 14.</p><p>It is unclear whether the modest defects in phagosomal acidification and DNA degradation displayed by the <italic>atg-7</italic> null mutants, in which autophagosomes biogenesis is primarily blocked, are sufficient to cause the intermediate delay in phagosome degradation. Less than 41% of the autophagosomes that fuse to phagosomes are autolysosomes that have the features of both autophagosomes and lysosomes. It is possible that autolysosomes bring some lysosomal activities to the phagosomal lumen and membrane. However, given that ~60% of the autophagosomes that are fused to phagosomes are not autolysosomes, we propose that autophagosomes additionally provide unique, lysosomal-independent substances and/or activities to phagosomes for the degradation of phagosomal cargos. Further investigation is required to identify such substances and/or activities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Genetic pathway: What are the effects of double mutants blocking both lysosome-phagosome fusion and autophagosome-phagosome fusion?</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous findings [2] and the discovery made in this manuscript indicate that RAB-7 activity is required for both the lysosome-phagosome and autophagosomephagosome fusions. In rab-7(ok511)(m<sup>-</sup>z<sup>-</sup>) null mutant embryos, both the lysosomephagosome and autophagosome-phagosome fusion are severely defective, even blocked ([2] and Figure 8 of this manuscript). To answer the above question, we quantified the phagosome degradation defect in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutant embryos. We measured the phagosome lifespan in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutant embryos (Figure 6) and compared the result to that measured in the <italic>atg-7</italic>, <italic>lgg-1</italic>, and <italic>lgg-2</italic> mutant embryos. We found that the phagosome lifespan is significantly longer in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants than in all of the other mutants (Figure 6, Results, “RAB-7 and the HOPS complex are essential for the fusion between autophagosomes and phagosomes”). The severe versus intermediate phagosome degradation defects displayed by <italic>rab-7</italic> and autophagy mutants, respectively, strongly suggest that autophagosomes and lysosomes both contribute to phagosome degradation, and that autophagosomes provide a phagosome degradation activity that is in an additive manner to lysosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the event that there are major technical limitations to performing these studies, please explain these.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Previously, using electron microscopy and immunogold labeling, Manil-Segalen et al., have shown that the GFP::LGG-1 and GFP::LGG-2 labeled puncta observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos are double-membrane autophagosomes [1].

Could the authors provide a quantification of LGG-1, LGG-2 and double positive vesicles? And could RAB-7 specifically be on LGG-1- and LGG-2 positive vesicles (Figure 7)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. We have quantified the distribution pattern of the three classes of the LGG-labeled phagosomes in the engulfing cells for cell corpses C1, C2, and C3, and found that the average distribution pattern of LGG-1<sup>+</sup> LGG-2<sup>-</sup>, LGG-1<sup>-</sup> LGG-2<sup>+</sup>, and LGG1<sup>+</sup> LGG-2<sup>+</sup> puncta is 35.8%, 40.7%, and 23.5%, respectively, indicating the existence of a comparable amount of each class of puncta in engulfing cells. We summarized the result of the quantification in a graph in the revised Figure 7C.</p><p>In wild-type embryos that co-express mCherry::LGG and GFP::RAB-7 reporters, we also quantified the percentage of LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta that are also RAB-7<sup>+</sup>. We found that in the cytoplasm of the ventral hypodermal cells, on average 66.2% of LGG-1<sup>+</sup> and 62.5% of LGG-2<sup>+</sup> puncta are RAB-7<sup>+</sup>, respectively (revised Figure 8E). Remarkably, the LGG-1<sup>+</sup> or LGG-2<sup>+</sup> puncta found on the surfaces of phagosomes are 100% RAB-7<sup>+</sup> (revied Figure 8F), suggesting that the presence of RAB-7 on autophagosomes is requested for the incorporation of autophagosomes to phagosomes. This hypothesis was proven true by our further finding presented in (Figure 8 G-J). We have reported these new results in “Results”, in a section entitled, “The small GTPase RAB-7 is enriched on the surfaces of autophagosomes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. ced-1 is required first for phagosome formation and subsequently for phagosome degradation. How can the authors look at autophagosome-phagosome fusion in ced-1 null mutants? Is the phagosome formation defect only partially penetrant?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the defect in phagosome formation is only partially penetrant in the <italic>ced1(e1735)</italic> null mutant embryos. Two major and one minor engulfment pathways have been discovered to act in parallel to promote the engulfment of apoptotic cells [3,4]. CED-1 leads one major pathway. The other major pathway is led by the CED-10 Rac GTPase and the CED-5/CED-12 complex, a bipartite nucleotide exchange factor for CED-10 [3]. The minor pathway is controlled by the small GTPase RAB-35 [4]. In <italic>ced1(e1735)</italic> null mutant embryos, we have characterized the different defects of apoptotic cell clearance and observed defects in all of the following events: recognition, engulfment, and phagosome degradation [2] (Figure S4 of [3]). In the <italic>ced-1(e135)</italic> background, even 100 min after the appearance of the cell death morphology, in 19% of the embryos the C3 cell corpse remains unengulfed; in 81% of the embryos, C3s are engulfed inside phagosomes, albeit at a slower pace (Figure S4 of [3]). Therefore, phagosomes containing C3 are available for time-lapse characterization. The engulfment defect in <italic>ced-1</italic> mutants is partially penetrant due to the presence of the engulfment pathways led by CED-10 and RAB-35, as in <italic>ced-1; ced-5</italic> and <italic>ced-1; rab-35</italic> double mutants, the recognition and engulfment defects are much worse than in each of the single mutants [4](Figure S7 of [2]). In <italic>ced-1; rab-35; ced-5</italic> triple mutants, the recognition and engulfment defects are further enhanced over that of the double mutants [4](Figure S7 of [2]). The engulfment activities provided by the CED-10 and RAB-35 pathways thus enabled phagosome formation in a portion of the <italic>ced-1</italic> mutant embryos and allowed us to identify and further characterize the phagosome degradation defects caused by mutations in <italic>ced-1</italic>. We added this explanation to “Results<bold>”,</bold> in a section entitled “The CED-1 pathway drives the recruitment of autophagosomes to phagosomes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Do the authors know whether blocking lysosome-phagosome fusion AND autophagosome-phagosome fusion results in a more severe engulfment defect compared to blocking only one of these fusion events? Basically, is there an additive or synergistic effect?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this question, we measured the cell corpse clearance defect, in particular, the phagosome degradation defect caused by the deletion mutation of <italic>rab-7</italic>. Previously, the <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> null mutants were reported to display severe defects in the incorporation of lysosomes to phagosomes [2,5]. In this manuscript, we report the blockage of autophagosome-phagosome fusion caused by the <italic>rab-7(ok511)</italic> mutation. Therefore, in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants, the fusion events of both lysosomes and autophagosomes to phagosomes are severely defective or blocked. Previously we reported that the <italic>rab-7</italic> null mutation blocked phagosome degradation [2]. Here we measured the phagosome degradation defect in <italic>rab-7(ok511)(m<sup>-</sup>z<sup>-</sup>)</italic> embryos using the same assay used to measure the degradation efficiency in the <italic>atg-7</italic>, <italic>lgg-1,</italic> and <italic>lgg-2</italic> mutants (Figure 6). We found that the <italic>rab-7</italic> mutation nearly completely blocks phagosome degradation, yet the <italic>atg-7</italic> and <italic>lgg</italic> mutations only delay the degradation to different extents. These results indicate that the autophagosomes contribute to phagosome degradation in a manner additive to lysosomes.

The arguments are all based on marker topology, which is reasonable, but a phagosome is a dynamic thing. For instance, as phagosomes digest contents like corpses, they get smaller. Does that membrane get internalized into the phagosome? If so, how does that affect the interpretation of the markers going inside the phagosome at later time points?</p></disp-quote><p>During the revision period, we have performed transmission EM analysis and observed the close association of double membrane vesicles with phagosomes that contain germ cell corpses. These double-membrane vesicles resemble autophagosomes in morphology. Please see “Essential Revisions – Response (Experiment 1)” for a detailed explanation of the rationale of this experiment, and the new Figure 4, and the section entitled “The autophagosomes-phagosome interaction is a general phenomenon observed in embryos and the adult gonad” in “Results” for the description of experimental results. Consistent with the EM observation, in the gonadal sheath cells, puncta labeled with mCherry::LGG-1 are observed to enrich on phagosomal surfaces, similar to the enrichment pattern on phagosomal surfaces in embryos. Together, these results suggest that like in the gonad, in embryos, the LGG-labeled puncta attached to phagosomal surfaces are very likely double-membrane organelles that resemble autophagosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What if this is a mechanism that allows phagosomes to grow their lipid membranes, rather than fusion to digest what's in the autophagosome? Atg2/9 drive the transfer of lipids from the ER to autophagosomes, that's how autophagosomes grow. Maybe autophagosomes in this situation are intermediates that serve as important lipid sources for phagosomes? Is there an autophagosome target (inside) or component not in phagosomes that one could track to show actual deposition and subsequent degradation? How else can these possibilities be discriminated?</p></disp-quote><p>This hypothesis is conceivable. The incorporation of intracellular vesicles to phagosomes would definitely cause the expansion of the phagosomal membrane. One particular function of the increased phagosome membrane amount might be to support the extension of the transient phagosomal tubules that aids the recruitment of lysosomal particles to phagosomes. We added it to the revised “Discussion”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The argument that they don't fuse is reasonable, but what if autophagosomes themselves are engulfed completely into the phagosome? They show a lysosomal marker doesn't do that as an argument, which is fine, but that really only says lysosomes are acting as they normally do in this context and that their assays would detect that. What if autophagosomes are different? In the next section on ATG7 they assert this (internal fluorescence) as a marker for insertion of the internal part of a double-membrane vesicle into a phagosome, but it may or may not be.</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that the double-membrane autophagosomes fuse with phagosomes primarily because we have observed not only the attachment of LGG-labeled autophagosomes to the phagosomal surfaces but also the subsequent accumulation of three autophagosomal membrane markers: LGG-1, LGG-2, and ATG-9 inside the phagosomal lumen. The entry of these markers to phagosomal lumen require two key properties: (1) the vesicles that fuse to the phagosomal membrane are of double membrane, and (2) the fusion between the outer membrane of the vesicle and the phagosomal membrane must happen, allowing the entry of the inner circle into the phagosomal lumen. The inner membrane is also labeled with one or more of the above markers. On the other hand, the fusion of the single membrane lysosomes to the phagosomal membrane results in the incorporation of the CTNS<sup>-1</sup> marker into the phagosomal membrane but not the phagosomal lumen (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). Figure 1K illustrates how the fusions of single-membrane vesicles or double-membrane vesicles to phagosomes result in the different localization patterns of the vesicle membrane marker. If the outer autophagosomal membrane does not fuse with the phagosomal membrane, it is hard to explain how the LGG markers are observed inside the phagosomal lumen. The essential roles of RAB-7 and VPS<sup>-1</sup>8 in the entry of the LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta into the phagosomal lumen (see the next paragraph) further support the fusion between autophagosomes and phagosomes.</p><p>Regarding the possibility that autophagosomes might be engulfed into the phagosome, formally it is possible; however, in the literature, there is no report of phagosomes further engulfing other vesicles in the cytoplasm. In the endocytic pathway, vesicles undergo dynamic conversions primarily through fusion and fission and the fusion and fission events retain the topology of the vesicles. In the aspect of membrane trafficking, phagosomes behave like lysosomes except that phagosomes are much bigger in size. For example, the small GTPase RAB-7 and the HOPs complex are enriched on the surfaces of both phagosomes and lysosomes and act as membrane tethering factors that facilitate fusion. It is known that Rab7 is essential for mediating the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. In this study, we found that mutations in <italic>rab-7</italic> and <italic>vps<sup>-1</sup>8</italic> block or severely impair the entry of the LGG markers into the phagosomal lumen, respectively, although they do not affect the attachment of LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta on the phagosomal surfaces (Figure 8). These results provide strong support to the hypothesis that autophagosomes actually fuse to phagosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What if LAPs in worms don't need ulk1/atg13/atg14, and they are single-membrane LAPs that are made differently? The data suggest these vesicles are double-membrane, but there are alternate interpretations (e.g. single vesicles that go in, and the stable reporters are showing that). How else are these different, or the same as LAPs in mammals?</p></disp-quote><p>Mammalian LAPs are defined as single-membrane vesicles with LC3 on their surfaces. The biogenesis of mammalian LAP vesicles does not need the Ulk1, Atg13, or Atg14 proteins, but not other proteins required for the biogenesis of autophagosomes. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, in atg-13 and epg-8 mutant embryos, like in atg-7 mutant embryos, very few LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta were observed (Figure 2 —figure supplements 1-2). This observation argues against the existence of a substantial pool of atg-13-independent LAP vesicles in C. elegans embryos, at least not in the hypodermal cells, or in the pharyngeal or intestinal precursor cells, in which P<sub>ced-1</sub> is active. This observation thus reveals a significant difference between C. elegans embryonic cells and cultured mammalian cells, in the latter of which LAP vesicles were observed. In addition, although Fazeli et al., [7] claimed that during C. elegans embryogenesis, the 2<sup>nd</sup> polar body is cleared by LAP, these authors did not attempt to observe LAP vesicles [7]. Therefore, whether the singlemembrane LAP vesicles exist in C. elegans embryos has not been demonstrated. It is possible that the biogenesis of the LAP vesicles might be induced by environmental stresses. However, stress-induction of LAP vesicles has not been reported in C. elegans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The idea here is that the autophagosomes are needed for digestion of corpses, but what if corpses and stuff in autophagosomes are co-degraded in phagosomes? In this model, the autophagosomes would be additional material digested in what started as a phagosome. If that is blocked with mutations affecting autophagy, it could be that the delays in digestion of corpses observed are due to a checkpoint that is relevant to autophagosome fusion/digestion, rather than there being a direct role for autophagosomes in cell corpse degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>The model proposed above is formally possible, although currently we do not know whether such a checkpoint exists. When that autophagosomes are fused to phagosomes, the cargos of autophagosomes are indeed co-degraded inside phagosomes. On the other hand, the cargos in autophagosomes are primarily degraded by lysosomes after the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Also, autophagy is a phenomenon that occurs broadly, not limited to cells that engulf apoptotic cells. Given that lysosomes are the presumed major force for degrading autophagosomal cargos, it is unclear whether phagosomes would make a significant contribution to the degradation of autophagosomal cargos. Therefore, such a checkpoint, if exists, does not seem to be able to benefit the degradation of cargos of autophagosomes in general.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think the authors have done a great job convincing me that autophagosomes are important, and that all the genes they describe are needed, but I am not fully convinced of the model they have landed on.

This report is not sufficient to answer the fundamental question of how autophagosomes facilitate phagosome degradation.</p><p>We believe that to identify the answer to this question, a substantial body of future investigation is needed. In the “Discussion” of the revised manuscript, we discussed multiple mechanisms that autophagosomes might employ to facilitate phagosome degradation, including the mechanisms raised by Reviewer 2. In summary, the points we propose are:</p><p>1. The LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta is a combination of two subpopulations: autophagosomes that are already fused to lysosomes and become autolysosomes (LGG<sup>+</sup> NUC-1<sup>+</sup>) and autophagosomes that have not fused to lysosomes (LGG<sup>+</sup> NUC-1<sup>-</sup>) (Figure 12). Autolysosomes might contribute multiple activities to phagosomes, one of which is an activity that is similar to that contributed by lysosomes that are fused to phagosomes. On the other hand, multiple lines of evidence suggest that autophagosomes also contribute activities that are different from that of lysosomes.</p><p>2. What could be those unique mechanisms provided by the autophagosomes that facilitate phagosome degradation?</p><p>(a) The fusion, as suggested by Reviewer 2, incorporates the outer membrane of the autophagosome to the phagosomal membrane and thus should cause the expansion of the phagosomal membrane. Increasing the overall amount of phagosomal membrane might aid the degradation of the apoptotic cell by facilitating the recruitment of lysosomes to the phagosomal surfaces. We previously reported that phagosomes extend transient lipid tubules to capture lysosomal particles in the cytoplasm and bring these particles back to the phagosomes for fusion [2,8]. It is possible that the increased phagosomal membrane material supports the extension of these lipid tubules. -- (b) The second possible mechanism proposes that the outer membrane of the autophagosomes provides important signaling molecules to the phagosomal membrane.</p><p>These molecules could be proteins and/or lipids. One candidate signaling molecule is PtdIns(3)P. On the phagosomal surfaces, PtdIns(3)P recruits PtdIns(3)P-binding proteins including the sorting nexins SNX-1, SNX-6, and LST-4/SNX-9 and the HOPs complex, which subsequently drive multiple membrane remodeling events that promote phagosome maturation [8,9]. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, PtdIns(3)P is presented on phagosomal membrane over time in a two-peak pattern [10]. Autophagosomes are coated with PtdIns(3)P. Judging by the timing of autophagosome-phagosome fusion, autophagosomal membranes are likely to provide PtdIns(3)P for the second peak.</p><p>In our future study, we will test the above models. The analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms that support this novel function of autophagosomes and the crosstalk between autophagosomes and phagosomes. We include the above points in the revised “Discussion”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should try to assess the pH and hydrolytic activity inside the phagosomes that matured in the presence or absence of autophagosomes to more convincingly demonstrate that lysosomal fusion occurred normally and that, importantly, a new, heretofore unappreciated factor is required for proper degradation of the contents.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to Reviewer 3 for the above suggestions. Below I will first describe the new experimental results we have obtained during the revision period and then discuss our thoughts regarding the mechanisms of how autophagosomes contribute to phagosome degradation.</p><p>We developed a P<italic><sub>his-72</sub> his-72::gfp::mCherry</italic> reporter as a pH reporter for the phagosomal lumen. The HIS-72::GFP::mCherry fusion protein inside the nucleus of an apoptotic cell is internalized into the phagosomal lumen when engulfment occurs. Due to GFP, but not mCherry, being sensitive to acidic pH, in the phagosomal lumen, the GFP signal will gradually reduce over time while the mCherry signal remains stable. We thus use the signal intensity ratio of GFP/mCherry as an index of acidification over time.</p><p>We found that, compared to wild-type, in <italic>atg-7</italic> mutants, acidification is delayed. However, compared to the <italic>cup-5</italic> mutants, in which the lysosomal function is severely defective, the acidification defect in <italic>atg-7</italic> mutants appears to be rather modest. <italic>cup-5</italic> encodes a lysosomal TRP channel protein and a homolog of human Mucolipin IV.</p><p>We also developed an assay to monitor the hydrolytic activity of NUC-1, a lysosomal endonuclease called DNaseII. We found that, unlike the previous report concluding that NUC-1 acts in cells undergoing apoptosis to generate chromatin DNA fragments [15], NUC-1 actually acts in the phagosomal lumen of the engulfing cells to degrade chromatin DNA of the engulfed apoptotic cells (Pickett J., Auld N., Lucas, L., Pena-Ramos O., and Zhou, Z., unpublished results). During the above study, we established HIS-72::mCherry as a reporter for monitoring the degradation of the chromatin DNA. HIS-72, a histone B H3.3, together with other histones and the DNA wrapping around them, form the nucleosome, the fundamental subunit of the chromatin.</p><p>Inside the phagosomal lumen, the HIS-72::mCherry signal appears as a condensed red disc, representing the nucleus of the engulfed apoptotic cell. We found that in the wildtype strain, the degradation of chromatin DNA of the apoptotic cell inside the phagosomal lumen resulted in the subsequent reduction of the size of the mCherry<sup>+</sup> disc. On the contrary, in the <italic>nuc-1</italic> mutant background, the size of the mCherry<sup>+</sup> disc inside the phagosomal lumen remains the same over a long period of time (&gt;60 min), indicating the lack of degradation of chromatin DNA (unpublished result). Thus the reduction of the size of the HIS-72::mCherry disc is a good representation of the DNA degradation activity of NUC-1. Besides <italic>nuc-1</italic> mutants, in <italic>cup-5(n3264)</italic> mutant embryos, within 60 min post phagosome formation, the average diameter of the mCherry<sup>+</sup> disc remains at 89% of the 0 min-value (Figure 14E). These above results have validated HIS72::mCherry as a chromatin DNA digestion marker. In <italic>atg-7(bp411)</italic> mutant embryos, that value is reduced to 66% of the 0 min-value; in addition, the diameter of the mCherry<sup>+</sup> disc in 25% of the samples is &gt; 80% of the 0 min-value. These results indicate that in <italic>atg-7</italic> mutants, there is a defect in the digestion of chromatin DNA, yet this defect is rather moderate.</p><p>Overall, the two new assays allowed us to identify the modest defects in phagosome acidification and DNA digestion caused by the <italic>atg-7(bp411)</italic> mutation. These defects likely contribute to the inefficient phagosome degradation. However, it is not clear whether these modest defects are sufficient to cause the overall delay of phagosome degradation observed from the autophagy mutants (Figure 6). Less than 41% of the LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta population observed to fuse with phagosomes is autolysosomes (LGG<sup>+</sup> NUC-1<sup>+</sup> puncta). The autolysosome population might contribute lysosomal activity to phagosomes after fusion. Meanwhile, the rest of the LGG<sup>+</sup> population, which are autophagosomes that are not fused to lysosomes, are likely to contribute non-lysosomal activities to phagosomes after fusion. Actually, autolysosomes are also capable of contributing non-lysosomal activities to phagosomes. The non-lysosomal activities might regulate a currently unknown aspect(s) of phagosome degradation. Alternatively, they might regulate the acidification and/or DNA hydrolysis in a manner independent of lysosomes. We revised the Discussion section, adding our hypothesis of the possible contribution of both the lysosomal and non-lysosomal activities by the autophagosomes and autolysosomes populations. We also proposed two alternative candidate substances from autophagosomes that might act to facilitate phagosome degradation. (Please also see our response to Reviewer #2’s “Recommendations for the authors, point 6”.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They should also establish the nature of the fusing structures: are they truly double-membraned autophagosomes or have they undergone fusion with lysosomes (i.e. become autolysosomes)?</p></disp-quote><p>Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have detected multiple double-membrane vesicles on the surfaces of phagosomes that contain germ cell corpses (Figure 4). These vesicles resemble the morphology of autophagosomes (Figure 4).</p><p>This evidence supports the conclusion that autophagosomes fuse to phagosomes. Please see our “Essential Revisions – Response (Experiment 1)” for the description of the TEM experiment. In addition, as already mentioned, in strains co-expressing the LGG and NUC-1 markers, 59.3% and 63.5% of LGG-1<sup>+</sup> and LGG-2<sup>+</sup> vesicles found on phagosomal surfaces and subsequently fuse to phagosomes are NUC-1<sup>-</sup>, respectively (Figure 12), which also indicate that the majority of the LGG<sup>+</sup> puncta that fuse to phagosomes are autophagosomes that are not fused to autolysosomes. Furthermore, in <italic>rab-7</italic> mutants, in which the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes is blocked, LGG<sup>+</sup> particles are heavily enriched on the surfaces of phagosomes (Figure 8), further demonstrating that autophagosomes are able to attach to phagosomes without prior fusion to lysosomes.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
