Mutations in ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) are often associated with myopathies with microscopic core-like structures in the muscle fiber. In this study, we identify a mouse RyR1 model in which heterozygous animals display clinical and pathological hallmarks of myopathy with core-like structures. The RyR1 mutation decreases sensitivity to activated calcium release and myoplasmic calcium levels, subsequently affecting mitochondrial calcium and ATP production. Mutant muscle shows a persistent potassium leak and disrupted expression of regulators of potassium homeostasis. Inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels or increasing interstitial potassium by diet or FDA-approved drugs can reverse the muscle weakness, fatigue-like physiology and pathology. We identify regulators of potassium homeostasis as biomarkers of disease that may reveal therapeutic targets in human patients with myopathy of central core disease (CCD). Altogether, our results suggest that amelioration of potassium leaks through potassium homeostasis mechanisms may minimize muscle damage of myopathies due to certain RyR1 mutations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02923.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02923.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02923.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Skeletal muscle covers our skeleton and allows us to move around. One disorder that leads to weakness in skeletal muscle—known as central core disease—can leave affected infants ‘floppy’ and delay the development of motor skills such as sitting, crawling, and walking. While no cure or treatment currently exists for the disease, researchers have found that most cases are connected to a mutation in the gene that makes a protein called ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1).</p><p>RyR1 belongs to a family of proteins that create channels for the controlled release of calcium ions from stores within cells. For muscle cells to contract, calcium ions must be released from these internal stores at the same time as potassium ions leave the cells. To relax the muscle cells, calcium ions are pumped back into the internal stores and potassium ions are taken back into the cell. Previous studies have established a role for RyR1 in the contraction of skeletal muscle, but the precise molecular details are not known.</p><p>Here, Hanson et al. studied mice that had symptoms of central core disease due to a mutation in the gene that makes RyR1. The muscle weakness in these mice was caused by defects that hindered the release of calcium ions from internal stores and leakage of potassium ions from the muscle cells.</p><p>The experiments reveal that a high-potassium diet alleviates the symptoms of disease in the mice by increasing the amount of potassium surrounding the muscle cells. Treatment with an existing drug called glibenclamide also reversed the disease symptoms by reducing the leakage of potassium ions from the cells.</p><p>Hanson et al. also found several genes involved in controlling potassium ion levels in cells that could act as indicators of the presence of the disease. These findings suggest that therapies targeting the control of potassium ion levels in muscle cells could minimize muscle damage in patients with central core disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02923.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02923.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>congenital myopathy</kwd><kwd>potassium homeostasis</kwd><kwd>ryanodine receptor</kwd><kwd>KATP channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanson</surname><given-names>M Gartz</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilde</surname><given-names>Jonathan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Minic</surname><given-names>Angela D</given-names></name><name><surname>Niswander</surname><given-names>Lee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MDA-69338</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanson</surname><given-names>M Gartz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-NS059267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanson</surname><given-names>M Gartz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mouse model of human muscle myopathy is used to provide mechanistic insight, identify possible biomarkers of disease, and suggest possible therapeutic strategies to alleviate muscle weakness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myopathies due to mutations in RyR1 are inherited and currently incurable. Congenital myopathies are characterized by hypotonia and delay of motor development with weakness in skeletal muscles. In normal muscle, nuclei are located at the periphery of the myofibers and the mitochondria reside throughout the myofiber. Muscle biopsies of patients with myopathies and mutations in ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) show centralized nuclei as well as disorganized areas in the center of the myofiber, called cores, that lack mitochondria and are devoid of metabolic activity, reflective of cellular damage. The most common RyR1-associated myopathy is central core disease (CCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jungbluth, 2007</xref>). In addition, RyR1 mutations in muscle cause diseases such as multi-mini core disease (MMD), hypokalemic periodic paralysis, and malignant hyperthermia (MH), although the phenotype/genotype relationship is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujii et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marchant et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Treves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wilmshurst et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Muscle movement is produced through excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling elicited by t-tubule conductance of the muscle action potential. Depolarization stimulates the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1) to mechanically open RyR1 channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which release intracellular calcium stores to flood the myofiber with calcium and initiate muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Numa et al., 1990</xref>). During contractions, muscle cells influx Na<sup>+</sup> and efflux K<sup>+</sup>, leading to depolarization of the membrane, a rise in extracellular K<sup>+</sup>, and loss of excitability. The myoplasmic loss of potassium is stabilized via increased potassium conductance from the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lindinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nielsen et al., 2004</xref>) and the activation of sodium–potassium ATPase (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase) transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clausen, 2013b</xref>).</p><p>During muscle contractions, the enzymes Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, and myosin ATPase consume most of the stored ATP. Myosin ATPase is considered to account for the majority of ATP consumption at 60–70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase is assumed to account for the majority of remaining ATP, while Na<sup>+</sup>–K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase can consume up to 10% of available ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Homsher, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clausen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barclay et al., 2007</xref>). As ATP levels decrease during repeated muscle contractions and fatigue, ATP-sensitive K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels open causing potassium efflux, membrane depolarization, and inhibition of the action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gong et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Thus, potassium homeostasis mechanisms preserve E–C coupled release of internal calcium stores, protect against muscle fatigue, and prevent excessive K<sup>+</sup> loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clausen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cifelli et al., 2008</xref>) and may protect the muscle during ATP loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gong et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we explore the function of RyR1 as it pertains to mechanisms of muscle weakness and potassium homeostasis. Through a forward genetic screen, we identified a mutation in <italic>Ryr1</italic> that causes muscle weakness and myopathic pathological hallmarks in heterozygous mice. Furthermore, we examined the potential of this animal model for clinical and therapeutic studies. Mutant <italic>Ryr1</italic> muscle showed decreased concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in the myoplasm and an increased permeability for K<sup>+</sup> in muscles at rest. In vitro, the potassium leak can be rectified through the application of higher concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> or inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. In vivo, the muscle weakness and myopathic pathology can be reversed through increased interstitial potassium and pharmacological inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels either by diet or FDA-approved drugs, suggesting defects in K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis mechanisms as possible myopathological hallmarks due to mutations in RyR1. K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels and other regulators of potassium transport are misexpressed in mutant muscle and may partly underlie the disease phenotype in this myopathic animal model. Finally, we find that human patients with CCD show dysregulation of genes involved in the control of potassium homeostasis and suggest that these may serve as important disease biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of RyR1 mutation that induces a myopathy with core-like structures in mice</title><p>Through a forward genetic screen in mice, we identified a mutation in which heterozygous mutant mice display muscle weakness.

However, the number of cores present in muscle biopsies is not reflective of the degree of muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Because proximal muscles of limbs are typically taken for muscle biopsies in patients, we examined the vastus lateralis and adductor magnus.

This suggests that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak that significantly elevates resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not present in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle fibers. In addition, the reduced sensitivity of <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle fibers to 4-C<italic>m</italic>C may suggest an increase in SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

In rat skeletal muscle, K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 pores have a single-channel conductance of around 80 pS, although the current densities (pA) of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels can vary between muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tricarico et al., 2006</xref>). To examine current densities of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in soleus muscle fibers, inside-out patch excision in ATP-free solutions was performed. Currents from excised patches of 2-month old wild-type soleus muscle fibers were −106 ± 12 pA with an average pipette resistance of 2.2 ± 0.4 MΩ after −60 mV voltage injection (n = 10 fibers from 3 mice). In 2-month old <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> soleus muscle fibers, the currents increased to −142 ± 24 pA with an average pipette resistance of 2.3 ± 0.3 MΩ (n = 10 fibers from 3 mice). Thus, <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> soleus muscle fibers showed a 34 ± 9% increase in normalized current densities compared to wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Glibenclamide addition removed the current differences between <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle, suggesting that the channels opened in the inside-out patch were K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,E</xref>, n = 8 fibers from three mice for both <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup>). These data indicate an increase in K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity in the membrane of <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle and this could explain the increased potassium efflux in spite of the decreased ATP levels in mutant muscle.</p><p>Potassium transport activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels is positively regulated by the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK (<italic>Prkkaa1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), and this transcript was upregulated in 2-month old <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, 0.6% diet). The sulfonylurea receptors (SUR) are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and subunits of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. SUR1 (<italic>Abcc8</italic>), which binds to K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2, was significantly upregulated in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscles at the RNA level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Thus, the increased expression of genes that encode proteins upstream of K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels or that interact with K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels might contribute to the increased activity of K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels in membrane and t-tubules. ClC-1-dependent chloride conductance is increased during muscle fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pedersen et al., 2009</xref>), yet ClC-1 transcripts were not significantly altered in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle compared to <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> littermates. <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle showed a rapid increase in intracellular potassium when K<sub>ATP</sub> channels were blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D,F</xref>), suggesting that mechanisms of K<sup>+</sup> transport into the cell are active in these muscles but may not be able to overcome the potassium leak and compensate for decreased intracellular K<sup>+</sup>. Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity maintains Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> equilibrium at the membrane in the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kristensen and Juel, 2010</xref>). Transcripts of the pump subunit Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1 were increased in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that expression levels of genes and proteins in the potassium transport pathway are dysregulated when RyR1-dependent calcium release is disrupted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Amelioration of myopathic phenotype through potassium supplementation</title><p>As our in vitro studies showed that increased extracellular K<sup>+</sup> leads to a normalization of intracellular K<sup>+</sup> in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscles, we then asked whether increased serum K<sup>+</sup> could alter the in vivo phenotype of <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> mice.

Therefore, we asked whether these treatments might decrease K<sup>+</sup> ion permeability in muscle and whether this could ameliorate the physiological and pathological symptoms of the myopathy in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> mice. To test these hypotheses, <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice were weaned onto 0.6% K<sup>+</sup> (level of potassium in standard mouse chow), and four weeks later, when muscle weakness is already observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), they were given either 5.2% K<sup>+</sup> diet or enalapril (0.02 mg/ml in drinking water) for an additional four weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, for blood pressure readings).

First, we identified a mutation in <italic>RyR1</italic> that induces a myopathy with ultrastructural hallmarks of cores similar to the <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>I4895T/+</italic></sup> mutant mouse, a known mouse model of CCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boncompagni et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2010</xref>). Second, we used this myopathic mouse model to identify a novel link between decreased internal calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), decreased mitochondrial ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and altered potassium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), mechanisms that are important in controlling excitability in muscle. Third, we provide evidence that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are elevated in the membrane and overactive, leading to increased potassium efflux in this myopathic mouse model, which could have direct effects on membrane excitability. Fourth, we provide clinically relevant findings that suggest a potassium-enriched diet, perhaps in combination with the sulfonylurea class of anti-diabetic drugs, which are potential therapies for myopathies with defects in potassium homeostasis. Using multiple assays and different muscles with different fiber type compositions, our data are consistent and show muscle weakness, pathological changes, and gene expression changes. The consistency of our data between muscle types further strengthens our hypotheses and conclusions. It should be noted that malignant hyperthermia, a disease associated with <italic>RyR1</italic> mutations, is sensitive to potassium chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moulds and Denborough, 1974</xref>), and therefore a testing method in patients or biopsy samples need to be initiated prior to potassium supplementation. Importantly, our work identifies potential diagnostic biomarkers of disease in patients with CCD and potentially non-RyR1 myopathies, which could be utilized to identify patients who may be candidates for potassium modulation-based therapies.</p><p>The physiological mechanisms underlying RyR1-related myopathy are not well defined. One histological hallmark of RyR1-related myopathy is the presence of muscle cell cores, which indicate focal mitochondrial loss and decreased ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boncompagni et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jungbluth et al., 2011</xref>). The <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> mutant mouse muscles have decreased intracellular calcium, core-like structures and decreased ATP content, as well as other ultrastructural hallmarks of core-like diseases. Data from our model suggest that proper calcium release from internal stores is required for mitochondrial production of ATP and increased ATP levels, which in a feedback loop can then stimulate RyR1-dependent calcium release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meissner et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laver et al., 2001</xref>). As muscle ATP decreases, K<sub>ATP</sub> channels open to efflux K<sup>+</sup> from the myoplasm to the interstitial space, which may protect against excessive muscle contraction. Efflux of K<sup>+</sup> into the t-tubules depolarizes the tubular membranes and inhibits the opening of sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fraser et al., 2011</xref>). Sodium channel inhibition decreases the probability that a nerve-derived action potential will activate DHPR receptors that mechanically activate Ryanodine receptors, and thus myoplasmic release of stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> is reduced. Therefore, in the <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> model, RyR1 dysfunction, decreased internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, potassium leakage and increased K<sub>ATP</sub>-dependent efflux may potentiate muscle weakness and muscle deterioration associated with core-like structures. The chronic low-level calcium uptake into the mitochondria may then induce long-term mitochondrial dysfunction. The histological appearance of cores in the center of the muscle but more normal staining near the plasma membrane may be explained by the possibility that more centralized mitochondria receive less calcium, whereas SOCE and calcium influx from external sources at the plasma membrane may provide buffering to mitochondria that are adjacent to the plasma membrane.</p><p>Our data suggest that the SR calcium release deficiencies and decreased mitochondrial ATP production might be sufficient to induce the myopathic phenotype in <italic>RyR1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> mice. ATP provides the energy to cause muscle contraction, and relative ATP/ADP levels are important in providing information about muscle fatigue and ion homeostasis to the cell. In skeletal muscle, 90% of ATP is used for muscle contractions by the myosin ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase, and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Homsher, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clausen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barclay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clausen, 2013b</xref>). Additional ATP-dependent enzymes may be particularly sensitive to a 30% loss of ATP in <italic>RyR1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle and this might contribute to a significant effect on excitability and membrane homeostasis after muscle contraction and fatigue. During skeletal muscle fatigue and fluctuations in potassium homeostasis, K<sub>ATP</sub> channels open and efflux potassium from the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pedersen et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, plasma membrane and t-tubule K<sub>ATP</sub> channels become more active as ATP is utilized and ADP accumulates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baczko et al., 2005</xref>). K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are mechanistically linked to the DHPR-RyR1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tricarico et al., 1999</xref>) but the ATP binding sites within RyR1 are at a considerable distance from the point mutation in the RyR1<sup>AG</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Popova et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity increases potassium conductance within the t-tubules after an action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gramolini and Renaud, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cifelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banas et al., 2011</xref>). These data suggest a mechanistic link between E–C coupling, RyR1 function, ATP levels, K<sub>ATP</sub> channel function, and potassium homeostasis.</p><p>In our mouse model of a myopathy with core-like structures, increased intake of dietary potassium increases interstitial K+, which leads to an increase in myoplasmic K<sup>+</sup>. The resulting increase in interstitial K<sup>+</sup> might counterbalance the K<sup>+</sup> leak permeability and increase membrane excitability. A more excitable membrane increases the likelihood of voltage-dependent DHPR-RyR1 release of calcium from the SR during an action potential. Increased calcium in the myoplasm will enhance mitochondrial uptake of calcium. We propose that the waves of increased calcium into the mitochondria enhance ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffiths and Rutter, 2009</xref>), which inhibits K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opening and reverses the K<sup>+</sup> leak, and stimulates RyR1-dependent calcium release from internal stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meissner et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laver et al., 2001</xref>), further perpetuating mitochondrial ATP production in this model of myopathy in which the phenotype can be ameliorated by increased potassium. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the potassium supplementation may work indirectly at the muscle by depolarizing the locomotor circuit to increase neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction and potentiate the voltage-dependent DHPR-RyR1 release of calcium.</p><p>Defective potassium mechanisms appear to be the hallmark of <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> mice as evidenced by 1) increased K<sub>ATP</sub> channel current that would drive K<sup>+</sup> efflux, 2) decreased internal K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, and 3) a potassium leak. Altogether this may suggest an increase in interstitial K<sup>+</sup>, but serum K<sup>+</sup> levels may not correlate with interstitial K<sup>+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clausen, 2013a</xref>) and increased interstitial K<sup>+</sup> would be expected to be rapidly removed by diffusion and through the capillary network of blood vessels. We did not observe a significant difference in serum K<sup>+</sup> levels in 2-month old <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> mice, but there was an increase in serum K<sup>+</sup> in 6-month old <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> mice relative to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In vitro, the rapid rise in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle bathed in 3 mM K<sup>+</sup> and treated with glibenclamide, an inhibitor of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, is in part due to the transport of K<sup>+</sup> into the myoplasm through K<sub>IR</sub>2.1 and Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases. These mechanisms that transport K<sup>+</sup> into the myoplasm in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscles may not be sufficient in vivo to compensate for the K<sup>+</sup> leakage or the increased activation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels located on the plasma membrane. We suggest that <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> myopathic muscles have a K<sup>+</sup> leak that persistently decreases intracellular K<sup>+</sup> and leads to a loss of membrane excitability.</p><p>Amelioration of muscle weakness through low-cost potassium supplementation could have profound impact on patients suffering from core myopathies and these data may have important implications for other disease states. Recent guidelines from the World Health Organization suggest that the world population is consuming inadequate levels of dietary potassium, which can lead to heart disease, stroke, respiratory distress, and increased fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartl, 2013</xref>). Our studies suggest that <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle is in a myopathic state due to decreased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, decreased K<sup>+</sup> levels, decreased ATP levels and increased activation of K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels, which may mimic a fatigue-like state. Currently, myopathies with mutations in RyR1 are not considered metabolic myopathies, even though RyR1-S2844D mice with an intracellular calcium leak and muscle weakness exhibit decreased levels of mitochondrial activity and metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>). Considering that our data suggest mitochondrial dysregulation of metabolic pathways and potassium signaling in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle and muscles from patients with CCD, we were intrigued by the findings that some fatigue-inducing metabolic myopathies can be rescued through dietary potassium supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Villabona et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caradonna et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ismail et al., 2001</xref>). In the future, it will be of interest to determine whether the positive response to increased potassium levels is applicable to myopathies due to other RyR1 mutations and to other genetic causes. Our data also suggest that muscles of human CCD patients are sensitive to pathways that mediate potassium homeostasis. <italic>ATPA1</italic> (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1) showed increased expression only in CCD patients with mutations in <italic>RYR1</italic>, suggesting a selective sensitivity to this ATP-sensitive transporter. With our suggestion that K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channel inhibition may help protect skeletal muscles from the formation of cores, one might predict that the human patient data would show consistently higher levels of KCNJ11 (K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2) transcripts in the muscle biopsies. This is the case in CCD patients, although the level is variable. This variability could be due to the location of the muscle biopsy, as K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels in mice are more highly expressed in glycolytic muscle than oxidative skeletal muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banas et al., 2011</xref>). These biomarkers may therefore provide a less invasive approach to identify patients with CCD myopathies and may eventually identify patients who are suitable candidates for treatment of CCD through modulation of potassium signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Forward genetic screen and mouse strains</title><p>ENU mutagenesis was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasarskis et al., 1998</xref>) on males of C57BL/6J background and then outcrossed onto 129S1/Svlmj background to score G3 embryos at embryonic day 18.5 for recessive mutations that affect embryonic locomotion.

However they raise substantial concerns on the specificity of the phenomenon described and, even more importantly, on the electrophysiological mechanism leading to the pathology.</p><p>Finally the manuscript requires a significant revision both in terms of addressing specific issues (e.g. why a given muscle was chosen) and a major editing for a high number of “incorrect or misleading statements, irrelevant references and poorly described results”.</p><p><italic>Reviewer # 1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting report on a RyR1 mutant mouse model in which various effects of the mutation have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. It is a well presented and detailed study with therapeutic implications. Specificity is touched on but not addressed by the study. It is important to know if the changes observed are specific to this mutant of RyR1 and if similar changes occur when other genes that cause a myopathy are mutated.</p><p>Additional points to address:</p><p>1) CCD is a well defined clinical and pathological entity caused by mutations in RyR1. What other genes, as implied in the Introduction, can cause it? Cores, as a pathological feature, can be associated with defects in several genes but these disorders are not central core disease.</p><p>2) Not all cases of CCD show central nuclei, although they can be a feature and the number variable. The central/internal nuclei in the H&amp;E figures are difficult to see in the images that appear to have a lot of dirt and blemishes.</p><p>3) Why was soleus chosen for most of the studies but images of femoral muscles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the rectus femoris of treated mice? Similarly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig9">Figures 7 and 9</xref> soleus is not shown.</p><p>4) What was the pathology in the diaphragm? Diaphragm is mentioned in the Results but not in the Methods.</p><p>5) In the Methods, immunolabelling is mentioned. No immunolabelling appears in the Results.</p><p>6) The cores shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are not as clearly delineated as in typical CCD and both fibre types are affected. A typical feature of CCD is uniformity of fibre type and a slow fibre profile of most fibres. Fibre typing is mentioned in the Discussion but differences between fibre types are not addressed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> the increase in COX may be a reflection of fibre typing, which should be addressed.</p><p>7) Second paragraph in the Discussion section: a feature of cores in CCD is the absence of mitochondria, not the reduced activity. Activity elsewhere in the fibre is usually normal.</p><p>8) Z line streaming in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> is not apparent, and the arrow in 1K is not indicating the Z line streaming. In 1L the structure shown is not clearly a T–tubules. These are usually only apparent at triads so showing the rest of the triad would be more informative. In addition T–tubules do not usually show any internal content.</p><p><italic>Reviewer # 2:</italic></p><p>This work provides a novel hypothesis to explain the skeletal muscle function defects associated with central core disease and proposes corresponding therapeutic options. Using a new mouse model that presents hallmarks of CCD, the authors suggest that diseased muscle cells suffer from defective mitochondrial function and ATP production, decreased intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration due to over–activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, depolarized resting membrane voltage. Authors propose that altered RyR1 function decreases ATP production which opens K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, leading to a decreased resting membrane potential which reduces membrane excitability and contributes to loss of force. Increased K<sup>+</sup> diet or K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibition rescues histological defects, intracellular K<sup>+</sup> level, mitochondrial function defects and muscle performance. Data from human muscle samples suggest that increased expression of several K<sup>+</sup> channels may be used to biomark CCD.</p><p>This is an impressive study in terms of amount of collected data with a quite amazing diversity of techniques mastered by the authors. The rescuing effects of the K<sup>+</sup> diet and K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibition on the defects observed in the diseased muscles also appear quite spectacular. While the overall general trend of data tends to convincingly highlight that there is a problem of membrane excitability associated with the diseased muscle model and that there is therapeutic potential for treating this problem, there are two major issues that I find do considerably weaken the manuscript.</p><p>My first major concern relates to the model proposed by the authors to interpret their data. I first find it difficult to believe that a 30 % decrease in ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), supposedly caused by reduced RyR1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, would be sufficient to open K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. But even assuming so, I find it even harder to understand how an increased K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity produces a chronic membrane depolarization whereas the opposite would be expected. Increased K<sup>+</sup> conductance should favor a resting voltage where net K<sup>+</sup> flux across the membrane is limited, so why K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opening in this model produces a decreased intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration and a membrane depolarization is very hard to understand. Similarly, how can increasing extracellular K<sup>+</sup> lead to hyperpolarization is also counter–intuitive. The authors propose that diseased muscle cells are in the depolarized paradoxal P2 state, but it is completely unclear how this can be due to the increased K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity as one would rather expect a P2 state to result from an increased inward cationic conductance. This whole interpretation is very confusing and not convincing.</p><p>My second major concern is that the manuscript suffers from a number of incorrect or misleading statements, irrelevant references and poorly described results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer # 3:</italic> The authors have identified a mutation in RyR1 that shows hallmarks of central core disease (e.g. muscle weakness). The finding is interesting, but the physiological/pathophysiological conclusions are unfortunately lacking scientific bearing.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: <italic>RyR1</italic><sup><italic>AG</italic></sup> fails to release Ca<sup>2+</sup> after depolarizing the membrane. As mentioned by authors, DHPR (Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1) is responsible for coupling to RyR1, which then releases Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The authors need to verify that the E–C coupling is functioning and that the complete lack of release is not due to impaired DHPR–RyR1 coupling. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figure 1E and 3A</xref> it appears as 4–CMC can release some Ca<sup>2+</sup> from SR via RyR1, hence the complete lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> seems not only be caused by impaired RyR1 gating. This needs to be further investigated by the authors. For example, muscle contraction is frequency dependent. The authors should add data showing the frequency–Ca<sup>2+</sup> relationship.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows that myotubes are not contracting; however, myotubes are immature cells that rarely contract in response to electrical stimulation. Instead the authors need to do these experiments on adult muscle fibers. Instead of expressing cells as “% contracting cells”, the data should be presented as factional shortening.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors stated that membrane depolarization does not result in Ca<sup>2+</sup> hence does not make any contractions possible. However in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the mice appears to be able to use their muscles. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the authors measure force with grip strength and hanging score, unfortunately these methods are not specific to force production but also involve action potential quality and other parameters. The authors need to express force produced in a more specific way (e.g. ex vivo measurements) and also measure the cross–sectional area of the fibers to verify that the lack of force is not due to decreased muscle size.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors have moved into isolated adult soleus muscles which is a slow–twitch fiber type. Please add pictures of the soleus muscles loaded with Rhod–2 or MitoSox.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, are diaphragm muscles used as well as soleus? Diaphragm is of mixed muscle fibers, do they also show the same mitochondrial parameters as soleus? Do fast–twitch muscle fibers also show signs of muscle weakness?</p><p>6) Rhod–2 measures mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows less Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in the mutant muscle. The authors claim that this is due to mitochondrial defects, but the authors needs to verify that this is not reflecting less Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from RyR1?</p><p>7) To draw the conclusion that there is no Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak based on no difference in MitoSox signal is not significantly correct since Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak needs to be measured in an alternative way. Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak should be assessed with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging e.g. with Mag–Fluo or another low affinity dye. In addition, how is the MitoSox fluorescence normalized? A positive control is necessary. H202 can be used to substrate inhibit SOD which could give indications of mitochondrial ROS handling.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows a TMRE fluorescence that assesses mitochondrial membrane potential. Please explain why Saponin was added to the fibers. In addition, in order to get an idea of the membrane potential the fibers should be treated with FCCP in the end of the experiment and then normalized to this value.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02923.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>As suggested, we have performed new experiments and obtained additional data to support and extend our observations.

However, we feel this is beyond the scope of our current manuscript that provides a thorough mechanistic understanding of a novel allele of RyR1 and extends the mechanistic insights to therapeutic strategies and to samples from human patients with CCD myopathy. At the end of the Discussion we have raised this important point: “In the future, it will be of interest to determine whether the positive response to increased potassium levels is applicable to myopathies due to other RyR1 mutations and to other genetic causes.”</p><p><italic>Additional points to address</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) CCD is a well defined clinical and pathological entity caused by mutations in RyR1. What other genes, as implied in the Introduction, can cause it? Cores, as a pathological feature, can be associated with defects in several genes but these disorders are not central core disease</italic>.</p><p>In consideration of this comment, we have decided not to classify this mouse model as CCD but instead have used a broader term of a “myopathy with core-like structures”.</p><p><italic>2) Not all cases of CCD show central nuclei, although they can be a feature and the number variable. The central/internal nuclei in the H&amp;E figures are difficult to see in the images that appear to have a lot of dirt and blemishes</italic>.</p><p>We have quantified the number of central/internal nuclei in the text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. These central nuclei are readily detectable in the mutant muscle whereas we detected none in the wildtype myofibers, and hence we consider central nuclei to be part of the myopathic phenotype. However, as noted by the reviewer, classification of CCD is difficult and therefore we have changed the description to a myopathy with core-like structures.</p><p><italic>3) Why was soleus chosen for most of the studies but images of femoral muscles shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>and the rectus femoris of treated mice? Similarly in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig9"><italic>Figures 7 and 9</italic></xref> <italic>soleus is not shown</italic>.</p><p>We choose the vastus lateralis for all mouse histology shown in panels. This was an error in writing from a previous submission in which more panels were used. We have corrected this. As stated in the second paragraph of the Results section: “Because proximal muscles of limbs are typically taken for muscle biopsies in patients, we examined the vastus lateralis and adductor magnus. Additionally, we examined the soleus muscle as it is commonly used for in vitro studies of fatigue and Ryr1-associated myopathy in mouse models.” We also chose the soleus because it is an easily accessible muscle that is impacted in myopathies. In addition, the soleus is a flattened muscle, which is advantageous for the inside-out path clamp experiments and for confocal microscopy visualization for the PBFI and Fura-2 AM studies. Moreover, the soleus was the predominant muscle examined in the <italic>RyR1</italic><sup><italic>I4895T</italic></sup> and <italic>RyR1</italic><sup><italic>Y522S/WT</italic></sup> mouse mutants for ultrastructural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boncompagni et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zvaritch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boncompagni et al., 2010</xref>). We chose to examine multiple muscles because myopathies are diseases of limb muscle weakness, not weakness of a particular muscle. Moreover, we examined multiple muscle types for gene expression by RT-PCR because the muscle chosen for patient muscle biopsies can be variable and the site of biopsy is unknown to us under the terms of our IRB protocol. Using multiple assays and different muscles with different fiber type compositions, our data are consistent and show muscle weakness, pathological changes, and gene expression changes. The consistency of our data between muscle types further strengthens our hypotheses and conclusions and should not be seen as a detriment to our manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) What was the pathology in the diaphragm? Diaphragm is mentioned in the Results but not in the Methods</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the diaphragm data to avoid confusion with another muscle examined. Nonetheless, the diaphragm data are consistent with the phenotype described.</p><p><italic>5) In the Methods, immunolabelling is mentioned. No immunolabelling appears in the Results</italic>.</p><p>We are sorry for this error; it has been corrected.</p><p><italic>6) The cores shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>are not as clearly delineated as in typical CCD and both fibre types are affected. A typical feature of CCD is uniformity of fibre type and a slow fibre profile of most fibres. Fibre typing is mentioned in the Discussion but differences between fibre types are not addressed. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>the increase in COX may be a reflection of fibre typing, which should be addressed</italic>.</p><p>There are numerous papers in the literature using NADH-TR staining that show cores are not always clearly delineated, such as the recent paper by Romero et al. in a patient with eccentric core disease caused by a mutation in <italic>MYH7</italic> (2014, JNNP) that shows some delineated cores and some non-delineated cores in the same sample. We quantified the cores in Type 1 muscle fibers at 12 months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) which were comparable to the NADH-TR staining delineations as Zvaritch (2009, PNAS). Cores were not present at 2 months of age so we are not reporting the fiber types within the muscle and instead focused on internalized nuclei (a hallmark for muscle damage, potassium and calcium levels and phenotypic weakness). Because of the difficulty of defining CCD, we no longer suggest that this is a model for CCD and instead classify the histological changes within the muscle as a myopathy with a core-like structure that can be delineated and non-delineated.</p><p><italic>7) Second paragraph in the Discussion section: a feature of cores in CCD is the absence of mitochondria, not the reduced activity. Activity elsewhere in the fibre is usually normal</italic>.</p><p>Our data clearly show regions of mitochondrial dysfunction and regions of apparently normal mitochondria by histology, COX and NADH-TR staining, and mitotracker labeling. However, we cannot definitively say that mitochondria are absent in cores, and therefore we have chosen to use the term mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p><italic>8) Z line streaming in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1J</italic></xref> <italic>is not apparent, and the arrow in 1K is not indicating the Z line streaming. In 1L the structure shown is not clearly a T–tubules. These are usually only apparent at triads so showing the rest of the triad would be more informative. In addition T–tubules do not usually show any internal content</italic>.</p><p>We have better placed the arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref> to identify the Z line streaming errors. Moreover, our ultrastructural analysis in the 2-month soleus muscle is similar to the study of I4895T and Y522S RyR1 mutant soleus (2 month) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boncompagni et al., (2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2010)</xref>. Thus, the histopathological and ultrastructural disturbances that we observe in our mouse model are similar to I4895T and Y522S RyR1 mutations used to model human CCD.</p><p><italic>Reviewer # 2</italic>:</p><p><italic>My first major concern relates to the model proposed by the authors to interpret their data. I first find it difficult to believe that a 30 % decrease in ATP (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>), supposedly caused by reduced RyR1 Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup> <italic>release, would be sufficient to open K</italic><sub><italic>ATP</italic></sub> <italic>channels</italic>.</p><p>First we would like to point out that ATP level usually decreases by only 20% during strenuous exercise in muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sahlin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karatzaferi et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karatzaferi et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, any additional decrease in ATP may alter other ATP dependent mechanisms. Second, 90% of ATP is used for muscle contractions by the myosin ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Homsher, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clausen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barclay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clausen, 2013b</xref>). With such limited amounts for other muscle processes (K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in particular), a 30% loss might be expected to have a significant effect on fiber force. Third, we also show that other regulators of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity (AMPK, SUR1) are upregulated in the <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle, which would be expected to increase K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity. Fourth, we have functional data using pharmacological methods that shows an increase in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> upon K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibition. These data along with our new data showing a potassium leak (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis through ratiometric imaging of myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) provide strong mechanistic insights. We have now included comments related to all of these points within the Discussion, as well as new data and figures to substantiate these points.</p><p><italic>But even assuming so, I find it even harder to understand how an increased K</italic><sub><italic>ATP</italic></sub> <italic>channel activity produces a chronic membrane depolarization whereas the opposite would be expected. Increased K</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>conductance should favor a resting voltage where net K</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>flux across the membrane is limited, so why K</italic><sub><italic>ATP</italic></sub> <italic>channel opening in this model produces a decreased intracellular K</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>concentration and a membrane depolarization is very hard to understand</italic>.</p><p><italic>Similarly, how can increasing extracellular K</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>lead to hyperpolarization is also counter–intuitive. The authors propose that diseased muscle cells are in the depolarized paradoxal P2 state, but it is completely unclear how this can be due to the increased K</italic><sub><italic>ATP</italic></sub> <italic>channel activity as one would rather expect a P2 state to result from an increased inward cationic conductance. This whole interpretation is very confusing and not convincing</italic>.</p><p>In response to this question and those of reviewer 3, we have performed additional experiments that help to resolve this confusion but which have also led to the decision to remove the membrane potential sharp electrode recordings from the paper. Inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity raises intracellular potassium levels in wildtype muscle, suggesting that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels either efflux K<sup>+</sup> or increase the permeability of K<sup>+</sup> ions across the membrane of the muscle as a function of potassium homeostasis. In heterozygous mutant muscle we show increased expression and activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> we show a decrease in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> over time, which can be reversed by inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Upon performing additional sharp electrode recordings using a standard method, we found that the fresh soleus muscle underwent contractions during dissection, mounting and the introduction of the sharp electrode. We believe that the contractions, in combination with the potassium leak, slowed down the re-establishment of the proper membrane potential in <italic>Ryr1</italic><sup><italic>AG/+</italic></sup> muscle. When a mutant muscle was dissected, mounted and cultured for 1 hour at room temperature in 3 mM K ringers solution prior to sharp electrode recording, the muscle only showed a 5 mV polarized shift. While this data is potentially interesting, the interpretation of the data is difficult to explain using the techniques at our disposal, and thus we have removed the membrane potential sharp electrode recordings from the paper.</p><p><italic>My second major concern is that the manuscript suffers from a number of incorrect or misleading statements, irrelevant references and poorly described results</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for your suggestions and corrections. We have made these corrections, as well as substantially revised the manuscript for clarity, in addition to the inclusion of new data to further substantiate the most important points of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer # 3</italic>:</p><p><italic>The authors have identified a mutation in RyR1 that shows hallmarks of central core disease (e.g. muscle weakness).
