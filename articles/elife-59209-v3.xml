unstructured electronic health record (EHR) provider notes is integral to advancing precision medicine. Here, we studied 246 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive (COVID<sub>pos</sub>) patients and propensity-matched 2460 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative (COVID<sub>neg</sub>) patients subjected to around 700,000 lab tests cumulatively across 194 assays. Compared to COVID<sub>neg</sub> patients at the time of diagnostic testing, COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and lower platelet counts. However, as the infection evolves, COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients distinctively show declining fibrinogen, increasing platelet counts, and lower white blood cell counts. Augmented curation of EHRs suggests that only a minority of COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients develop thromboembolism, and rarely, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with patients generally not displaying platelet reductions typical of consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends provide fine-grained resolution into COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) and set the stage for personalizing thromboprophylaxis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>laboratory tests</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>electronic health record (EHR)</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>coagulation</kwd><kwd>thrombolytic agents</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Longitudinal laboratory testing results tied to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic PCR results of more than 2500 patients reveal the temporal evolution of COVID-associated coagulopathy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that severe COVID-19 outcomes may be associated with dysregulated coagulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Tang et al., 2020</xref>), including stroke, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and other venous or arterial thromboembolic complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Klok et al., 2020</xref>). This so-called COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) shares similarities with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thrombotic microangiopathy but also has distinctive features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Levi et al., 2020</xref>). Given the significance of CAC to COVID-19 mortality, there is an urgent need for fine-grained resolution into the temporal manifestation of CAC, particularly in comparison to the broad-spectrum of other, better characterized coagulopathies. While there are studies suggesting associations between COVID-19 infection and mortality with thrombocytopenia, D-dimer levels, and prolongation of prothrombin time, the signatures of CAC onset and progression as well as their connection to clinical outcomes are not well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Panigada et al., 2020</xref>). An advanced understanding of this phenotype may aid in theÂ risk stratification of patients, thus facilitating optimal monitoring strategies during disease evolution through the paradigm of precision medicine.</p><p>To this end, we instituted a holistic data science platform across an academic medical center that enables machine intelligence to augment the curation of phenotypes and outcomes from over 10 million electronic health record (EHR) clinical notes and associated 3.2 million lab tests from 2232 SARS-CoV-2 positive (COVID<sub>pos</sub>) and 72,354 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 negative (COVID<sub>neg</sub>) patients over a retrospectively defined 2-month observation period straddling the date of the PCR test. For the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort, we center the 2-month observation period around the date of the first positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, and for the COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohort, we center the 2-month observation period around the date of the first PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). It is important to note that not all individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 develop symptoms of COVID-19, but rather that a majority of patients are either asymptomatic or have mild-to-moderate symptoms not requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the guidelines followed for PCR-testing included aÂ routine screening of individuals, patients displaying COVID-19 symptoms asÂ per the Mayo Clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Coronavirus disease, 2019</xref>) and CDC definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Website, 2020</xref>), and possibly contact with infected persons or underlying predisposing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>By compiling all available laboratory testing data for the 30 days preceding the first SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive diagnostic testing date (day 0), as well as the 30 days following the diagnostic testing date, and triangulating this information with medications and clinical outcomes, we were able to identify laboratory abnormalities significantly associated with the COVID<sub>pos</sub> group. We identified coagulation-related parameters among this set of abnormalities and then studied aggregate as well as individual patient trajectories that could aid in extracting a temporal signature of CAC onset and progression. We also correlated these signals with the clinical outcomes of these patients.</p><p>In order to hone into longitudinal lab test trends that would apply at the individual patient level, we restricted our analysis to patients with available serial testing data, which had at least three test results of the same type during the observation period. After applying these inclusion criteria, 246 COVID<sub>pos</sub> and 13,666 COVID<sub>neg</sub> patients met study theÂ inclusion criteria. The need for longitudinal data on the testing results, while constraining the study population size greatly, enables us to provide a fine-grained temporal resolution of CAC for the first time.</p><p>After filtering the patients with the available longitudinal testing data, the median age in the COVID<sub>pos</sub> and COVID<sub>neg</sub> groups were 60.8 years and 64.1 years, respectively (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and the numbers of males were 137 (56%) and 7129 (52%), respectively. The total numbers of pre-existing coagulopathies in the COVID<sub>pos</sub> and COVID<sub>neg</sub> groups were 31 (13%) and 3901 (29%), respectively. These counts of coagulopathies include the following phenotypes identified in the clinical notes from day â365 to day â31 relative to the PCR testing date: deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, thrombotic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for detailed breakdown). The number of COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients hospitalized in the month prior to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing date was 41 (17%), compared to 1247 (9.1%) for the COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohort.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of patient characteristics for the overall COVID<sub>pos</sub>, COVID<sub>neg</sub> (matched), and COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohorts.</title><p>The COVID<sub>neg</sub> (matched) cohort was constructed using 1:10 propensity score matching to balance each of the clinical covariates, including demographics (age, gender, race), medication use (anticoagulant/antiplatelet use in the preceding 30 days/1 year of PCR testing date), medical history of thrombotic events from the past year, and hospitalization status in theÂ month prior to the date of PCR testing.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Patient characteristics</th><th valign="bottom">COVID<sub>pos</sub></th><th valign="bottom">COVID<sub>neg</sub> (matched)</th><th valign="bottom">COVID<sub>neg</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of patients</td><td>246</td><td>2460</td><td>13,666</td></tr><tr><td>Age in years</td><td>60.8</td><td>60.9</td><td>64.1</td></tr><tr><th colspan="4">Gender:</th></tr><tr><td>Male</td><td>137 (56%)</td><td>1388 (56%)</td><td>7129 (52%)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="4">Race:</th></tr><tr><td>White</td><td>154 (63%)</td><td>1540 (63%)</td><td>12,241 (90%)</td></tr><tr><td>Black</td><td>24 (9.8%)</td><td>313 (13%)</td><td>569 (4.2%)</td></tr><tr><td>Asian</td><td>18 (7.3%)</td><td>207 (8.4%)</td><td>274 (2.0%)</td></tr><tr><td>American Indian</td><td>23 (9.3%)</td><td>81 (3.3%)</td><td>81 (0.59%)</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>27 (11%)</td><td>319 (13%)</td><td>501 (3.7%)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="4">Medication use in the preceding 30 days of PCR testing date:</th></tr><tr><td>Anticoagulants</td><td>63 (26%)</td><td>596 (24%)</td><td>5171 (38%)</td></tr><tr><td>Antiplatelets</td><td>30 (12%)</td><td>298 (12%)</td><td>2230 (16%)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="4">Medication use in the preceding 1 year of PCR testing date:</th></tr><tr><td>Anticoagulants</td><td>86 (35%)</td><td>819 (33%)</td><td>7476 (55%)</td></tr><tr><td>Antiplatelets</td><td>40 (16%)</td><td>419 (17%)</td><td>3620 (26%)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="4">Medical history of thrombotic events in 1 year prior to study period:</th></tr><tr><td>Deep vein thrombosis</td><td>15 (6.1%)</td><td>153 (6.2%)</td><td>2,110 (15%)</td></tr><tr><td>Pulmonary embolism</td><td>12 (4.9%)</td><td>112 (4.6%)</td><td>1258 (9.2%)</td></tr><tr><td>Myocardial infarction</td><td>11 (4.5%)</td><td>142 (5.8%)</td><td>1468 (11%)</td></tr><tr><td>Venous thromboembolism</td><td>4 (1.6%)</td><td>44 (1.8%)</td><td>615 (4.5%)</td></tr><tr><td>Thrombotic stroke</td><td>1 (0.41%)</td><td>3 (0.12%)</td><td>143 (1.0%)</td></tr><tr><td>Cerebral venous thrombosis</td><td>0</td><td>1 (0.04%)</td><td>7 (0.05%)</td></tr><tr><td>Disseminated intravascularÂ coagulation</td><td>0</td><td>1 (0.04%)</td><td>30 (0.22%)</td></tr><tr><td>Any thrombotic event</td><td>31 (13%)</td><td>308 (13%)</td><td>3901 (29%)</td></tr><tr><td>Hospitalized in theÂ month prior to PCR testing date</td><td>41 (17%)</td><td>304 (12%)</td><td>1247 (9%)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To balance these clinical covariates and others between the two cohorts, we applied 1:10 propensity score matching to define a subset of 2460 patients from the COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohort to use for the final statistical analysis (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods).

As most patients did not undergo laboratory testing for each assay on a daily basis, we grouped the measurements into nine time windows reflecting potential stages of infection as follows: pre-infection (days â30 to â11), pre-PCR (days â10 to â2), time of clinical presentation (days â1 to 0), and post-PCR phases 1 (days 1 to 3), 2 (days 4Â toÂ 6), 3 (days 7Â toÂ 9), 4 (days 10Â toÂ 12), 5 (days 13Â toÂ 15), and 6 (days 16Â toÂ 30). We only considered test-time window pairs in which at least three patients contributing toÂ laboratory test results in both groups. During each time window, we then compared the distribution of results from COVID<sub>pos</sub> versus COVID<sub>neg</sub> (matched) patients, allowing us to identify any lab tests which were significantly altered in COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients during any time of disease acquisition, onset, and/or progression.</p><p>Of theÂ 1709 lab test-time window pairs with adequate data points for comparison, we identified 130 such pairs (comprising 66 unique lab tests) which met our thresholds for statistical significance (Cohenâs DÂ &gt;0.35, BH-adjusted Mann-Whitney p-valueÂ &lt;0.05;Â <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

The lab test-time window pairs shown are those which met our defined thresholds for statistical significance and substantial effect (BH-adjusted Mann-Whitney p-valueÂ &lt;0.05 and Cohenâs D absolute valueÂ &gt;0.35). In particular, 130 of the initial 1709 (test, time window) pairs with at least one patient met these thresholds. Rows are sorted alphabetically by test and then time window (from earliest to latest). Coagulation-related tests of particular interest (fibrinogen, platelets, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and D-dimer) are highlighted in gray. Sample sources are denoted as: PÂ =Â plasma, SÂ =Â serum, S/PÂ =Â serum/plasma, BÂ =Â blood, UÂ =Â urine.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Test</th><th

To do so, we employed a BERT-based neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Devlin et al., 2018</xref>; see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods) to identify patients who experienced a thrombotic event after their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing date. Specifically, we extracted diagnostic sentiment from EHR notes (e.g. whether a patient was diagnosed with a phenotype, suspected of having a phenotype, ruled out for having a phenotype, or other) regarding specific thromboembolic phenotypes including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, thrombotic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.</p><p>We found that 101 of the total 2232 COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort (4.5%) were positively diagnosed with one or more of the above-mentioned thrombotic phenotypes in the 30 days after PCR testing, with the majority of these patients (53 of 101) experiencing a deep vein thrombosis.

Among these 245, there were 169 patients without thrombosis after PCR-based diagnosis (non-thrombotic) and 76 patients with thrombosis (thrombotic).

If true, then we would expect the thrombotic COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort to show significantly higher maximum platelet counts during their course of disease progression compared to the non-thrombotic COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort. We found that this was not the case, as maximum platelet counts were similar in the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Similarly, among the 147 COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients with platelet counts both at theÂ time of clinical presentation and post-diagnosis, the degree of maximal platelet increase was not associated with the development of thrombosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). It would certainly be of interest to perform this same analysis on a larger COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort (nÂ =Â 2232; 101 thrombotic vs. 2131 non-thrombotic), but we were not able to do so given the lack of longitudinal testing available for a large majority of non-thrombotic COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, we explored whether some COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients may experience clotting in the setting of low or declining platelets (e.g. consumptive coagulopathy) despite the population-level trend of increasing platelets over time. Indeed, we found that nine of 74 thrombotic patients showed absolute platelet counts below 100 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/L during at least one post-diagnosis time window (below dotted red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, we analyzed post-diagnosis platelet reductions among COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients. While the maximum degree of absolute platelet reduction was not associated with clot development in aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), we did find that six of the 52 thrombotic patients experienced a reduction of at least 100 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/L relative to the time of diagnosis. Of note, similar fractions of non-thrombotic COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients also showed these low or declining platelet counts, indicating that these trends are not specific indicators of thrombosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Consumptive coagulopathy contributes to only a small fraction of COVID-19 associated thromboses</title><p>The observed declining platelet counts and thrombocytopenia in the context of thrombosis in a small fraction of COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients are consistent with previous reports that fewer than 1% of survivors, but over 70% of non-survivors, meet the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). As was previously noted, hyperfibrinogenemia was among the strongest lab test features distinguishing COVID<sub>pos</sub> from COVID<sub>neg</sub> patients at diagnosis, but the subsequent downward trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) could be attributed to a resolving acute phase response and/or consumption of fibrinogen in a systemic coagulopathy. Using our BERT-based sentiment extraction, we found that only five of the 2232 COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients that exhibited DIC-like symptoms, all of whom were included in our longitudinal cohort of 246 COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Upon manual review of the EHR data for each patient, we found that two out of these five patients had confirmed diagnosis of DIC, while the remaining had high clinical suspicion and pending tests for DIC. This finding suggests that declining fibrinogen after COVID-19 diagnosis typically represents a physiologic return to normal range rather than pathologic coagulation factor consumption. To further examine the plasma fibrinogen trends among COVID-19 patients with DIC, with non-DIC thrombosis, and without thrombosis, we examined patient-level lab test trends from 10 individuals who were tested for fibrinogen both at the time of diagnosis and at least two times subsequently. The 10 patients for individual analysis were selected as the first 10 individuals with longitudinal fibrinogen lab testing data available.</p><p>This patient-level analysis indeed revealed multiple distinct trajectories with respect to fibrinogen and other coagulation parameters in COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients. Four of these ten individuals developed at least one blood clot during their hospital course. Only one was identified by our BERT model (and confirmed by manual EHR review) to have low-grade DIC, and as expected we found this patientâs longitudinal lab test pattern to be consistent with consumptive coagulopathy (Patient 124; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). At the time of diagnosis, this patient showed significant hyperfibrinogenemia with elevated D-dimers (1304.5 ng/mL) and a borderline normal platelet count (153 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/L). Over the next 10 days, this patientâs fibrinogen levels consistently decreased, reaching a minimum of 110 mg/dL on day 9. Similarly, after an initial recovery to 190 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/L the platelet counts consistently declined starting on day 2 post-diagnosis, reaching a minimum of 117 Ã 10<sup>9</sup>/L on day 11. D-dimer levels exponentially increased after 5 days, reaching a maximum of 41,300 ng/mL on day 10. Phenotypically, this patient experienced both thrombotic (right internal jugular vein and right superior thyroid artery) and hemorrhagic (oropharyngeal and pulmonary) events. This combination of lab results and clinical manifestations is consistent with the diagnosis of DIC-like consumptive coagulopathy during the first week after COVID-19 diagnosis.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Longitudinal analyses of platelet counts, plasma fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels in individual patients with or without thrombotic disease.</title><p>In each plot, shaded regions represent time periods when the patient was taking a specific anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication.

Patient 23 developed a clot on day 4 post-diagnosis in the context of a declining fibrinogen level and increasing D-dimers but steady platelet counts, which actually increased shortly thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Patient 79 developed several clots after day 3 post-diagnosis in the setting of upward trending platelets (which eventually exceed the upper limit of normal) and elevated levels of both fibrinogen and D-dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Patient 94 developed a clot on day 8 post-diagnosis with relatively stable platelet counts within normal limits and steadily declining fibrinogen levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>One hypothesis is that early elevations in plasma fibrinogen contribute to the clotting observed in the non-DIC like COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort. This hypothesis may warrant further analysis in cohorts with more longitudinal fibrinogen data, but again it is important to note that several COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients who presented with hyperfibrinogenemia did not go on to develop thromboses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6EâF</xref>). This emphasizes that a steady post-diagnosis decline in plasma fibrinogen may represent physiologic resolution of the acute phase response rather than a pathologic consumption of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,DâF</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, this analysis affirms that a DIC-like coagulopathy resulting in a combination of hemorrhage and thrombosis can develop in the setting of COVID-19 infection. However, the observations that DIC was formally diagnosed in only five of 2232 COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients and emphasizes that consumptive coagulopathy is an exception rather than the rule as it pertains to thrombotic phenotypes in COVID-19 patients. These results should be considered as a preliminary characterization of COVID-associated coagulopathies (CAC) and will be updated as patient counts increase with the continued evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many studies on clinical characteristics and lab tests are shedding light on the spectrum of hematological parameters associated with COVID-19 patients. In an initial study of 41 patients from Wuhan, the blood counts in COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients showed leukopenia and lymphopenia, and prothrombin time and D-dimer levels were higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Another study based on 343 Wuhan COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients found that a Dâdimer level of at least 2.0 Âµg/mL could predict mortality with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). An independent study of 43 COVID-19 patients found significant differences between mild and severe cases in plasma interleukinâ6 (ILâ6), Dâdimers, glucose, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and Câreactive protein (p&lt;0.05;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). While such studies indeed highlight that hematological and inflammatory abnormalities are prevalent in COVID<sub>pos</sub>, a high-resolution temporal understanding of how these parameters evolve in COVID-19 patients post diagnosis has not been established. Specifically, in the wake of accumulating evidence for hypercoagulability in COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients, there are important clinical questions emerging regarding the necessity of and guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in patient management.</p><p>DIC-like consumptive coagulopathy in COVID-19 has been a point of concern in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Particularly in patients with ARDS, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is the predominant cause of death. A recent study suggested that DIC was associated with MODS during the early stage of ARDS and that persistent DIC may also have a role in this association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gando et al., 2020</xref>). Our study focusing on COVID-19 patients with longitudinal lab data suggests that COVID-19 is indeed associated with modulation of coagulation related parameters such as platelet counts, fibrinogen levels, and clotting time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the majority of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients with longitudinal lab testing are not the result of a DIC-like consumptive coagulopathy, as this only occurs in a small subset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>The ability to derive this longitudinal understanding of COVID-19 progression, including laboratory abnormalities and their associated clinical manifestations, mandates the synthesis of structured and unstructured EHR data (e.g. lab tests and clinical notes) at a large scale. The fact that tens of thousands of patients have undergone SARS-CoV-2 testing at major academic medical centers (AMCs) provides an abundance of potential data to perform this analysis but also poses significant challenges from a practicality standpoint. Manual review and curation of patient trajectories and associated testing results is not practical. ItÂ isÂ not likely to provide comprehensive or even entirely accurate individual patient records. Rather, triangulation across datasets, including lab measurements, clinical notes, and prescription information, using a scalable digitized approach to extract structured data along with sentiment-surrounded clinical phenotypes and outcomes enables us to efficiently perform this analysis in a timely fashion.</p><p>By developing and deploying such a digitized platform on the entirety of EHR data from a large AMC, we have identified in an unbiased manner, laboratory test-based abnormalities that differentiate COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients from COVID<sub>neg</sub> patients. The abnormalities in coagulation-related tests, including fibrinogen and platelets, were intriguing in the context of literature reporting the occurrence of various clotting phenotypes in COVID-19 patients, including DIC-like consumptive coagulopathies along with more isolated clotting events in the lungs, central nervous system, and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Klok et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Levi et al., 2020</xref>). Our finding that consumptive coagulopathy represents a minority of COVID-19 associated clotting events provides context for other studies, which have reported overt DIC or DIC-like disease in over 70% of non-survivors but far lower fractions of survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). As the pandemic continues to evolve and the patient counts increase over the coming months, we will be monitoring and reporting any updates to the clinical and laboratory observations drawn in this study.</p><p>Notwithstanding the preliminary nature of the analysis presented in this study, the results highlight that consumptive coagulopathy should be considered in the minority of COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients with significant serial reductions in platelet counts. It remains to be seen whether the post-diagnosis platelet increases or early hyperfibrinogenemia which we observed may contribute mechanistically to the clotting in the much larger non-DIC thrombotic COVID-19 population. It is important to note that despite the trend of increasing platelets, the platelet count only extended above the normal range (&gt;450Ã10<sup>9</sup>/L) after the PCR date in few COVID<sub>pos</sub> patients with serial measurements, and the development of such outright thrombocytosis was observed with similar frequencies in the thrombotic and non-thrombotic cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Further, the fact that several patients with elevated fibrinogen (i.e.Â &gt;400 mg/dL) at presentation did not develop thromboses suggests that early hyperfibrinogenemia is not a singular driver of subsequent clotting events, but a small sample size (nÂ =Â 10 patients; nine non-thrombotic vs. one thrombotic) limited the power of this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Despite these caveats, this linking of longitudinal trends to patient outcomes provides several useful pieces of clinical information. First, hyperfibrinogenemia is to be expected in COVID-19 patients around the time of diagnostic testing. Furthermore, declining fibrinogen levels shortly after diagnosis are also expected and likely represent the resolution of acute phase response in most patients rather than a decline secondary to the onset of consumptive coagulation. In addition, borderline or overt thrombocytopenia is common in COVID-19 patients at the time of clinical presentation, and the initial platelet count does not robustly predict patients who are likely to develop thromboses. After diagnosis, COVID-19 patients generally show an upward trend in platelets. Patients whose platelets trend down after diagnosis should be monitored, as platelet reductions after clinical presentation are associated with thromboses and significant reductions may be indicative of ongoing consumptive coagulopathy.</p><p>One unavoidable limitation of this study is that we restrict our analysis to patients which have longitudinal lab testing data available. While the inclusion criteria is naturally biased, we consider this study population to be of high clinical interest because these patients are highly enriched for severe thrombotic events during the study period (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Further, in the propensity score matching step of the analysis, we are able to construct a control cohort that is similar to the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort in these enriched dimensions. To provide additional color on the distinctive attributes of the study population, we provide a summary of the clinical characteristics of the study population versus all patients with PCR tests during the same time period (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7">Table 7</xref>). In addition, we provide the median numbers of lab tests per patient for selected coagulation-related lab tests (fibrinogen, platelets, PTT, APTT, D-dimer) and total lab tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8">Tables 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9">9</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table7" position="float"><label>Table 7.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing.</title><p>General demographic characteristics of all patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing in the Mayo Clinic EHR database from February 15, 2020 to May 28, 2020.

To account for the potential variability in disease progression, we have performed aÂ sensitivity analysis on the time intervals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Additionally, there are several covariates that may influence these longitudinal trends and should be explored further. For example, we have already considered whether previous or concomitant administration of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents influences patient lab test results and/or outcomes. Similarly, in the future, we intend to explore whether longitudinal lab measurement trends differ between outpatient, inpatient, and ICU admitted patient cohorts. New datasets can also be utilized; for example, rather than grouping patients by the identified thromboembolic phenotypes extracted from the clinical notes alone, patients could be stratified by those who had imaging studies (duplex ultrasound, CT scan, etc.) performed, and phenotypes could be directly extracted from these procedural reports. As more data accumulates from COVID<sub>pos</sub> and COVID<sub>neg</sub> patients in the coming months, these analyses need to be expanded to assess similarities and differences in the temporal trends of laboratory test results among a wider range of patient subgroups relevant for COVID-19 outcomes, such as those who have pre-existing conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, obesity, malignancies) or patients who are on specific medication (e.g. ACE inhibitors, statins, immunosuppressants).</p><p>In summary, this work demonstrates significant progress toward enabling scaled and digitized analyses of longitudinal unstructured and structured EHRs to identify variables (e.g. laboratory results) which are associated with relevant clinical phenotypes (e.g. COVID-19 diagnosis and outcomes). In doing so, we identified trends in lab test results which may be relevant to monitor in COVID-19 patients and warrant both clinical and mechanistic follow-up in more targeted and explicitly controlled prospective analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design, setting and patient population</title><p>This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Mayo Clinic and hospitals affiliated to the Mayo health system.

Among this population, 2232 patients had at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result, and 72,354 patients had all negative PCR test results. In order to align the data for the analysis of aggregate longitudinal trends, we selected a reference date for each patient. For patients in the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort, we used the date of the first positive PCR test result as the reference date (dayÂ =Â 0). For patients with all negative PCR tests, we used the date of the first PCR test result as the reference date (dayÂ =Â 0). We defined the study period for each patient to be 30 days before and after the PCR testing date. Patients with contradictory PCR test results were excluded for the purpose of this analysis; forÂ example, a positive PCR test result and a negative PCR test result on the same day, or a positive PCR test result followed immediately by several negative PCR test results.</p><p>Over 4 million test results from 6298 different types of lab tests were recorded for the patients who received PCR tests in the 60-day window surrounding their PCR testing dates at the Mayo Clinic campuses in Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida. Among these lab tests, we restricted our analysis to 194 tests with at least 1000 observations total and at least 10 observations from the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort among the patients with PCR testing on or before May 8, 2020. In addition, we considered different subsets of the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort for the analysis of each of the 194 lab tests, due to differences in availability of testing results. For each lab test, we consider the results from patients with three or more observations during the study period.</p><p>In the end, there are 246 SARS-COV-2 positive and 13,666 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients that had three or more test results during the study period for at least one of the assays among the 194 lab tests considered. We take this set of 246 COVID-19 positive patients to be the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort. In order to construct the COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohort from the 13,666 COVID-19 negative patients, we apply propensity score matching, which is described in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Propensity score matching to select the final COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohort</title><p>To construct a COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohort similar in baseline clinical covariates to the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort, we employ 1:10 propensity score matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Austin, 2011</xref>). In particular, first we trained a regularized logistic regression model to predict the likelihood that each patient will have a positive or negative COVID-19 test result, using the following covariates: demographics (age, gender, race), anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication use (orders for alteplase, antithrombin III, apixaban, argatroban, aspirin, bivalirudin, clopidogrel, dabigatran, dalteparin, enoxaparin, eptifibatide, heparin, rivaroxaban, warfarin in the past year and in the past 30 days), pre-existing coagulopathies (medical history of thrombotic phenotypes including: deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, thrombotic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation from day â365 to day â31 relative to the PCR testing date), and hospitalization status (i.e. whether or not the patient was hospitalized within the past 30 days of PCR testing).</p><p>Using the predictions from the logistic regression model as propensity scores, we then matched each of the 246 patients in the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort to 10 patients out of the 13,666 COVID-19 negative patients, using greedy nearest-neighbor matching without replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Austin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Austin, 2014</xref>). As a result, we ended up with a final COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohort that included 2460 patients with similar baseline characteristics to the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort. The characteristics of the two cohorts are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Further, for the analyses conducted on individual lab tests, which include only a subset of patients from the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort, we use the propensity scores to match each patient from the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort to 10 patients from the COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohort which have the most similar propensity scores and lab tests available. For example, for the fibrinogen lab test, in which we have data on 81 patients from the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort, we select 810 patients from the COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohort and the most similar propensity scores to be the control group. In this way, we ensure that all of the comparisons are done between subsets of the positive and negative cohorts with similar propensity scores, and therefore similar underlying characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical significance assessments for lab test differences over prognostic time intervals for SARS-CoV-2 infection</title><p>We conduct a systematic statistical analysis to identify tests that show significant differentiation among the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort during a set of predetermined prognostic time intervals for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, we group the lab test measurements for each patient into the following nine time intervals relative to their date of PCR testing: pre-infection (days â30 to â11), pre-PCR (days â10 to â2), time of clinical presentation (days â1 to 0), and post-PCR phases 1 (days 1 to 3), 2 (days 4 to 6), 3 (days 7 to 9), 4 (days 10 to 12), 5 (days 13 to 15), and 6 (days 16 to 30).</p><p>For each lab test and for each of each of our nine pre-specified time intervals, we compared the mean lab test value among patients who underwent at least one such lab test in the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort over that time interval to the mean lab test value in the COVID<sub>neg</sub> (matched) cohort over that time window. We only considered (lab test, time interval) pairs in which there were at least three patients contributing toÂ laboratory test results in both groups. Specifically, for each (lab test, time interval) pair, we conducted the following procedure:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Compute (patient, time interval) averages: We compute the average lab test values for each patient in the COVID<sub>pos</sub> and COVID<sub>neg</sub> (matched) cohorts during the specified time interval.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Statistical hypothesis testing: We conduct a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test in order to test the null hypothesis that the average lab test results for each of the (patient, time interval) pairs from the COVID<sub>pos</sub> and COVID<sub>neg</sub> (matched) cohorts come from the same distribution.

In particular, we repeatÂ the statistical analysis with the time intervals shifted forward or backward 1 day for all patients. For the forward shifted sensitivity analysis, the new time intervals under consideration are: pre-infection (days â30 to â10), pre-PCR (days â9 to â1), time of clinical presentation (days 0 to 1), and post-PCR phases 1 (days 2 to 4), 2 (days 5 to 7), 3 (days 8 to 10), 4 (days 11 to 13), 5 (days 14 to 16), and 6 (days 17 to 30). For the backward shifted sensitivity analysis, the new time intervals under consideration are: pre-infection (days â30 to â12), pre-PCR (days â11 to â3), time of clinical presentation (days â2 to â1), and post-PCR phases 1 (days 0 to 2), 2 (days 3 to 5), 3 (days 6 to 8), 4 (days 9 to 11), 5 (days 12 to 14), and 6 (days 15 to 30). For both the forward and backward sensitivity analyses, we apply the same thresholds of effect size and significance (Cohenâs DÂ &gt;Â 0.35, BH-adjusted Mann-Whitney p-valueÂ &lt;0.05), and we compare the results to the original time intervals.</p><p>From this analysis, we observe consistent results (i.e. comparisons meeting same criteria of significance and effect) on (i) both perturbations in 83 out of 130 (64%) lab test trends identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and (ii) at least one perturbation in 114 of 130 (87%) lab test trends.

Sentences containing phenotypes were classified into the following categories: Yes (confirmed diagnosis), No (ruled out diagnosis), Maybe (possibility of disease), and Other (alternate context, e.g. family history of disease). The neural network used to perform this classification was trained using nearly 250 different phenotypes and 18,500 sentences and achieves 93.6% overall accuracy and over 95% precision and recall for Yes/No sentiment classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>). Here, this model was used to classify the sentiment around coagulopathies in the unstructured text of the 246 COVID<italic><sub>pos</sub></italic> and 13,666 COVID<sub>neg</sub> patientsâ clinical notes, structuring this information so that it could be compiled with longitudinal lab measurement and medication information.</p><p>In particular, we used the BERT model to identify the seven coagulopathy phenotypes mentioned in clinical notes in the Mayo Clinic EHR database, including: deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, thrombotic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. We validated the performance of this model for these phenotypes on a set of 1000 randomly selected sentences from the clinical notes of the patients in the study population. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>, we report the out-of-sample accuracy metrics for the BERT model on this set of sentences, using manually curated labels provided by one of the studyâs authors (CP) to be the ground truth. We demonstrate that the model performs well in the task of identifying thrombotic phenotypes in clinical notes, with an overall accuracy of 94.7%, recall of 97.8%, and precision of 92.8%.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Mathai Mammen, James List, JoAnne Foody, Patrick Lenehan, Murali Aravamudan, Rakesh Barve, Sankar Ardhanari, and Vishy Thiagarajan, for their helpful feedback.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf5"><p>This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf6"><p>This author is an employee of nference with financial interests in the company</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf7"><p>One or more of the investigators associated with this project and Mayo Clinic have a Financial Conflict of Interest in technology used in the research and that the investigator(s) and Mayo Clinic may stand to gain financially from the successful outcome of the research.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors analyze a large EHR-based dataset of coagulation tests in COVID-19 patients to obtain an understanding of the kinetics of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. It is a clear approach and the data are important for the clinics. They used machine learning to extract patterns. Overall the conclusions were drawn in many directions. Nonetheless, the paper asks a potentially important question and is adequately written and presented. The data support that the majority of thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients are not the result of a DIC-like consumptive coagulopathy, this only occurs in a small subset. This should also be the focus of the Discussion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Patient characteristics:</p><p>â Please clinically define &quot;pre-existing coagulopathies&quot;.</p><p>â It is a unclear what the comparator cohort adds: In part it is not clear who these patients are.

Perhaps a push not to perform diagnostic imaging studies lead to lower objective identification of venous thromboembolism than has been generally described in COVID-19?</p><p>â Patients are identified as COVID-19 positive or negative based on PCR testing. Actually, using the PCR test a positive/negative infection by SARS-CoV-2 is assessed; COVID-19 is the disease that can follow upon infection. This distinction should be made clear, as not all patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection necessarily develop COVID-19.

This should also be explained and included.</p><p>â Introduction: &quot;â¦ straddling the date of the PCR test.â¦&quot; Do the authors refer to the first PCR test here, as it is mentioned that multiple PCR tests may have been performed?

Why not use multilevel regression mixture models, longitudinal regression, etc?</p><p>â One of the three covariates used in the regularized logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a positive infection (subsection âPropensity score matching to select the final COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohortâ) is anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication use. Is this covariate positively or negatively correlated to infection and what is the rationale for this? Table 1 comprises more details; however, these add to further confusion. The Table 1 legend states &quot;anticoagulant/antiplatelet use within 30 days/1 year of PCR testing date&quot; i.e. after the PCR test, while the table itself mentions &quot;medication use in the preceding 30 days/1yr&quot;, so before the PCR test. Please clarify and adapt.</p><p>Figures:</p><p>â Figure 2A: Why are no data points provided for the -30 to 0 days of the COVID negative patients while these data are shown in Figure 2B and E?</p><p>â The same question as above but then for the APTT and D-dimer data in Figure 2 vs. Figure 3 and magnesium in Figure 1 vs. Figure 3. I guess the cohorts are different between the two figures, maybe this should be stated in the figure legends.</p><p>â Figure 3: we agree with the authors that the fibrinogen decline and platelet increase in COVID positive patients is re-emphasized in this manner.

(a) For the 1.3 million lab tests on 194 assays over the 60-day window: provide the mean/range of number of tests separately for positive and negative patients, and also provide the mean/range of the number of tests for pre- vs. post-index &quot;0&quot; date; (b) For positive patients, the proportion of those whose PCR positive test is the first test in the 60-day window; (c) If at all possible, COVID-19 related info at the first PCR test for all patients; (4) If possible, reasons for hospitalizations at the day=0;</p><p>2) It is not clear why it is important to assess lab tests in relation to diagnosis. For studying association between lab tests with diagnosis, ideally, the positive cases should use the &quot;time of infection&quot; as time zero which of course is intractable. But before variation in time from infection to diagnosis by PCR tests, the relevance of test results for diagnosis is unclear. Further, because of the propensity score matching, the cohort may not be suitable for assess the diagnosis: if some matching variables are associated with any of the test results, matching will artificially deflate the association. We therefore suggest the focus of this paper on prognosis only. The Abstract indeed focused on the prognosis, but diagnosis was mentioned multiple times in the manuscript.</p><p>3) BERT method: The accuracy of BERT was established in an unpublished manuscript developed by the same research group. What is the proportion of patients who were classified as &quot;Maybe&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot; AND &quot;No&quot;? It is helpful if chart review is performed on 100, say, patients, to validate this algorithm in the study context;</p><p>4) Tables 3 and 4 indicate that the endpoints were significantly enriched for positive cases who had longitudinal data. But it is possible that patients received more tests because of indications of more negative outcomes. As a result, patients with longitudinal lab tests are representative of all positive patients as indicated by the enrichment. This is an important weakness of the study as this may be a source of bias, making the study results not generalizable. It is important to provide additional information on the comparing characteristics of patients with and without longitudinal tests. It may be worthwhile to provide information on reasons of repeating tests for negative patients.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59209.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors analyze a large EHR-based dataset of coagulation tests in COVID-19 patients to obtain an understanding of the kinetics of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.

We have added a definition of pre-existing coagulopathies to the Introduction, which includes all patients who have at least one of the phenotypes from days -365 to -31 relative to the PCR testing date. In Table 1 of the revised manuscript, we have now added in the medical history of thrombotic events for the patients in the COVID-19 positive, negative, and negative (matched) cohorts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â It is a unclear what the comparator cohort adds: In part it is not clear who these patients are.

The clinical covariates that we controlled for initially included demographics (age, gender, race), hospitalization status, and anticoagulant/antiplatelet use, which can be viewed as a proxy variable for medical history of thrombotic events. In this revision, we have explicitly added in medical history of thrombotic events as clinical covariates to balance on, as shown in the updated Table 1 of the revised manuscript. We have added a few statements describing the updated COVID<sub>neg</sub> (matched) cohort to the last paragraph of the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Ascertained rates of venous thromboembolism are much lower than what others have observed (e.g., Helms ICM 2020, Middeldorp pre-prints, etc.).

The guidelines followed for PCR-testing included all of the following â displaying COVID-19 symptoms, contact with infected persons, and other factors such as potential work-place/community exposure as well as underlying conditions predisposing to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has been noted in the second paragraph of the Introduction section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Introduction: &quot;â¦ straddling the date of the PCR test.â¦&quot; Do the authors refer to the first PCR test here, as it is mentioned that multiple PCR tests may have been performed?

For the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort, we center the two month observation period around the date of the first positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, and for the COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohort, we center the two month observation period around the date of the first PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Analysis:</p><p>â The analysis was restricted to patients who had serial (&gt;/= 3) tests done.

We have added in a statement on potential survival bias to the Discussion section. In particular, we now provide a summary of the clinical characteristics of the study population vs. all patients with PCR tests during the same time period in Table 6. We have also included an additional table characterizing the key lab tests and their availability for the study population vs. all patients (see Tables 7-8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â This restriction also led to the exclusion of the vast majority of the cohort: 1,192 -&gt; 181 COVID-19<sub>pos</sub> patients. Why was there such a strong emphasis on longitudinal markers?</p></disp-quote><p>The need for longitudinal data on the testing results, while constraining the study population size greatly, enables us to provide a fine-grained temporal resolution of COVID-associated coagulopathy for the first time. In addition, we consider this study population to be of high clinical interest because these patients are highly enriched for severe thrombotic events during the study period (see Table 4). We have added this in as a point in the seventh paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The potential significance of these longitudinal trends are assessed with these tests as far as I can understand, which both only looks to see whether mean/median change was different between the groups, but moreover does not allow for adjustment. Why not use multilevel regression mixture models, longitudinal regression, etc?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We considered logistic regression for this analysis, to predict the presence/absence of thrombotic events using the longitudinal lab testing information available for each patient prior to the PCR testing date Day 0. However, due to large heterogeneity in lab tests conducted for the study population, and the relative sparsity of lab testing data available for the COVID<sub>pos</sub> population prior to Day 0, we were unable to train an accurate predictive model using the available data. However, we expect that as additional data becomes available this is a promising area for future research, and we have added a note on this in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â One of the three covariates used in the regularized logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a positive infection (subsection âPropensity score matching to select the final COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohortâ) is anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication use.

Please clarify and adapt.</p></disp-quote><p>We observe that anticoagulant/antiplatelet use is negatively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (see Table 1). We hypothesize that the reason for this is that patients who are on anticoagulants/antiplatelets generally have more underlying conditions and thus take more precautionary measures to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, Table 1 shows anticoagulant/antiplatelet use in the 30 days/1 year prior to the PCR testing date. We have revised the name of this covariate in Table 1 for clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures:</p><p>â Figure 2A: Why are no data points provided for the -30 to 0 days of the COVID negative patients while these data are shown in Figure 2B and E?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, Figure 2A has been renamed to Figure 3A. This plot, which shows the temporal trends of the Fibrinogen lab tests, has no data points between days -30 to 0 because none of the patients in the COVID<sub>pos</sub> cohort had Fibrinogen lab test results reported during this time range. For all of the temporal trend plots, we only show data points for which there are at least 3 patients in the COVID<sub>pos</sub> and COVID<sub>neg</sub> cohorts.

For PCR-positive and PCR-negative patient cohorts, we include the overall number of tests and number of patients with tests; we do this for all the tests in aggregate and 5 coagulation-related tests in particular. Table 7 has these numbers for the PCR-tested patient population; Table 8 has them for the study population of PCR-tested patients with longitudinal test data. We included general demographic characteristics as well in Table 6.
