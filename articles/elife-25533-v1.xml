innate neuronal processing. Thus, the paradigmatic chick retinotectal projection, due to its neighborhood preserving, topographic organization, establishes millions of parallel channels for incremental visual field analysis. Retinal axons receive targeting information from quantitative guidance cue gradients. Surprisingly, novel adaptation assays demonstrate that retinal growth cones robustly adapt towards ephrin-A/EphA forward and reverse signals, which provide the major mapping cues. Computational modeling suggests that topographic accuracy and adaptability, though seemingly incompatible, could be reconciled by a novel mechanism of coupled adaptation of signaling channels. Experimentally, we find such ‘co-adaptation’ in retinal growth cones specifically for ephrin-A/EphA signaling. Co-adaptation involves trafficking of unliganded sensors between the surface membrane and recycling endosomes, and is presumably triggered by changes in the lipid composition of membrane microdomains. We propose that co-adaptative desensitization eventually relies on guidance sensor translocation into <italic>cis</italic>-signaling endosomes to outbalance repulsive <italic>trans</italic>-signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25533.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25533.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25533.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain contains roughly 100 billion neurons, which are organized into complex networks. But how does the brain establish these networks in the first place? Neurons have long projections known as axons and, in the developing brain, these axons form structures called growth cones at their tips. The growth cones possess finger-like appendages that probe their surroundings in search of signals displayed on the surface of other cells. These signals guide the growth cones to their targets and move the axon tip into a position where it can form connections with other neurons within a particular network.</p><p>The signals that growth cones follow are often distributed in concentration gradients so that the levels of a signal may be low at one end of a brain structure and gradually increase to a maximum level at the other end. In the developing visual system, for example, about one million axons from the retina reach their proper targets in visual regions of the brain by reading gradients of signals called ephrins and Ephs. However, when Fiederling et al. studied retinal neurons in a petri dish, they found that the axons became much less sensitive to both signals upon prolonged exposure to them. This unexpected finding raised a new question. If neurons rely upon these gradients for navigation, how do they continue to find their way if they also become less sensitive to those signals over time?</p><p>Fiederling et al. used a computer to simulate the events occurring in the developing brain. The simulations were based on the idea that navigating growth cones sense the ratio of ephrins to Ephs, instead of sensing the individual concentrations of these signals. Thus, by keeping the amounts of all involved sensors in strict proportion to each other while continuously re-adjusting them, the axons could still be accurately guided to their targets even though the neurons would become less sensitive to the signals. Experiments in neurons grown in petri dishes confirmed that retinal growth cones do exactly this and regulate the amounts of ephrin and Eph sensors on their outer membranes in a highly coordinated manner using a previously unknown mechanism.</p><p>Given that signaling requires energy, the brain may have evolved this system to reduce the costs associated with wiring itself up. The system also offers greater flexibility than guidance based on the absolute concentrations of the signals. If other regions of the brain use a similar mechanism to establish their own wiring patterns, then understanding such basic mechanisms might eventually provide insights into diseases of miswiring such as schizophrenia and autism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25533.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25533.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Axon guidance</kwd><kwd>growth cone</kwd><kwd>retinotectal</kwd><kwd>ephrin</kwd><kwd>Eph</kwd><kwd>topographic map</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Karlsruhe School of Optics and Photonics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG GSC 21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fiederling</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008316</institution-id><institution>Baden-Württemberg Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>State Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fiederling</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BA 1034/14-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weschenfelder</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Fritz</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Bastmeyer</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Weth</surname><given-names>Franco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004350</institution-id><institution>Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Philipsborn</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names> </name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open Access Publishing Fund of KIT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weth</surname><given-names>Franco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A distinctive novel mechanism of ephrin-A/EphA signaling modulation in retinal growth cones ensures concurrent quantitative accuracy and adaptability of topographic hardwiring.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dazzling diversity of functions of the nervous system are brought about by neural networks of definite connectivity, most of which arise during ontogenesis through targeted outgrowth of axons. This is accomplished by growth cones (GCs) at the tips of growing axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lowery and Van Vactor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vitriol and Zheng, 2012</xref>), which sense genetically encoded chemotactic guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</xref>). Such genetic hardwiring endows the individual at prefunctional stages with computational architectures, which have been fitted for survival through the evolution of the whole species.</p><p>A well-studied example is the development of the retinotectal projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which, in non-mammalian vertebrates, connects the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of the eye with the midbrain’s optic tectum in a topographic, <italic>i.e.</italic>, neighborhood-preserving manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feldheim and O'Leary, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemke and Reber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weth et al., 2014</xref>). Research on this two-dimensional mapping has mainly focused on the anterior-posterior axis, whereby the temporal retina is projected onto the anterior tectum and the nasal retina onto the posterior tectum. The major guidance cues along this axis are EphA receptor tyrosine kinases and their glycosylphosphatidylinositol-(GPI)-anchored ephrin-A ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suetterlin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Triplett and Feldheim, 2012</xref>). EphAs and ephrin-As are counter-graded on both the retina and the tectum (temporal retina — EphA high, ephrin-A low; anterior tectum — EphA high, ephrin-A low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McLaughlin and O'Leary, 2005</xref>]). The ephrin-A/EphA system can signal in forward (EphA acting as receptor) and in reverse (ephrin-A as receptor) directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egea and Klein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kania and Klein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lisabeth et al., 2013</xref>). Both signaling channels act repulsively on RGC GCs. Receptor/ligand interactions typically occur in <italic>trans</italic>, between different cells, but, when present on the same cell, as on RGCs, they can additionally happen in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hornberger et al., 1999</xref>). We have recently proposed a simple but powerful comprehensive computational model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gebhardt et al., 2012</xref>) that includes all possible ephrin-A/EphA interactions in this system (fiber–target, fiber–fiber, <italic>cis</italic>, each forward and reverse). The model assumes that axon targeting aims to balance all summed reverse signals against all summed forward signals sensed by the GC. There have been diverse further attempts to explain retinotopic mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hjorth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simpson et al., 2009</xref>). Most of them agree, however, that topographic guidance is based on quantitative signaling, whereby the concentrations of sensors and cues bear the topographic information. This assumption has also been corroborated by experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baier and Bonhoeffer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosentreter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Philipsborn et al., 2006b</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25533.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The retinotectal projection.</title><p>The topographic projection in the chicken visual system connects RGCs from the retina to the midbrain's optic tectum.

Retinal GCs are guided to their tectal targets by repulsive signals from counter-gradient distributions of tectal ephrin-As (red; p&gt;a) and EphAs (blue; a&gt;p).

Ligand-specific desensitization was correlated with decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, whereas re-sensitization required MAP-kinase activation and local protein synthesis. <italic>Xenopus</italic> retinal axons in collapse assays were shown to adapt towards the collapse-inducing activities of soluble Sema3A and Netrin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piper et al., 2005</xref>). Here, ligand-specific desensitization and re-sensitization, depended on endocytosis and protein translation, respectively. Notably, however, none of these guidance cues has been involved in topographic mapping. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how adaptive signal modulation might be compatible with the need for quantitative signaling. First evidence, however, indicates that retinal GCs might in fact be able to adapt to topographic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosentreter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Philipsborn et al., 2006b</xref>). We therefore decided to investigate this conundrum in more detail.</p><p>Introducing a novel adaptation assay (‘gap assay’), we demonstrate that chick retinal GCs adapt towards both ephrin-A forward and EphA reverse topographic signals. Led by computational modeling, we postulate a distinctive novel type of signal modulation (‘co-adaptation’) to reconcile adaptation and topographic accuracy. We prove experimentally that such ephrin-A/EphA specific co-adaptation is indeed realized in retinal GCs. Using SNAP-tagged ephrin-A5 to label sensor surface populations, pharmacological inhibition, and co-localization studies with Rab11, we show that co-adaptation on the cellular level involves trafficking of the guidance sensors between the GC membrane and the recycling endosome. By inducing adaptation by altering the lipid composition of the GC membrane, we provide evidence that repartitioning of guidance sensors between membrane microdomains might drive co-adaptation downstream of ephrin-A/EphA signaling. Eventually we propose, on the basis of our computational model, a hypothetical mechanism of co-adaptation, suggesting that an increase in the efficiency of <italic>cis</italic>-signaling from endosomes eventually desensitizes GCs against <italic>trans</italic>-signaling, without altering their topographic identity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Retinal GCs adapt towards topographic EphA forward and ephrin-A reverse signals</title><p>In <italic>in-vitro</italic> collapse assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kapfhammer et al., 2007</xref>) typically ~80% of temporal GCs show a collapsed morphology after 20 min incubation with 0.25 μg/ml ephrin-A5-Fc, whereas control (Fc fragment)-treated GCs mostly remain intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Surprisingly, however, we observe that temporal GCs recover their morphology, despite the presence of the repulsive cue, after prolonged incubation. After 120 min of incubation with ephrin-A5-Fc, the fraction of collapsed GCs drops from 77.1% (20min) to 32.9% and, thus, to control levels (20 min Fc: 23.3%; 120 min: 27.2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This recovery is not caused by a loss of activity of the repulsive cue, as a medium containing 0.25 μg/ml ephrin-A5-Fc that has been on a first culture for 120 min triggers full response when reused on a second culture for 20 min (81.5% collapsed temporal GCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

At high concentrations (15 µg/ml), a specific and significant collapse is triggered (64.4% of GCs; equimolar Fc: 24.3% collapsed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but this does not occur at lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We suggest that the exclusive response to high EphA concentrations is due to an exclusive activity of EphA3 oligomers (n &gt; 2), which might form in concentrated solutions only. Supporting evidence comes from measuring ephrin-A5/EphA3 affinity by biolayer interferometry. Remarkably, binding constants depend on the EphA3 concentration and are dramatically increased at high concentrations (≥15 µg/ml; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The assumed oligomers remain stable in solution for at least 1 day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, but similar to the response to ephrin-A5, GCs completely recover after prolonged incubation with EphA3-Fc (22.6% collapsed after 120 min; Fc controls after 120 min: 21.6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), demonstrating GC desensitization also towards EphA3 reverse signals.</p><p>Full adaptability comprises desensitization and re-sensitization. To address the latter and to better approximate the <italic>in-vivo</italic> situation regarding surface-bound cues, we developed a novel <italic>in-vitro</italic> adaptation assay, the ‘gap assay’. To this end, we manufactured patterned guidance substrates by protein contact printing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">von Philipsborn et al., 2006a</xref>), which consisted of two rectangular fields homogeneously covered with the cue and separated by a permissive gap (laminin) of defined width. To ensure the activity of the printed cue, positive controls are performed in which axons grow from homogeneous laminin towards an identical field of the cue. For ephrin-A5-Fc, naїve temporal axons show a robust stop reaction at the boundary to the ephrin field in such controls (98% stopping; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Negative controls using a corresponding field of human Fc fragment (28.8% stopping) demonstrate the specificity of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). By contrast, axons starting from a field of homogeneous ephrin-A5-Fc no longer stop and continue growing onto the second ephrin field if the gap is small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A'</xref>), revealing their desensitization in agreement with the collapse assays. Notably, however, the proportion of GCs that stop in front of the second ephrin field increases with increasing gap sizes. Only 15.3% of temporal axons stop in assays with 50 µm wide gaps, but 43.0% stop after 75 µm, 59.2% after 100 µm and 81.0% after 200 µm wide gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A'' and C</xref>), indicating that GCs regain sensitivity towards forward signaling while growing on the permissive gap.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25533.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Growth cone adaptation towards substrate-bound ephrin-A5 and EphA3.</title><p>Subfigures in (<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) each display a cartoon (left) illustrating the experimental setup consisting of explant (thick black strip), axons and printed guidance protein (colored field(s)), the inverted signal of fluorescent phalloidin-stained axonal actin (middle; explant not shown) and the underlying, antibody-labeled substrate (right) are shown in a detailed view of a representative microscopic image (scale: 100 µm).

Briefly, the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) is exclusively based on ephrin/Eph signaling and assumes that GCs do not distinguish the diverse sources of the impinging signals (target cells, other fibers, GC’s own surface). They just sense <italic>total</italic> reverse and <italic>total</italic> forward signaling. GC targeting is then considered as a potential minimization process, comparable to a sphere rolling into a well. To describe this process, a ‘guidance potential’, <italic>D</italic>, is defined, which is conceived to be proportional to the <italic>ratio</italic> of total reverse to total forward signaling and to be minimized when both are equal, indicating target arrival. The effective strengths of the signals received by an individual GC depend on its endowment with sensors (ephrins for reverse and Ephs for forward signaling). Thus, the GC’s own ephrin/Eph ratio corresponds to its topographic imprint, determining where on the target area reverse/forward signaling balance will be reached. Therefore, to retain topography in the face of adaptation, which is expected to modulate signal strength, this ratio must remain basically unaltered. In the model, this is achieved by introducing the same multiplicative adaptation factor, <italic>a</italic>, simultaneously to <italic>both</italic> reverse and forward signaling.

To check for this possibility, we specifically labeled the intracellular population of SNAP–ephrin-A5 in desensitized GCs growing on ephrin-A5. Subsequently, GCs were given time (20–22 hr) to leave the ephrin-A5 field for re-sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and were then stained for any formerly intracellular label that had appeared on the GC surface in the meantime (for a detailed staining protocol, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and 'Materials and methods'). Notably, GCs that have left the ephrin field show a significantly higher surface staining than GCs that are still growing on the field (fold change in intensity compared to laminin controls: on ephrin-A5 — 0.85; off ephrin-A5 — 1.13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–B’’ and D</xref>). This indicates a transport of intracellular sensors to the GC's surface upon re-sensitization. Notably, these results were gained for SNAP–ephrin-A5 on ephrin-A5-Fc substrates. As ephrin-A5 is not a receptor for ephrin-A5-Fc, its regulation has to be assumed to be a result of co-regulation with EphAs, the active sensor in this setting, again supporting the co-adaptation idea.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Co-adaptation implicates temporary storage of guidance sensors in the recycling endosome</title><p>Endocytotic clearance and surface repopulation from internal stores upon co-adaptation suggests the involvement of recycling endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldenring, 2015</xref>).

A potential regulator of co-adaption should therefore be located downstream of both reverse and forward signaling, which together determine the guidance potential, and it should impact on the membrane activity of the signaling sensors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baba et al. (2009</xref>) have shown that Fyn-kinase is activated downstream of ephrin-A reverse signaling, inducing an increase of sphingomyelin in the membrane and a corresponding exclusion of ephrin-A from the cell surface. Sphingomyelin, together with cholesterol, is a major component of the lipid rafts of the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simons and Ikonen, 1997</xref>), where ephrin-As have been shown to be localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Averaimo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gauthier and Robbins, 2003</xref>). As Fyn-kinase also acts downstream of EphA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 1997</xref>), we first asked whether manipulating the sphingomyelin content of the membrane might impact co-adaptation. Pretreatment with sphingomyelinase (SMase, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neufeld et al., 1996</xref>) in collapse assays strongly reduces the primary response of GCs towards ephrin-A5 and EphA3 (ephrin-A5 — 79.6%; ephrin-A5+SMase — 50%; EphA3 — 52.9%; and EphA3+SMase — 23.8% collapsed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). SMase treatment has been shown to disrupt rafts by replacing them with ceramide-enriched, densely packed solid ordered domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiantia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goñi and Alonso, 2009</xref>). Thus, sphingomyelin overproduction or conversion to ceramide might have the same effect of excluding ephrin-As from rafts. To investigate the role of these membrane microdomains in co-adaptation more closely, and to avoid the intricacies of SMase effects, we used methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahammad and Parmryd, 2015</xref>]) to disrupt rafts by extracting cholesterol from the GC membrane in further adaptation assays. In forward signaling collapse assays with 0.25 µg/ml ephrin-A5-Fc, co-application of 2 mg/ml MβCD does not significantly alter the primary response after 20 min (80.3% without, 77.4% with MβCD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). After 1 hr of incubation, however, significantly more GCs have recovered in the presence of MβCD than without (74.2% collapse without, 45% with MβCD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). In reverse signaling collapse assays with 15 µg/ml EphA3, a corresponding desensitizing effect is already seen after 20 min (78.2% collapsed without, 51.6% collapsed with MβCD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) and remains significant after 1 hr (28.3% collapse without, 14.5% with MβCD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In double-cue gap-assays with a gap size actually allowing for substantial re-sensitization (115 µm), a significantly higher percentage of EphA3- or ephrin-A5-adapted axons are still desensitized when MβCD is present compared to controls; these axons overgrow the boundary and enter the field of ephrin-A5 or EphA3, respectively, after the gap (EA3-eA5: 80.7% stopping without MβCD, 46,3% stopping with MβCD [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,C’ and E</xref>]; eA5-EA3: 70.9% stopping without MβCD, 23.4% stopping with MβCD [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D,D’ and E</xref>]). Thus, extraction of cholesterol from the GC membrane, which is thought to result in the disintegration of lipid rafts, strongly enhances desensitization in both types of adaptation assays.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25533.024</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Disintegration of lipid microdomains induces co-adaptive growth cone desensitization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ephrin-A5-Fc and (<bold>B</bold>) EphA3-Fc collapse assays.

Thus, in accordance with experimental observations, a half-retinal projection expands to a full tectum, a full retinal projection compresses to a half-tectum, and a half-projection can be forced to map onto a mismatching tectal half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodhill and Richards, 1999</xref>). This is due to fiber–fiber interactions, by virtue of which the axons introduce their own mapping apparatus into the target field, eventually overwriting the target cues. Why then should co-adaptation be needed? Generally speaking, signaling comes at the expense of energy. Adaptation is continuously acting to reduce the guidance potential and, thus, the energetic costs of organizing the connectome, which are presumably limiting to the development of the nervous system as the mature brain is the most highly ordered biological structure we know of. A more specific advantage of the adaptation of retinal GCs can be envisaged from corresponding simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Without adaptation, the majority of axons would be unable to overcome the steep boundary of reverse signaling at the entrance of the target field. By contrast, when we deliberately desensitize the fiber population through the co-adaptation mechanism before entering the target field, they easily overcome the boundary and automatically re-adjust their sensitivities on the target field. To this end, a pre-adapting signal would be required before the target. Fiber–fiber interactions enabled by the intimate contact of the fibers in the optic tract are unlikely to be the preadapting factor, as it has been show that fiber–fiber interactions are required neither for target entry nor for the actual mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gosse et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests the existence of still elusive biochemical preadapting factors, which should be present in the optic tract, but absent from the target.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25533.028</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Modeling tectal innervation.</title><p>Co-adaptation enables fiber terminals to enter a tectal target field initially and allows correct mapping therein (gray circles), whereas non-adapted terminals (white circles) fail to enter a tectal target field in simulations with 200 GCs placed in front of the target.

Inspired by computational modeling, we suggest that the seemingly incompatible properties of topographic accuracy and adaptation can be reconciled by a distinctive novel mode of strictly parallelized modulation of the signaling channels, termed co-adaptation. Experimentally, we demonstrate that co-adaptation is implemented in retinal GCs. The cellular mechanism of co-adaptation is based on the trafficking of guidance sensors between the GC membrane and internal stores, including the recycling endosome. Finally, we provide evidence indicating that repartitioning of guidance sensors between membrane microdomains might be a critical first step in co-adaptation. According to modeling, co-adaptation could have a particular role during tectal entry, allowing axons to overcome the steep reverse signaling boundary at this location.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Co-adaptation preserves the ephrin-A/EphA ratio, the genetic imprint of topographic identity</title><p>It has repeatedly been shown before that GCs can adapt to axonal guidance cues that act as global attractants or repellents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ming et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piper et al., 2005</xref>). Adaptation in these cases might be a means of adjusting the dynamic range of the sensors. By contrast, adaptation against topographic cues comes unexpectedly, as these cues have been thought to act by virtue of their concentrations within graded distributions since the first proposition of gradient guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sperry, 1963</xref>). Concentration gradients provide two kinds of information for chemotactic guidance: positional information, via the local concentration, <italic>c(x)</italic>, and directional information, via the derivative, <italic>dc(x)/dx</italic>. Adaptation amounts to deleting the positional information. This is what is found in bacterial chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parkinson et al., 2015</xref>). At every location in the gradient, the CheR methyltransferase desensitizes chemotaxis receptors so that upon relocation of the bacterium, only the incremental change of the cue concentration is detected. This exclusive readout of the gradient’s directional information enables the bacteria to reach the source or the sink of an attractant or repellent, respectively, but precludes the identification of intermediate targets. The same would hold true for the topographic guidance of GCs.</p><p>In our previously published computational model of topographic guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gebhardt et al., 2012</xref>), the topographic identity of the GCs is encoded in the ratio of ephrin-As to EphAs that they express. This is because this ratio determines the ratio of instantaneous reverse to forward signals received by the GC, which, according to the model, has to be balanced upon target approach. Thus, retaining topographic identity in the face of adaptation requires that these sensing channels are co-modulated concomitantly by the same factor. We challenged this idea of co-adaptation experimentally by testing the strong prediction that, through co-adaptive coupling, a signaling channel should be modulated even in the absence of its cognate signal, as long as the coupled channel is activated and modulated. We show that this is what happens in retinal GCs with regard to reverse and forward ephrin-A/EphA signaling. The mechanism is specific to the ephrin/Eph system, and GCs remain sensitive to other guidance signals throughout. To the best of our knowledge, co-adaptation is a novel signaling phenomenon not described previously. Canonical adaptation can be conceived as a negative feedback to channel activation. Co-adaptation, by contrast, also modulates coupled, non-activated signaling channels.</p><p>It should be noted that the existence of co-adaptation in retinal GCs along the way supports our modeling assumption that topographic identity is encoded in the ephrin-A/EphA ratio. It also corroborates the occasionally disputed role of reverse signaling in topographic mapping. Why should a specific co-adaptation mechanism for the two channels exist, if only one was needed for mapping?</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The cellular mechanism of co-adaptation involves the shuttling of a controlled subpopulation of membrane-bound sensors on a special trafficking route</title><p>According to our findings, co-adaptation in retinal GCs is based on vesicular trafficking. Desensitization is correlated with surface clearance of ephrin-As and EphAs by CME, whereas re-sensitization implies replenishment of ephrin-As and EphAs from recycling endosomal compartments. In contrast to the transport of ephrin-As, the trafficking of EphA receptors has been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sabet et al., 2015</xref>). Receptors that have been auto-phosphorylated as a result of ligand binding, as well as receptors that are spontaneously auto-phosphorylated in the absence of a ligand, are internalized into Rab5-positive early endosomes. Ligand binding, as opposed to spontaneous auto-phosphorylation, is thought to induce clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nikolov et al., 2013</xref>) and additional phosphorylation. The latter recruits ubiquitinylating enzymes, eventually diverting the stable receptor/ligand complexes to the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment for degradation. Unliganded, spontaneously auto-phosphorylated receptors, however, are trafficked to the recycling endosome, bringing them into apposition with tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. After dephosphorylation, the receptors are recycled to the plasma membrane. Despite being triggered by ligand binding, co-adaptation undoubtedly necessitates the trafficking of unbound receptors. It is unlikely, however, that these correspond to the spontaneously auto-phosphorylated subpopulation described above. This is because spontaneous auto-phosphorylation is expected to occur at constant frequency, whereas the degree of co-adaptation must vary with the impinging signal. Thus, we propose that the sensors trafficked during co-adaptation form an independent subpopulation, whose size is adjusted to the required degree of adaptation and which is shuttled on a pathway that is not identical with the routes described above. As co-adaptation requires the shuttling of the proper absolute number of sensors in the topographically appropriate ratio, the question arises as to how this subpopulation might be selected for trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Repartitioning between membrane lipid microdomains as the potential mechanism allocating sensors to the co-adaptation pathway</title><p>The degree of co-adaptation required in the model is determined by the instantaneous guidance potential, <italic>D</italic>, measured by a GC, <italic>i.e.</italic>, downstream of the integration of reverse and forward signals. Sphingomyelin has been shown to increase in the cell membrane upon activation of Fyn-kinase, downstream of ephrin-A/EphA signaling, and to induce a concomitant decrease of membrane ephrin-As (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baba et al., 2009</xref>). This sphingomyelin appeared to be a promising candidate regulator of co-adaptation. In fact, SMase pretreatment desensitizes retinal GCs to both ephrin-A forward and EphA reverse signaling.</p><p>Sphingomyelin, together with cholesterol, is thought to be a key organizer of lipid rafts, which are liquid-ordered microdomains of the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Róg and Vattulainen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simons and Sampaio, 2011</xref>). We therefore went on to test the effects of MβCD, an efficient scavenger of cholesterol, on GC co-adaptation. In fact, we find a strong enhancement of the desensitization of forward and reverse signaling in both collapse and gap co-adaptation assays upon application of MβCD. Thus, manipulation of both major components of lipid rafts yields the same effect, supporting the idea that these membrane microdomains are involved in the observed desensitization. Formally, our experiments cannot rule out the possibility that lipid raft disruption simply impedes primary signaling and is thus unrelated to the co-adaptation mechanism. However, the fact that ephrin-A reverse signaling impacts on the relevant lipid composition of the membrane strongly suggests the idea that raft microdomain alteration is a genuine element of the GC co-adaptation mechanism.</p><p>Raft disintegration would lead to a release of ephrin-As, which have been shown to be localized in membrane rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Averaimo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gauthier and Robbins, 2003</xref>), into the liquid disordered domain of the membrane. There is substantial evidence that EphAs might also reside in lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakraborty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>), potentially driven by the lipid-interactions of their second fibronectin type III domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chavent et al., 2016</xref>), although these rafts seem to be separate from the ephrin-A-containing microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kao and Kania, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marquardt et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that a similar dispersion from microdomains might also happen to EphAs upon variation of the sphingomyelin content of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). These processes would eventually generate an intermixed subpopulation of dispersed ephrin-As and EphAs in the non-raft membrane.</p><p>Notably, raft-located proteins are typically internalized by clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sandvig et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, we observe CME for both ephrin-As and EphAs during co-adaptation, supporting the idea that the endocytosed subpopulation of molecules might not be raft localized. If, as we propose, alteration of the sphingomyelin content induced the same fraction of ephrin-As and EphAs to re-partition from their respective microdomains to the liquid-disordered phase of the membrane, the dispersed mixture eventually would have the same ratio of ephrin-As and EphAs as the whole membrane. It could thus be endocytotically removed from the surface upon co-adaptation without altering the topographically relevant ephrin-A/EphA ratio. The same would be hardly conceivable if membrane clearance involved only ephrin-A/EphA ligand receptor complexes, as their ratio would be stoichiometric instead of depending on the topographic imprint of the respective cell. The disperse subpopulation would probably not be activated, as activated sensors should stay in their respective microdomains due to increased clustering caused by ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nikolov et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the co-adaptive subpopulation would not be expected to carry any phosphorylation tag to trigger endocytosis. We instead suggest that the disperse distribution by itself might destine for constitutive endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25533.029</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism of co-adaptation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EphAs (blue) and ephrin-As (red), located in membrane lipid microdomains (dark gray), signal in <italic>trans</italic> due to external cues. <italic>Trans</italic> forward (FWD) and reverse (REV) signals integrate into the guidance potential, <italic>D</italic>, and elicit repulsion when not balanced. <italic>Trans</italic> signaling also promotes sphingomyelin (SM) synthesis, and when incorporated into the membrane, this phospholipid might proportionally solubilize EphAs and ephrin-As from their respective domains.

For double-cue gap assays, both fields of the stamp were physically separated using a piece of Parafilm<sup>TM</sup> and each was covered with a different protein solution (combinations of 15 μg/ml ephrin-A5-Fc, 15 μg/ml EphA3-Fc and 25 μg/ml mouse semaphorin3A-Fc in PBS). The pattern orientation was indicated on the coverslip. Patterns were stained with Alexa-conjugated anti-human goat IgGs. Quantification of gap assays was performed using a custom-written MATLAB (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>) code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weth, 2017</xref>) to count fibers in and immediately behind the gap. In short, grayscale images of axons were thresholded and two ROIs were drawn in parallel to the gap (ROI one in the gap, ROI two directly behind the gap; both ~20 μm wide and over the complete lateral extension of the gap). Both ROIs were then evaluated, counting signal peaks in each pixel row, and the percentage of stopping fibers was calculated from mean counts in ROI one and ROI 2. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (2 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was directly added to the culture medium. For experiments with anisomycin (AIM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 40 µM AIM was added to the culture medium when axons were just about to leave the first ephrin-A5 field, and GCs were tracked using time-lapse imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Expression constructs</title><p>To construct pSNAP–ephrin-A5–IRES–EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), we first reverse transcribed and PCR amplified the message for full-length <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> ephrin-A5 (NCBI [RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006472">SCR_006472]</ext-link> NM_205184.2) using primers starting 16 bp upstream of the start and ending 27 bp downstream of the stop codon from total RNA of the E7 chick tectum. Using SdaI and NotI linkers, the amplification product was inserted between the respective sites of the pSNAP-tag(m) vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). In addition, a synthetic double-stranded DNA encoding the first 20 amino acids of chick ephrin-A5 (signal peptide) was inserted into the EcoRV site of the same construct to create a continuous open reading frame for a fusion protein containing the ephrin-A5 signal peptide, the SNAP-tag and full-length ephrin-A5. This coding sequence was amplified from the construct using the primers starting 8 bp upstream of the start codon and ending 36 bp downstream of the stop codon, and was inserted into the SmaI site of the expression vector pCIG2, containing a CAG enhancer/promotor upstream and IRES–EGFP downstream of the insert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hand et al., 2005</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers and a Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewers and Reviewing Editor have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fiederlin and co-workers address a fundamental problem in topographic map formation; the ability of axons to adapt to external guidance cues (de/re-sensitisation) on the one hand, and the requirement of growth cones for quantitative signaling to enable them to orient within a guidance gradient on the other hand. The present study using in vitro signaling assays and computational modeling in an attempt to reconcile this conundrum and advance the field.</p><p>The authors have worked for some time on a (molecular) understanding of topographic mapping in the chick retinotectal projection in vitro, in particular focussing on the EphA/ephrin-A family. The new and exciting finding of the present study is the identification and characterization of co-adaptation between forward and reverse ephrin-A/EphA signaling modules; Adaptation in forward signaling is accompanied by adaptation in reverse signaling, thereby maintaining topographically important information and a balance of forward and reverse signaling. The authors' findings are supported and complemented by computational modeling approaches, which in turn provide further insights into potential mechanisms of co-adaptation. Overall, the experiments are of high quality and well documented, and the study is of general interest because it provides a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms of topographic map formation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The modeling predictions of disrupting co-adaptation are intriguing but remain untested experimentally. We would like to see additional in vitro manipulations showing that co-adaptation is disrupted following treatment with sphingomyelinase. One possible experiment to address this would be the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> co-adaptation assay repeated in the presence of sphingomyelinase.</p><p>2) The interplay (or lack thereof) between the Eph/ephrin system and Sema3A is an interesting feature of the system and should be expanded to elevate the scope and impact of the work. What is the behavior of retinal axons in a gap assay with Sema3A only? What is the outcome of a gap assay in which a Sema3A source is followed – after the gap – by an ephrin-A5 substrate? Does Sema3A alter ephrinA or EphA surface localization?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25533.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The modeling predictions of disrupting co-adaptation are intriguing but remain untested experimentally.

One possible experiment to address this would be the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> co-adaptation assay repeated in the presence of sphingomyelinase.</italic> </p><p>To respond to this point, we have included a complete new set of experiments. The results are presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, explained in the Results paragraph “Disrupting membrane rafts induces adaptation” and discussed further in the Discussion paragraph “Repartitioning between membrane lipid microdomains as a potential mechanism of allocating sensors to the co-adaptation pathway”. The old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> has been moved to the supplement (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Corresponding additions have been made to the Materials and methods paragraphs “Collapse assays” and “Gap assays”.</p><p>Briefly, we turned from sphingomyelinase to methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) to manipulate lipid rafts and to study their influence on co-adaptation. SMase generates ceramide, which by itself forms new lipid microdomains with cholesterol (Chiantia et al., 2006; Goni and Alonso, 2009), potentially confounding the interpretation of the results. In addition, the activity of SMase in overnight culture media is hard to control. MβCD, in contrast, is a well-established drug to disrupt lipid rafts by cholesterol scavenging (Mahammad and Parmryd, 2015). We applied MβCD in collapse as well as in co-adaption gap assays. In both cases, we find a profound desensitizing effect of the drug, confirming the previous SMase data. In both forward and reverse signaling collapse assays, axons regenerate faster in the presence of the drug, corresponding to more efficient desensitization. In ephrin-A5 – EphA3 as well as in EphA3 – ephrin-A5 co-adaptation gap assays, axons also are more desensitized, indicated by overgrowing larger gaps. These results strongly support the proposed mechanism of co-adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), predicting that raft disintegration would release ephrin-As and EphAs into the liquid-disordered phase of the membrane, from where they are constitutively endocytosed to desensitize the growth cone.</p><p><italic>2) The interplay (or lack thereof) between the Eph/ephrin system and Sema3A is an interesting feature of the system and should be expanded to elevate the scope and impact of the work. What is the behavior of retinal axons in a gap assay with Sema3A only? What is the outcome of a gap assay in which a Sema3A source is followed – after the gap – by an ephrin-A5 substrate? Does Sema3A alter ephrinA or EphA surface localization?</italic> </p><p>To answer these questions, we have included another new set of experiments. The results are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. They are eluded to in the Results paragraphs “EphA forward signaling in fact co-adapts ephrin-A reverse signaling and vice versa” (second paragraph) and “Desensitization involves clearance of sensors from the GC surface by clathrin-mediated endocytosis” (first paragraph). Necessary additions have been made in the Materials and methods paragraph “Gap assays”.</p><p>Briefly, retinal axons display very efficient desensitization towards Sema3A in gap-assays. The desensitization is so efficient that we do not see obvious re-sensitization even with the largest gaps (215µm) available with our contact-printing stamps. Along the way, we observed an interesting behavior of the RGC axons on the Sema3A gap substrates: As soon as the adapted axons leave the Sema3A pedestal and continue to grow on laminin in the gap, they display a strong tendency to defasciculate and to form branches. Dwelling deeper into this phenomenon is, however, beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>In Sema3A – ephrin-A5 double-cue gap assays, we observe no co-adaptation. Correspondingly, the SNAP-ephrin-A5 surface localization probe is not internalized on Sema3A. These observations clearly indicate that the two guidance systems (ephrin-A/EphA and Sema3A) do not interplay in retinal growth cones and display an orthogonal behavior. This finding supports the idea, that co-adaptation is a specific feature of the topographic guidance system.</p></body></sub-article></article>
