Phase response curves (PRCs) quantify how a neuron transforms input to output by spike timing. PRCs exhibit strong firing-rate adaptation, but its mechanism and relevance for network output are poorly understood. Using our Purkinje cell (PC) model, we demonstrate that the rate adaptation is caused by rate-dependent subthreshold membrane potentials efficiently regulating the activation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Then, we use a realistic PC network model to examine how rate-dependent responses synchronize spikes in the scenario of reciprocal inhibition-caused high-frequency oscillations. The changes in PRC cause oscillations and spike correlations only at high firing rates. The causal role of the PRC is confirmed using a simpler coupled oscillator network model. This mechanism enables transient oscillations between fast-spiking neurons that thereby form PC assemblies. Our work demonstrates that rate adaptation of PRCs can spatio-temporally organize the PC input to cerebellar nuclei.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>phase response curve</kwd><kwd>rate adaptation</kwd><kwd>reciprocal inhibition</kwd><kwd>network oscillations</kwd><kwd>transient assembly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004199</institution-id><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Schutter</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational and theoretical models show that rate adaptation of phase responses can regulate Purkinje cell outputs by forming transient oscillations in fast-spiking neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The propensity of neurons to fire synchronously depends on the interaction between cellular and network properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ermentrout et al., 2001</xref>). The contribution of cellular properties can be measured with a phase response curve (PRC). The PRC quantifies how a weak stimulus exerted at different phases during the interspike interval (ISI) can shift subsequent spike timing in repetitively firing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ermentrout et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ermentrout et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutkin et al., 2005</xref>) and thereby predicts how well-timed synaptic input can modify spike timing. Consequently, the PRC determines the potential of network synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ermentrout et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ermentrout et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutkin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smeal et al., 2010</xref>). However, the PRC is not static and shows significant adaptation to firing rates. In cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), their phase responses to weak stimuli at low firing rates are small and surprisingly flat. With increased rates, responses in later phases become phase-dependent, with earlier onset-phases and gradually increasing peak amplitudes. This PRC property has never been theoretically replicated or explained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Phoka et al., 2010</xref>), nor has its effect on synchronizing spike outputs been explored.</p><p>On the circuit level, high-frequency oscillations caused by reciprocal inhibition have been observed in many regions of the brain, including the cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheron et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>). The functional importance of oscillations in information transmission is largely determined by their spatio-temporal scale, which for hard-wired inhibitory connections, is generally assumed to be driven by external input. It is interesting to explore whether firing rate-dependent PRCs can contribute to dynamic control of the spatial range of oscillations based on firing rate changes, because this would have significant downstream effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>).</p><p>To examine the mechanism of rate-dependent PRCs, we use our physiologically detailed PC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zang et al., 2018</xref>) and a simple pyramidal neuron model to explore the rate adaptation of PRCs. By analyzing simulation data and in vitro experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rancz and Häusser, 2010</xref>), we show that rate-dependent subthreshold membrane potentials can modulate the activation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels to shape neuronal PRC profiles. We also build a PC network model connected by inhibitory axon collaterals to simulate high-frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). Rate adaptation of PRCs increases the power of oscillations at higher firing rates, firing irregularity and network connectivity also regulate the oscillation level. The causal role of the PRC is confirmed using a simpler coupled oscillator network model. The combination of these factors enables PC spikes uncorrelated at low basal rates to become transiently correlated in transient assemblies of PCs at high firing rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PRC exhibits rate adaptation in PCs</title><p>PRCs were obtained by repeatedly exerting a weak stimulus at different phases of the ISI. The resulting change in ISI relative to original ISI corresponds to the PRC value at that phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All previous abstract and detailed PC models failed to replicate the experimentally observed rate adaptation of PRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akemann and Knöpfel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Schutter and Bower, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khaliq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Phoka et al., 2010</xref>). Our recent PC model was well constrained against a wide range of experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zang et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we explored whether this model can capture the rate adaptation of PRCs under similar conditions. When the PC model fires at 12 Hz, responses (phase advances) to weak stimuli are small and nearly flat for the whole ISI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). Only at a very narrow late phase do the responses become phase-dependent and slightly increased. With increased rates, the responses remain small and flat during early phases. However, later phase-dependent peaks gradually become larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with onset shifted to earlier phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It should be noted that the increased late-peak amplitude may be affected by how the PRC is computed (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>): it is normalized by the ISI, causing the peak amplitude to increase for higher firing rates (smaller ISIs).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PRC exhibits strong rate adaptation in PC model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the definition and computation of PRCs. The current pulse has a duration of 0.5 ms and an amplitude of 50 pA.

After each spike, there is a pronounced after-hyperpolarization (AHP) caused by the large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> current, and subsequently the membrane potential gradually depolarizes due to intrinsic Na<sup>+</sup> currents and dendritic axial current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zang et al., 2018</xref>). As confirmed by re-analyzing in vitro somatic membrane potential recordings (shared by Ede Rancz and Michael Häusser <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rancz and Häusser, 2010</xref>), subthreshold membrane potential levels are significantly elevated at high firing rates, but spike thresholds rise only slightly with rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

It shows an opposite rate adaptation of PRCs compared to PCs (<bold>A</bold>). In the Traub model, responses become smaller and relatively phase-independent at high firing rates. This demonstrates that the normalization used in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> does not always lead to increasing PRC peak amplitudes for smaller ISIs. These PRC shapes can be explained by significantly lower subthreshold membrane potentials at high rates, compared to PCs, (<bold>B</bold>). This is due to the accumulation of delayed rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current (kdr, <bold>C</bold>), which has a low activation threshold and large conductance. The lower subthreshold membrane potentials are far below the Na<sup>+</sup>-activation threshold, making responses to weak stimuli passive at high firing rates. Accordingly, PRCs in the model become smaller and relatively phase-independent at high rates. We minimally modified the Traub model by reducing the conductance of the kdr current, raising its activation threshold and increasing the AHP current (details in Materials and methods) (<bold>D-F</bold>). With these modifications, subthreshold membrane potentials are significantly elevated at high firing rates lower than 110 Hz. Accordingly, onset-phases of phase-dependent responses shift left and peaks increase at high rates. These simulation results show that spike rate-dependent subthreshold membrane potentials and their effect on nonlinear activation of Na<sup>+</sup> currents can be crucial in shaping neuronal PRC profiles in many types of neurons. Surprisingly, when firing rates are higher than 110 Hz, PRCs decrease again, suggesting other undetermined biological mechanisms may be involved in determining the phase responses.

The depolarizations to weak stimuli fail to activate sufficient transient and resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> channels to speed up voltage trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consequently, phase advances in early phases are small and flat. At later phases, membrane potentials gradually approach and surpass the Na<sup>+</sup> activation threshold. Stimulus-evoked depolarizations activate more Na<sup>+</sup> channels to speed up trajectories in return. Therefore, phase advances become large and phase- (actually voltage-) dependent. Because high-rate-corresponding elevated membrane potentials have larger slopes at the foot of the Na<sup>+</sup> activation curve, the same ∆V activates more Na<sup>+</sup> channels and, in addition to the normalization, contributes to larger PRC peaks at high rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Under all conditions (except phase = 0.2, 162 Hz), stimulus-evoked depolarizations also increase outward currents, but this increase is smaller than that of inward currents (mainly Na<sup>+</sup>) due to the high activation threshold of K<sup>+</sup> currents (mainly Kv3) in PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zang et al., 2018</xref>). As the stimulus becomes stronger, it triggers larger depolarizations and the required pre-stimulus membrane potential (phase) to reach Na<sup>+</sup> activation threshold is lowered. Thus, increasing the stimulus amplitude not only increases PRC peaks, but also shifts the onset-phases of phase-dependent responses to the left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In the absence of a dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), the larger amplitude spike is followed by a stronger afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zang et al., 2018</xref>) that deactivates K<sup>+</sup> currents allowing for an earlier depolarization in the ISI, resulting in a completely different PRC.</p><p>We further confirmed that the critical role of subthreshold membrane potentials in shaping PRC profiles is not specific to the PC by manipulating PRCs in a modified Traub model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ermentrout et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and accompanying text).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rate-dependent high-frequency oscillations</title><p>The potential effect of firing rate-caused variations of cellular response properties on population synchrony has been largely ignored in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunel and Hakim, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</xref>).

Therefore, spikes in the network show intermittent pairwise synchrony on the population level rather than spike-to-spike synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Each peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> corresponds to a ‘cluster’. Based on the power spectrum, the network oscillates at a frequency of ~175 Hz (inverse of the cluster interval,~6 ms), which is independent of cellular firing rates (116 Hz in red and 70 Hz in blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), because oscillation frequency is mainly determined by synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunel and Hakim, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunel and Wang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maex and De Schutter, 2003</xref>). When cellular firing rates increase from 70 Hz to 116 Hz, the power of high-frequency oscillations significantly increases and the peak becomes sharper. When individual PCs fire at low rates (10 Hz), the network fails to generate high-frequency oscillations and each PC fires independently, as evidenced by the flat power spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). High-frequency oscillations and their firing rate-dependent changes are also reflected in the average normalized cross-correlograms (CCGs) between PC pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). When PCs fire at 70 Hz and 116 Hz, in addition to positive central peaks, two significant side peaks can be observed in the CCGs, suggesting correlated spikes with 0 ms-time lag and ~6 ms-time lag. Amplitudes of the peaks increase with cellular firing rates and disappear when they are low (10 Hz).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the variation of cellular rates was driven by synaptic input to demonstrate the rate adaptation of high-frequency oscillations. However, it is difficult to differentiate the relative contribution of PRC shapes and firing irregularity (measured by the CV of ISIs) since they covary with firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, cellular rates were systematically varied by dynamic current injections, which were approximated by the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Destexhe et al., 2001</xref>). This simulation protocol also causes the formation of high-frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). When PCs fire with low to moderate CV of ISIs, they show loose spike-to-spike synchrony at high rates, and the power peak increases with cellular firing rates. High-frequency oscillations were never observed for low cellular firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). With high CV of ISIs, spikes are jittered and the loose spike synchrony is disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Oscillation changes due to firing properties are also reflected in average normalized CCGs. Both central and side peaks increase with the cellular firing rate and decrease with the spiking irregularity.

In both pyramidal neurons and PCs, spike rates cause significant variation of the subthreshold membrane potential during the ISI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rancz and Häusser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsubo et al., 2007</xref>). In response to a stimulus, both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> currents are activated. In PCs, the main K<sup>+</sup> current is high-threshold activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zang et al., 2018</xref>); therefore, depolarization-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> currents dominate, causing larger normalized PRCs at high rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This facilitation may be further boosted in PCs by enhanced excitability, such as SK2 down-regulation reducing the AHP and elevating subthreshold membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grasselli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohtsuki and Hansel, 2018</xref>). We did not explore possible PRC differences between zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs due to a lack of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).

However, careful analysis of previous experimental data in the cerebellum provides some evidence to support our findings. In the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>, units with lower average rates (&lt;10 Hz) did not exhibit significant correlations between neighboring PCs, for unknown reasons. This can be explained by the small flat PRCs at low rates. Under extreme conditions, when the PRC is constantly 0 (equivalent to disconnection), no correlations can be achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Additionally, the experimental oscillation power increased by the application of WIN 55,212–2, which was intended to suppress background excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>). The increased power could be due to more regular spiking after inhibiting the activity of background synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, it could also be caused by increased spike rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), because this agent also blocks P/Q type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and consequently P/Q type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents, to increase spike rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisyunov et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, enhanced oscillations have also been observed in calcium-binding protein gene KO mice, which have significantly higher simple spike rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheron et al., 2004</xref>). A more systematic experimental study of the firing rate dependent appearance of loose simple spike synchrony among PCs and its relation to behavior would be required to confirm these predictions.</p><p>The rate-dependent correlations observed in this study are different from those reported previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de la Rocha et al., 2007</xref>. In that study, common input-mediated correlation increased rapidly with increasing rate at low firing rates in pyramidal cells (their Figure 1e) and in integrate-and-fire models (their Figure 2c), while the PRC mediated correlations in our study of inhibitory coupling only appear at much higher firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de la Rocha et al., 2007</xref> are not general, they only apply for neurons with integrator firing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Down-stream effects of PC assemblies</title><p>PCs inhibit their target neurons in the CN, which in turn form the only cerebellar output. It is difficult to finely regulate CN firing rates with inhibition only, because it operates over the narrow voltage range between resting potentials and GABA<sub>A</sub> reversal potentials. Two solutions for this problem have been proposed. The first is that synchronized pauses of PC firing will release CN neurons from inhibition, leading to rebound firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Schutter and Steuber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). There is strong evidence that this mechanism works in controlling the onset of movement in the conditioned eyeblink reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heiney et al., 2014</xref>) and in saccade initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2016</xref>). The other solution provides a more continuous rate modulated CN output by time-locking of CN spikes to PC input. Several experimental studies have demonstrated that partial synchronization of afferent PC spiking can time-lock the spikes of CN neurons to their input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>). The ability to rapidly increase the correlation level within a subgroup of PCs with increased firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is therefore predicted to have a strong effect on CN spiking. Moreover, this does not require strong synchronization. Similar results were observed when jitter higher than the few ms predicted by our network model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) was applied to the synchronous PC input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</xref>).

If CN neurons just average the activity of all afferent PCs, much of the potential information generated by the large neural expansion in cerebellar cortex would be lost.

To compute PRCs in response to negative stimuli, the amplitudes of the pulses were changed to -50 pA. To compute PRCs of our PC model with passive dendrites, only H current and leak current were distributed on the dendrites with the same parameters as in the active model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zang et al., 2018</xref>). The Traub model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Traub et al., 1999</xref>) was implemented according to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ermentrout et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gutkin et al., 2005</xref>. In the modified version of this model, the conductance of the kdr current was reduced from 80 to 40. Activation and deactivation rates of this current were shifted to the right by 30 mV, α<sub>n</sub>(v)=0.032*(v+22)/(1-exp(-(v+22)/5)); β<sub>n</sub>(v)=0.5*exp(-(v+27)/40); the conductance of AHP current was increased from 0 to 0.1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Network simulations</title><p>We implemented our recurrent inhibitory PC layer network using the Watts-Strogatz model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref>) to avoid boundary effects. To reduce simulation time, we used the PC model with passive dendrites, which exhibits similar rate-dependent PRCs to the PC model with active dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the baseline version of the network, 100 PCs were distributed on the parasagittal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witter et al., 2016</xref>), corresponding to 2 mm of folium with a distance of 20 μm between neighboring PC soma centers. 100 PCs are within the estimated range of PCs converging to a same cerebellar nuclei neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>). Each PC was connected to its nearest 2*radius neighboring PC somas and connections had 0 rewiring probability. The PCs were interconnected, according to anatomical data showing collaterals present toward both the apex and the base of the lobule with only slight directional biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). The baseline value of radius was 5 within the range of experimental estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bishop and O'Donoghue, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). The inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) was implemented using the NEURON built-in point process, Exp2Syn. G = weight * (exp(-t/τ<sub>2</sub>) - exp(-t/τ<sub>1</sub>)), with τ<sub>1</sub> = 0.5 ms (rise time) and τ<sub>2</sub> = 3 ms (decay time). The reversal potential of the IPSC was set at −85 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watt et al., 2009</xref>). The conductance was 1 nS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orduz and Llano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). The delay between onset of an IPSC and its presynaptic spike timing was 1.5 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orduz and Llano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). To test the effect of rate-dependent PRCs on high-frequency oscillations, we varied the cellular rates in two paradigms. In the first paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), each PC is contacted by 4000 excitatory parallel fiber synapses (PF, on spiny dendrites), 18 inhibitory stellate cells (STs, on spiny dendrites) and four inhibitory basket cells (BSs, on the soma). Activation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in each PC was approximated as an independent Poisson process with different rates. We simulated five conditions: PC rate = 10 Hz when PF rate = 0.27 Hz, ST rate = 14.4 Hz, BS rate = 14.4 Hz; PC rate = 47 Hz when PF rate = 1.62 Hz, ST rate = 28.8 Hz, BS rate = 28.8 Hz (used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); PC rate = 70 Hz when PF rate = 2.16 Hz, ST rate = 28.8 Hz, BS rate = 28.8 Hz; PC rate = 93 Hz when PF rate = 2.7 Hz, ST rate = 28.8 Hz, BS rate = 28.8 Hz (used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); PC rate = 116 Hz when PF rate = 3.24 Hz, ST rate = 28.8 Hz, BS rate = 28.8 Hz.</p><p>To more systematically explore different factors regulating network outputs, we used a second paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>).

In this paradigm, we systematically varied the rates and firing irregularities of PCs (CV of ISIs) to explore their importance for network output. Due to the intrinsic relationship between CV of ISIs and firing rates, a larger <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is required for higher firing rates to get the same CV of ISI. Phase response is a result of input current and response gain of the cell. We reduce the phase response by halving the input current (synaptic conductance) to achieve a smaller response at high firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>). The conductance of inhibitory synapses was tested with the values of 0.75, 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 nS in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.

We first picked two neurons from our network and aligned their spike-count PSTHs to stimulation onset with 2 ms time bins in each trial (larger time bins annihilated the positive peaks due to the significant negative correlations in paired spikes, see CCGs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). We constructed the JPSTH matrix by taking each stimulus trial segment and plotting the spike counts of one cell on the horizontal and one on the vertical. If there is a spike from neuron i at time <italic>x</italic>, and a spike from neuron j at time <italic>y</italic>, one count will be added to the matrix index (x,y). By repeating this process for different trials, we got a raw matrix for a cell pair i and j. Then by the shift-predictor (repeated previous steps with shuffled stimulation trials), we removed correlations due to co-stimulation caused firing rate changes. Next step, we normalized the JPSTH by dividing with the product of standard deviations of the PSTHs of each neuron. To measure the correlation of the assembly, we averaged JPSTH between all non-repeated cell pairs in the defined ‘assembly’ of our network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oemisch et al., 2015</xref>). The corrected matrix values become correlation coefficients, with values between −1 and +1. The main diagonal of the JPSTH matrix provides a measure of time-varying 0 ms time lag correlations and the third main diagonal (2 ms time bin) provides a measure of 6 ms time lag correlations. Due to the small-time bin we used, we simulated 1992 trials (for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref>) to compute JPSTH between PC pairs and smoothed the JPSTHs for visualization purpose. Due to the small number of decreased-rate neurons in the network, we simulated 26112 trials to compute <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref> (30 decreased-rate neurons). When decreased-rate neuron numbers are 10 and 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), we did not compute their correlations due to the computational challenge.

In the infinitesimal limit,the PRC is the normalized nullspace of the adjoint linear operator. The usual normalization is that the inner product is 1. This is how the theory that the authors allude to is done. Here the authors use a different normalization where they divide the adjoint by the period. This produces a different scaling and of course will make the PRC that occurs near the bifurcation (where the period is large) to appear much smaller in amplitude than it would with the standard scaling. If you use the standard scaling on the Traub model (which is readily available) and use the authors modifications, you find that with the standard normalization, higher frequencies have smaller PRCs which is according to the theory. If you divide by the period, then you get the authors results at least for currents that are not too big. For frequencies of about 110 Hz, even with the scaling, I found the PRC to be smaller than the lower frequencies.</p><p>Turning to their PC model, it is clear from Figure 1C, that the amplitudes with the usual normalization will follow the theory. That is, higher-frequencies have smaller amplitudes. (Specifically, if you divide the amplitudes shown by their respective frequencies, the graph will be decreasing.)</p><p>The main motive for this study is the PRC measurements from Couto et al. which was published in PLoS comp bio where the same result was found experimentally. To me the amplitude is not so much the point of interest here but rather the extreme change in the shape of the PRC. The Traub model does not show the shape dependence in fact it is the opposite with little effects until the late phases for low frequencies, an effect that was explained in the paper by Pascal et al. as coming from the adaptation.</p><p>The main result of interest is that at higher rates, oscillations synchronize/correlate better than an low rates So, there is some practical effect of this.</p><p>The authors set out to explain several effects. One of them is the largely unresponsive phase after the spike. As noted above, this effect was already explained in the old work of Pascal et al.</p><p>In Figure 3D, while the amplitude goes up in this model, the phase dependence is very flat only in the low rate versions. Thus, I think that the authors explanations are not really general. They need to make these explanations in a more rigorous mathematical manner.</p><p>The latter part of the paper is the most interesting where they demonstrate rate dependence in the correlation of the networks. It is a shame that they do not directly relate this to the PRCs. It would have been nice to perform some sort of analysis of a network of neurons that viewed as phase oscillators and connected via their phase response curves. I should point out that when coupling, whether or not locking occurs depends on whether or not you rescale the heterogeneties or not. I illustrate this in the following example. Let I be the baseline current to a bunch of neural oscillatora and let I_j be the heterogeneous current (assumed small) Let T be the period and suppose simple pulse coupling such that is neuron j fires, then a delta function current J_{ij} is added to the postsynaptic current. Let Delta be the conventional PRC (normalized to be msec/mv). Then the Kuramoto/Ermentrout/Kopell/ etc reduction yields for the phase:</p><p>dtheta_i/dt = 1 + Delta (theta_i)[ I_i/C + sum J_{ij}/C delta(t-t_j)] mod T</p><p>with C the membrane capacitance. Theta is a time-like variable at this point. To make it a phase-like variable (as the authors do), then let theta = T phi. Then one obtains</p><p>dphi_i/dt = omega + (1/T) Delta(T phi_i) [ I_i/C + sum J_{ij}/C delta(t-t_j)] mod 1</p><p>Conditions for synchrony etc are the same as the first model if, say you reduce this to a phase-difference model by replacing the delta(t) with delta(phi).</p><p>My point is, that the amplitude dependence on frequency is partially a consequence of how you normalize the PRC. If you look at Tsubo Figure 4, the amplitudes are all the same in their normalized version. The theory predicted by the theta model is that the period-normalized PRCs should have constant amplitudes.</p><p>I think the results are interesting, but I also think that they need to do some more sophisticated math analysis and also relate their PRCs more directly to the synachronization/correlation effects. This could be done with a weak coupling analysis after convolving their PRCs with the synapses to obtain the interaction function. The most important facet of PRCs is not som much their amplitude (which can be compensated for by changing the coupling), but their shape. I'd like more theoretical understanding of the shape dependence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript explores how average firing rate in Purkinje cells affects their PRC and high-frequency oscillations.

In their explanation of the biophysical mechanism of rate adaptation of PRCs in PCs that follows (in subsection “PRC Exhibits Rate Adaptation in PCs”), dendrites are not mentioned, however, as if the dendrite was not relevant to the mechanism at all. Did the authors follow this somewhat contradictory strategy because they consider the role of the dendrite too simple or too complicated to explain? Could the main consequence of the presence of an active or passive dendrite be its (capacitive and Ohmic) load, leading to a depolarizing shift of the somatic voltage threshold of spikes (Bekkers and Hausser, 2007; Zang et al., 2018)? With the consequence that, in a well-tuned, physiologically detailed PC model like that of the authors, removal of the dendrite would lead to a shift in the spike threshold in the hyperpolarized direction, artificially interfering with the mechanism illustrated by the authors in Figure 2A and B?</p><p>If the importance of the dendrite is in fact due to an effect of this (or a similar) kind, then not only would the reader benefit from a brief explanation, but the authors could also make experimentally testable predictions of what happens to the PRC at different firing rates when the (passive or active) dendrite is pinched, i.e. isolating the some from the dendrite.</p><p>2) More generally, can the authors propose other experimentally testable predictions resulting from their biophysical mechanism of rate-dependent PRCs? This would help strengthen the study.</p><p>3) I am somewhat baffled by the words &quot;just the passive depolarization&quot; in the explanation (subsection “The Biophysical Mechanism of Rate Adaptation of PRCs in PCs”) that &quot;During early phases of all rates, membrane potentials are distant from the Na<sup>+</sup> activation threshold (Figure 2A,B). The depolarizations to weak stimuli fail to activate sufficient Na<sup>+</sup> channels to speed up voltage trajectories, and phase advances are caused by just the passive depolarizations (Figure 2C). Consequently, phase advances in early phases are small and flat (or phase independent).&quot; In the bottom (12 Hz) PRC in Figure 1B, there is an (admittedly broad) local maximum near phase 0.2. If these phase advances due to stimuli in an early phase of the PRC were indeed caused just by the resulting passive depolarizations, then the amplitude of these depolarizations should decay with the passive membrane time constant, leading to smaller PRC amplitudes at early phases (such as 0.2) than later phases (such as 0.8). The 12 and 27 Hz PRCs in Figure 1B show the opposite effect, suggesting that the membrane potential of a passive soma is not the only relevant state variable governing the approximately flat part of the PRC. Which other state variables (e.g. dendritic membrane potential, calcium concentration, activation or inactivation state of ion channels) could explain the shape of the 'foot' of the PRC at low rates?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Firing Rate-dependent Phase Responses of Purkinje Cells Support Transient Oscillations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

For this reason, I would like to restrict myself to a brief discussion of cell physiological aspects of the work. Overall, the study is well done, and I believe that this work will be important to the field of cerebellar physiology, with further reaching implications in the neurosciences regarding the impact of neuronal oscillations.</p><p>1) It should be stated in the results section whether the modeling focuses on Purkinje cells in adult animals, or during development. This is crucial information, keeping in mind that the nature of Purkinje cell – Purkinje cell interactions changes during development (see Watt et al., 2009; cited).</p><p>2) Results section: the cell's responsiveness and spike output (in response to synaptic drive) appear to change with the state of the AHP, not only the amplitude of synaptic input (Ohtsuki et al., 2018). Does the model predict how the oscillatory phase affects synaptically driven spike firing?</p><p>3) Are resurgent Na conductances (Raman and Bean, 1997) critical for the occurrence of these oscillations or specific parameters?</p><p>4) Does the model account for differences in spike firing frequencies in zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative cerebellar modules (Zhou et al., 2014)? This is suggested by the findings of Schonewille and others (Grasselli et al., 2020) that in SK channel knockout mice these firing properties are differentially affected, which highlights the role of the AHP in sub-and suprathreshold modulation.</p><p>5) Are oscillations in the cerebellum coherent with high-frequency oscillations in other brain areas? This is suggested by the observation that input from the cerebellar nuclei regulates gamma frequency oscillations in thalamocortical networks (Timofeev and Steriade, 1997).</p><p>Addressing these points will shed more light on the consequences of these oscillations for cerebellar output functions and will thus hopefully further enhance the impact of this interesting paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60692.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Equation 1 we used to compute the PRC is identical to the equation in Ermentrout, Pascal and Gutkin (2001). As far as we know, the usual normalization the reviewer alludes to can only be applied to very simple models. We now mention explicitly that the use of Equation 1 facilitates comparison with experimental data (subsection “PRC Computations”).</p><p>We do understand the broader argument that this standard normalization of the PRC, dividing the difference in spike timing by the period, promotes a firing rate-dependence of the peak amplitude of the PRC. This has never been explicitly acknowledged in previous experimental literature that described this phenomenon, namely Phoka et al., 2010 and the confirmation by Couto et al., 2015.

In their explanation of the biophysical mechanism of rate adaptation of PRCs in PCs that follows (in subsection “PRC Exhibits Rate Adaptation in PCs”), dendrites are not mentioned, however, as if the dendrite was not relevant to the mechanism at all. Did the authors follow this somewhat contradictory strategy because they consider the role of the dendrite too simple or too complicated to explain? Could the main consequence of the presence of an active or passive dendrite be its (capacitive and Ohmic) load, leading to a depolarizing shift of the somatic voltage threshold of spikes (Bekkers and Hausser, 2007; Zang et al., 2018)? With the consequence that, in a well-tuned, physiologically detailed PC model like that of the authors, removal of the dendrite would lead to a shift in the spike threshold in the hyperpolarized direction, artificially interfering with the mechanism illustrated by the authors in Figure 2A and B?</p><p>If the importance of the dendrite is in fact due to an effect of this (or a similar) kind, then not only would the reader benefit from a brief explanation, but the authors could also make experimentally testable predictions of what happens to the PRC at different firing rates when the (passive or active) dendrite is pinched, i.e. isolating the some from the dendrite.</p></disp-quote><p>As already shown in Zang et al., 2018 the dendrite extensively changes the spike shape, without dendrite there is a stronger afterhyperpolarization that significantly changes the subthreshold trajectory. As a consequence, the PRC without dendrite looks completely different. See new Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and subsection “Biophysical Mechanisms Underlying Rate-dependent PRCs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More generally, can the authors propose other experimentally testable predictions resulting from their biophysical mechanism of rate-dependent PRCs? This would help strengthen the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added suggestions to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I am somewhat baffled by the words &quot;just the passive depolarization&quot; in the explanation (subsection “The Biophysical Mechanism of Rate Adaptation of PRCs in PCs”) that &quot;During early phases of all rates, membrane potentials are distant from the Na<sup>+</sup> activation threshold (Figure 2A,B). The depolarizations to weak stimuli fail to activate sufficient Na<sup>+</sup> channels to speed up voltage trajectories, and phase advances are caused by just the passive depolarizations (Figure 2C). Consequently, phase advances in early phases are small and flat (or phase independent).&quot; In the bottom (12 Hz) PRC in Figure 1B, there is an (admittedly broad) local maximum near phase 0.2. If these phase advances due to stimuli in an early phase of the PRC were indeed caused just by the resulting passive depolarizations, then the amplitude of these depolarizations should decay with the passive membrane time constant, leading to smaller PRC amplitudes at early phases (such as 0.2) than later phases (such as 0.8). The 12 and 27 Hz PRCs in Figure 1B show the opposite effect, suggesting that the membrane potential of a passive soma is not the only relevant state variable governing the approximately flat part of the PRC. Which other state variables (e.g. dendritic membrane potential, calcium concentration, activation or inactivation state of ion channels) could explain the shape of the 'foot' of the PRC at low rates?</p></disp-quote><p>We no longer use “passive depolarization” as it may be a confusing terminology. We emphasize the importance of activation of transient versus persistent sodium channels (subsection “Subsection “The Biophysical Mechanism of Rate Adaptation of PRCs in PCs”).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The reviews by the three other referees have already appropriately summarized the findings and commented on the modeling aspects of the study. For this reason, I would like to restrict myself to a brief discussion of cell physiological aspects of the work. Overall, the study is well done, and I believe that this work will be important to the field of cerebellar physiology, with further reaching implications in the neurosciences regarding the impact of neuronal oscillations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for agreeing with the importance of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) It should be stated in the Results section whether the modeling focuses on Purkinje cells in adult animals, or during development. This is crucial information, keeping in mind that the nature of Purkinje cell – Purkinje cell interactions changes during development (see Watt et al., 2009; cited).</p></disp-quote><p>We added text to the Results section to clarify that we simulated adult cerebellar cortex and the evidence to support the presence of collateral connections in adults.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Results section: the cell's responsiveness and spike output (in response to synaptic drive) appear to change with the state of the AHP, not only the amplitude of synaptic input (Ohtsuki et al., 2018). Does the model predict how the oscillatory phase affects synaptically driven spike firing?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous theoretical work cited in the Introduction established that the PRC predicts how the oscillatory phase affects spike firing caused by synaptic input. As the model reproduces the experimental PRC, it should also make this prediction. The paper has been cited and discussed in Subsection “Biophysical Mechanisms Underlying Rate-dependent PRCs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Are resurgent Na conductances (Raman and Bean, 1997) critical for the occurrence of these oscillations or specific parameters?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, resurgent Na conductance is critical for PRCs and then for oscillations. We used a state model of sodium channel gating from Raman and Bean, 2001, which incorporates transient, resurgent and persistent current in one model. We now mentioned resurgent component in subsection “The Biophysical Mechanism of Rate Adaptation of PRCs in PCs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does the model account for differences in spike firing frequencies in zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative cerebellar modules (Zhou et al., 2014)? This is suggested by the findings of Schonewille and others (Grasselli et al., 2020) that in SK channel knockout mice these firing properties are differentially affected, which highlights the role of the AHP in sub-and suprathreshold modulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to lack of data, we can’t account for differences in zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative cerebellar modules. We have clearly stated this as a limitation. These papers have been cited and discussed. Subsection “Biophysical Mechanisms Underlying Rate-dependent PRCs”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Are oscillations in the cerebellum coherent with high-frequency oscillations in other brain areas? This is suggested by the observation that input from the cerebellar nuclei regulates γ frequency oscillations in thalamocortical networks (Timofeev and Steriade, 1997).</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss coherence of oscillations in subsection “Down-stream effects of PC assemblies”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
