precisely control their protein composition according to cellular energy demand. Although nuclear-encoded mRNAs can be localized to the mitochondrial surface, the importance of this localization is unclear. As yeast switch to respiratory metabolism, there is an increase in the fraction of the cytoplasm that is mitochondrial. Our data point to this change in mitochondrial volume fraction increasing the localization of certain nuclear-encoded mRNAs to the surface of the mitochondria. We show that mitochondrial mRNA localization is necessary and sufficient to increase protein production to levels required during respiratory growth. Furthermore, we find that ribosome stalling impacts mRNA sensitivity to mitochondrial volume fraction and counterintuitively leads to enhanced protein synthesis by increasing mRNA localization to mitochondria. This points to a mechanism by which cells are able to use translation elongation and the geometric constraints of the cell to fine-tune organelle-specific gene expression through mRNA localization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mRNA localization</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are essential cellular organelles that are key sources of ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation as well as the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters and many other catabolic and anabolic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attardi and Schatz, 1988</xref>). To support mitochondrial function, proteins from hundreds of nuclear genes are imported into mitochondria from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morgenstern et al., 2017</xref>). This has to be coordinated with the gene expression of the mitochondrial genome, which in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> contains 13 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borst and Grivell, 1978</xref>). While cells can generate ATP through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, they can also use glycolysis as an alternative means of generating ATP. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are Crabtree-positive yeast and will actively repress respiration and the use of alternative carbon sources in conditions in which the fermentable carbon source glucose is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Deken, 1966</xref>). This seems counterintuitive as the yield of ATP per glucose molecule is much higher in respiration compared to fermentation, but it is thought that fermentation allows higher fluxes of metabolite processing, leading to faster growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Dijken et al., 1993</xref>). Yet as cells run out of glucose they must switch their primary ATP generation source from fermentation to respiration. This metabolic change is known to dramatically change the mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Egner et al., 2002</xref>). The protein content of yeast mitochondria also shows dynamic changes in response to shifting cellular energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morgenstern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paulo et al., 2016</xref>). The HAP complex is known to play an important role in the transcriptional upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis upon a shift to non-fermentable carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buschlen et al., 2003</xref>). Translational regulation has also been found to be important in the control of mitochondrial gene expression as oxidative phosphorylation protein coding mRNAs gradually increase their protein synthesis as the growth environment changes from fermentative growth to respiratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couvillion et al., 2016</xref>). mRNA localization is a means to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression at both a temporal and spatial level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin and Ephrussi, 2009</xref>). In the 1970s, electron microscopy analysis found that cytoplasmic ribosomes can be localized along the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kellems et al., 1974</xref>). Recent microarray and RNA-seq analyses of biochemically fractionated mitochondrial membranes and fluorescent microscopy analysis have identified subsets of nuclear-encoded mRNAs that are mitochondrially localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gadir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marc et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saint-Georges et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). It has been shown that both the 3′ UTR and coding regions, primarily through mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTSs), contribute to mitochondrial localization. One class of localized mRNAs (Class I) was shown to be dependent on the Puf3 RNA-binging protein through binding motifs in the 3′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saint-Georges et al., 2008</xref>). Another class of mRNAs was localized to the mitochondria independently of Puf3 (Class II). Many of the localized mRNAs show reduced association upon polysome dissociation through EDTA or puromycin treatment, implicating translation as a necessary factor for mRNA localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eliyahu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazal et al., 2019</xref>). The mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex has been shown to impact mRNA localization through interaction with the nascent MTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eliyahu et al., 2010</xref>), while the outer-membrane protein OM14 has been shown to be a mitochondrial receptor for the ribosome nascent-chain-associated complex (NAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lesnik et al., 2014</xref>). Isolating mitochondrially localized ribosomes to perform proximity-specific ribosome profiling revealed that many mitochondrial inner-membrane protein mRNAs are co-translationally targeted to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). These observations have suggested a mechanism of co-translational protein import into mitochondria for a subset of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs.</p><p>While mRNA localization is a way to control gene expression and there is strong evidence for the localization of mRNAs to the mitochondria, the use of this mRNA localization to alter the composition of mitochondria in different environmental conditions has not been explored. Furthermore, though mitochondrial biogenesis is thought to be transcriptionally regulated in relation to the metabolic needs of the cell, how these changing mitochondrial dynamics may also directly impact mRNA localization and protein synthesis has not been investigated. Here we report that interactions between mitochondria and mRNA/nascent-peptide (MTS) complexes can be altered by both the kinetics of protein synthesis and the fraction of cytoplasm that is mitochondrial, leading to condition-dependent mitochondrial mRNA localization during respiratory conditions. This localization subsequently leads to enhanced protein expression for these condition-specific localized mRNAs during respiratory conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>mRNA association with mitochondria differs between fermentative and respiratory conditions</title><p>To explore how mRNA localization is impacted by the metabolic state of the cell and changing mitochondrial morphologies, we developed a methodology to quantify mRNA location and mitochondrial 3D structure in living cells.

We were able to recapitulate the behavior of <italic>TOM22</italic> via a model of an ideal Brownian particle with no affinity for the mitochondria, which showed linearly correlated localization with mitochondrial volume fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, equation (1)</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We then set up a simple equilibrium equation where the baseline equilibrium constant, K<sub>0</sub>, was set by a freely diffusing particle like <italic>TOM22</italic> and multiplied by the affinity, A, of the particle for the mitochondria, thus giving K = AK<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, equation (2)</xref>; Materials and methods). As the value of A increased in the simulation, the proportion of mitochondrial localization of the mRNA for a given mitochondrial volume fraction increased as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We then applied this relationship to estimate the experimental values of A to be 2.4 and 8.8 for <italic>ATP3</italic> and <italic>TIM50</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Notably, mitochondrial volume fraction correlates with mRNA localization, but cell volume and mitochondrial volume alone did not show any correlation through fermentative and respiratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Interestingly, this simple mathematical relationship also recapitulates the shape of the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, suggesting that the apparent shift in association that occurs during the switch from fermentative to respiratory conditions may be primarily a result of the combination of the mitochondrial volume fraction and the strength of mRNA-specific association and, therefore, not due to the difference in growth condition or to other mechanisms.</p><p>To further test this model, we sought to manipulate mitochondrial volume fraction in a multitude of ways. We first tested the impact of increased mitochondrial biogenesis on mRNA localization while maintaining the nutrient conditions of the cell. Reg1 is a protein necessary for glucose repression in yeast, and <italic>reg1</italic>∆ cells exhibit increased mitochondrial function in glucose media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hübscher et al., 2016</xref>). Supporting our model, we observed increased mitochondrial volume fraction in rich glucose conditions in <italic>reg1</italic>∆ mutant cells as well as increased <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA localization to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). Additionally, the antibiotic chloramphenicol is known to decrease mitochondrial protein synthesis while having no effect on cytoplasmic translation and has been found to increase the fraction of mitochondrial protein in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> and mitochondrial volume in <italic>Tetrahymena pyriformis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brody, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gleason et al., 1975</xref>). We sought to test whether chloramphenicol would alter the mitochondria volume fraction in yeast during rich glucose conditions when mitochondrial respiration is not required. We observed an ~70% increase in mitochondria volume fraction in yeast cells treated with chloramphenicol and, simultaneously, a ~ 50% increase in <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA mitochondrial association during vegetative conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that mitochondrial volume fraction is the important variable for <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA localization and not a factor related to respiration, as chloramphenicol decreases respiratory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Williamson et al., 1971</xref>) while increasing mitochondrial volume fraction and <italic>ATP3</italic> localization.</p><p>Finally, as mitochondrial volume fraction can be increased by either increasing mitochondrial volume or decreasing cytoplasmic volume, we tested whether decreasing cytoplasmic volume could increase <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA mitochondrial association. <italic>sch9∆</italic> was previously found to be one of the smallest strains from a genome-wide screen for cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen et al., 2002</xref>). We found that <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNAs showed increased mitochondrial association in <italic>sch9∆</italic>, though from initial analysis this was not accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial volume fraction. While imaging these cells, we noticed a large increase in the relative vacuole in <italic>sch9∆</italic> cells; the vacuole volume fraction was ~6 x higher in <italic>sch9∆</italic> cells versus WT cells. As the vacuole restricts the accessible cytoplasmic volume, we recalculated the mitochondrial volume fraction relative to the accessible cytosol and found that <italic>sch9∆</italic> cells have a significant increase in mitochondrial volume fraction after this correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). With this corrected mitochondrial volume fraction, we found that, similar to <italic>reg1</italic>∆ and chloramphenicol-treated cells, <italic>sch9∆</italic> cells had increased localization of <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA to the mitochondria that was not significantly different either from our experimental measurements relating mitochondrial volume fraction and mRNA association in WT cells or from what would be predicted from our mRNA localization simulation based solely on changing mitochondrial volume fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3G–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). These results show that the relationship between mitochondrial volume fraction and mRNA localization holds across highly varied perturbations, including nutritional (glucose/glycerol), genetic (<italic>reg1</italic>∆, <italic>sch9</italic>∆), and pharmacological (chloramphenicol).</p><p>An alternative possibility is that expression of the import machinery or the NAC receptor correlate with mitochondrial volume fraction and that these are what is important for the changes in <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA localization. If this is the case, we expect that the expression of these genes should increase across all perturbations that have higher mitochondrial volume fraction and increased <italic>ATP3</italic> localization. To test this, we investigated the expression of potential known receptors in fermentative and respiratory conditions using published proteomics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morgenstern et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, most of these potential receptors, including the import machinery, TOM/SAM complex, do not show a difference in expression between respiratory and fermentative conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). The outer membrane receptors OM14 and OM45 did have a significant 7 to 9-fold increase in expression when mitochondrial volume fraction is expanded. To further explore the role of these outer membrane proteins in mRNA localization we measured their expression in <italic>reg1</italic>∆ and <italic>sch9</italic>∆ mutant strains, which have increased mitochondrial volume fraction and <italic>ATP3</italic> localization, but are grown in glucose media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). While we are able to recapitulate the large increase in expression of <italic>OM14</italic> and <italic>OM45</italic> in respiratory conditions, we do not find a significant increase in the expression of these RNAs in <italic>reg1</italic>∆ and <italic>sch9</italic>∆ mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Overall, these data point to the importance of increasing mitochondrial volume fraction effectively shrinking the cytoplasm and favoring random interactions with the mitochondrial membrane, which would result in altered association based on binding affinities of the components involved. Furthermore, mRNA association with mitochondria can be tuneable to permit a switch-like transition in mitochondrial localization, as is seen for <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), due to a nutrient-induced change in mitochondrial volume fraction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Translation regulates mRNA localization</title><p>Given these results, we wanted to delve further into the mechanism of this varying localization and protein production.

However, a series of biochemistry and microscopy analysis showed that some nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein mRNAs are translated on the mitochondrial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gadir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gold et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kellems et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marc et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saint-Georges et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore investigated the effects of the MTS and of protein translation on mRNA association with mitochondria. We remove or replaced the MTS of Tim50p with an ER-localization signal or introduced an ER-targeting signal at the N-terminus of Tom22p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we designed chimeric reporter genes wherein we swapped the MTS sequences between Tim50p and Atp3p under <italic>TIM50</italic> promoter control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Polyproline stretches have been shown to mediate ribosome stalling, and, when we investigated a ribosome profiling data set, we found that ribosomes accumulate at this polyproline stretch during fermentative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zid and O’Shea, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests a possible mechanism, similar to what has been seen for SRP recognition, by which local slowdown of ribosomes increases the chance that the mitochondria will recognize the <italic>TIM50</italic> MTS and consequently promote its association with the mitochondrial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pechmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang and Shan, 2012</xref>). To test this, we deleted these polyproline residues and found this caused <italic>TIM50</italic> to be more sensitive to environmental conditions as it reduced both protein synthesis and mRNA localization of <italic>TIM50</italic> during fermentative conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). In contrast, the ATP3 coding sequence does not have any obvious strong ribosome stalling sequence. This suggests that <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA localization and protein synthesis are regulated solely in a manner dependent on mitochondrial volume fraction. If this is true, artificially slowing the ribosomes in fermentative conditions should drive <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA to become mitochondrially localized. To test this hypothesis, we inserted a run of 7 consecutive proline codons at 100 amino acids downstream of the start codon and analyzed protein expression in fermentative conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right). We observed that protein production is increased 1.6-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and mRNA localization is increased as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). An alternative explanation is that the RNA sequence encoding the polyprolines is important for localization to the mitochondria and not ribosome stalling due to the encoded polyprolines. We believe this is not the case as translation initiation is key for the localization of <italic>TIM50</italic> mRNA to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and that upon lactimidomycin treatment <italic>TIM50</italic> and <italic>ATP3</italic> have indistinguishable localization phenotypes even though <italic>TIM50</italic> mRNAs contain the RNA sequence for seven consecutive polyprolines and <italic>ATP3</italic> does not, arguing against the RNA sequence directly having a role in the differential localization between <italic>TIM50</italic> and <italic>ATP3</italic>. Overall these results further suggest that ribosome stalling leads to mRNA localization to mitochondria and increased protein production.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Decreased translational elongation localizes mRNA to mitochondria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of deletion of polyproline sequence from <italic>TIM50-flagGFP/flagiRFP</italic> reporter gene and insertion of polyproline sequence into <italic>ATP3- flagGFP/flagiRFP</italic> reporter gene.

We therefore hypothesized that mRNA localization to mitochondria may be a way to drive the coordinated increase in mitochondrial protein production observed in respiratory conditions. An alternative explanation is that increased translation drives more nascent protein production, which increases mRNA localization to the mitochondria. To directly test these two possibilities, we analyzed the effect of driving mRNA localization to mitochondria on protein expression. To accomplish this, we tethered reporter mRNAs to mitochondria by MS2 sequences. We inserted the MCP protein into the C-terminus of Tom20p and Tom70p, two well-characterized proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane, and analyzed subsequent protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We found that tethering <italic>TIM50-flag-GFP-12xMS2</italic> and <italic>ATP3-flag-GFP-12xMS2</italic> mRNA to the mitochondria was sufficient to upregulate protein production. Surprisingly, protein production was increased independent of the mRNA harboring an MTS, as an mRNA that contained <italic>flag-GFP</italic> with no mitochondrial coding sequences also showed increased protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). We then analyzed whether tethering to the ER might affect protein production by inserting the MCP protein into the C-terminus of Sec63p. We also saw increased protein production when mRNA was tethered to the ER, suggesting that the surface of both of these organelles may harbor the capacity for enhanced protein synthesis. In addition to increased protein expression, we also observed increased mRNA levels when mRNAs were tethered to the mitochondria. However, the ratio of protein to mRNA was much higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We further observed a 3-fold increase in ribosome association rate from sucrose density fractionated mRNAs for mRNAs that were tethered to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that translational efficiency is increased on the mitochondrial surface. To test whether localization to the mitochondria is necessary for optimal protein production during respiratory conditions, we reduced the localization of endogenous <italic>ATP3</italic> and <italic>TIM50</italic> mRNA to mitochondria by directing those mRNAs to the plasma membrane via insertion of a CaaX-tag to the C termini of MCP-GFP proteins during respiratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). This caused a decrease in protein reporter levels of mitochondrial localized mRNAs, such as <italic>TIM50</italic>, <italic>ATP3</italic>, and <italic>ATP2</italic>, but not in non-mitochondrially localized mRNAs, such as <italic>TOM22</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We demonstrate that yeast cells can use the geometric constraints that arise from increased mitochondrial volume fraction during respiratory conditions to increase condition-dependent mitochondrial localization for a subset of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs. We favor the hypothesis that the geometric constraints of mitochondrial volume fraction are an important factor impacting mRNA localization for two reasons: first, our simple mathematical model incorporating mitochondrial volume fraction and various binding affinities is able to recapitulate the mRNA localization effects we see in cells. Second, the relationship between mitochondrial volume fraction and mRNA localization holds across a multitude of experimental perturbations, which presumably impact mitochondrial function in very different ways. <italic>reg1</italic>∆ changes mitochondrial volume fraction exclusively by increasing mitochondrial volume, whereas chloramphenicol and a nutrient shift from glucose to glycerol media increase mitochondrial volume fraction by both increasing mitochondrial volume and decreasing cytoplasmic volume. While <italic>reg1</italic>∆ and glycerol media increase oxidative phosphorylation, chloramphenicol inhibits mitochondrial translation and respiratory function. Finally, <italic>sch9</italic>∆ has a reduced mitochondrial volume but an increased vacuolar volume. This increase in vacuolar size decreases the accessible cytoplasm, thereby increasing the mitochondrial volume fraction, and increases <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA localization to the mitochondria. While we believe the geometric constraints of the cell are important for mRNA localization, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that there are secondary factors such as receptor concentrations that also contribute to the mRNA localization, yet as we do not find them to be correlated with mRNA localization across all of our diverse perturbations, we do not believe receptor concentrations are the primary drivers of the mRNA localization changes we observe.</p><p>Our results also indicate that translation duration plays an important role in mRNA localization to the mitochondria. We believe that translation duration and mitochondrial volume fraction are interconnected, as both will impact the probability of the mitochondria interacting with a competent mRNA, meaning the MTS is exposed while still attached to the mRNA as a nascent-polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA, which has fast translation elongation compared to <italic>TIM50</italic>, is in a competent state for a shorter period of time, so during fermentative conditions it is less likely to interact with mitochondria while in a competent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Conversely, ribosome stalling along <italic>TIM50</italic> mRNA prolongs the time the mRNA is in a competent state, and this increases its probability of interacting with mitochondria even when in low mitochondrial volume fraction conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As the mitochondrial volume fraction of cells increases as they shift to respiratory conditions, there is a higher probability of competent mRNAs interacting with the mitochondria, even if they are only competent for a short time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). While we show that one way to increase translation duration is a translation elongation stall caused by polyproline sequences, other mechanisms that increase translation duration including increasing ORF length, rare codons, and mRNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schuller and Green, 2018</xref>) have similar potential to impact mRNA localization.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial volume fraction controls protein synthesis of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Competency of mRNA localization to mitochondria is regulated by translational elongation. After the MTS is translated and exposed from the ribosome the mRNA becomes competent for localization to the mitochondria for as long as the mRNA is associated with the nascent chain.

Our work points to localization to mitochondria having an alternative function: to upregulate protein synthesis, as we found that mRNA localization to mitochondria was sufficient to increase protein synthesis, whereas tethering mRNAs away from the mitochondria to the plasma membrane reduced protein synthesis. The decrease in protein levels when <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA is anchored to the plasma membrane is also associated with a growth defect during respiratory conditions. Yet localization to the mitochondria is not absolutely required for optimal growth; when <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNAs were targeted away from the mitochondria to the ER, there was no growth defect. This may be because, similar to the mitochondria, there is an upregulation of protein levels when mRNAs are targeted to the ER.</p><p>Condition-dependent mRNA localization to the mitochondria as a means to control gene expression could be used to tune the protein composition of the mitochondria to the metabolic needs of the cell. Several observations support this hypothesis. For example, the conserved subunits of ATP synthase are all sensitive to the translation elongation rates in the cell, and these subunits showed similar localization regulation patterns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>); this suggests that a mechanism may have evolved that coordinates the expression and stoichiometry of vital subunits of this complex. Interestingly it has been shown that nuclear-encoded components of the F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase complex upregulate the translation of the mitochondrially encoded <italic>ATP6</italic> and <italic>ATP8</italic> subunits potentially contributing to the synchronization of these separated genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rak and Tzagoloff, 2009</xref>). Further supporting the use of condition-dependent mRNA localization in impacting gene expression is global data showing that cycloheximide-sensitive mRNAs (<italic>ATP3</italic>-type) show a more than 2-fold increase in protein synthesis relative to constitutively localized mRNAs (<italic>TIM50</italic>-type) when cells shift from fermentation to respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). For <italic>ATP3</italic>-type mRNAs, the increase in protein synthesis during respiratory conditions is driven by both increases in translational efficiency and increased mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, the increase in protein levels seen when mRNAs were tethered to the mitochondria was driven by both an increase in mRNA levels and ribosome engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). As these reporter mRNAs are under identical promoters, we favor the hypothesis that localization to the mitochondria increases mRNA stability. It is unclear whether translational efficiency and mRNA stability are independently affected by localization to the mitochondria or whether they are interrelated, as previous reports have shown that increased translation initiation can lead to protection from mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roy and Jacobson, 2013</xref>). As discussed previously, ribosome stalling increases mRNA binding competency, driving mRNA localization to the mitochondria, along with increased translation initiation and mRNA stability. As translation initiation is thought to be the rate-limiting step in translation for most mRNAs, this would explain our somewhat-contradictory results showing that more ribosome stalling, through polyproline insertion, leads to increased protein synthesis.</p><p>How mitochondrially localized mRNAs can increase protein synthesis is still an open question. We consider the simplest explanation, that there may be an increased density of ribosomes on the mitochondrial surface, as previously suggested in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). It also might be true that translation initiation factors or mRNA decay factors have altered activities near mitochondria that produce high levels of ATP. An alternative idea is that there are specialized ribosomes, enriched at the mitochondrial surface, that enhance translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xue and Barna, 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, it was recently found that specific ribosomal protein paralogs are necessary for normal mitochondrial function. <italic>Rpl1b∆</italic> cells were found to be deficient for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources, whereas <italic>rpl1a∆</italic> had no growth defect in these conditions. Furthermore, <italic>rpl1b∆</italic> cells were found to have decreased translation of many mitochondrial proteins during respiratory conditions, including the <italic>ATP3</italic>-type mRNAs <italic>ATP1</italic> and <italic>ATP2 </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segev and Gerst, 2018</xref>). Determining how mRNA localization increases protein synthesis will increase our understanding on how mitochondria are able to control their composition in relation to the metabolic needs of the cell.</p><p>While we have found this gene expression control mechanism in yeast, we speculate that higher eukaryotic cells could also use mitochondrial mRNA localization, controlled by translation elongation and mitochondrial volume fraction, to regulate protein synthesis. Hinting at this, a recent paper exploring global mRNA localization in mammalian cells found that many ATP synthase mRNAs had enhanced localization to the mitochondria in a cycloheximide-dependent manner, similar to <italic>ATP3</italic>-type mRNAs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazal et al., 2019</xref>). Further exploration into the role of mitochondrial volume fraction and translation elongation in mRNA localization to the mitochondria will provide insight into the regulation of mitochondria in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>The yeast strains and plasmids used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and the oligonucleotides used for plasmid construction are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

We then hypothesized that some mRNAs may associate with the mitochondrial surface by a sequence-specific association (e.g. via an MTS) with a constant K such that:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>⇄</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is also thermodynamically given by<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mstyle><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where k<sub>B</sub> is Boltzmann’s constant, T is temperature, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">z</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the free energy gain from mitochondrial localization.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper provides evidence that localization of yeast mRNAs to mitochondria (mito) increases their translational efficiencies, and that the increased mito-localization seen for certain nucleus-encoded mito protein mRNAs during a shift from fermentative (ferm) to respiratory (resp) growth is driven by two factors. One is the increased proportion of cell volume made up by mito in respiratory growth, while the second, at least for <italic>TIM50</italic> mRNA under ferm conditions when the mito volume fraction is low, is a stretch of consecutive proline codons, known to confer a pause during translation elongation, which they hypothesize is required to increase the time available for association of the mito targeting sequence (MTS) in the nascent polypeptide with the MTS receptor on the mito outer membrane and thereby enhance mRNA localization to mito-associated ribosomes. <italic>ATP3</italic> appears to lack an elongation-stalling sequence as inserting the polyproline tract into its mRNA can enhance its mito-association in ferm conditions, which is normally lower than that seen for <italic>TIM50</italic> that naturally contains the PolyPro. This model can also explain the previous observation that inhibiting translation elongation with CHX can enhance mito-association of <italic>ATP3</italic> and certain other mito mRNAs, but not of TIM50, presumably by substituting for translation elongation stalling sequences in those former mRNAs. Consistent with their model, inhibiting initiation vs. elongation with lactimidomycin did not enhance mito. localization as this would prevent synthesis of the MTS. They also did tethering experiments and showed that artificially tethering any reporter mRNA tested (even GFP) to mitochondria increases its translation and mRNA abundance, whereas tethering <italic>TIM50</italic> or <italic>ATP3</italic> , but not <italic>TOM22</italic> or GFP, to the plasma membrane (PM) reduces their translation relative to the untethered state.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>The following are the major comments that would likely require additional experimental evidence to be addressed in a satisfactory way:</p><p>1) New experiments are needed to measure the levels of the TOM complex, or other relevant complexes (OM14 or SAM-Mdm10), to see if they increase under resp. growth conditions, which if so, could be an important factor beyond mito. volume per se in increasing localization of mito. mRNAs.</p><p>2) Present additional imaging data (videos) to convince us that the same mRNAs are being examined in different z-stacks.</p><p>3) Provide evidence for increased translation initiation, beyond just showing increased mRNA localization, in response to manipulations that increase the mitochondria volume fraction.</p><p>4) Show that deleting the MTS, rather than replacing it with an ER-targeting sequence, impairs mito. localization.</p><p>5) Add analysis of control constructs to confirm that the sequence encoding Polyproline increases mito. localization owing to translation elongation through polyproline codons rather than an inhibitory effect of the RNA sequences per se, involving synonomous codon replacements encoding PolyPro or a single base pair insertion to place the polyPro tract out of frame.</p><p>6) Provide a more comprehensive analysis of mRNA localization/translation in both fermentative and resp. conditions.</p><p>In addition, the paper should be revised, possibly including the title, to acknowledge that the present evidence is inadequate to conclude that mitochondrial volume is a major driver of mito protein localization, and to note that other intrinsic features of the translated ORFs (e.g. MTS, codon usage, ORF length), changes in translation and the level of the constituents involved in tethering under respiratory conditions, and alterations in cellular architecture (e.g. organelle size), may be equally or more important. The paper should also be revised to address as many as possible of the other major comments not touched on above</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper is interesting in providing evidence that localization of yeast mRNAs to mitochondria (mito) increases their translational efficiencies, and that the increased mito-localization seen for certain nucleus-encoded mito protein mRNAs during a shift from fermentative (ferm) to respiratory (resp) growth is driven by two factors. One is the increased proportion of cell volume made up by mito in respiratory growth, and although this point is established only by correlation, they did a thorough job of modulating the mito volume proportion in different ways and found coherent effects on mito localization of mRNAs. The second important element for mito localization, at least for <italic>TIM50</italic> mRNA under ferm conditions when the mito volume fraction is low, appears to be a stretch of consecutive proline codons, known to confer a pause during translation elongation, which they hypothesize is required to increase the time available for association of the mito targeting sequence (MTS) in the nascent polypeptide with the MTS receptor on the mito outer membrane and thereby enhance mRNA localization to mito-associated ribosomes. <italic>ATP3</italic> appears to lack an elongation-stalling sequence as inserting the polyproline tract into its mRNA can enhance its mito-association in ferm conditions, which is normally lower than that seen for <italic>TIM50</italic> that naturally contains the PolyPro.

They have failed to establish clearly that the MTS of <italic>TIM50</italic> is required for mito association of the mRNA, showing only that substituting it with an ER-localization sequence reduces the mito localization. They also need to show that simply deleting the MTS impairs mito localization of <italic>TIM50</italic> mRNA, if this has not already been published, in order to firmly establish that the MTS is actually necessary for mito localization of TIM50. Additional control experiments are needed regarding the polyproline tract to distinguish between an effect of the mRNA sequence on localization independently of translation, versus the putative effect of Pro codons in stalling elongation: rather than just deleting it from <italic>TIM50</italic>, they should also have made synonymous codon replacements by mutating the wobble position of each Pro codon. And in addition to just inserting it in frame in <italic>ATP3</italic>, they should have made a single base, out-of-frame insertion in which the in-frame codons would no longer encode PolyPro. Finally, they should show that the PolyPro tract won't work if it is located too close to the MTS, as the elongation pause needs to be enacted only after the complete MTS has emerged from the ribosome exit tunnel.</p><p>There were also a number of cases where they did not examine the effects of manipulating <italic>TIM50</italic> or <italic>ATP3</italic> under resp conditions in addition to ferm conditions (or at least I couldn't tell if both conditions were examined) making it unclear whether the elongation pause is needed for efficient localization only under ferm growth when the mito cell volume is relatively low,</p><p>– Ratio of association is a poor identifier of measurements, such as in Figure 1B, as ratio of what to what is not defined. If it's mitochondrial-associated to total mRNA, proportion would be a better term. Also, the language in figure legends can sometimes be misconstrued to indicate a ratio of association between fermentative and respiratory growth; and so more precision is needed in all of the figures where this term is used.</p><p>– As noted above, the authors failed to show that the MTS of <italic>TIM50</italic> is actually necessary for mito localization, only that its replacement with an ER-targeting signal reduces mito association. They need a deletion of the MTS versus replacement to make the point convincingly.</p><p>– Figure 3D: The legend claims that both ferm and resp conditions were examined, but it appears from the text that these data are only in ferm conditions, unless &quot;ratio&quot; of association means something different than above. In any event, the data in both conditions should be provided.</p><p>– Figure 4C-E: the same difficulty as for Figure 3D exists here, of unclear labeling and vague descriptions in the legends. Results from both ferm and resp conditions are needed to determine if the effects of polyproline on localization are restricted to only ferm conditions when mito volume is low.</p><p>– The experiments on the polyproline stretch need controls of synonymous codon changes vs. deletion for TIM50; and insertion of Pro codons out of frame for <italic>ATP3</italic>, to distinguish effects of mRNA sequence vs elongation stalling on localization.</p><p>– In the tethering experiments of Figure 6, one would like to know whether the effect on tethering of <italic>ATP3</italic> is less in resp vs. ferm conditions; and it's not clear which condition was actually analyzed. They also need to add the control of measuring native <italic>ATP3</italic> and <italic>TIM50</italic> expression in the strain with Tom70-MCP, as their expression should be unaltered.</p><p>– It's unclear why PM-tethering reduces translation of mRNAs that are normally mito-localized, but not non-localized mRNAs, as the findings with <italic>TOM22</italic> and GFP mRNAs with MS2 insertions show clearly that there are abundant ribosomes near the PM for translation of these mRNAs, and all of the mRNAs targeted to mito show increased translation. Presumably there are other unknown factors involved allowing <italic>TIM50</italic> and <italic>ATP3</italic> to be translated better when they are tethered to mitochondria vs the PM, but the authors don't consider this issue and should comment on it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The gene expression control events highlighted by this work are interesting and speak to the finely tuned nature of a cell to respond to cellular and environmental change. The data is of high quality and well presented. I also find the data to be thought provoking, but I am not convinced that mRNA localization is directly linked to mitochondrial volume fraction vs. binding interactions driven by the nascent chain and difference in translation across metabolic programs. Overall, I am supportive of publication if the points raised below can be adequately addressed.</p><p>1) How does mitochondrial composition change with organelle growth? It is not addressed how the TOM complex, or other relevant complexes (OM14 or SAM-Mdm10), change with mitochondrial volume or respiratory activity. For instance, if the density of these complexes are maintained as the membrane grows, or even increase with respiration, this would mean an increase in the total number of binding sites on the mitochondrial surface. As import of MTS proteins and insertion of <italic>Tom22</italic> involves one or more of these complexes, it may be changes in receptor numbers that drive association of mRNAs through the nascent polypeptide chain, not volume per se.</p><p>2) Is ORF length a driver of mitochondrial localization? Of the mRNAs studied, the proteins encoded are 476 (<italic>TIM50</italic>), 311 (<italic>ATP3</italic>), and 152 (<italic>TOM22</italic>) residues in length. Yet, the authors do not address the correlation of length with the percent mRNA localized. This question is furthered by the observation that among the ATP complex subunits, the shortest ORF (<italic>ATP16</italic>, 160 residues) is the one that is not impacted by CHX. Williams et al. 2014 has noted that there was correlation between ORF length and localization, with the majority of nascent chains observed at mitochondria being &gt;180 residues in length. A potentially informative experiment to address this issue would involve assaying mRNA localization and protein expression levels in <italic>TIM50</italic>/<italic>ATP3</italic>/<italic>TOM22</italic>-GPF reporters in response to fermentative vs. respiratory growth conditions.</p><p>3) The authors perform mRNA imaging over a time series and define a mRNA as localized if it is within a defined distance of the mitochondria in two consecutive imaging frames ~3 seconds apart. Mitochondria can move, an mRNA could release and rebind between z-stacks, or different mRNAs could bind sites physically close together at different times. As such, how is it that the authors know they are counting the same mRNA in consecutive z-stacks? This should be discussed and example images/videos provided to detail how this issue is dealt with. Assuming there is not much change between time points, the authors should be able to provide binding durations for each mRNA. I would expect such dwell time information to be valuable in terms of the modeling data in Figure 2 and could be used to favor or possibly exclude models explaining how/why different mRNAs are localized to the mitochondria surface (e.g. co-translational import, engagement with mitochondrial associated ribosomes, or transient interactions with translational/RNA-binding proteins needed for translation).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Tsuboi et al. investigated the mRNAs localization of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins in yeast under fermentative and respiratory growth conditions. They used single mRNA imaging with MS2 system in live cells with fluorescently labeled mitochondria. The authors observed that three types of behaviors: constitutively (<italic>TIM50</italic>), partially (<italic>ATP3</italic>) and not localized (<italic>TOM22</italic>). They found that <italic>ATP3</italic> localization to mitochondria increases when yeast was changed from fermentative to respiratory condition, while <italic>TIM50</italic> and <italic>TOM22</italic> have less changes. The mRNA localization was correlated to mitochondrial volume fraction. The localization depends on the MTS downstream coding sequence and the authors claim that the localization increased translation initiation. By mutation and translation inhibition, the authors found out that the decreased translation elongation localizes mRNA to mitochondria. Finally, by comparing mis-localized RNAs, the authors found out decreased protein production and some growth defects. The authors proposed a model that mitochondrial RNA localization increases protein translation.</p><p>Here the authors used single molecule approach to measure the distance between mRNA and the mitochondria directly, which is technically impressive and nice. Overall, the reviewer think that the data basically agrees with the previous transcriptome wide RNA localization data and the model proposed there: translation drives RNA localization on to the mitochondria, the degree of localization and the CHX sensitivity depend on the relative position of MTS and the downstream sequences in the mRNA. However, I think the data and the proposed model has some gaps, that requires tuning down the claim or further experimental confirmation.</p><p>1) The authors concentrated on MTS driven mitochondrial mRNA localization. As proposed before, it mainly depends on the location of MTS within the ORF and the downstream sequence (the length and the plausible stalling sequence). The authors observed that the association with mitochondria of certain mRNAs (<italic>ATP3</italic>) increased when yeast shifted from fermentative to respiratory condition. The authors claim that mitochondria volume fraction &quot;regulate&quot; the fraction of association. I think this is a chicken and egg question. The translation efficiencies of mRNAs may also explain these observations. <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNAs are not actively translated in fermentation condition. The translation efficiency dramatically increases (translation regulation) when the growth condition changed to respiration, which in turn drives the localization of the mRNAs to mitochondria. It makes sense that when fraction of mitochondria is increased, there is a higher chance for MTS to meet the receptor on it, which results in higher colocalization. The authors used ways to manipulate mitochondria fraction and indeed observed more interaction. But in those experiment, there is no direct evidence that increased localization results more translation initiation.</p><p>2) Mathematical modeling: the authors claim that <italic>ATP3</italic> and <italic>TIM50</italic> mRNAs has certain affinity to mitochondria. The authors claim the affinity to be &quot;strength of mRNA-specific association&quot;. But if the localization is mainly due to translation and MTS binding to the receptor, what does these binding affinities mean? Should it just be the function of translation efficiencies of mRNAs? Should the translation of mRNA explain all the localization? If the model can differentiate whether localization of mRNA increases translation efficiency, it would be more convincing and exciting.</p><p>3) The authors claimed increased translation initiation based on western, GFP fluorescence. Those final protein products may also depend on the protein stability. For example, if <italic>TIM50</italic> or <italic>ATP3</italic> are not synthesized on the surface of mitochondria, the nascent proteins may have lower stability and get degraded, because they may require co-transaltional translocation. The decreased protein can also result in growth phenotype.</p><p>4) The authors used combination of endogenous labeling and reporters. Sometimes, it is confusing which strains were used because it was not clearly stated. For example, MCP-GFP and <italic>ATP3</italic>-flag-GFP cannot be in the same strain, right? First, it cannot be used to image RNA. Second, the qPCR measurement of mRNA level using GFP primer include both MCP-GFP and <italic>ATP3</italic>-flag-GFP (Figure 6). So are there MCP-RFP used to visualize RNAs?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57814.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>The following are the major comments that would likely require additional experimental evidence to be addressed in a satisfactory way:</p><p>1) New experiments are needed to measure the levels of the TOM complex, or other relevant complexes (OM14 or SAM-Mdm10), to see if they increase under resp. growth conditions, which if so, could be an important factor beyond mito. volume per se in increasing localization of mito. mRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, we want to emphasize that the mitochondrial volume fraction, not mitochondrial volume is important for mRNA localization in terms of space restriction/ cellular constraints as shown for <italic>TOM22</italic> mRNA localization and simulation results (Figure 2B, 2D, Figure 2—figure supplement 2). From our modeling we are able to recapitulate general trends in our experimental data by using mRNAs with constant affinities across conditions and just adjusting the spatial restrictions from increasing mitochondrial volume fraction. While our simulation doesn’t completely recapitulate our experimental data, and this could be partially explained by changes in relevant receptors, we think it is beyond the scope of this paper to completely characterize all aspects of mRNA localization in this single manuscript. To touch on this issue though we explored as suggested the expression of the TOM complex, and other relevant complexes (OM14 or SAM-Mdm10) in fermentative versus respiratory conditions using data from Morgenstern et al., 2017. This dataset shows a 3.5 fold increase in <italic>ATP3</italic> and no change in <italic>TIM50</italic> when they compare protein expression levels in glucose and glycerol which are very similar to our results (Figure 1D, E). From their experiments, they showed protein expression are changed as follows.</p><p>The protein expression of TOM and most other complexes did not change appreciably in glucose and glycerol, except for OM14 and OM45. As we have perturbations that change mitochondrial volume fraction and <italic>ATP3</italic> localization independent of nutrients we sought to explore if OM14 and OM45 change in these perturbations. We were able to recapitulate the large changes in OM14 and OM45 RNA levels by RT-qPCR in respiratory conditions, but we see a slight decrease of OM14 and no significant change in OM45 in <italic>sch9</italic>∆ and <italic>reg1</italic>∆ strains, where we see a significant increase in mitochondrial volume fraction and <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA localization. This doesn’t mean OM14 and OM45 play no role in localization during respiratory conditions but that mitochondrial volume fraction is a key factor impacting mRNA localization. We believe further exploration of this relationship is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>We have added the following to the Results section:</p><p>“An alternative possibility is that expression of the import machinery or the NAC receptor correlate with mitochondrial volume fraction and that these are what is important for the changes in <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA localization. […] While we are able to recapitulate the large increase in expression of <italic>OM14</italic> and <italic>OM45</italic> in respiratory conditions, we do not find a significant increase in the expression of these RNAs in <italic>reg1∆</italic> and <italic>sch9∆</italic> mutant strains (Figure 2—figure supplement 5).”</p><p>And to the Discussion section: “While we believe the geometric constraints of the cell are important for mRNA localization, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that there are secondary factors such as receptor concentrations that also contribute to the mRNA localization, yet as we do not find them to be correlated with mRNA localization across all of our diverse perturbations, we do not believe receptor concentrations are the primary drivers of the mRNA localization changes we observe.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Present additional imaging data (videos) to convince us that the same mRNAs are being examined in different z-stacks.</p></disp-quote><p>We included videos for <italic>TIM50</italic>, <italic>ATP3</italic> and <italic>TOM22</italic> mRNAs in fermentative conditions as Video 2.

Presumably there are other unknown factors involved allowing TIM50 and ATP3 to be translated better when they are tethered to mitochondria vs the PM, but the authors don't consider this issue and should comment on it.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this is not a <italic>TIM50</italic> or <italic>ATP3</italic> specific issue, and that any mRNA that is localized to the mitochondrial surface has increased protein synthesis as seen for the cytosolic protein <italic>Flag-GFP</italic> in Figure 6B, C. So it is not that the plasma membrane is specifically limiting protein synthesis of mito-mRNAs localized there, but that mRNAs pulled away from the mitochondria don’t get the beneficial effects of being localized to the mitochondria and the associated increased protein synthesis. Similarly when we decrease mRNA localization to the mitochondria by deleting prolines in <italic>TIM50</italic>, we see decreased protein synthesis, not because it is localized to the plasma membrane, but because it is not localized to the mitochondrial surface.</p><p>We inserted the following statement in Discussion.</p><p>“How mitochondrially localized mRNAs can increase protein synthesis is still an open question.

We inserted a polyproline tract at 100aa from MTS and still see the increased mRNA localization. The ribosome tunnel size is generally thought as 30aa length and we are uncertain if effects from inserting the polyproline tract closer than 100aat would be from the MTS not being exposed or because the MTS was disrupted as the MTS is assumed to be ~30-100aa, but not always perfectly defined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The gene expression control events highlighted by this work are interesting and speak to the finely tuned nature of a cell to respond to cellular and environmental change. The data is of high quality and well presented. I also find the data to be thought provoking, but I am not convinced that mRNA localization is directly linked to mitochondrial volume fraction vs. binding interactions driven by the nascent chain and difference in translation across metabolic programs. Overall, I am supportive of publication if the points raised below can be adequately addressed.</p><p>1) How does mitochondrial composition change with organelle growth? It is not addressed how the TOM complex, or other relevant complexes (OM14 or SAM-Mdm10), change with mitochondrial volume or respiratory activity. For instance, if the density of these complexes are maintained as the membrane grows, or even increase with respiration, this would mean an increase in the total number of binding sites on the mitochondrial surface. As import of MTS proteins and insertion of Tom22 involves one or more of these complexes, it may be changes in receptor numbers that drive association of mRNAs through the nascent polypeptide chain, not volume per se.</p></disp-quote><p>This is fair point and we assessed change of receptors. Please see major additional experiment 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is ORF length a driver of mitochondrial localization? Of the mRNAs studied, the proteins encoded are 476 (TIM50), 311 (ATP3), and 152 (TOM22) residues in length. Yet, the authors do not address the correlation of length with the percent mRNA localized. This question is furthered by the observation that among the ATP complex subunits, the shortest ORF (ATP16, 160 residues) is the one that is not impacted by CHX. Williams et al. 2014 has noted that there was correlation between ORF length and localization, with the majority of nascent chains observed at mitochondria being &gt;180 residues in length. A potentially informative experiment to address this issue would involve assaying mRNA localization and protein expression levels in TIM50/ATP3/TOM22-GPF reporters in response to fermentative vs. respiratory growth conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers points that length of the mRNA will also potentially impact localization to the mitochondrial surface and have changed the title to “translation duration” to better encompass this point. Yet we have also found that length is not the only factor as we can remove the 7 polyprolines from <italic>TIM50</italic> (a &lt;2% length reduction) and see a large drop in localization, while inserting these short residues in <italic>ATP3</italic> increases localization. We also believe that using fluorescent microscopy to explore the impact of length skew the results.</p><p>We tested <italic>TIM50-iRFP</italic>, <italic>ATP3-iRFP</italic> by inserting <italic>iRFP</italic> into C-terminus of those genes. Please see major additional experiment 6 above. We see differences in ratio of mitochondrial association with/without <italic>iRFP</italic>. We observed ratio of association as 0.52 in fermentative and 0.7 in respiratory condition for <italic>TIM50</italic> mRNA and ratio of association as 0.15 in fermentative and 0.5 in respiratory condition for <italic>ATP3</italic> mRNA. When we insert <italic>iRFP</italic>, we observed an increase in the ratio of association for <italic>ATP3-iRFP</italic> (0.27 in fermentative and 0.6 in respiratory condition) yet we see a slight decrease in ratio of association for <italic>TIM50-iRFP</italic> (0.37 in fermentative and 0.64 in respiratory condition) compared to the shorter <italic>TIM50</italic>. The additional <italic>iRFP</italic> length of 948nt which can be at least 10-20nm in vivo (Adivarahan et al., 2018) may affect our quantification of localization because of the thresholding we set for a localized mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors perform mRNA imaging over a time series and define a mRNA as localized if it is within a defined distance of the mitochondria in two consecutive imaging frames ~3 seconds apart. Mitochondria can move, an mRNA could release and rebind between z-stacks, or different mRNAs could bind sites physically close together at different times. As such, how is it that the authors know they are counting the same mRNA in consecutive z-stacks? This should be discussed and example images/videos provided to detail how this issue is dealt with. Assuming there is not much change between time points, the authors should be able to provide binding durations for each mRNA. I would expect such dwell time information to be valuable in terms of the modeling data in Figure 2 and could be used to favor or possibly exclude models explaining how/why different mRNAs are localized to the mitochondria surface (e.g. co-translational import, engagement with mitochondrial associated ribosomes, or transient interactions with translational/RNA-binding proteins needed for translation).</p></disp-quote><p>Visualizing single molecule mRNA and mitochondria simultaneously in 3D was technically challenging experiment. MS2-GFP signals from mRNAs are fast bleaching and we can visualize them for 30 sec, which we are not able to analyze the binding duration time. As described in Materials and methods, we tracked mRNA manually and tested whether those tracks are equal to nearest neighbor search. We cannot exclude the opportunity that we mistrack the same single molecule mRNA in consecutive time points. As we added in major additional experiment 2 above, you may easily track the single mRNA, which associated to mitochondria by eyes, but for freely diffusing mRNAs we rely on justification by nearest neighbor search. We focused on the analysis of ratio of mitochondrial associated mRNA, which binds to mitochondria for consecutive 2 time points, which we are much more confident on those being the same mRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Tsuboi et al. investigated the mRNAs localization of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins in yeast under fermentative and respiratory growth conditions. They used single mRNA imaging with MS2 system in live cells with fluorescently labeled mitochondria. The authors observed that three types of behaviors: constitutively (TIM50), partially (ATP3) and not localized (TOM22). They found that ATP3 localization to mitochondria increases when yeast was changed from fermentative to respiratory condition, while TIM50 and TOM22 have less changes. The mRNA localization was correlated to mitochondrial volume fraction. The localization depends on the MTS downstream coding sequence and the authors claim that the localization increased translation initiation. By mutation and translation inhibition, the authors found out that the decreased translation elongation localizes mRNA to mitochondria. Finally, by comparing mis-localized RNAs, the authors found out decreased protein production and some growth defects. The authors proposed a model that mitochondrial RNA localization increases protein translation.</p><p>Here the authors used single molecule approach to measure the distance between mRNA and the mitochondria directly, which is technically impressive and nice. Overall, the reviewer think that the data basically agrees with the previous transcriptome wide RNA localization data and the model proposed there: translation drives RNA localization on to the mitochondria, the degree of localization and the CHX sensitivity depend on the relative position of MTS and the downstream sequences in the mRNA. However, I think the data and the proposed model has some gaps, that requires tuning down the claim or further experimental confirmation.</p><p>1) The authors concentrated on MTS driven mitochondrial mRNA localization. As proposed before, it mainly depends on the location of MTS within the ORF and the downstream sequence (the length and the plausible stalling sequence). The authors observed that the association with mitochondria of certain mRNAs (ATP3) increased when yeast shifted from fermentative to respiratory condition. The authors claim that mitochondria volume fraction &quot;regulate&quot; the fraction of association. I think this is a chicken and egg question. The translation efficiencies of mRNAs may also explain these observations. ATP3 mRNAs are not actively translated in fermentation condition. The translation efficiency dramatically increases (translation regulation) when the growth condition changed to respiration, which in turn drives the localization of the mRNAs to mitochondria. It makes sense that when fraction of mitochondria is increased, there is a higher chance for MTS to meet the receptor on it, which results in higher colocalization. The authors used ways to manipulate mitochondria fraction and indeed observed more interaction. But in those experiment, there is no direct evidence that increased localization results more translation initiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s chicken and egg proposition, to decouple condition specific translation effects from mRNA localization effects we tested the impact of tethering reporter mRNAs to mitochondria during fermentative conditions. For all mRNAs tested we measured increased protein synthesis. We believe this is in part due to increased mRNA stability, but that doesn’t explain the full extent of increased protein production. So to directly assay whether localization increases ribosome loading we performed polysome profiling and found that there is an increased fraction of mRNA associated with ribosomes when an mRNA is localized to the mitochondria, this suggests that in part mitochondrial localization increases protein synthesis through increased translation initiation (Figure 6A-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Mathematical modeling: the authors claim that ATP3 and TIM50 mRNAs has certain affinity to mitochondria. The authors claim the affinity to be &quot;strength of mRNA-specific association&quot;. But if the localization is mainly due to translation and MTS binding to the receptor, what does these binding affinities mean? Should it just be the function of translation efficiencies of mRNAs? Should the translation of mRNA explain all the localization? If the model can differentiate whether localization of mRNA increases translation efficiency, it would be more convincing and exciting.</p></disp-quote><p>As much of the actual localization process and import is still an active area of research with many unknowns we sought to use as simplistic model as possible to explore whether space/mitochondrial volume fraction with constant “affinity” could explain the condition specific localization phenotypes we see. From further research in our paper we agree that for <italic>ATP3</italic> and <italic>TIM50</italic> the time an mRNA is competent (MTS exposed) is probably the major factor impacting “strength of mRNA-specific association”. This competency will be impacted by multiple factors including translation initiation rate (translation efficiency), but also mRNA length and as we show elongation rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claimed increased translation initiation based on western, GFP fluorescence. Those final protein products may also depend on the protein stability. For example, if TIM50 or ATP3 are not synthesized on the surface of mitochondria, the nascent proteins may have lower stability and get degraded, because they may require co-transaltional translocation. The decreased protein can also result in growth phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>This unique idea that mis-co-translational translocation leads to protein degradation is a very interesting question and we were also interested in how the protein stability can change. We observed that half-life (Protein half-life was analyzed through western blotting. Samples were harvested at 0, 30 and 60 min after the addition of CHX (final 100µg/ml). The half-life was calculated by fitting data in log scale.) of the ATP3-GFP protein which is translated at the plasma membrane and the control half-life was both more than 2 hours, and not significantly different from each other. This is intuitive that 2 hours protein half-life does not much affect protein abundance of yeast cells, in which the cell cycle is 1.5 hours, but gene expression (cell cycle) controls protein abundance. Baum et al., 2019 has mathematically shown that cell cycle is more important than protein half-life for protein abundance when the protein half-life is longer than cell cycle. They stated that “It becomes evident that the influence of cell division increases with increasing half-life of either mRNA (Figure 3A, top row) or mRNA and protein.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors used combination of endogenous labeling and reporters. Sometimes, it is confusing which strains were used because it was not clearly stated. For example, MCP-GFP and ATP3-flag-GFP cannot be in the same strain, right? First, it cannot be used to image RNA. Second, the qPCR measurement of mRNA level using GFP primer include both MCP-GFP and ATP3-flag-GFP (Figure 6). So are there MCP-RFP used to visualize RNAs?</p></disp-quote><p>For visualizing mRNA movements in Figure 3 and 4, we used iRFP as a reporter genes. For Figure 6 we used MCP-GFP as a control in comparison to mito- and ER- tethering and tested protein levels using GFP-antibody and conduct qPCR using flag sequence as a part of amplicon. GFP-antibody binds to both MCP-GFP and flagGFP reporter gene, however we can distinguish the difference by the size.</p></body></sub-article></article>
