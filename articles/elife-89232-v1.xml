indicator targeted to mitochondria, the temperature of active mitochondria in four mammalian and one insect cell line was estimated to be up to 15°C above that of the external environment to which the cells were exposed. High mitochondrial temperature was maintained in the face of a variety of metabolic stresses, including substrate starvation or modification, decreased ATP demand due to inhibition of cytosolic protein synthesis, inhibition of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transporter and, if an auxiliary pathway for electron transfer was available via the alternative oxidase, even respiratory poisons acting downstream of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex I. We propose that the high temperature of active mitochondria is an inescapable consequence of the biochemistry of OXPHOS and is homeostatically maintained as a primary feature of mitochondrial metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thermogenesis</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>organelle</kwd><kwd>temperature</kwd><kwd>OXPHOS</kwd><kwd>bioenergetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>324730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salminen</surname><given-names>Tiina S</given-names></name><name><surname>Jacobs</surname><given-names>Howard T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Basic Science Research Institute Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1A6A1A10042944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Young-Tae</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006306</institution-id><institution>Sigrid Juséliuksen Säätiö</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3122800849</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salminen</surname><given-names>Tiina S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10.52926/jpmjcr15n3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagai</surname><given-names>Takeharu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023R1A2C300453411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Young-Tae</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>322732</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salminen</surname><given-names>Tiina S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>328969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salminen</surname><given-names>Tiina S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Based on two independent methods, mitochondria operate at temperatures up to 15°C hotter than ambient, adjusting their heat production so as to maintain temperature in face of physiological stresses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitochondrial system of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is considered the most efficient energy conversion platform of non-photosynthetic eukaryotes. However, it does not operate at or anywhere near 100% thermodynamic efficiency. Much of the free energy released by the reoxidation of primary electron carriers such as NADH is converted to heat. Note that this applies under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brand, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nath, 2016</xref>), not only in cells expressing uncoupler proteins or treated with a chemical uncoupler. Furthermore, this heat production is not mere ‘waste’, since it is a major and regulatable energy source for maintaining body temperature in homeotherms such as mammals and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brand et al., 1994</xref>), and possibly many other organisms, even those living at a wide range of temperatures in varying environments. Uncoupler proteins merely serve an auxiliary function under cold stress, as shown by the fact that, in mice, ablation of the major uncoupling protein UCP1 is nonlethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enerbäck et al., 1997</xref>) and does not affect basal body temperature.</p><p>Using the mitochondrially targeted fluorescent dye Mito Thermo Yellow (MTY), it was recently shown that intramitochondrial temperature in respiring, human HEK293-derived (immortalised embryonic kidney) cells is at least 10–12°C higher than the ambient temperature at which the cells are maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrétien et al., 2018</xref>). In essence, this inference was based on the fact that the MTY fluorescence change, after cells were treated with OXPHOS inhibitors such as rotenone (targeted on OXPHOS complex I, cI), antimycin (targeted on OXPHOS complex III, cIII), or oligomycin (targeted on ATP synthase – OXPHOS complex V, cV), or subjected to prolonged anaerobiosis, indicated a temperature drop of this magnitude, based on internal calibration at the end of each experiment. Inferences from the use of protein-based fluorescence probes targeted to mitochondria are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakano et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, similar methods have indicated that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kriszt et al., 2017</xref>), cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okabe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>), plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liang et al., 2022</xref>), and different cellular compartments, such as the cell body and neurites of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tanimoto et al., 2016</xref>), are at temperatures distinct from the extracellular environment and from each other.</p><p>These findings have far-reaching implications for biochemistry and physiology, but need further validation and elaboration before they can be generally accepted. In particular, since the cells of many organisms, notably homeotherms, are unable to tolerate prolonged high or low temperatures when applied externally, the question arises as to how much the temperature of mitochondria is permitted to vary in vivo, and whether and how it is regulated according to physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lane, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this study we undertook to assess mitochondrial temperature in a number of cultured cell lines from different organisms, and subjected to different metabolic stresses involving well-characterised inhibitors and the transgenic expression of the thermogenic alternative oxidase (AOX) from a marine invertebrate. Broadly, the outcome of these studies verifies that mitochondrial temperature is physiologically maintained at ~15°C above ambient temperature, and is subject to homeostatic regulation in response to metabolic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Based on MTY fluorescence mitochondrial temperature is up to ~15°C above ambient</title><p>In previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrétien et al., 2018</xref>), MTY fluorescence was tracked in continuously oxygenated human HEK293-derived cells maintained at a constant external temperature, in which mitochondria had been prelabelled with MTY and then treated with one of several OXPHOS inhibitors under controlled oxygen concentration. Internal calibration in each experiment indicated a mitochondrial temperature decrease of 10–12°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrétien et al., 2018</xref>) following the transition from normoxia to anaerobiosis, or inhibition of the OXPHOS system by classic inhibitors (rotenone, antimycin, cyanide, or oligomycin – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We conducted a systematic follow-up study with different inhibitors and cell lines, and sufficient repeats to generate statistical reliability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), once the MTY fluorescence intensity had reached a stable value following initial oxygenation. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> for details of the instrumentation, its validation and calibration, and various steps that we undertook to validate the method. These trials showed that the fluorescence signal of MTY in cell-free solution decreases almost linearly with temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>), is not responsive to changes in calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>), hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>), or pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>), across the physiological range of these parameters. Note that the response curve generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>), cannot be used directly for calibration in living cells, due to the endogenous contributions of autofluorescence and fluorescence quenching, which are considerable, and will vary according to how much label is actually taken up and retained in mitochondria in each trial. Instead, the internal calibration carried out in each experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) provides a more reliable guide to the temperature changes produced.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and inhibitors.</title><p>Summary of the major components of the OXPHOS system and classic inhibitors.

We therefore set about applying a different method to measure mitochondrial temperature in these cell lines, based on the ratiometric fluorescence of mito-gTEMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakano et al., 2017</xref>). This technique is based on the fluorescence ratio between two previously developed fluorescent proteins, mT-Sapphire and Sirius, co-expressed as a single, self-cleaved polypeptide, with each cleavage product targeted to mitochondria using a reiterated cytochrome oxidase subunit 8 (COX8) presequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The basis of the method is the fact that the fluorescence of Sirius is highly temperature sensitive, declining (like MTY) as temperature rises, whereas that of mT-Sapphire is not.

This enabled us to construct an in vivo calibration curve for the mito-gTEMP fluorescence ratio against externally imposed temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which fitted a linear function over the temperature range at which we were able to conduct the measurement: higher temperatures result in loss of cell integrity and viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roti Roti, 2008</xref>), so were not used.

However, the exact intramitochondrial location of MTY is not known, besides the fact that at least some of it interacts with the matrix protein aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2015</xref>). To address this issue experimentally, we subfractionated mitochondria from cells pre-stained with MTY (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and measured fluorescence at 562 nm, subtracting the autofluorescence manifested by the corresponding fraction from unstained cells prepared in parallel. To prevent dye leakage, we supplied a standard pyruvate-glutamate-malate substrate mix to maintain mitochondria in the energised state throughout the procedure. In the first fractionation step, mitoplasts were separated from the outer membrane space/IMS fraction. In two trials, the mean proportion of MTY fluorescence retained in mitoplasts was 92%. In the second fractionation step, mitoplasts were sonicated to prepare fractions enriched for matrix versus ‘inside-out’ sub-mitochondrial particles (SMPs). In two trials, the mean proportion of MTY fluorescence retained in the SMP fraction was 90%. These findings are consistent with MTY being retained within, or closely associated with, the inner mitochondrial membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Individual cells and organelles show mitochondrial temperature differences and fluctuations</title><p>As studied by either method, mitochondrial temperature represents an average over many cells, each containing many mitochondria.

Using our earlier calibrations, we initially estimated the mitochondrial temperature in cells prior to anisomycin treatment, then followed the effect of anisomycin treatment for up to 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast to our expectation that anisomycin, by attenuating ATP demand, would decrease electron flux in the OXPHOS system and thus lead to a drop in mitochondrial temperature, the latter instead showed a transient slight increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thereafter, high mitochondrial temperature was sustained for many hours, although by 18 hr of exposure to the drug many of the cells were no longer attached and probably dying (the cells analysed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> were those that had remained attached). AOX-expressing iMEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) showed an almost identical behaviour, except that the cells remained healthy-looking even after 18 hr in anisomycin. To evaluate the contribution of cI and cV to the maintenance of mitochondrial temperature in anisomycin-treated cells, we stained anisomycin-pretreated iMEFs with MTY, then tracked fluorescence changes after treatment with rotenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) or oligomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The inferred mitochondrial temperature of anisomycin-treated iMEFs showed a lesser effect of rotenone than iMEFs not treated with anisomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, blue trace, compare 1–18 hr time-points with 0 hr control), and this effect was increasingly pronounced after longer times of anisomycin exposure. Mitochondrial temperature in the surviving cells after 18 hr in anisomycin was almost unaffected by rotenone. In contrast, and despite some experiment-to-experiment variation, anisomycin-exposed iMEFs were as affected by oligomycin as prior to treatment, even up to 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, blue trace). AOX-expressing iMEFs behaved differently. After anisomycin treatment, they showed a consistently greater mitochondrial temperature decrease produced by rotenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, red trace) than did control iMEFs not expressing AOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, blue trace). Although the effect of rotenone declined with increasing times of anisomycin exposure, it did so more gradually than for control iMEFs not expressing AOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The mitochondria of anisomycin-treated iMEF(AOX) cells showed a temperature decrease by oligomycin significantly less than anisomycin-treated control iMEF(P) cells, regardless of the length of time of anisomycin exposure, but also showed a possibly increased effect of oligomycin, with increasing anisomycin exposure time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, red trace), at least for the first hours.

We validated the measurements using the mito-gTEMP system, based on the ratiometric fluorescence of two mitochondrially localised reporter proteins. We visualised mitochondrial temperature fluctuations at the single-cell level, and documented the maintenance of high mitochondrial temperature despite variations in growth conditions, substrate availability, ATP demand, and even OXPHOS poisons where an alternative respiratory pathway was available.</p><p>No chemical reaction is 100% thermally efficient, and those of OXPHOS are no exception, with up to 60% of the energy yield from the biological oxidations of respiration and ATP synthesis released as heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brand, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nath, 2016</xref>). It has long been assumed that this heat was simply radiated to the rest of the cell or the external environment, maintaining intracellular temperature at a uniform 37–42°C in mammals and birds, or at a variable, environmentally determined temperature in poikilotherms such as insects, generally considered as ectothermic. Our findings are inconsistent with this model, indicating instead that much of the heat generated by OXPHOS is retained within the organelle, keeping mitochondrial temperature far above that of other cell components and, whenever possible, within a narrow range. Heat conductance from the mitochondria might also be modulated to maintain mitochondrial temperature.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Validation and calibration of high mitochondrial temperature</title><p>In previous studies using MTY in human HEK293 and HeLa cells, we documented fluorescence changes after treatment with OXPHOS inhibitors that were indicative of high mitochondrial temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrétien et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrétien et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study we extended these findings to other cell lines, including one from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and two isolates of iMEFs, immortalised using a different cocktail of factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andjelković et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giordano et al., 2019</xref>). We systematically conducted multiple repeats with each of five drugs impacting the OXPHOS system. In each case, we implemented an internal calibration step after MTY fluorescence had reached a plateau level in the presence of the inhibitor, by abruptly shifting the external temperature up, then down by 3°C or 5°C, at minimally 4 min intervals. In each case, it is assumed that the observed fluorescence shift is due only to the change in the externally applied temperature (i.e. that any ‘corrective’ response of the cell in the presence of the inhibitor is negligible). This is supported by the fact that the new fluorescence values reached during the calibration steps are essentially constant over the time-scales used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref> for examples). Internal calibration in each experiment provides a control for variation in the exact number of cells or the amount of label taken up. The use of a Peltier jacket surrounding the cuvette in the apparatus ensures that temperature changes in the cuvette rapidly and accurately reflect those applied, as verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, the mito-gTEMP fluorescence ratio, and its calibration against externally applied temperature, provides a second check on the findings obtained using MTY. Although the principle of the mito-gTEMP method is different, being based on fluorescent reporter proteins rather than an externally applied dye, the calibration steps rely on the same, validated assumptions, and produced temperature readouts very similar to those derived using MTY, although typically several °C lower in the case of each of the mammalian cell lines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As stated earlier, the MTY-based measurements may be slightly in error (by ~2°C), due to the minor deviation from linearity of the MTY fluorescence temperature-response curve, in the inferred temperature range of 50–60°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Although the two methods gave essentially concordant results, it is important to recognise that both have limitations. Apart from our failure to obtain a stable fluorescence reading for S2 cells treated with oligomycin, we did not experience problems working with MTY on any of the cell lines tested in the presence of single OXPHOS inhibitors, such as were reported earlier for a human primary fibroblast line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrétien et al., 2020</xref>). However, using combinations of OXPHOS inhibitors, other than rotenone plus antimycin, we were not able to infer mitochondrial temperature by the MTY method, due to unstable fluorescence readings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). These are likely due to dye leakage resulting from membrane-potential anomalies of the type reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chrétien et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, we note that most combinations of OXPHOS inhibitors that failed to give a stable MTY fluorescence reading involved oligomycin plus an inhibitor of respiration. Since we already know that a complete loss of membrane potential leads to leakage of the dye, we surmise that collapse of membrane potential is the most likely reason for the fluorescence instability. In the presence of oligomycin alone, a minimal respiratory electron flow balanced against proton leakage should suffice to maintain a membrane potential. Similarly, even when respiration is inhibited, ATP synthase alone should be able to generate a membrane potential. However, the membrane potential may collapse when both oligomycin and a respiratory chain inhibitor are simultaneously applied.</p><p>Various confounding factors could potentially influence MTY fluorescence. In previous studies it was argued that drugs that have different effects on mitochondrial membrane potential nevertheless all lead to a sustained increase in MTY fluorescence. Since it is not possible to stain cells simultaneously with MTY and membrane-potential sensitive dyes such as TMRM, due to spectral overlap, we need to rely on experiments conducted under parallel conditions, both by ourselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannino et al., 2012</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalbácová et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Treatment of cells with respiratory inhibitors such as rotenone or antimycin lead to substantially decreased membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalbácová et al., 2003</xref>), whereas the effects of oligomycin on mitochondrial membrane potential are generally minor, and vary between cell lines and over time. Commonly, oligomycin results in a small increase in mitochondrial membrane potential, sometimes followed by a decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalbácová et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, we here observed a sustained increased of MTY fluorescence in all of the mammalian cells treated with any of these inhibitors. This implies that any quantitative effect of membrane potential on MTY fluorescence is negligible, unless the potential is completely lost, leading to dye leakage. Any confounding effect upon MTY fluorescence of other physiologically varying parameters, such as calcium concentration, hydrogen peroxide, or pH, was directly excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The excitation wavelength for gTEMP (360 nm) falls within the ultraviolet range, and the resulting cellular damage under continuous illumination for more than 60 min renders calibration unreliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). An alternative probe set, based on the recently developed B-gTEMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2022</xref>), should overcome the problem in future studies. In the current report, we used mito-gTEMP only up to 35 min, which generated a reliable calibration curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, this is not long enough to profile very slow temperature changes such as the rewarming we observed using MTY on AOX-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, we found that some inhibitors, notably antimycin, though not rotenone or oligomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), affected the mito-gTEMP fluorescence ratio, compromising its use. Similarly, the effects of BKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), nPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and MitoBloCK-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>) on MTY fluorescence readings preclude their use with the probe. One important caveat regarding the application of mito-gTEMP is that it was necessary to extrapolate the calibration curve beyond 42°C, assuming the linearity seen earlier for the isolated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakano et al., 2017</xref>). Above this temperature, in vivo calibration is not possible, due to the loss of cellular viability and integrity, accompanied by major changes in protein composition and distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roti Roti, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The finding that mitochondrial temperature is of the order of 50°C or more and distinct from that of the rest of the cell has been challenged on both theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baffou et al., 2014</xref>) and experimental grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moreno-Loshuertos et al., 2023</xref>). However, recent data indicate that the slow thermal diffusivity of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2022</xref>) is sufficient to account for the maintenance of intracellular temperature differences inferred under physiological conditions and further documented here. Furthermore, the maintenance of high mitochondrial temperature as a source of intracellular heat is supported by theoretical considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang, 2018</xref>).</p><p>It should also be noted that previous studies using different probes have implied that the temperature across the cell is not uniform. Some organelles or active regions manifest distinct temperature inhomogeneities: notably, the nucleus is 1–2°C warmer than the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Okabe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hayashi et al., 2015</xref>), the nucleolus even hotter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Piñol et al., 2020</xref>), and perinuclear mitochondria may be hotter than those at the cellular periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Savchuk et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It will therefore be of great interest to use the temperature reporters employed here to track how the various treatments and stresses that we imposed affect not only mitochondria, but all of the other organelles and cellular components with which they interact. A simple way this could be done systematically would be to reclone the gTEMP reporters (or better, the improved B-gTEMP version) for targeting to other compartments, followed by careful validation of targeting, e.g., to nucleus, ER lumen, mitochondria-associated membranes, peroxisomes, endosomes, Golgi, the plasma membrane, and cytosol. Such a study would provide a picture of how alterations in mitochondrial metabolism and heat production affect intracellular temperature and its regulation more globally. An alternative approach would be to employ the recently developed palette of small-molecule intracellular temperature reporters, the Thermo Greens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Earlier studies using temperature-sensitive dyes targeted specifically to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Itoh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kriszt et al., 2017</xref>) have indicated how the temperature of this organelle responds to external stresses and physiological stimuli. Use of the B-gTEMP reporters targeted to different sub-mitochondrial compartments would also shed light on heat transfer within mitochondria, and how this varies with organelle architecture in different cell types. The use of reporters in isolated mitochondria might also provide insight into how much buffering of heat transfer is provided by the cytosol, although this would not address the temperature of the organelle itself in vivo. Note, however, that not all such dyes and reporters may be employed simultaneously, although studies in parallel should help address many of the outstanding questions. Since every method has technical limitations, it is obviously desirable that all conclusions arising from our and similar studies should, as far as is feasible, be independently verified using different approaches.</p><p>We previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrétien et al., 2018</xref>) that isolated OXPHOS complexes I and V are heat labile, though OXPHOS complex II (cII), cIII, and cIV activities have temperature optima in the 50–55°C range when studied in intact mitochondrial membranes. Others have recently reported that the imposition of an external temperature of 43°C or above to cells or to isolated mitochondria damages respiratory function and disturbs OXPHOS complex and supercomplex organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moreno-Loshuertos et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, externally applied heat delivered to mitochondria, which our assays indicate are already at elevated temperatures, may push them beyond their operational limit, implying that mitochondrial heat production in vivo must be finely attuned to cellular needs, to avoid catastrophic overheating. On the other hand, a recent meltome analysis of human proteins found that those constituting the respiratory chain complexes have median Tm values of around 60°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jarzab et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with our inference of high mitochondrial temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Inhibition of each OXPHOS complex produces specific temperature effects on mitochondria</title><p>As the OXPHOS system is traversed from cI through cV, we observed significant increases in the temperature effect of specific inhibitors, with essentially the same pattern observed in two iMEF lines, U2OS, HEK293T, and even in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, as far as methods allowed, i.e., oligomycin&gt;KCN&gt;antimycin<underline>≥</underline>rotenone. Oligomycin inhibits all protonmotive components of the OXPHOS system, including those that feed electrons via ubiquinol to cIII, even though they are not directly protonmotive. The lesser amount of mitochondrial temperature decrease produced by blocks on cI, cIII, or cIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is not the result of incomplete inhibition: the inhibitor doses were pre-checked on all cell lines by respirometry and are similar to those used in many other studies. Instead, we posit that it reflects the proportion of electron flow entering the respiratory chain at each step. Since rotenone and antimycin inhibition had the same mitochondrial temperature effect in iMEFs, both individually and in combination, we infer that electron flow entering the chain independently of cI in this cell background is negligible. In contrast, antimycin produced a significantly greater mitochondrial temperature decrease in U2OS cells than did rotenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), from which we conclude that around 20–30% of electron flow into cIII in this cell line must come from other ubiquinone-linked enzymes. In iMEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) and S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), though not in HEK293T or U2OS cells, KCN had a significantly greater mitochondrial temperature effect than antimycin, which implies that, in these cell lines, a measurable amount of electron flow to oxygen enters the OXPHOS system via cytochrome <italic>c</italic> independently of cIII, i.e., via the Mia40-Evr1/ALR protein import pathway, albeit that we were not able to verify this directly using the Evr1/ALR inhibitor MitoBloCK-6. There may also be other, as yet uncharacterised, electron donors to cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. In all cell lines that we were able to test, oligomycin produced a significantly greater mitochondrial temperature decrease than KCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). Since KCN should block all respiratory proton pumping across the IMM, we infer that cV itself must be able to generate some heat in the complete absence of cellular respiration, presumably by the hydrolysis of mitochondrially imported ATP. Since this residual thermogenesis is inhibited by oligomycin, it must nevertheless involve cV, in a reaction that is itself protonmotive, and hence limited by the rate of dissipation of the IMM proton gradient by other processes, such as protein, metabolite, and ion transport.</p><p>In cells expressing AOX, the initial effects of OXPHOS inhibition at these various steps was different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Rotenone inhibition of electron flow through cI initially produced the same temperature decrease in AOX-expressing iMEF mitochondria as in control iMEF mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that AOX by-passes cIII+cIV but not cI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dassa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McDonald and Gospodaryov, 2019</xref>). In contrast, the mitochondrial temperature decrease produced by antimycin inhibition of cIII was substantially less than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Electron flow through the inherently thermogenic AOX is expected substantially to replaces the normal heating effect of electron flow through cIII+cIV. Note that, when cIII and cIV are able to function normally, electrons flowing through cI should not be diverted via AOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Szibor et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mitochondrial temperature decrease brought about by antimycin in AOX-expressing MEFs was not zero. Part of the explanation is that the capacity of AOX to support electron flow from cI through to oxygen in these cells remains below that of cIII+cIV, as inferred previously by respirometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giordano et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the full engagement of AOX for cI-linked substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Szibor et al., 2020</xref>) requires the accumulation of ubiquinol, the reduced form of coenzyme Q. Nevertheless, the initial temperature decrease produced by antimycin in the mitochondria of AOX-expressing cells is maintained only for a relatively short time, approximately 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), before rewarming commences. The fact that the initial effect of KCN in AOX-expressing cells was greater than that caused by antimycin supports the idea that some of the electron flow through cIV in iMEFs is introduced via cytochrome <italic>c</italic> independently of cIII, for which AOX does not provide a by-pass.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>High mitochondrial temperature is maintained under diverse metabolic stress conditions</title><p>Despite the fact that, under the rather extreme conditions of toxic inhibition of the OXPHOS complexes, high mitochondrial temperature is compromised, we uncovered several contexts wherein it appeared to be homeostatically maintained, hinting at one or more metabolic adaptation processes. First, it appears to decline only slowly and minimally in response to nutrient starvation, and to be restored by renewed substrate availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), consistent with previous estimates by an independent method, using the so-called upconversion nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di et al., 2021</xref>). This implies the existence of a metabolic reserve even in cells such as fibroblasts that are not normally considered repositories for storage molecules such as triglycerides or glycogen. Second, in cells expressing AOX we recorded a gradual restoration of high mitochondrial temperature after the initial decrease provoked by inhibition of the OXPHOS complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). Although AOX is not normally present in vertebrate cells, the metabolic flexibility that it confers may be important in maintaining mitochondrial temperature and organismal viability in the vast array of species that do possess AOX but are subject to wide external temperature fluctuations, namely bacteria, fungi, plants, eukaryotic protists, and many animals as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McDonald and Gospodaryov, 2019</xref>). The exact nature of the metabolic changes that enable AOX-endowed cells to recover normal mitochondrial temperature over periods of 40–70 min remains to be elucidated and may be complex. Logically it should involve a remodelling of metabolism towards the oxidation of flavin-linked substrates that directly reduce ubiquinone. Rewarming was evident in the case of cells in which cI was inhibited by rotenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>), indicting that it does not involve the acquisition of additional capacity for AOX to receive electrons via cI. Rather, it must involve a metabolic switch to other pathways, even though via AOX these do not support ATP production, only heat generation and redox homeostasis.</p><p>The rather minimal effect of BKA, i.e., a possible transient, small increase in mitochondrial temperature, followed by an equally modest decrease, was also surprising. BKA treatment of immortalised fibroblasts has previously been reported to induce a switch to glycolytic ATP production and decreased flux through the respiratory chain, whilst maintaining high mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kano et al., 2019</xref>). The modest mitochondrial temperature decrease that was inferred may simply correspond with that seen in cells deprived of substrate over the time period of observation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and E</xref>, or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and F</xref>). Thus, the efficient exchange of adenine nucleotides between mitochondria and the cytosol is not required for the maintenance of high mitochondrial temperature. Instead, the usually minor contribution of intramitochondrial ATP turnover may be boosted sufficiently to drive mitochondrial heat production to near-normal levels, possibly involving, once again, a contribution from cV-linked ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>The most surprising result that we obtained was the maintenance of high mitochondrial temperature in cells subjected to prolonged treatment with anisomycin at a dose in excess of that which profoundly inhibits cytosolic protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grollman, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sidhu and Omiecinski, 1998</xref>). Protein synthesis uses between 35% and 70% of the ATP produced in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stouthamer, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pontes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Siems et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>). We therefore expected that the predicted decrease in ATP demand would lead to decreased flux through the respiratory chain and to a sustained drop in mitochondrial temperature. Instead, anisomycin treatment led to a modest but transient increase (~4°C) in mitochondrial temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), with gradual reversion to the original mitochondrial temperature after 2–3 hr in the presence of the drug. Even after prolonged (18 hr) anisomycin treatment, leading to widespread cell death, high mitochondrial temperature was maintained in the surviving cells. The same effects, but without cell death, were also seen in AOX-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, overnight growth in media that are predicted to stimulate mitochondrial as opposed to cytosolic ATP production had no effect on mitochondrial temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Once again, the precise metabolic changes that underlie these phenomena remain uncertain and may not be easy to dissect. Nevertheless, our observations imply a homeostatic mechanism adjusting mitochondrial heat production to metabolic supply and demand, keeping mitochondrial temperature within a narrow range.</p><p>Based on the inhibitor studies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, mitochondrial temperature maintenance in anisomycin-exposed iMEF cells is lower and less dependent on cI with time, yet remains fully dependent on cV. This suggests that, as cellular ATP usage dwindles, cV may start to operate thermogenically as an ATPase, although this does not explain how the resulting proton gradient across the IMM is dissipated. A more complex mechanism, such as the futile creatine cycle recently documented in brown fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rahbani et al., 2021</xref>), may need to be invoked. The adenine nucleotide carrier (ATP-Mg/Pi), encoded by a small multigene family, which ensures the net delivery of adenine nucleotides to the mitochondrial matrix under specific physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiermonte et al., 2004</xref>), may also be involved in sustaining a futile cycle of intramitochondrial ATP hydrolysis, as well as possible reverse electron transport through cI. In anisomycin-exposed, AOX-expressing cells, where AOX itself provides an alternative mechanism of thermogenesis, cells remained more dependent on cI for the maintenance of high mitochondrial temperature over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), but less dependent on cV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>An important caveat of our findings is that we cannot formally distinguish whether metabolic adjustments are being made in response to external stresses, with mitochondrial temperature maintenance just a ‘by-product’ of these changes or, conversely, that mitochondrial temperature is directly responsive to external stresses, entraining metabolic adjustments in its wake. A search for an endogenous mitochondrial temperature sensor and an associated signal transduction machinery may help resolve this.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Theoretical considerations</title><p>A mitochondrial temperature in excess of 50°C places severe constraints on the mechanisms of intracellular heat conductance. Here, we postulate that, at least in mammals, mitochondrial heat production sustains the cell broadly at around 37°C, but must be responsive both to external heat stresses and to metabolic changes taking place within the cell, including those within the mitochondrion itself. Thus, the molecular and physical mechanisms that govern heat flow within and out of mitochondria must be both robust and flexible.</p><p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fahimi and Matta, 2022</xref>, have pointed out, the thermal conductivity of the mitochondrial membranes must be very small at the distances encountered in the cell between the hot and cold compartments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fahimi and Matta, 2022</xref> termed this the mitochondrial paradox and offered a physical explanation based on spikes in local temperature associated with proton passage from the IMS to the matrix. They posit that the dehydration and deprotonation of the hydronium ion on the IMS side and the reverse process on the matrix side creates a mode of heat transfer consistent with the time-scale of these processes and with the very low thermal conductivity of ATP synthase. Based on these considerations they were able to predict a 7K difference across the membrane. To our knowledge, their work is the only physically sound hypothesis yet proposed, to account for the surprising temperature differences inferred experimentally, and whose validity has been widely debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lane, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baffou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiyonaka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baffou et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Matta and colleagues have also argued, based on thermodynamic principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matta and Massa, 2015</xref>), that the true efficiency of ATP synthase must be close to 90%, taking account of heat dissipation by informational transactions (Landauer’s principle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Landauer, 1961</xref>) which is compensated by the inherent electrostatic potential of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vigneau et al., 2022</xref>). This may partly explain why the additional temperature decrease produced by inhibiting ATP synthase in addition to inhibiting respiration is both small, but non-negligible.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Biological implications of high mitochondrial temperature</title><p>Although the amount of mitochondrial temperature decrease produced after OXPHOS inhibition by oligomycin, when measured by the MTY and mito-gTEMP methods, was similar, it was not identical, and the rather small difference was judged to be significant for at least two of the cell lines studied, U2OS osteosarcoma cells, and iMEFs. Although both probes are efficiently targeted to mitochondria, they appear to be localised in different sub-mitochondrial compartments. As derivatives of GFP, both of the mito-gTEMP reporter polypeptides linked to the COX8 targeting peptide should reside in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Molina and Shirihai, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Partikian et al., 1998</xref>). Conversely, MTY is a rhodamine-related lipophilic dye whose uptake requires a mitochondrial membrane potential, and which is rapidly lost from mitochondria when the membrane potential is abrogated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrétien et al., 2018</xref>). Its localisation at or very close to the inner face of the IMM is supported by our sub-mitochondrial fractionation experiments, showing that it co-fractionates preferentially with SMPs rather than with the mitochondrial matrix-enriched fraction. This, despite reports that at least some of it interacts with the matrix protein ALDH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2015</xref>). Since the IMM is also the location of mitochondrial heat generation, it should logically be slightly warmer than the matrix that it surrounds, accounting for the small temperature differential implied by the two methods.</p><p>Since high mitochondrial temperature was here documented in five different cell lines from three species of animal, including a poikilotherm, it is clearly not just an exceptional feature of one cell type. Rather it would appear to be a common property of mitochondria and of the chemistry of the OXPHOS system. Moreover, it suggests a novel role for the universal double membrane system of mitochondria, as an insulating layer enabling mitochondria to maintain a high internal temperature, whilst allowing the remainder of the cell to operate at a lower temperature. If this is correct, a corollary is that the ratio of mitochondrial volume to surface area may change in response to metabolic needs and physiological signals that regulate mitochondrial heat output. Put more simply, mitochondria might be expected to fragment into smaller entities when heat output rises, so as to maintain internal mitochondrial temperature, and to fuse into filamentous structures when heat output is low. They may also fragment if mitochondrial heat production is simply abolished and mitochondria need to absorb as much heat as possible from the rest of the cell, in order to maintain a minimal metabolism.</p><p>This proposition could account for some of the apparently paradoxical dynamics of mitochondria which, when subject to various stresses can either undergo widespread fission or hyperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das and Chakrabarti, 2020</xref>). The mitochondrial fusion/fission cycle has hitherto been associated primarily with mitochondrial quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottlieb et al., 2021</xref>), which is disturbed in patholological states and during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seo et al., 2010</xref>). However, mitochondrial temperature homeostasis could also be a determinant. Accordingly, it has recently been reported that inhibition of cV, but not of the other OXPHOS complexes, triggers mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van der Stel et al., 2023</xref>). Treatment with rotenone or antimycin were reported to result in rapid depletion of intramitochondrial ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van der Stel et al., 2023</xref>), consistent with our inference that these inhibitors allow some residual mitochondrial heat output driven by ATP hydrolysis, whilst oligomycin does not. Using mito-gTEMP, it was previously shown that treatment of cells with an uncoupler, which is known to provoke mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Legros et al., 2002</xref>), also resulted in a mitochondrial temperature increase of ~6°C (see Figure 4 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nakano et al., 2017</xref>). Using a different spectrophotometric method, other authors estimated the effect of a chemical uncoupler in the 4–5°C range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Piñol et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with the idea that mitochondrial fusion is associated with low mitochondrial heat output, the cell line with the greatest inferred temperature difference between the two methods used in the present study to assess mitochondrial temperature, and also the one where this difference was the most variable experimentally, was U2OS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), a cell line in which mitochondria are mostly filamentous, e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Westrate et al., 2014</xref>. In other cell lines, such as iMEFs, mitochondria are highly fragmented under standard culture conditions, e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullah et al., 2022</xref>.</p><p>Staining of cells with MTY revealed bright puncta within mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the nature of which is unknown. One possibility is that these may correspond with nucleoids. Their bright staining could indicate that they are cooler than their mitochondrial surroundings, or could be an artefact, due to preferential binding of the dye to one or more components of the nucleoid. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the orthologue of ALDH2 (Ald4) is a nucleoid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kucej and Butow, 2007</xref>), but this has not been reported to be the case in mammals.</p><p>Since the OXPHOS system is of bacterial origin, its heat output in bacteria should be similar to that of mitochondria, and we would expect that the thermal insulation provided in gram-negatives by the double membrane and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cell wall, or by the thicker cell wall in gram-positives, should be at least as effective as that of the double membrane of mitochondria. It will therefore be interesting to implement thermosensitive reporters such as gTEMP or B-gTEMP in bacteria, to assess intracellular temperature, which we would predict to be once again some 15–20°C warmer than ambient temperature. This has important potential implications for understanding the metabolic biochemistry of bacteria, including antibiotic action.</p><p>Similarly, considering that heat generation is an inescapable cellular function of metabolically active mitochondria, a loss of this activity, as in cases of mitochondrial disease, may compromise the maintenance of intracellular temperature or induce futile cycles of cytosolic ATP generation and usage that may have profound metabolic effects.

The required concentrations for full inhibition were determined to be 3 µM rotenone (cI inhibitor), 1 µM antimycin (cIII inhibitor), 0.8 mM potassium cyanide (KCN, cIV inhibitor), 5 µM oligomycin (cV inhibitor), and 100 µM nPG (AOX inhibitor).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Thermo-profiling of mitochondria in cells treated with OXPHOS inhibitors</title><p>Cells were prepared for spectrofluorometry, and inhibitors were added to the above concentrations, once fluorescence or fluorescence ratio had reached a steady state, generally 10 min after initial oxygenation. Fluorescence values were then studied over time, until a new equilibrium value was reached, but only until 35 min for mito-gTEMP. MTY fluorescence was calibrated against temperature in each experiment, by raising and lowering the Peltier by 3°C at the end of the experiment, and recording the fluorescence values reached. The change in temperature was then estimated using this internal calibration. For estimating temperature changes using mito-gTEMP, the calibration function described above was applied to the actual values obtained for the mT-Sapphire/Sirius ratio. The ANT inhibitor BKA (Sigma, B-6179) and ALR/Evr1 inhibitor MitoBloCK-6 (Calbiochem, Sigma-5.05759) were used similarly at 100 µM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cytoplasmic protein synthesis inhibition</title><p>Cells were seeded and, after 24 hr, the medium was replaced with otherwise complete medium without penicillin or streptomycin, but with 150 µM anisomycin (A-9789, Sigma). Cells were incubated for various times up to 18 hr. For measuring the mito-gTEMP fluorescence ratio, cells were then treated as for control (untreated) cells expressing mito-gTEMP, except that for all time-points except that at t=0, the cells were resuspended in PBS containing 150 µM anisomycin. For measuring MTY fluorescence in anisomycin-treated cells, 100 nM MTY was added 15 min prior to each time-point, followed by resuspension in PBS containing 150 µM anisomycin and the addition of OXPHOS inhibitors as for control (untreated cells).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Cells were seeded on glass bottom dishes (35 mm MatTek, USA) and grown for 24 hr in standard growth media at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The culture medium was replaced with prewarmed medium containing fluorescent dyes, namely 100 nM MTY and/or 100 nM MitoTracker Deep Red FM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 15 min incubation, the staining medium was removed, and cells washed once with fresh, prewarmed PBS then kept in PBS at 37°C until analyses were complete. The expression and localisation of mT-Sapphire in transgenic cell lines was imaged by spinning disc (X-light V2, CrestOptics) confocal fluorescence microscopy (Nikon FN1), with excitation at 360 nm (Cool-Led pE-400 light source) and emission filter 525/50 nm, with Nikon 60×/1.0 dip objective (CFI Apochromat NIR 60× W). Laser excitation light intensity was adjusted to minimise photobleaching. Fluorescence images for MitoTracker Deep Red FM (excitation 633 nm, emission 700/75 nm) were generated similarly. Live-cell and time-lapse images of cells stained with MitoTracker Deep Red FM or MTY (excitation 542 nm, emission 562 nm) were captured by laser scanning microscopy (Nikon A1R), using a Nikon 60×/1.27 water-immersion (CFI SR Plan Apo IR 60XC WI) objective. The detector sensitivity was adjusted for each sample to optimise the image brightness and to avoid saturation. The Nikon A1R with N-SIM laser scanning confocal microscopy system includes a live-cell supporting chamber where CO<sub>2</sub>, temperature of the culture dish (surrounded by heated-water supply), and temperature of objective in use can be controlled. Time-lapse imaging was performed on cells maintained at 37°C with 1 image/10 s for 10 min, with a 2 min pause for addition of oligomycin to 5 µM, followed by a further 30 min of image capture. Signal analyses of time-lapse images were performed with ImageJ (Fuji), by surface-plot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>All data are presented as means ± SD.

As a follow-up to a prior paper from some of the same authors, the goal of this study was to conduct additional experiments to assess mitochondrial temperature in cultured cells. Consistent with the prior work, the authors provide consistent evidence that the temperature of mitochondria in four different types of cultured mammalian cells, as well as cells from <italic>Drosophila</italic> (poikilotherms), is 15oC or more above the external temperature at which cells are maintained (e.g., 37oC). Additional evidence shows that mitochondria maintain higher temperatures under several different types of cellular metabolic stresses predicted to decrease the dependence on OxPhos, adding to the notion that natural thermodynamic inefficiency and heat generation may be an important, and potentially regulated, characteristic of mitochondrial metabolism.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>Demonstration that both a fluorescent (Mito Thermo Yellow) and a genetic-based (mito-gTEMP) mitochondrial targeted temperature probe elicit similar quantitative changes in mitochondrial temperature under different experimental conditions is a strength. The addition of the genetic probe to the current study supports prior findings using the fluorescent probe and thus achieves a primary objective of the study.</p><p>The experiments are well designed and executed. Specific attention given to potential artifacts affecting probe signal and/or non-specific effects from the different experimental interventions is a strength.</p><p>The use of different cultured cell lines from different organisms provides additional evidence of elevated temperature as a general property of functioning mitochondria, representing additional validation.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>While the findings and potential interpretations put forward by the authors are intriguing, the severity of the interventions (e.g., mitochondrial complex-specific inhibitors, inhibition of protein synthesis) and the absence of simultaneous or parallel measurements of other key bioenergetic parameters (i.e., membrane potential, oxygen consumption rate, etc.) limits the ability to interpret potential cause and effect - whether the thermogenesis aspect of OxPhos is being sensed and regulated, or whether temperature changes are more of a biproduct of adjustments in OxPhos flux under the experimental circumstances. In other words, the physiological relevance of the findings remains unclear.</p><p>Related, several of the interventions are employed to either increase or decrease dependence on OxPhos flux, but no outcome measures are reported to document whether the intended objective was achieved (e.g., increased OxPhos flux in low glucose plus galactose, decreased ATP demand-OxPhos flux with anisomycin, etc.).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89232.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>An important paper that confirms the validity of the initial findings of Chretien et al regarding the hot temperatures at which the mitochondrion is operating.

The authors provide additional evidence that they claim to support &quot;hot&quot; mitochondria.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. The authors use several methods, including a mitochondrial fluorescent reporter dye, as well as a genetically encoded gTEMP temperature probe, to estimate mitochondrial temperature.</p><p>2. The authors couple these measurements with other perturbation of mitochondria, such as OXPHOS inhibitors, to show consistency</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The methodology for inferring mitochondrial temperature is not well-established to begin with and requires additional controls for interpretation.</p><p>a. Very little benchmarking is done of the &quot;basal&quot; fluorescence ratio, and whether that fluorescence ratio actually reflects true organelle temperature. For instance, the authors should in parallel compare between different organelles to see if only mitochondria appear &quot;hot&quot; or whether this is some calibration error. Another control is to use different incubator temperatures and see how mitochondrial (vs other organelle) temperature varies as a function of external temperature.</p><p>b. The authors do not rigorously control for other factors that may also be changing fluorescence and may be confounders to the delta fluorescence (eg, delta calcium in response to mito inhibitors, membrane potential, redox status, ROS, etc.). There should be additional calibration for all potential confounders.</p><p>c. Can these probes be used in isolated mitochondria and other isolated organelles. Such data would also help to clarify whether the high temperature is specific to mitochondria.</p><p>2. The authors should try to calibrate their fluorescence inference of temperature with an alternative method and benchmark to others in the field. For instance, Okabe et al Nat Comm 2012 used a polymeric thermometer to measure temperature and reported 33degC cytoplasm and 35degC nucleus. Can the authors also show a ~2degC difference in their hands between those two compartments, and under those conditions are mitochondria still 10degC hotter?</p><p>Based on the aforementioned weaknesses, in my opinion, the authors did not achieve their Aims to accurately determine the temperature of mitochondria. The results, while interesting, are preliminary and require additional controls before conclusions can be drawn. Previous studies have indicated intra-organelle temperature variations within cells; typically, previous reports have estimated that the variation is within a few degrees (Okabe et al Nat Comm 2012). Only one report has previously suggested that mitochondria are at 50degC (Cretien, Plos biology 2018). The study does not substantially clarify the true temperature of mitochondria or resolve potential discrepancies in previous estimates of mitochondrial temperature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89232.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Terzioglu</surname><given-names>Mügen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tampere University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tampere</named-content></addr-line><country>Finland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Veeroja</surname><given-names>Kristo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tampere University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tampere</named-content></addr-line><country>Finland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Montonen</surname><given-names>Toni</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tampere University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tampere</named-content></addr-line><country>Finland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ihalainen</surname><given-names>Teemu O</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tampere University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tampere</named-content></addr-line><country>Finland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Salminen</surname><given-names>Tiina S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tampere University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tampere</named-content></addr-line><country>Finland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bénit</surname><given-names>Paule</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>INSERM, Université Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cité</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rustin</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Inserm U1141 and Université Paris-Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cité</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Young-Tae</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>POSTECH</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Pohang</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nagai</surname><given-names>Takeharu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Osaka University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ibaraki</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jacobs</surname><given-names>Howard T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tampere University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tampere</named-content></addr-line><country>Finland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>Response to Editor and Reviewers</p><p>Terzioglu et al, Mitochondrial temperature homeostasis resists external metabolic stresses</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Editor:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the specific direction of the editors in guiding us as to what experiments areneeded to strengthen the manuscript for publication. We here summarize how we have handled thisadvice (please refer to response to specific reviewer points, below, for the details). Changes to the text are indicated by red text and marginal red boxes numbered as per the responses below.</p><p>Benchmarking: we now include a direct calibration of MTY against temperature. Performingexperiments on temperature probes localized to different subcellular and submitochondrialcompartments would be interesting and potentially informative, but is a whole new study that wouldrequire a great deal of validation. Hopefully it will be implemented, but it would not change the basicconclusions from the current study.</p><p>Probe localization: In addition to referring to previously published literature, and the existing Figures3B, 4 and S4 indicating that both MTY and mito-gTEMP are localized in mitochondria (the latter in the matrix), we have conducted some simple experiments to determine the intramitochondrial localization of MTY, applying standard subfractionation protocols. The findings confirm our previous assumption that MTY is inner membrane-associated.</p><p>Expected outcomes: Since, in most cases, it is not possible to do this simultaneously with fluorescence measurements, we rely mostly on previous literature which is fully cited, or on measurements conducted in parallel (e.g. respirometry, Fig. S5) or previously in our own laboratories (e.g. flow cytometry on TMRM-stained cells). We accept that specific inferences on causality, e.g. that the effect of anisomycin is mediated by decreased ATP usage, or that the effects of Gal medium are to enforce dependence on OXPHOS, are arguably an over-reach. We have therefore toned down these statements so as to focus on the mt temperature response to the treatments, rather than to the imputed downstream physiological effects thereof.</p><p>Confounding factors: We tested (and excluded) possible confounding factors affecting MTY and report the findings in an expanded supplementary figure.</p><p>Discussion of the model(s) proposed by Matta: We have now included this, as far as we consideredappropriate for the eLife readership. However, not being theoretical physicists, we would greatlywelcome a careful scrutiny of what we have written, by both the reviewer and handling editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>A1. Causality: We agree with the reviewer in that we cannot formally distinguish, in this study, whether metabolism is adjusted to maintain mitochondrial temperature, or whether mitochondrial temperature maintenance is a secondary consequence of metabolic changes induced by stress. We have added a note to the Discussion to this effect. On balance, we would argue that the many cases that we have documented here tend to favour the former assertion, although this does not constitute proof. Identification of a sensor of mitochondrial temperature changes and an associated signal transduction machinery to orchestrate responses to it would be needed to settle this, but we are obviously very far from this at present. We have added this point to the Discussion, as well.</p><p>A2. Metabolic correlates: We concede that the reviewer has a valid point, although exploring itsramifications in detail is not straightforward. The effects of AOX on respiration and resistance toOXPHOS inhibitors are documented previously and are also included in the paper as a check (Fig. S5). Our starting assumptions were that cells grown in low glucose/galactose would depend more upon mitochondrial as opposed to glycolytic ATP production, whilst net ATP production in anisomycin-treated cells should be attenuated, due to decreased ATP demand. Nevertheless, there are a number of ways this could be achieved, especially if our suggestion that altered ATP production is balanced by decreased or increased futile ATP turnover geared to maintenance of mitochondrial temperature. For example, measuring total oxygen consumption, P to O ratio or steady-state levels of ATP (or any other metabolite) would not be definitive. To accommodate the reviewer’s point, we have made clear that the various treatments we applied are predicted to alter metabolism in the specified ways, based upon theoretical arguments and previous data. To establish the exact details of the metabolic changes that accompany these treatments would require tracer-based metabolomics over time (see Jang 2018, 10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.055), followed up by measurements of specified enzyme activities. Whilst this would be very useful data that may illuminate our observations, it is obviously beyond the scope of the present paper. We hope that future studies will eventually unravel the relationship between metabolic adaptation and mitochondrial temperature.</p><p>A3. Combinations of inhibitors: We were (and remain) reluctant to cram the paper too full ofunsubstantiated speculations. Most, though not all, of the combinations of OXPHOS inhibitors thatfailed to give a stable reading of MTY fluorescence involved oligomycin plus an inhibitor ofrespiration. Since we already know that a complete loss of membrane potential leads to leakage of the dye, we surmise that this is the most likely reason for the fluorescence instability. In the presence of oligomycin alone, the minimal respiratory electron flow sustained should suffice to maintain amembrane potential if balanced against proton leakage. Conversely, even when respiration is inhibited, ATP synthase alone should be able to generate a membrane potential. However, the membrane potential may collapse when both oligomycin and a respiratory chain inhibitor are simultaneously applied. We expanded our comment on this issue in the Discussion and referred to it, briefly, in the legend of Fig. S3A.</p><p>A4. Figure 4A: We added the panel indicators to the figure.</p><p>A5. Fig.7C: We have tried to tighten up the wording, for clarity. Yes, the blue trace was the relevantdata, but we were comparing the effect of rotenone on cells treated with anisomycin for 1, 2….18 hours with cells not treated with anisomycin at all (i.e. blue trace, zero h time-point).</p><p>A6.

Theoretical considerations (‘mitochondrial paradox’): Since we are not theoretical physicists, we have deferred to the reviewer’s expertise in these matters and quoted the suggested literature assuccinctly as possible for the largely biological audience of eLife, sticking closely to the reviewer’sown words. In this light, we would invite the reviewer to scrutinize our added text (in a short additional section of the Discussion, for both this and point B3, below), and suggest any rewording that they consider appropriate.</p><p>B2. Biological implications: We appreciate the point, but since the Discussion section is already long,we have just referred the reader to the treatment of Fahimi et al. We hope to expand on these issues in a separate paper, to be published elsewhere.</p><p>B3. Theoretical considerations (Landauer’s principle and ATP synthase electrostatics): Once again, we have mentioned the issue as suggested, but would ask the reviewer to check the exact language we have used and propose any amendments they consider necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>C1. Benchmark comparisons: We acknowledge that there are limitations to the use of each method of mitochondrial temperature assessment, and we now explain them more thoroughly in a new section of the Discussion. However, the fact that the two methods give approximately the same result constitutes a crucial validation. In addition, we verified the temperature-responsiveness of MTY fluorescence in free solution at physiological pH (see new supplementary figure panel, Fig. S2D), showing that the response is almost linear over the temperature range inferred in the experiments (35-65 ºC). Note, however, that the response curve generated cannot be used directly for calibration, due to the unknown contributions in vivo from cellular autofluorescence and quenching under OXPHOS-inhibited conditions, which may modify the signal, and will vary according to the amount of dye taken up in a given experiment. Because of this, the internal calibration used in each experiment is a far more reliable way of relating observed fluorescence changes to temperature. Note, however, that if the slight deviation from linearity seen at higher temperatures in the MTY fluorescence temperature-response curve (dotted line in Fig. S2D) reflects how the dye responds in vivo, MTY-based estimations of mitochondrial temperature may be over-estimated by ~2 ºC. This is now made clear in the text.</p><p>C2. Basal temperature: The basal mitochondrial temperature (no inhibitors) as inferred from the mitogTEMP calibration curve was already in the paper zero time points for iMEF(P) and iMEF(AOX)cells, Fig. 7A, 7B.</p><p>C3. Other organelles: In principle, gTEMP could be targeted to other organelles, such as the nucleus, peroxisomes, ER, plasma membrane and so on, which would be highly informative in profiling intracellular temperature heterogeneities. However, this would require further rounds of recloning and expression, followed in each case by verification of intracellular targeting; obviously quite a large study beyond the scope of our present work. In any case, it would now best be undertaken using the improved, next-generation ratiometric probes (B-gTEMP), which is under way. We agree that this is an important question for future experimentation and have added a short extra section to the Discussion, accordingly.</p><p>C4. Variation with external temperature: We implemented additional experiments to test this, subjecting cells to a mild heat- or cold-shock, and tracking MTY fluorescence both before and after the subsequent addition of oligomycin, with final internal calibration as before. The results were again qualitatively reproducible, but suggested that the combination of external temperature shock and bioenergetic stress. We show the details of the results of these experiments here, for the reviewer and others to inspect and consider. However, since they are not straightforwardly interpretable, we feel that they should be reserved for a future study which investigates the effects of external temperature changes on intramitochondrial temperature and bioenergetics in much greater detail. For these reasons we show the data here only, and not in the revised paper.</p><p>Both cold shock (38→32 ºC) and heat shock (38→41 ºC) produced immediate shifts of mt temperature, but by lesser amounts than the external stresses applied, i.e. a cooling of 2-4 ºC in the first case and a warming of 0-2 ºC in the second. Over the following 10 min the mt temperature of the temperature-shocked cells held steady or drifted only slightly. These observations are broadly consistent with the general conclusions of the paper that mitochondrial temperature resists external stresses. However, the effect of then adding oligomycin was intriguingly different from that seen in control cells. In cold-shocked cells the mt temperature shift produced by oligomycin was several degrees less than in control cells and mitochondrial temperature then gradually readjusted upwards to near the starting value, suggesting the induction of thermogenic pathways to compensate for the decreased external temperature. In heat-shocked cells, the response to oligomycin was reproducibly triphasic: the initial cooling effect was less pronounced than in control cells, but was followed by rewarming and then by a prolonged and progressive cooling. This is obviously much harder to interpret, and will require substantial further studies to parse.</p><p>C5. Other factors: Although this point is addressed in previous literature, we measured effects directly in solution (for MTY). Note, however, that it is not feasible to measure membrane potentialsimultaneously, due to the spectral overlap between e.g. TMRM and MTY. Nevertheless we were able to test the effects on MTY fluorescence of incremental changes in Ca2+, pH and ROS within the physiological range (see doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.12.6803, doi: 10.1074/jbc.M610491200 and doi:10.3390/antiox10050731). The results clearly indicate that changes in any of these parameters has no effect on MTY fluorescence (new supplementary figure panels S3E, S3F and S3G).</p><p>C6. Localization of probes: The existing Figures 3B, 4 and S4, as well as previous literature, indicate a mitochondrial localization both for MTY and mito-gTEMP. The matrix localization of proteins of theGFP reporter family tagged with the COX8 matrix-directed targeting signal used here is wellestablished (e.g. see doi: 10.1016/S0076-6879(09)05016-2). To investigate the sub-mitochondriallocalization of MTY we conducted a standard series of fractionation steps, using detergents,centrifugation and sonication. Whilst these do not provide absolute purity, they clearly indicate thatMTY in energized mitochondria resides in or closely associated with the inner mitochondrialmembrane. In two trials, in which mitochondria were fractionated into mitoplasts versus outermembrane/inter-membrane space fractions, an average 92% of the MTY fluorescence was retained in the mitoplast fraction (after subtracting autofluorescence from control samples not treated with MTY). After sonication, which should render most of the inner membrane pelletable as ‘inside out’ submitochondrial particles (SMPs), leaving most of the matrix contents in solution, 90% of the MTYfluorescence signal (again based on two trials, with background subtracted) was recovered in the SMP fraction, supporting the proposition that the dye is inner-membrane associated. These findings are now reported in the Results section and commented on in the appropriate section of the Discussion. We agree with the reviewer that it would be useful to target temperature probes, e.g. B-gTEMP, to specific sub- and extra-mitochondrial compartments (cytosol, MAMs, outer membrane, IMS, inner membrane or even specific protein complexes therein), so as to gauge the nature of intramitochondrial heat conduction between compartments and its radiation to the extramitochondrial environment. However, because it would be an extensive study in its own right, requiring careful validation of targeting, we feel this should be attempted as a follow-up study.</p><p>C7. Use of probes in isolated mitochondria: In principle we see no reason why this should not work, but any result would be non-physiological, since the external environment of isolated mitochondria is not the complex protein- and organelle-rich environment of the cytoplasm, which must play a crucial role in modulating heat diffusion from the organelle. Such an experiment may be useful to assess how much temperature buffering is provided by the rest of the cytoplasm, even though it does not directly address the internal temperature of mitochondria in vivo. Accordingly, we added a sentence to the Discussion foreshadowing such an experiment.</p><p>C8. Other probes and methods: See points C1 and C3 above. The reviewer’s suggestion could best be addressed using the superior B-gTEMP reporters engineered for specific expression in the nucleus and cytosol. This would be part of an extensive new study beyond the scope of the present work, but would of course be a further validation of its conclusions. We agree that multiple approaches are needed to address the issue of temperature differences within cells, in light of the surprising findings both of ourselves and of others, such as the study of Okabe et al (2012) to which the reviewer refers. This point too is now added to the Discussion.</p><p>C9. Theoretical considerations: The critiques referred to are now briefly addressed in the revisedDiscussion, along with those raised by Reviewer 2. However, since we are not theoretical physicists we do not feel qualified to enter the debate further. As Baffou and colleagues point out, in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3552">https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3552</ext-link>, “In order for the community to come to a consensus, we believesome effort will be required to identify the actual origin of the signal measured in these studies, boththeoretically and experimentally“. Our experimental findings provide source data for this debate but do not resolve it.</p></body></sub-article></article>
