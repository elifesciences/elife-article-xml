We discovered that layilin, a C-type lectin receptor, is predominantly expressed on Tregs in skin. Layilin was highly expressed on a subset of clonally expanded âeffectorâ Tregs in both healthy and psoriatic human skin. Layilin-expressing Tregs exhibited a transcriptional profile indicative of enhanced adhesion. Deletion of layilin in Tregs in mice in vivo resulted in significantly attenuated skin inflammation. Mechanistically, layilin enhanced in vitro human Treg adhesion via modulation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, resulting in distinct cytoskeletal alterations consistent with enhanced focal adhesion and lamellipodia formation. Taken together, we define layilin as a critical regulator of Treg-suppressive capacity by modulating motility and adhesion in a non-lymphoid tissue.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regulatory T cell</kwd><kwd>Skin</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R21AR072195-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouirand</surname><given-names>Victoire</given-names></name><name><surname>Clancy</surname><given-names>Sean</given-names></name><name><surname>Macon</surname><given-names>Courtney</given-names></name><name><surname>Valle</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name><name><surname>Pauli</surname><given-names>Mariela</given-names></name><name><surname>Truong</surname><given-names>Hong-An</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Jarish</given-names></name><name><surname>Kinet</surname><given-names>Maxime</given-names></name><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>Margaret M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lord</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Skruber</surname><given-names>Kristen</given-names></name><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Hobart</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name><name><surname>Neuhaus</surname><given-names>Isaac</given-names></name><name><surname>Reif</surname><given-names>Karin</given-names></name><name><surname>Zarrin</surname><given-names>Ali A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mullins</surname><given-names>R Dyche</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenblum</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>TRex Bio Inc</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valle</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name><name><surname>Pauli</surname><given-names>Mariela</given-names></name><name><surname>Truong</surname><given-names>Hong-An</given-names></name><name><surname>Reif</surname><given-names>Karin</given-names></name><name><surname>Zarrin</surname><given-names>Ali A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulatory T cell expression of layilin mediates adhesion in skin, which acts to attenuate their suppressive capacity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in mediating peripheral immune tolerance. Although present in lymphoid organs, specialized subsets of these cells stably reside in non-lymphoid tissues, including skin, gut, and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">MuÃ±oz-Rojas and Mathis, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali and Rosenblum, 2017</xref>). Subsets of Tregs in skin play a crucial role in suppressing hair follicle autoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, these cells facilitate hair follicle cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ali et al., 2017</xref>), augment wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nosbaum et al., 2016</xref>), and establish and maintain tolerance to skin commensals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scharschmidt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scharschmidt et al., 2017</xref>). Many autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases are thought to result from an imbalance in the relative abundance and functional state of proinflammatory and regulatory cells. Thus, elucidating the fundamental mechanisms these cells utilize in both healthy and inflamed tissues is crucial in attempts to develop novel therapies aimed at restoring tissue immune homeostasis.</p><p>Layilin is a cell surface C-type lectin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borowsky and Hynes, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bono et al., 2001</xref>). This family of receptors plays a role in many cellular functions, including adhesion and cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). Previously, we and others have shown that layilin is preferentially expressed on exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrating human and murine tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahuron et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, intratumoral Tregs express high levels of layilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhairavabhotla et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Simone et al., 2016</xref>). Mechanistically, we have shown that layilin functions to anchor Tregs in non-lymphoid tissues, and in doing so, limits their suppressive capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehta et al., 2021</xref>). On CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, layilin co-localizes with integrin Î±LÎ²2 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 [LFA-1]), enhancing its adhesive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahuron et al., 2020</xref>). Despite emerging evidence that layilin plays an important role in the biology of Tregs in non-lymphoid tissues, little is known about the potential role it plays in autoimmune disease. In addition, whether layilin functions to modulate LFA-1 activation on Tregs remains to be determined. Here, we interrogate the functional biology of Treg expression of layilin in inflammatory skin disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Layilin is expressed on activated âeffectorâ Tregs in human inflammatory skin disease</title><p>To begin to understand the expression pattern of layilin on immune cells in chronic inflammatory skin diseases, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells sorted from healthy or psoriatic skin. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhairavabhotla et al., 2016</xref>), the main population expressing <italic>LAYILIN</italic> are Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>). There were no changes in the relative expression of <italic>LAYN</italic> per cell when comparing Treg clusters from psoriasis skin with healthy control skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that <italic>LAYN</italic> expression is not increased on Tregs in inflamed skin. Because layilin is expressed on ~40â50% of Tregs in both healthy and inflamed skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehta et al., 2021</xref>), we sought to understand how layilin-expressing Tregs differed from layilin-non-expressing Tregs at the transcriptional level. To this end, we subclustered Tregs from psoriatic skin and performed pseudo-bulk analysis based on <italic>LAYN</italic> gene counts (threshold greater than 0 considered positive for <italic>LAYN</italic> expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). We found that <italic>LAYN</italic>-expressing (<italic>LAYN</italic>&gt;0) and non-expressing (<italic>LAYN</italic>&lt;0) cells are relatively similar to equivalent levels of <italic>FOXP3</italic> and <italic>CTLA-4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Similarly to the observation made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, we noticed most differences are driven by <italic>LAYN</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Focusing on psoriatic skin, we found that 636 genes were significantly differentially expressed (DEGs) between <italic>LAYN</italic>-positive and <italic>LAYN</italic>-negative Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Interestingly, several <italic>TNFRSF</italic> family genes and several adhesion molecules, including integrin coding genes (<italic>ITGB7</italic> and <italic>ITGB6</italic>) or cellâcell adhesion (<italic>CADM1</italic>), were expressed at significantly higher levels in <italic>LAYN</italic>-expressing Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Thus, we hypothesized that layilin-expressing Tregs may be specific for tissue antigens and consequently more clonal than Tregs in skin with undetectable layilin expression. To test this hypothesis, we performed TCR repertoire analysis using the same subclustering of Tregs as in the pseudo-bulk analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>LAYN</italic>-expressing Tregs had more expanded clones, with the top 15 expressed clonotypes being more abundant in <italic>LAYN</italic>-expressing cells. These findings are similar to previous observations made in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahuron et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, transcriptional immunophenotyping of Tregs isolated from psoriatic skin suggests that <italic>LAYN</italic> expression correlates with more activated, more motile, and clonally expanded cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Layilin has a minimal effect on Treg activation and suppressive capacity in vitro</title><p>Activated lymphocytes express receptors and pathways that can either promote or attenuate their effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlino et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, ex vivo activation of lymphocytes can induce molecular pathways that only play a meaningful biologic role when the cells are in their natural in vivo setting. Thus, we sought to determine whether layilin expression on Tregs plays a role in promoting their activation state or suppressive capacity in vitro. To do so, we isolated Tregs from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and expanded them ex vivo with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28-coated beads and high-dose IL-2. Expanded cells were specifically edited for <italic>LAYN</italic> using a well-established CRISPR-Cas9 electroporation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albanese et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Four days post-electroporation, we consistently observed a maximal reduction in <italic>LAYN</italic> expression by ~30â50% compared to single guide-treated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). After 4 days of suboptimal activation post-electroporation, cells were rested and cultured with or without TCR restimulation. Subsequently, the cells underwent spectral flow cytometry analysis using a detailed panel of Treg activation markers.

The summation of our data from results presented herein and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehta et al., 2021</xref>) suggests that layilin modulates Treg motility in tissues. This effect on motility is mediated, at least in part, through the modulation of LFA-1 activation and contributes to cytoskeletal remodeling necessary for cellular adhesion and movement.</p><p>Our data supports a model whereby layilin expression is induced on Tregs upon entering non-lymphoid tissues such as skin. This acts to anchor Tregs in the tissue, possibly adjacent to (or within) collagen IV-rich blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uitto et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfisterer et al., 2021</xref>). In this capacity, layilin may help sequester Tregs to a defined niche, facilitating their ability to maintain tissue immune homeostasis in the steady state. Conversely, in pathological situations such as tumors and chronic inflammation, the motility of Tregs may play a larger role in their functionality, allowing them to navigate to various tissue microanatomic niches to attenuate specific cell types and inflammatory mediators. Notably, several studies have underscored the crucial role of adhesion properties, particularly those mediated by ICAM-1, the main adhesion molecule expressed by T cells, in enabling effective Treg suppression capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gottrand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). In this context, layilin expression on Tregs most likely acts to curtail their suppressive capacity by limiting their motility. Indeed, two-photon microscopy studies revealed that layilin-deficient Tregs are relatively more motile in inflamed skin compared to layilin-expressing control Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehta et al., 2021</xref>). In support of this theory, herein, we show that reducing layilin expression on Tregs results in enhanced immune regulation in a skin inflammation model, as demonstrated by a significant reduction in pro-inflammatory cells, observed in <italic>Foxp3<sup>Cre</sup>/Layn<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice compared to controls. In contrast, it is interesting to highlight that, in vitro, layilin plays a minimal role in Treg activation and suppressive capacity in vitro.

All mouse experiments were performed on 7â12-week-old animals. All mice were housed under a 12-hour light/dark cycle. All animal experiments were performed following the guidelines established by the Laboratory Animal Resource Center at UCSF, and all experimental plans and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) beforehand.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mouse tissue processing</title><p>Briefly, mouse skin was minced and digested in a buffer containing collagenase XI, DNase, and hyaluronidase in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium in an incubator shaker at 225 rpm for 45 minutes at 37Â°C. Once the single-cell suspensions were obtained, cells were counted using an automated cell counter (NucleoCounter NC-200, Chemometec). 2â4 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells were stained, and flow cytometric analysis was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Human specimens</title><p>Normal healthy human skin was obtained from patients at the UCSF undergoing elective surgery, and the specimens received were de-identified (study number 19-29608) and certified as Not Human Subjects Research. Blood samples were obtained from healthy adult volunteers (study number 12-09489) or ordered from the Standford Blood Center. Biopsies of psoriasis were obtained with a 6 mm punch biopsy tool (study number 19-29608). For all fresh human tissue samples, active/flaring disease was confirmed both clinically and histologically. Studies using human samples were approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research and the institutional review board of UCSF. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Human skin digestion</title><p>Skin samples were stored in a sterile container on gauze and PBS at 4Â°C until digestion. Skin was processed and digested as previously described. Briefly, hair and subcutaneous fat were removed, and skin was cut into small pieces and mixed with digestion buffer containing 0.8 mg/ml collagenase type 4 (4188; Worthington), 0.02 mg/ml DNAse (DN25-1G; Sigma-Aldrich), 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), and 1% penicillin/streptavidin in RPMI medium and digested overnight in an incubator.

Once isolated, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were stained and sorted by gating on live CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup>CD127<sup>lo</sup> cells. Purified Tregs were ex vivo expanded for 12 days in complete X-Vivo media (Lonza) with 500 U/ml IL-2 (2000 U/ml, Tonbo Biosciences) and stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads at a cells:beads ratio of 1:1 (Gibco). At D12, cells were frozen for later experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Human Tregs engineering/CRISPR</title><p>To engineer human Treg, we used a CRISPR-cas9 SNP protocol. We thawed D12 Tregs and rested them for 4 hours. Afterward, we mixed 22.2 pmol of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 with 88.8 pmol of scramble single guide (sg-CTRL) or <italic>LAYN</italic> single guide (sg-<italic>LAYN</italic>, UUCUCGAAGACUGAACUUUG) and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature to form the RNP complex. During the incubation, we harvested the cells, counted them using the NucleoCounter, and resuspended them in P3 buffer cells at a 2 million/20 ul concentration. Once the RNP complex was formed, an electroporation enhancer (IDT) was added at a ratio of 1:2 (EE:RNP) to the cells in an electroporation plate. Cells were electroporated using the DG-113 program on a 4D-Nucleofector 96-well unit (Lonza). After 4 days, efficiency was measured, and cells were used for the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p>Sequencing data are available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): GSE249622, GSE249793, and GSE283500. scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq libraries were prepared at the UCSF Core Immunology laboratory using the 10X Chromium Single Cell 5â² Gene Expression and V(D)J Profiling Solution kit, according to the manufacturerâs instructions (10X Genomics). 150 paired-end sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 instrument. The Cell Ranger analysis pipelines were then used to process the generated sequencing data. Data were demultiplexed into FASTQ files, aligned to the GRCh38 human reference genome, and counted, and TCR library reads were assembled into single-cell V(D)J sequences and annotations. For gene expression analysis, the R package Seurat was used. Filtered gene-barcode matrices were loaded, and quality control steps were performed (low-quality or dying cells and cell doublets/multiplets were excluded from subsequent analysis). Data were normalized and scaled, then linear dimensional reduction using principal component analysis was performed. Highly variable genes were used to perform unsupervised clustering, and non-linear dimensional reduction with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was used to visualize the data.</p><p>For differential gene expression analysis comparing <italic>LAYN</italic>-expressing cells to <italic>LAYN</italic>-non-expressing cells, data were subsetted into <italic>LAYN</italic>-negative (<italic>LAYN</italic>&lt;0) and <italic>LAYN</italic>-positive (<italic>LAYN</italic>&gt;0) using <italic>LAYN</italic> expression &gt;0 as a threshold.

Expression of Layilin on Tregs would have no impact on activation markers or in vitro suppressive function. However, activation of Layilin either with a cross-linking antibody or collagen IV, its natural ligand, would promote cell adhesion via LFA1 activation. The in vivo functional role of Layilin in Tregs is studied in a conditional KO mouse model in a model of skin inflammation. Deletion of Layilin in Tregs led to an attenuation of the disease score and a reduction in the cutaneous lymphocyte infiltrate. This work is clearly innovative, but a number of major points limit its interest.</p><p>Weakness and major points:</p><p>(1) The number of panels and figures suggests that this story is quite complete but several data presented in the main figures do not provide essential information for a proper understanding of Layilin's role in Tregs.</p><p>Figures 1I, 1J, and the whole of Figure 2 could be placed as supplementary figures. Also, for Figure 3E, it would be preferable to show the percentage of cells expressing cytokines rather than their absolute numbers. In fact, the drop in the numbers of cytokine-producing cells is probably due solely to the drop in total cell numbers and not to a decrease in the proportion of cells expressing cytokines. If this is the case, these data should be shown in supplementary figures. Finally, Figures 4 and 5 could be merged.</p><p>(2) Some important data are not shown or not mentioned.</p><p>(a) It would be important to show the proportion of Treg, Tconv, and CD8 expressing Layilin in healthy skin and in patients developing psoriasis, as well as in the blood of healthy subjects.</p><p>(b) We lack information to be convinced that there is enrichment for migration and adhesion genes in Layilin+ Tregs in the GSEA data. The authors should indicate what geneset libraries they used. Indeed, it is tempting to show only the genesets that give results in line with the message you want to get across. If these genesets come from public banks, the bank used should be indicated, and the results of all gene sets shown in an unbiased way. In addition, it should be indicated whether the analyses were performed on untransformed or pseudobulk scRNAseq data analyses. Finally, it would be preferable to confirm the GSEA data with z-score analyses, as Ingenuity does, for example. Indeed, in GSEA-type analyses, there are genes that have activating but also inhibiting effects on a pathway in a given gene set.</p><p>(c) For all FACS data, the raw data should be shown as histograms or dot plots for representative samples.</p><p>(d) For Figure 5B, the number of samples analyzed is insufficient to draw clear conclusions.</p><p>(3) For Figs. 4 and 5, the design of the experiment poses a problem. Indeed, the comparison between Layn+ and Layn- cells may, in part, not be directly linked to the expression or absence of expression of this protein. Indeed, Layn+ and Layn- Tregs may constitute populations with different biological properties, beyond the expression of Layn. However, in the experiment design used here, a significant fraction of the sorted Layn- Tregs will be cells belonging to the population that has never expressed this protein. It would have been preferable to sort first the Layn+ Tregs, then knock down this protein and re-sort the Layn- Tregs and Layn+ Tregs. If this experiment is too cumbersome to perform, I agree that the authors should not do it. However, it would be important to mention the point I have just made in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105277.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, Gouirand et al. report on the role of Layilin expression for the motility and suppressive capacity of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In previous studies, the authors had already demonstrated that Layilin is expressed on Tregs, that it acts as a negative regulator of their suppressive capacity, that it functions to anchor Tregs in non-lymphoid tissues, and that it enhances the adhesive properties of Layilin-expressing cells by co-localization with the integrin Î±LÎ²2 (LFA-1). Building on these published data, the authors now show that Layilin is highly expressed on a subset of clonally expanded effector Tregs in both healthy and psoriatic skin and that deletion of Layilin in Tregs in vivo resulted in significantly attenuated skin inflammation. Furthermore, the authors addressed the molecular mechanism by which Layilin affects the suppressive capacity of Tregs and showed that Layilin increased Treg adhesion via modulation of LFA-1, resulting in distinct cytoskeletal changes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Certainly, the strength of this study lies in the combination of data from mouse and human models.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Some of the conclusions drawn by the authors must be treated with caution, as the experimental conditions were not always appropriate, leading to a risk of misinterpretation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105277.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Gouirand et al explore the function of Layilin on Treg in the context of psoriasis using both patient samples and a conditional mutant mouse model.
