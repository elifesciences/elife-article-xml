blocks of metazoan biodiversity and offer a powerful perspective for inferring evolutionary phenomena. With the development of single-cell transcriptomic techniques, new definitions of cell types are emerging. This allows a conceptual reassessment of traditional definitions of novel cell types and their evolution. Research in echinoderms, particularly sea star and sea urchin embryos has contributed significantly to understanding the evolution of novel cell types, through the examination of skeletogenic mesenchyme and pigment cells, which are found in sea urchin larvae, but not sea star larvae. This paper outlines the development of a gene expression atlas for the bat sea star, <italic>Patiria miniata</italic>, using single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of embryonic stages. The atlas revealed 23 cell clusters covering all expected cell types from the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm germ layers. In particular, four distinct neural clusters, an immune-like cluster, and distinct right and left coelom clusters were revealed as distinct cell states. A comparison with <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> embryo single-cell transcriptomes was performed using 1:1 orthologs to anchor and then compare gene expression patterns. The equivalent of <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> piwil3+ Cells were not detected in <italic>P. miniata</italic>, while the Left Coelom of <italic>P. miniata</italic> has no equivalent cell cluster in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>. These differences may reflect changes in developmental timing between these species. While considered novel morphologically, the Pigment Cells of <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> map to clusters containing Immune-like Mesenchyme and Neural cells of <italic>P. miniata</italic>, while the Skeletogenic Mesenchyme of <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> are revealed as orthologous to the Right Coelom cluster of <italic>P. miniata</italic>. These results suggest a new interpretation of the evolution of these well-studied cell types and a reflection on the definition of novel cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Patiria miniata</kwd><kwd>novelty</kwd><kwd>single nuclei</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>cell type</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1557431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hinman</surname><given-names>Veronica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Understanding novel cell types and their evolutionary history is re-evaluated using single nuclei transcriptomic approaches and their inferred underlying gene regulatory networks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell types are the fundamental units of multicellular life. Understanding how novel cell types emerge is critical to understanding the relationships between cells, and hence the processes by which organisms acquire new evolutionary traits. Although fundamental to theories of morphological evolution, understanding how novel cell types evolve, or even how to define a novel cell type, is still unclear and a source of active debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Marquez zacarias et al., 2021</xref>). Traditionally, a combination of morphology, function, cell lineage, and subsets of gene expression has been used to describe and classify cell types. However, there are many ways in which this method of classification may not accurately reflect evolutionary relationships. For example, cell types with similar morphologies, such as the striated myocytes in bilaterians and cnidarians, appear to be homologous morphologically, when in fact this phenotype arose independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brunet et al., 2016</xref>). Developmental lineage too has drawbacks, as cell types that are very similar in regulatory profiles and morphology may arise from different cell lineages in an embryo. For example, neurons can be derived from both the ectoderm and foregut endoderm in sea urchins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Angerer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are a valuable tool for understanding the evolution of cell types within and between species, as evolutionarily related cell types are assumed to have similar regulatory relationships. Homologous cell types can therefore be identified between species by examining the expression of orthologous genes as a proxy for GRNs operating in the cells. However, the cooption of modular GRN subcircuits may frequently occur during evolution, obscuring the relationship between cells in an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Monteiro and Podlaha, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Davidson and Erwin, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The phylum Echinodermata, which includes species of sea stars, sea urchins, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, and feather stars, is a powerful system for studying the evolution of cell types. Their larval forms in particular have several cell types that, based on developmental, morphological, and functional criteria, are considered to be novel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). One of the best-studied examples of novel cell types in these species is the biomineral forming skeletal cells of sea urchin and brittle star (Ophiuroidea) pluteus larvae. These cells derive from early embryonic skeletogenic mesenchyme that ingress and secrete a calcium-based biomineral skeleton within the blastocoel. The long skeletal rods formed by this process give the larvae the distinctive pyramidal, plutei shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Decker and Lennarz, 1988</xref>). The larval forms of the other, non pluteus forming, groups of echinodermsâthe bipinnaria in sea stars, auricularia in sea cucumbers, auricularia-like in crinoids, and the tornaria larva of the outgroup Hemichordate phylumâdo not produce larval skeletal rods. The sea cucumber auricularia does however produce a small biomineralized cluster that appears to be secreted from mesenchyme cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Decker and Lennarz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hyman, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">McCauley et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A phylogeny of the major classes of Echinodermata, and Hemichordata outgroup and diagrams of adult and larval phenotypes.</title><p>Larval schematics show biomineralized larval skeletons colored in red, coelomic pouches colored green, and pigment cells colored in blue. Presence/absence is also indicated using colored circles to the left of the embryos. The pink shading indicates the secretion of biomineralized spicules, but not the formation of an extensive skeleton.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80090-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Another novel cell type, the larval pigment cells, are unique to the sea urchins (i.e. the echinoid family). The pigment cells emerge in the second wave of mesenchymal ingression during gastrulation and embed themselves in the ectoderm of the larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gustafson and Wolpert, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Massri et al., 2021</xref>). Upon infection, the immune response is activated and these cells ingress into the blastocoel and aggregate with other immune cells at sites of high pathogen concentration (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buckley and Rast, 2017</xref>). The molecule that gives these cells their distinctive color is echinochrome A, a naphthoquinone with known antimicrobial properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Service and Wardlaw, 1984</xref>).</p><p>Much is known about the mechanisms of specification of these novel cell types in sea urchins, especially the purple sea urchin, <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus,</italic> and the green sea urchin, <italic>Lytechinus variegatus</italic>, which have an especially well-resolved early developmental GRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davidson et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davidson et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hinman et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Oliveri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Saunders and McClay, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). These GRNs have provided the basis for comparison with several other echinoderm taxa, most extensively the bat sea star, <italic>Patiria miniata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cary et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hinman and Cheatle Jarvela, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hinman et al., 2009</xref>). Sea stars such as <italic>P. miniata</italic> morphologically lack both larval-skeleton-forming cells and pigment cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Comparisons of GRNs within different cell types have been used to infer the evolution of the sea urchin skeleton and pigment cell types from an ancestor shared with sea stars. A leading hypothesis from these studies is that the sea urchin and brittle star larval skeleton arose through the co-option of the adult skeletogenesis program by a subpopulation of embryonic mesodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gao and Davidson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Morino et al., 2012</xref>), under the regulatory control of the transcription factor <italic>aristaless-like homeobox</italic> (<italic>alx1</italic>) and cooption of the <italic>vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (vegfr</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ben-Tabou de-Leon, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ettensohn and Adomako-Ankomah, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Morino et al., 2012</xref>). These regulatory genes are required for the expression of genes needed for biomineralization in these sea urchin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Duloquin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rafiq et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>vegfr</italic> in particular had not been detected in echinoderm embryos that do not form skeletons. Likewise, the pigment cells are proposed to have arisen through a heterochronic co-option of an adult program for the formation of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Perillo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cell-type diversity within an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Konstantinides et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Marioni and Arendt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Morris, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shapiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tanay and SebÃ©-PedrÃ³s, 2021</xref>). This technology profiles the transcriptome of individual cells within an organism, preserving the heterogeneity of cell states that are lost in traditional bulk sequencing. This new technology provides prominence to gene expression and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) as the basis of cell-type identity and the evolutionary relationships between cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achim and Arendt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arendt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>). Knowledge of echinoderm cell diversity and molecular profiles has recently benefited greatly from scRNA-seq studies in echinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foster et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Massri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Paganos et al., 2021</xref>). These datasets provide an unbiased view of the gene expression state of cell types in sea urchin embryos. This presents an opportunity to establish equivalent profiling in sea stars to establish the similarities and differences of gene expression states on a large scale rather than the candidate gene approaches that have been performed to date. We, therefore, developed a single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) developmental cell atlas for <italic>P. miniata</italic>. snRNA-seq is performed on isolated nuclei rather than whole cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lake et al., 2016</xref>) and is suggested by recent literature to provide a more representative view of cell types than single-cell sequencing because the uniform nuclear morphology permits less biased isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To compare expression states across species, we made a multi-species developmental atlas from previously published <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foster et al., 2020</xref>) using an integrated approach based on the expression patterns of a comprehensive mapping of 1:1 gene orthologs between <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>P. miniata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arshinoff et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beatman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Foley et al., 2021</xref>). For each gene discussed in this paper, the speciesâ NCBI-curated locus IDs (LOCID) and associated nomenclature established in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beatman et al., 2021</xref> are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. We use these atlases to compare the GRN definition of cell type novelty to the morphological definition, to establish alternative hypotheses of the origin of pigment cells and skeletogenic mesenchyme and to broadly reflect on the definitions of cell type and novelty.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-nucleus transcriptome is representative of cell diversity in sea star embryos</title><p>Before creating our <italic>P. miniata</italic> atlas, we wanted to explore the use of snRNA-seq in echinoderms to see if it offers any benefit over scRNA-seq, in particular a more robust isolation. We, therefore, adapted protocols for single nuclear isolation used in Omni-ATACseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corces et al., 2017</xref>). This is the first time that a single nuclei sequencing protocol has been conducted in an echinoderm.</p><p>We sought to establish whether our nuclear isolation method was less biased in cell-type retention by comparing bulk-RNA seq data collected from samples isolated using whole-cell isolation, nuclear isolation, or from whole embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We compared the overall similarity of transcriptome profiles using the Spearman correlation coefficient for each dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The nuclei-to-whole embryo comparison had the highest Spearman coefficient (â´=0.987), indicating higher overall transcriptome similarity to the undissociated embryos. Whole-cell isolation also showed a strong correlation with the whole embryo, with a Spearman coefficient of â´=0.985, demonstrating that, like nuclear isolation, single-cell isolation still reflects the overall transcriptomic profile of the whole organism.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Validation of single nuclear RNA-seq protocol.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic representation of the experimental design.

The whole-cell to whole-embryo comparison resulted in a mean of â0.003 and a standard deviation of 0.683. Although the mean is closer to zero in the whole-cell isolates, we conclude that a nuclear isolation method more consistently reflects whole embryo expression diversity because of the lower standard deviation, indicating the overall distribution is more narrow and therefore more genes accurately reflect the expression levels of a whole organism.</p><p>Finally, as proof of principle, we performed snRNA-seq in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> to determine if we could identify distinct clusters of known cell types. Using samples from four time points [6 hours post-fertilization (hpf), 15 hpf, 23 hpf, and 33 hpf], we were able to identify 15 clusters, encompassing all three germ layers and including several clusters corresponding to skeletogenic mesenchyme and pigment cells. These skeletogenic mesenchyme clusters were characterized by gene expression associated with different degrees of differentiation. Further analysis of this pilot dataset is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>. These results thus strongly support that single nuclei and single-cell RNA isolation and sequencing each resulted in appropriate representative clusters thus providing confidence that either isolation method was an effective way to establish cell clusters. snRNA-seq is more likely to capture earlier transcriptional responses than scRNA-seq, but such timing differences are much smaller than the sampling times here and unlikely to affect our analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A cell type atlas for <italic>Patiria miniata</italic> embryo development</title><p>Previous work has shown that pooling scRNA-seq data from the eight-cell stage to the late gastrula of <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> into one atlas results in biologically meaningful clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foster et al., 2020</xref>).

Alternatively, the transcriptomes of the homologous coelomic pouches between the species could be sufficiently divergent so that they no longer drive clustering in the integration approaches we used, possibly reflecting to the morphological uniqueness of sea star coeloms with respect to other echinoderm species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Child, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Morris et al., 2009</xref>). This could also, like with the piwil3+ Cells, result from a difference in developmental timing in which the corresponding population has not yet arisen in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> at the sampled stages. Further interrogation of <italic>P. miniataâs</italic> left coelomic pouch development is needed to better understand these phenomena.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>At the heart of evolutionary developmental biology rest two questions: what is a cell type? And what is novelty? Being able to differentiate and reproducibly define cell categories is essential to understanding the evolutionary relationship between cell types and the cross-species comparisons needed to establish novelty. The identification and definition of cell types can change with new technologies as new data is brought to light. In this paper, a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing approach was used to classify cell types present during early embryonic development in the bat sea star, <italic>P. miniata</italic>. An integrated atlas was constructed using 1:1 orthologs of <italic>P. miniata</italic> and <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> to investigate and infer the changes during cell type specification that underlie the developmental origins of these novel cell types.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>An early embryo developmental atlas for <italic>P. miniata</italic></title><p>We produced a developmental atlas of an echinoderm belonging to the Asteroidea family. The expected cell types were observed and known markers of major tissue types were identified (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). We were also able to make several key observations of cell types present in sea star embryos for the first time. We observed 4 neural clusters in our analysis. These include serotonergic neurons, sensory neural, mixed neural, and an early, general neural type. The identification of these distinct neural clusters is consistent with the finding that the sea urchin early gastrula embryo has three neural cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Slota and McClay, 2018</xref>). In sea urchins, these three neural subtypes are distinguished by the expression of unique transcription factors. The work here shows that neural subtypes can also be distinguished by the expression of different synaptotagmin genes in <italic>P. miniata</italic>, suggesting distinct synaptic vesicle trafficking in these neural types. The identification of endocrine-associated markers in two of these neural clusters (Pmin CL 18 Mixed Neural and Pmin CL 22 Sensory Neural) supports an emerging hypothesis of the origins of neural subtypes from secretory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Moroz, 2021</xref>), which is thus still evident in the mixed endocrine and neural markers of these clusters. This is also consistent with recent work in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> larvae, which identified endocrine-associated genes in post-oral/lateral neurons and argues that the endocrine system evolved from a subset of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Paganos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Perillo et al., 2018</xref>). The similarities found in sea stars and sea urchin embryos demonstrate that the striking degree of neural diversity is a likely feature of early eleutherozoan embryos.</p><p>Diverse mesodermal cell types were also identified by snRNA-seq in <italic>P. miniata</italic>, including an immune-like population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In the <italic>P. miniata</italic> Immune-like Mesenchyme cluster were orthologs of the sea urchin blastocoelar and pigment cells' immune response gene <italic>tek</italic>, a gene expressed in sea urchin coelomocytes and linked to the proliferation of immune cells following an immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Stevens et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>P. miniata</italic> Immune-like Mesenchyme and sea urchin blastocoelar cells also share the marker genes <italic>duox1</italic> and <italic>mapk1</italic>, which are well documented to play a role in stress and immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pinsino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zhan et al., 2018</xref>). These genes are not detected as markers in the sea urchin Pigment Cell cluster, reinforcing the idea that the pigment and blastocoelar cells play different roles in the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ch Ho et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The two populations of coelomic mesoderm in <italic>P. miniata</italic> are of special interest. The Right Coelom shares many markers with the Immune-like Mesenchyme cluster (including transcription factors such as <italic>elk1</italic> and <italic>ets1</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), suggesting that the Immune-like Mesenchymal cells originate from the right coelom and may continue to do so throughout development. However, the left coelom does not have mesenchyme markers suggesting that cells in the left coelom do not undergo EMT transition at this developmental stage. This asymmetry is maintained throughout later developmental stages outside of our sampling window (e.g. shown by whole-mount in situ hybridization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D-I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A comparative single nuclei/cell transcriptomic approach for studying the evolution of cell types</title><p>Identifying homologous cell types across species is a central quest in biology as it is the prerequisite knowledge for understanding the evolutionary basis of cell and morphological diversification. Here, we have presented an orthology-based methodology for combining developmental single cell/nuclei data across species into one composite atlas. Current approaches focus on either integrating data from multiple species into a common atlas or performing pairwise comparisons between separately clustered datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shafer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tanay and SebÃ©-PedrÃ³s, 2021</xref>). An advantage of examining clustered multi-species transcriptome data is that it accommodates split clustering of an organismâs original cluster identity, where a transcriptomic profile defined in a species-specific developmental atlas may split between more than one cluster into the integrated data. This allows us to pull out elements of the GRN that overlap, which we can combine with biological knowledge to form hypotheses for the sister cell relationships and the identification of shared modules deployed in different contexts. We have shown that using only 1:1 orthologs to create an integrated atlas is sufficient to drive clustering that results in mixed-species clusters that demonstrate meaningful transcriptomic similarity. However, it should be noted that restricting our analysis to only 1:1 orthologs removes data from an analysis that can potentially mask the importance of non-orthologous genes and gene duplications in driving species-specific cell-type differences. As this field advances, integration accounting for paralogous transcripts could help improve the meaningfulness and depth of transcriptome comparisons.</p><p>To explore the concept of cell novelty, we first examined whether any integrated clusters showed a species bias. If a cell type was completely unique to one species, we would expect to see a cluster on our integrated UMAP that is dominated by contributions from one species. Int CL 16 is our most species-skewed cluster, with 7.1% from our <italic>P. miniata</italic> dataset and 92.9% of its members originating from our <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> dataset, most of which were originally annotated as piwil3+ Cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The sea urchin piwil3+ Cells could therefore be viewed as novel under the GRN definition of cell types as they do not share any significant transcriptional similarity with cell clusters in sea stars. However, an alternative interpretation is that these cells have yet to be specified in the stages of our sampling in sea stars. There is evidence that these cells are specified later in sea stars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fresques et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we propose that piwil3+ Cells can likely be considered temporally novel to <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> in our dataset, with its distinct signal arising from differences in developmental timing and not separate evolutionary cell lineages. This distinction can be resolved by expanding the datasets to later time points and establishing whether the piwil3+ Cells would form mixed-species clusters.</p><p>Our analysis also identified another potentially species-specific cell population, the Left Coelom of <italic>P. miniata</italic>, which primarily contributed to Int CL 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Though it was not species-exclusive, the <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> atlas of the cells that contributed to the integrated cluster were of numerous identities with no clear contribution from any cluster in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>. In both species, the left coelomic pouch gives rise to the hydrocoel, which forms the adult water vascular system in adults and is a shared feature of all echinoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balser et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">MacBride, 1918</xref>). Therefore from a functional and developmental perspective, these cells are not considered novel but using our definition of transcriptome similarity, they may represent a novel population in sea stars. Understanding the GRN operating in this coelom will provide further insights into the role of this unique regulatory transcriptome. This in turn may change the understanding of the origins of the water vascular systems which is an echinoderm synapomorphy.</p><p>In comparison, the presumed, traditionally defined novel cell types, that is the skeletogenic mesenchyme and pigment cells in sea urchins form molecularly distinct populations in the single species atlas but lose that distinctness in our multi-species atlas where we find similarities between their transcriptomes and those of <italic>P. miniata</italic> clusters. In our integrated data set, the Skeletogenic Mesenchyme aggregate with nuclei from <italic>P. miniata</italic>âs Right Coelom, and these two populations share a significant number of marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>), including several transcription factors (<italic>ets1, arid3a, elk1</italic>). We suggest that these genes have a conserved role in the core mesenchyme specification program present in their last common ancestor. Further work examining these cell types across species of echinoderms is needed to better define these novelties and allow for a more comprehensive characterization of their evolutionary timing.</p><p>Of particular interest is our detection of <italic>vegfr1l</italic> in <italic>P. miniata</italic>. Previous studies have shown that an ortholog of this gene, <italic>vegfr1l</italic> (also known as <italic>flt1</italic>) was exclusively expressed in the skeletogenic mesenchyme of brittle stars and sea urchins and was responsible for the deployment of the biomineralization gene set as was seen as a critical node of cooption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Morino et al., 2012</xref>). VEGFR signaling does not activate skeletogenesis pathways, at least at this developmental stage, as the sea star embryo does not make a skeleton. The <italic>P. miniata</italic> skeletogenic mesenchyme-like GRN now identified in the right coelom may instead have a conserved role in cell guidance, and/or establishing the clustered ring of primary mesenchymal cells at the bottom of the blastocoel, as it does in skeletogenic mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Morino et al., 2012</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, we see <italic>vegfr1l</italic>-positive cells form a ring around the base of the archenteron, similar to skeletogenic PMC cells. This is an intriguing finding as it suggests that the patterning and migration cues that direct skeletogenic mesoderm cells in sea urchins are also in place in sea stars. This indicates that perhaps only the very final activation of the skeletogenesis program is present in sea urchins and that otherwise the cell lineage between these species is similar. This finding is also consistent with the findings from Cidaroid sea urchins that show that skeletogenic cells arise from a population of mesenchyme that migrates from the top of the archenteron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Erkenbrack and Davidson, 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>Vegfr</italic> has also been shown to control conserved tubulogenesis programs documented in other echinoderms and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ben-Tabou de-Leon, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Morgulis et al., 2019</xref>). The coelomic pouches of asteroids are very distinct from other species of echinoderms; they form much earlier in embryonic development and are longer and thinner, compared to other echinoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Child, 1941</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that some of those conserved tubulogenesis genes may also be involved in developing their distinct coelomic morphologies while in sea urchins this gene is instead used to activate biomineral pathways.</p><p>In our multi-species atlas, pigment cells that formed a cluster in the <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> atlas, contribute to integrated clusters with <italic>P. miniata</italic> immune-like mesenchyme or <italic>gcml-</italic>positive neurons. It is not surprising that pigment cells may share similarities with immune cell types in sea stars, given their presumed shared immune functions. When comparing the immune-like mesenchyme of the sea star with the pigment cells of <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> we see several shared combinations of transcription factors, previously demonstrated to play similar roles in cell fate specification between <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>P. miniata</italic>. The sharing of these early-acting regulators suggests that there is a common mesodermal and immune-like mesenchyme regulatory program maintained between <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>P. miniata</italic>. This supports previous work hypothesizing the close evolutionary relationship and possible functional ancestral interdependence between the immune and nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Klimovich and Bosch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kraus et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The pigment cell clustering with <italic>P. miniata</italic> neurons is consistent with previous work that has shown that in larval scRNA-seq, pigment cells cluster with ectodermal cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Paganos et al., 2021</xref>). When comparing the gene expression patterns of the pigment cells and <italic>P. miniata</italic> neurons, we see an overlap of several genes. Of particular interest is their shared expression of <italic>gcml</italic>. Previous literature showing <italic>gcml</italic> is expressed in neural development in other phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jones et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Soustelle et al., 2007</xref>) leads us to suggest that <italic>gcml</italic> plays a role in the development of neural-like excitable or secretory cells in echinoderms, and in the common ancestor of the eleutherozoa. In this scenario, pigment cells may have arisen through the co-option of a neuronal <italic>gcml</italic> module in a subset of mesenchyme cells. The regulatory independence of this new <italic>gcml</italic>-expressing population allowed for genetic individualization and the evolution of different downstream functionalities including the activation of pigment formation genes. At the same time, we see the maintained expression of other neuronal effector genes (<italic>thrb</italic>, voltage-gated channels, and <italic>rab3</italic>), possibly another consequence of <italic>gcml</italic> expression. This suggests that these genes may play dual roles in immune and neural cells and the emergence of modern pigment cells is the result of a fusion of regulatory programs from different cell lineages. Additionally, work comparing fully differentiated neurons, immune cells and pigment cells would help elucidate any further similarities in cell function and gene expression, possibly providing insights into how novel cell types arise and develop unique phenotypes via the co-option of regulatory pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have used single nuclei RNA-seq to study early embryo development in the sea star <italic>P. miniata</italic> and an orthology-centered approach to integrate it with the atlas of sea urchin, <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>. Single-cell transcriptomics provides a very detailed picture of gene expression and cell identity. This allows us to deeply explore concepts of cell-type identity and evolutionary novelty through the lens of gene expression and inferred GRNs operating in the cells.</p><p>The examples uncovered in this study serve to expand our understanding of evolution of cell types among these echinoderms, and more generally highlight ways that we can think about novelty and the limitations of experimental approaches to this understanding.</p><p>Our comparisons discovered examples of transcriptomically distinct cell clusters, that is piwil3+ Cells in sea urchins and Left Coelom in sea stars, with no clear orthologous cluster in the other species. These findings were unexpected and have identified previously unappreciated differences in cell types. These findings may be taken as examples of a novel cell when defined on the basis of gene expression similarities achieved by this method. Novelty in both of these cases may be relative changes in timing or heterochrony of the cell state specification. Unless snRNA-seq covers a tight time course across the entirety of development and adult tissues, and possible environmental contexts we can never truly determine novelty. However, heterochronic activation of a GRN in a new context can result in dramatic functional differences to the organism. The very early specification of a <italic>piwil3+</italic> cell population in sea urchin likely points to a different developmental program and possible functional role of these cell types in these species.</p><p>Conversely, the two cell types that we anticipated as novel based on cell morphology, function, and developmental lineage, that is skeletogenic mesenchyme and pigment cells in sea urchins had significant transcriptomic profiles in common with sea star cell clusters. This implies a shared ancestry of these cells, with an ancestral cell type possessing these regulatory profiles. In the case of skeletogenic mesenchyme and right coelom, this may include overlapping functions in EMT, cell migration, and tubulogenesis with a cooption, quite late in the developmental GRN of cassettes of biomineral genes. The most surprising find from our studies was the overlap between pigment cell cluster transcriptome and the immune and neural clusters in sea stars. This implies a more complex evolutionary scenario whereby programs from two cell types in sea stars have merged into one to produce a distinct cell morphology and function.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides new interpretations of cell type novelty and new inferences of novel cell type evolution when considering comparisons of orthologous gene expression profiles over traditional approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Embryo isolation and prep</title><p>Adult <italic>P. miniata</italic> and <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> animals were obtained by Marinus Scientific (Long Beach, California) and housed in 100-gallon tanks containing aerated artificial seawater (Instant Ocean, 32â33 ppt between 10 and 15Â°C).

After quality control (selection of transcript and gene count thresholds as with the <italic>P. miniata</italic> atlas, as well as the removal of cells with more than 5% of their transcripts originating from the mitochondrial scaffold), 10,611 cells were selected for analysis and clustering using Seurat V4.0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hao et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>For each time point, reads were normalized using the SCTransform algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>), while regressing out mitochondrial (for <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> only) and rRNA transcripts. 2321 integration anchors were identified and used for dataset integration via canonical correlation analysis (CCA), using the Seurat package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). UMAP dimensional reduction and Louvain community assignment resulted in 20 distinct clusters.</p><p>To compare marker genes between different clusters, all calculated marker genes for a cluster of interest in their species-specific atlas were input into a Venn Diagram tool, housed by the Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics group at the Ghent University (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/</ext-link>).</p><p>To calculate the significance of marker gene overlap between species, we calculated the representation factor of pairwise comparisons between calculated marker gene lists. It is calculated by dividing the number of overlapping genes by the expected number of overlapping genes for two independent sets subsampled from a larger finite set. Values over 1 indicate more overlap than expected by chance, while values under 1 indicate less overlap than expected. For marker comparisons between clusters in <italic>P. miniata,</italic> a total gene number of 27,818 was used. For cross-species analysis, this was calculated with respect to the total numbers of 1:1 orthologs. A calculator housed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nemates.org/MA/progs/representation.stats.html">http://nemates.org/MA/progs/representation.stats.html</ext-link> was used to conduct this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Whole mount in situ hybridization (WMISH)</title><p>The WMISH protocol was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hinman et al., 2003b</xref>.

Following denaturation for 5 min at 65 Â°C, DIG-labeled probes were added to the embryos at 0.2 ng/ÂµL. Samples were then incubated at 58 Â°C for 4â7 days. Embryos were washed three times with a hybridization buffer over 4â6 hr, transferred to MAB (0.1 M Malic Acid, 0.15 M NaCl) with 0.1%Tween20 then washed four times with MAB +0.1%Tween. Samples were blocked with MAB-2% Roche Block solution for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 Â°C. Anti-DIG AP FAB Antibody in MAB-2% Roche Block was added to the samples for a final concentration of 1:1000 and left to incubate for 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4 Â°C.</p><p>Next, the samples were washed four times in MAB-0.1%Tween20 followed by three washes in AP buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris pH 9.5), with 15 min between washes. Samples were resuspended in color reaction solution (1X AP buffer, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.2% Tween20, 0.175 mg/ÂµL 4-Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, 0.35 mg/mL 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate), transferred to watch glasses, and kept in the dark at room temperature until the reaction was completed. When the color reaction concluded, embryos were washed three times in MAB-0.1%Tween20 and stored indefinitely in MAB.</p><p>Embryos were evaluated using a Leica MZ 95 dissection scope.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Maria Ina Arnone as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Roger Revilla-i-Domingo (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Improve validation of the P. miniata clustering by using double whole month in situ hybridization as suggested by Reviewer #1.</p><p>2) Complement the integration of sea urchin and sea star datasets analysis with a method that is not limited to the 1:1 orthologs between sea urchin and sea star, using, for example, as suggested by Reviewer #2 the algorithm based on self-assembling manyfold (SAMap). This could partially address also Reviewer #3 concern about comparing a single-nuclei RNA-seq dataset with a single-cell RNA-seq dataset.</p><p>3) Include a sea urchin gastrula stage in the sea urchin and sea star integrated single cell analysis or otherwise address the concerns of Reviewer #1 regarding the absence of a sea urchin gastrula stage in the analysis.</p><p>4) Include clear statements and general discussion about the limitation of cell type evolutionary comparison performed as described in points 2 and 3 by Reviewer #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the manuscript is well written, particularly in the introduction and Discussion sections, the data presented show two major weaknesses, one concerning the validation of the clustering via whole month in situ hybridization (WMISH), and the other concerning the stages of S. purpuratus chosen as homologous of the ones analyzed in P. miniata.</p><p>Regarding validation by WMISH, the general point is that this reviewer would like to see more embryos/gene validation, especially for the novel marker genes identified, and, in some cases a better resolution of the mRNA localization with the help of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or double FISH. For instance, in lines 220-230, the authors make a very interesting point on novel marker genes of their neural clusters, the synaptotagmin genes, which, as shown in the dot plot reported in Figure 5a, exhibit a differential expression marking different neural cell clusters. It would be very nice to see at least a couple of FISH experiments showing these differentiating markers in situ. Double FISH for this would be perfect. Similarly, a better resolution is necessary to convince the reader about the expression patterns reported in Figure 5 E-G and those in Figure 7.</p><p>Another point regarding the WMISH is that there is no information in the paper regarding the stages analyzed. I assume that the embryos in Figure 5 and 6 correspond to the mid gastrula/ 40 h P. miniata embryos that were used as the latest time point in the construction of the single cell atlas, while the ones reported in Figure 7 correspond to later gastrula stages. However, this info has to be included in the figures and/or figure legends.</p><p>Regarding the stages of S. purpuratus chosen as homologous of the ones analyzed in P. miniata, as stated in the results and reported in Figure 3B the authors have used for P. miniate two blastula stages and one gastrula, 40h, which the authors correctly define as mid gastrula (line 171). However, strangely enough, they didn't include any gastrula stage for the corresponding sea urchin data sets, despite the fact the source they used for scRNA-seq data of S. purpuratus (Foster et al. 2020) includes two gastrula stages, one early and one late. On the contrary, the authors chose only hatched and mesenchyme blastula stages for sea urchins and justify this choice with a sentence that appears very controversial: &quot;An extensive comparison of whole embryo RNA-seq time series data between S. purpuratus and P. miniata has shown that P. miniata develops at a faster rate and that S. purpuratus (hatched and mesenchymal blastula stages) are equivalent in developmental timing to the P.miniata time points used to generate the atlas here (Gildor et al., 2019).&quot; Besides the fact that P. miniata definitely develops at a slower and not faster rate compared to S. purpuratus, and that the staging reported in Gildor et al. is not the best reference to be used (certainly they aren't for the two sea urchin species analysed in there) also because the 40h P. miniata stage is not included in it, this statement is clearly contradictory even in respect to what stated by the authors of this paper in other parts of the manuscript. While I can agree with the fact that the so-called &quot;mesenchyme blastula&quot; in sea urchins can be considered as a very early gastrula (given that mesenchyme cells are ingressed in the blastocoel at this stage), no endoderm has ingressed at all at this stage. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to include in the S. purpuratus data sets a stage in which at least some part of the archenteron has ingressed. Indeed, the S. purpuratus early gastrula of the Foster et al. dataset (30h) appears as a bona fide equivalent of the 40h P. miniata gastrula stage. I believe the exclusion of a sea urchin gastrula stage in the comparative analysis introduces a strong bias and I strongly suggest redoing this analysis with the inclusion of this stage.</p><p>Another general, important, although minor and easy to fix point, is the nomenclature used in the manuscript:</p><p>â First of all, about gene names: throughout the manuscript, text, figures, and figure legends, a plethora of different styles are used, even within the same list (such as in the y axis of dot plots), including UPPERCASE, lowercase (italics and not), capitalised words, with or without initials of species names â¦ please choose a style and stick to it, because it is very confusing</p><p>â Second, about cluster names: some choices are in my opinion confusing as they refer to a structure/ developmental stage that is not present in the data set; this is the case for example of (left and right) &quot;coelom&quot;, which should be better referred to as &quot;coelomic mesoderm&quot; given that coelomic pouches appears much later compared to the stages analysed; or the case of the &quot;immune mesenchyme&quot;, which should be better referred to as immune-like given that immune cells, to my knowledge, were never functionally identified in the P. miniata larva; I understand that for the sake of simplicity &quot;immune mesenchyme&quot; could be a better name, but this assumption should be clearly specified and definitely the short name &quot;immune cluster&quot; used in abstract and conclusions is not appropriate</p><p>â Another issue concerns the use of &quot;primary mesenchyme cells&quot;, which is quite an obsolete terminology, not very informative, and really meaningful only within the sea urchin community. Skeletogenic mesenchyme appears more appropriate for a wider audience.</p><p>Two other important changes that would make the manuscript more readable are:</p><p>â First, about the use of the adjusted p-value: reporting the adjusted p-value for each of the marker genes identifying each cluster appears as redundant. If a gene is a gene marker it means that it passed the adjusted p-value test and if the reader wants to know more about those figures these are all included in the tables. The result session is uselessly heavy and boring to read with all these parentheses. I strongly suggest eliminating these details in the text.</p><p>â Second, in the analysis of the contribution of cells for each integrated cluster, the list of all contributions, even if they account for just one cell, again appears redundant, and the text become difficult to read (because of all those figures, percent and parentheses) and eventually even confusing to what is the actual identity of the cluster. I would propose to decide on a certain cut-off (e.g., 10%) and list in the text only the contribution above that threshold, leaving to a supplementary figure the detailed contribution of sea urchin or sea star cluster to the integrated cluster, as done for Figure 9 and 10.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. To strengthen (and potentially expand) the claims resulting from the integration of sea urchin and sea star datasets, I recommend that the authors complement their analysis with a method that is not limited to the 1:1 orthologs between sea urchin and sea star. I would suggest, for example, the algorithm based on self-assembling manyfold (SAMap), which has been successfully employed by Musser et al. (Science 2021) to compare two sponge species (Figure 2B) and has been described in detail by Tarashansky et al. (<italic>eLife</italic> 2021), where single-cell datasets from animals across different phyla were integrated.</p><p>2. I am not sure that this is possible, but if it is, I would suggest visualizing the data in Supplementary Table 3 in a similar way as Figure 2B of Musser et al. (Science 2021). This would make it easier to follow the description of the integrated clusters.</p><p>3. In Figure 6, the authors very nicely show that genes enriched in Pmin Cl 21 are expressed in mesenchymal populations. In particular, VEGFR1L is shown to be expressed in a population that accumulates around the base of the archenteron (Figure 6G), similar to the localization of PMCs in S. purpuratus. According to Figure 6.D, my impression is that tek (another gene enriched in Pmin CL 21) is also expressed in the population of cells around the archenteron. Although less clear, the same might be true for ets1 (Figure 6.D). Could the authors explain whether these (and perhaps other) markers of Pmin CL 21 are expressed in the mesenchymal population around the archenteron? If they are indeed expressed in this population, can the authors comment on the significance of this?</p><p>4. An interesting finding of the study by Meyer et al. is the overlap between pigment cell cluster transcriptome in sea urchins and the immune and neural clusters in sea stars. Would it be relevant to discuss this finding in the light of the hypothesis by Klimovich and Bosch (BioEssays 2018, section: &quot;Rethinking the Role of the Nervous System&quot;) that the nervous system and the immune system have a common evolutionary origin?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Combing scRNAseq and snRNAseq data could introduce biases. Several studies have noted that seemingly subtle differences like sequencing platform or even batch can produce artificial signals within scRNAseq data, sometimes even swamping species effects (e.g., Mizrahi-Man and Gilad 2015 PMID: 26236466; Tung et al. 2017 PMID: 28045081). Thus, it's not clear to me that single-nucleus and single-cell RNAseq data can be combined without introducing systematic biases in the representation of transcripts present. For instance, mRNAs with short half-lives would likely be over-represented in snRNAseq compared with scRNAseq. I suspect that conclusions about overlapping clusters and the presence/absence of clusters reported in this study are generally secure. However, differences in timing and in proportions of cells in a given cluster between species may be more problematic. If the authors are aware of any empirical data that support direct comparisons between snRNAseq and scRNA seq, citing these would build confidence in the results. At a minimum, the authors should state more clearly that they are making an assumption when combining different data types in this study, and also comment on how this might affect the interpretation of results.</p><p>2. Sampling only embryonic stages limits the ability to confidently identify the absence of a cell type. In an adult organ composed mostly of differentiated cells, determining the presence/absence of a cell type is fairly straightforward, assuming fairly representative cells/nuclei and reasonably high-quality data. In contrast, a gastrula-stage embryo contains very few, if indeed any, fully differentiated cells. Further, it is well established that homologous cells can differentiate at different stages of development in different species. Thus, a cell type might appear to be absent in the gastrula of one species and present in another simply because it has not yet begun to differentiate in the first species. It's a situation where the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This makes it impossible to reach any firm conclusions about which cell types might be unique to seastars or sea urchins. The authors are clearly aware of this limitation, e.g. lines 446-447: &quot;thus making Int CL 16 the only S. purpuratus-specific cell type at this stage of development&quot; (emphasis added). Here and elsewhere, the authors are good about stating this caveat. However, these statements come across as each applying to a specific case rather than a general limitation that applies to all cell types. This more general caveat should be clearly stated, as it is key to understanding what can and can't be learned from the data. This is particularly important because many non-specialists reading this paper will get lost in, or simply skip over, the numerous details presented for any given cell type and could easily miss both the individual caveats and the more general point that in no case is it possible to conclude that a particular cell type is present or absent from one species or the other.</p><p>3. Data from only two species limits the ability to confidently identify the direction of evolutionary change. Even if we accept that some cells are truly present/absent, figuring out whether these cases represent novelties or losses is problematic when only examining two species: is it a gain in the species with the unique cell type or a loss in the species without? The usual approach to answering this question is getting data from an outgroup species, but in the present case, the data simply aren't available. The authors are not always clear about this limitation, for example (lines 462-463) &quot;this cluster can be considered novel to S. purpuratus&quot;. More accurate would be to say that it is uniquely present rather than novel. It could also be the case that the ancestral echinoderm had an early specification of germ cells and that this has been lost in seastars and perhaps other echinoderms. Here again, the limitation is a general one rather than specific to this particular cell type and should be clearly stated as such. Again, this is key to understanding what can and cannot be inferred from the data.</p><p>A suggestion: There may be an opportunity to make a different kind of evolutionarily inference that is more secure, namely to identify evolutionary differences in the timing of differentiation of specific cell types. These observations are interesting because they have implications for the evolution of cell fate specification mechanisms. For instance, germ cells are specified clonally and very early in sea urchins and the molecular mechanisms and cellular processes responsible are well studied. The absence of any cells with a similar transcriptional profile in seastar embryos implies no that early segregation of the germ line does not occur, and thus it is unlikely that localized maternal determinants are responsible. Given the wealth of information available about cell fate specification mechanisms in sea urchins, inferences about evolutionary differences could be made about other cell types as well. This seems to me a missed opportunity for the authors to highlight some interesting and informative aspects of their results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80090.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Improve validation of the P. miniata clustering by using double whole month in situ hybridization as suggested by Reviewer #1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added single-color WMISH for the genes <italic>syt14</italic> (Figure 5.i), <italic>syt7</italic> (Figure 5.h), <italic>etv1</italic> (Figure 5.f) and <italic>got1</italic> (Figure 5.g).

This could partially address also Reviewer #3 concern about comparing a single-nuclei RNA-seq dataset with a single-cell RNA-seq dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>After careful consideration we have decided to maintain our focus on 1:1 orthologs for our mapping as we believe this gives more robust results SAMap was developed for mouse/human integration (~100 Mya) and will be limited for sea star/sea urchin integration (~400 Mya). First it should be noted that our orthology mapping between these two species has been extensively performed using the principles of the Alliance of Genome Resources that at least three DIOPT tools should agree on the orthology. We have used BLAST, phylogenetic-based tools (InParanoid v4.1, ProteinOrtho v6, SwiftOrtho, FastOrtho, OMA and OrthoFinder) as published in âIntegration of 1: 1 orthology maps and updated datasets into Echinobase, Foley et al. Database, 2021â. We think mapping using orthologous genes provides a more reliable comparison for our integrated echinoderm datasets.</p><p>We also show that several results from this integrated mapping corroborate observations from other data types to support that we are making meaningful findings. For example, we identify a sea urchin specific integrated cluster (Int CL 14) that corresponds to <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> Piwil3+ Cells. The near absence of sea star nuclei in Int CL 14 is supported by previous gene expression studies (Fresques et al. 2014) which show that <italic>piwil3</italic>, <italic>nanos2l</italic> and <italic>pum2</italic> orthologs/paralogs are not expressed in these stages in <italic>P. miniata</italic>.</p><p>To reflect our focus on ortholog driven clustering we have changed the title to of the paper</p><p>New hypotheses of cell type diversity and novelty from orthology-driven comparative single cell and nuclei transcriptomics in echinoderms.</p><p>We also comment here on the differences between single nuclei and single cell approaches. We carefully considered the approaches to isolation and thought for this and future studies that single nuclei sequencing would be less biased, robust and easier to achieve reliability; especially as researchers look to later and more complex stages and tissues. We therefore took great care to evaluate the two procedures since we do rely on comparison to scRNA sequencing. Figure 2 and Figure 2 Supplemental FIgure 1 strongly support that there are no significant differences between approaches and that they can be reliably compared. We showed bulk RNA profiles are not significantly different when obtained from whole embryos, isolated cells or isolated nuclei (Figure 2) and that the single nuclei atlas prepared in our studies was highly similar to the atlas previously prepared from single cells (Foster et al. 2019).</p><p>We added the following sentence in the fourth paragraph of the results to more thoroughly clarify our position on this.</p><p>&quot;These results thus strongly support that single nuclei and single-cell RNA isolation and sequencing each resulted in appropriate representative clusters thus providing confidence that either isolation method was an effective way to establish cell clusters. snRNA-seq is more likely to capture earlier transcriptional responses than scRNA-seq, but such timing differences are much smaller than the sampling times here and unlikely to affect our analyses.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Include a sea urchin gastrula stage in the sea urchin and sea star integrated single cell analysis or otherwise address the concerns of Reviewer #1 regarding the absence of a sea urchin gastrula stage in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this new time point in our analysis. In doing so we have re-clustered and re-annotated the sea urchin data and re-performed the integrated cluster analysis. This reanalysis has led to many small changes in summary statistics and specifics of clusters, and overlapping gene sets. However, the main findings of the work and conclusions of the analyses have not changed, as many of the differences in the re-analyses are of small effect.</p><p>Thus, we recreated the sea urchin developmental atlas now using three time points (hatched blastula, and mesenchymal blastula, and early gastrula stages). We now have 10,611 cells in the analysis rather than the original reported 7,370 and 23 vs 20 distinct clusters.</p><p>We then performed a new cluster annotation. The most significant difference with this new analysis is that we now have two rather than one pigment cell cluster, named Spur CL 12 Pigment Cells A and Spur CL 14 Pigment Cells B. Additionally small micromeres and muscle clusters were annotated. The <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> annotation in Figure 8 supplemental figure 1 and Figure 8 was updated to reflect the new cluster names.</p><p>We added additional text to more robustly explain the annotation of Spur CL 12 and 14, the two pigment cell clusters and Spur CL 13 as skeletogenic mesenchyme (previously PMCs).</p><p>The text now reads:</p><p>âTwo clusters were identified as belonging to the pigment cell lineage (Spur CL 12 Pigment Cells A and Spur CL 14 Pigment Cells B). These clusters shared 107 markers including known markers of pigment cells in sea urchins, including <italic>gcml</italic>, <italic>polyketide synthase 1 (pks1), dimethylaniline monooxygenase [N-oxide-forming] 2 (fmo3),</italic> and <italic>sulfotransferase</italic> (<italic>sult</italic>) (Calestani et al. 2003). We hypothesize Spur CL 14 Pigment cells B represents a population of pigment cells in an earlier state of differentiation than Spur CL 12 Pigment Cells A, because upstream transcription factors such as <italic>etv6, gata6, and etv1</italic> mark only Spur CL 14 Pigment Cells B. â</p><p>âThe skeletogenic mesenchyme cluster (Spur CL 13) was marked by the expression of regulatory genes such as ets1, aristaless-like homeobox (alx1), ALX homeobox 1-like (alx1l, previously called alx4), T-box brain transcription factor 1 (tbr), ets variant transcription factor 6 (etv6, previously called tel), transcriptional regulator ERG (erg), hematopoietically-expressed homeobox protein HHEX homolog (hhex), TGFB induced factor homeobox 2-like (tgif2), arid3a, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (flt1, also known as vegfr1). As expected, this cluster was also marked by genes involved in biomineralization, including 27 kDa primary mesenchyme-specific spicule protein (pm27a), spicule matrix protein SM50 (sm50), and mesenchyme-specific cell surface glycoprotein (msp130).â</p><p>While the annotation of the immune cell cluster did not change, we added additional text to more clearly explain the rationale for this cluster.</p><p>&quot;Another cluster of particular interest is Spur CL 17 Oral Non-skeletogenic Mesenchyme, the lineage fated to become immune coelomocyte cells. This cluster is marked by genes known to be involved in the specification of this lineage like <italic>erg, gata3, gata6, hhex, prox1, ets1,</italic> as well as genes that have been linked to immune response in echinoderms, like <italic>tek</italic>, and <italic>srcr</italic>. Other genes implicated in immune function in other systems such as two allograft inflammatory factor 1-like genes (LOC763226, LOC115929190), C-type lectin domain-containing protein 141-like, and duox1 are also found in this cluster (Brown et al., 2018; Rada and Leto, 2008; Vizioli et al., 2020).&quot;</p><p>With the new cluster analysis we then re-performed the integration between the <italic>P. miniata</italic> and <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> datasets and updated the analyses in Figures 8-12.</p><p>We have used the same methodology and pipelines as previously.

For instance, in lines 220-230, the authors make a very interesting point on novel marker genes of their neural clusters, the synaptotagmin genes, which, as shown in the dot plot reported in Figure 5a, exhibit a differential expression marking different neural cell clusters. It would be very nice to see at least a couple of FISH experiments showing these differentiating markers in situ. Double FISH for this would be perfect. Similarly, a better resolution is necessary to convince the reader about the expression patterns reported in Figure 5 E-G and those in Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>These in situs have been added and details are provided under âessential revisionsâ point 1.</p><p>We have added single-color WMISH of 48 hpf gastrula stage embryos for the genes <italic>syt14</italic> (Figure 5.I), <italic>syt7</italic> (Figure 5.H), <italic>etv1</italic> (Figure 5.F) and <italic>got1</italic> (Figure 5.G). These genes were identified as markers for the four neural clusters and now importantly indicate expression in patterns consistent with neural fate and a pattern that differs between the genes suggesting non overlapping of neural fates. We additionally added two color FISH for <italic>gcml</italic> + <italic>hoxd9a</italic> (Figure 5.l) and <italic>rab3</italic> + <italic>gcml</italic> (Figure 5.M). These were important to show that <italic>hoxd9a</italic> and <italic>rab3</italic> are coexpressed with some subsets of <italic>gcml</italic>+ cells. This supports the hypothesis suggested by the clustering of neural types in Figure 4 and Figure 5.A that <italic>gcml</italic>, <italic>rab3</italic> and <italic>hoxd9a</italic> are are marker genes for the Sensory Neural cluster (Pmin CL 22) with some colocalization. There is not perfect overlap with these gene transcripts suggesting an even more complex neural cell fate than we have captured in our clustering.</p><p>We also added images from double FISH of 48 hpf gastrula stage embryos for <italic>ets1</italic> + <italic>tek</italic> (Figure 6.H) to support the hypothesis of Figure 4 and Figure 6.A and 6.B that <italic>ets1</italic> and <italic>tek</italic> are coexpressed and are marker genes for Immune-like Mesenchyme (Pm CL 1).

I assume that the embryos in Figure 5 and 6 correspond to the mid gastrula/ 40 h P. miniata embryos that were used as the latest time point in the construction of the single cell atlas, while the ones reported in Figure 7 correspond to later gastrula stages. However, this info has to be included in the figures and/or figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>Times and stages have been added to the figure legends.</p><p>Figure 5 shows 48 hpf gastrula stage embryos.</p><p>Figure 6 shows 48 hpf gastrula stage embryos.</p><p>Figure 7 shows 72 hpf gastrula stage embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the stages of S. purpuratus chosen as homologous of the ones analyzed in P. miniata, as stated in the results and reported in Figure 3B the authors have used for P. miniate two blastula stages and one gastrula, 40h, which the authors correctly define as mid gastrula (line 171). However, strangely enough, they didn't include any gastrula stage for the corresponding sea urchin data sets, despite the fact the source they used for scRNA-seq data of S. purpuratus (Foster et al. 2020) includes two gastrula stages, one early and one late. On the contrary, the authors chose only hatched and mesenchyme blastula stages for sea urchins and justify this choice with a sentence that appears very controversial: &quot;An extensive comparison of whole embryo RNA-seq time series data between S. purpuratus and P. miniata has shown that P. miniata develops at a faster rate and that S. purpuratus (hatched and mesenchymal blastula stages) are equivalent in developmental timing to the P.miniata time points used to generate the atlas here (Gildor et al., 2019).&quot; Besides the fact that P. miniata definitely develops at a slower and not faster rate compared to S. purpuratus, and that the staging reported in Gildor et al. is not the best reference to be used (certainly they aren't for the two sea urchin species analysed in there) also because the 40h P. miniata stage is not included in it, this statement is clearly contradictory even in respect to what stated by the authors of this paper in other parts of the manuscript. While I can agree with the fact that the so-called &quot;mesenchyme blastula&quot; in sea urchins can be considered as a very early gastrula (given that mesenchyme cells are ingressed in the blastocoel at this stage), no endoderm has ingressed at all at this stage. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to include in the S. purpuratus data sets a stage in which at least some part of the archenteron has ingressed. Indeed, the S. purpuratus early gastrula of the Foster et al. dataset (30h) appears as a bona fide equivalent of the 40h P. miniata gastrula stage. I believe the exclusion of a sea urchin gastrula stage in the comparative analysis introduces a strong bias and I strongly suggest redoing this analysis with the inclusion of this stage.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the sea urchin early gastrula (24 hpf) stage sample from Foster et al. to the data and these changes to the manuscript are explained in âessential revisionsâ point 3.</p><p>We have included this new time point in our analysis. In doing so we have re-clustered and re-annotated the sea urchin data and re-performed the integrated cluster analysis. This reanalysis has led to many small changes in summary statistics and specifics of clusters, and overlapping gene sets. However, the main findings of the work and conclusions of the analyses have not changed, as many of the differences in the re-analyses are of small effect.</p><p>Thus, we recreated the sea urchin developmental atlas now using three time points (hatched blastula, and mesenchymal blastula, and early gastrula stages). We now have 10,611 cells in the analysis rather than the original reported 7,370 and 23 vs 20 distinct clusters.</p><p>We then performed a new cluster annotation. The most significant difference with this new analysis is that we now have two rather than one pigment cell cluster, named Spur CL 12 Pigment Cells A and Spur CL 14 Pigment Cells B. Additionally small micromeres and muscle clusters were annotated. The <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> annotation in Figure 8 Supplemental Figure 1 and Figure 8 was updated to reflect the new cluster names.</p><p>We added additional text to more robustly explain the annotation of Spur CL 12 and 14, the two pigment cell clusters and Spur CL 13 as skeletogenic mesenchyme (previously PMCs).</p><p>The text now reads:</p><p>âTwo clusters were identified as belonging to the pigment cell lineage (Spur CL 12 Pigment Cells A and Spur CL 14 Pigment Cells B).

We hypothesize Spur CL 14 Pigment cells B represents a population of pigment cells in an earlier state of differentiation than Spur CL 12 Pigment Cells A, because upstream transcription factors such as <italic>etv6, gata6, and etv1</italic> mark only Spur CL 14 Pigment Cells B. â</p><p>âThe skeletogenic mesenchyme cluster (Spur CL 13) was marked by the expression of regulatory genes such as ets1, aristaless-like homeobox (alx1), ALX homeobox 1-like (alx1l, previously called alx4), T-box brain transcription factor 1 (tbr), ets variant transcription factor 6 (etv6, previously called tel), transcriptional regulator ERG (erg), hematopoietically-expressed homeobox protein HHEX homolog (hhex), TGFB induced factor homeobox 2-like (tgif2), arid3a, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (flt1, also known as vegfr1). As expected, this cluster was also marked by genes involved in biomineralization, including 27 kDa primary mesenchyme-specific spicule protein (pm27 a), spicule matrix protein SM50 (sm50), and mesenchyme-specific cell surface glycoprotein (msp130).â</p><p>While the annotation of the immune cell cluster did not change, we added additional text to more clearly explain the rationale for this cluster.</p><p>&quot;Another cluster of particular interest is Spur CL 17 Oral Non-skeletogenic mesenchyme, the lineage fated to become immune coelomocyte cells.

I would propose to decide on a certain cut-off (e.g., 10%) and list in the text only the contribution above that threshold, leaving to a supplementary figure the detailed contribution of sea urchin or sea star cluster to the integrated cluster, as done for Figure 9 and 10.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed these throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. To strengthen (and potentially expand) the claims resulting from the integration of sea urchin and sea star datasets, I recommend that the authors complement their analysis with a method that is not limited to the 1:1 orthologs between sea urchin and sea star. I would suggest, for example, the algorithm based on self-assembling manyfold (SAMap), which has been successfully employed by Musser et al. (Science 2021) to compare two sponge species (Figure 2B) and has been described in detail by Tarashansky et al. (eLife 2021), where single-cell datasets from animals across different phyla were integrated.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss this under âessential revisionsâ point 2 where we justify our decision to maintain the analysis on 1:1 orthologs and acknowledge this by changing the title of the paper to reflect our focus on this subset of genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I am not sure that this is possible, but if it is, I would suggest visualizing the data in Supplementary Table 3 in a similar way as Figure 2B of Musser et al. (Science 2021). This would make it easier to follow the description of the integrated clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>While we appreciate this reviewer's point after discussion among the authors, we opted for our visualization method used in Figures 9 -12 because we determined a ribbon plot linking 3 clustering methods was ultimately too complex and chaotic to effectively communicate our findings.

In Figure 6, the authors very nicely show that genes enriched in Pmin Cl 21 are expressed in mesenchymal populations. In particular, VEGFR1L is shown to be expressed in a population that accumulates around the base of the archenteron (Figure 6G), similar to the localization of PMCs in S. purpuratus. According to Figure 6.D, my impression is that tek (another gene enriched in Pmin CL 21) is also expressed in the population of cells around the archenteron. Although less clear, the same might be true for ets1 (Figure 6.D). Could the authors explain whether these (and perhaps other) markers of Pmin CL 21 are expressed in the mesenchymal population around the archenteron? If they are indeed expressed in this population, can the authors comment on the significance of this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more in situs and double in situs and have added text as now explained in âessential revisionsâ point 1.</p><p>We have also added the following text:</p><p>&quot;This is an intriguing finding as it suggests that the patterning and migration cues that direct skeletogenic mesoderm cells in sea urchins are also in place in sea stars. This indicates that perhaps only the very final activation of the skeletogenesis program is present in sea urchins and that otherwise the cell lineage between these species is similar. This finding is also consistent with the findings from Cidaroid sea urchins that show that skeletogenic cells arise from a population of mesenchyme that migrates from the top of the archenteron (Erkenbrack and Davidson 2015)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. An interesting finding of the study by Meyer et al. is the overlap between pigment cell cluster transcriptome in sea urchins and the immune and neural clusters in sea stars.

We have added the following text and reference into the discussion:</p><p>&quot;This supports previous work hypothesizing the close evolutionary relationship and possible functional ancestral interdependence between the immune and nervous systems (Klimovich and Bosch, 2018; Kraus et al., 2021).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Combing scRNAseq and snRNAseq data could introduce biases. Several studies have noted that seemingly subtle differences like sequencing platform or even batch can produce artificial signals within scRNAseq data, sometimes even swamping species effects (e.g., Mizrahi-Man and Gilad 2015 PMID: 26236466; Tung et al. 2017 PMID: 28045081). Thus, it's not clear to me that single-nucleus and single-cell RNAseq data can be combined without introducing systematic biases in the representation of transcripts present. For instance, mRNAs with short half-lives would likely be over-represented in snRNAseq compared with scRNAseq. I suspect that conclusions about overlapping clusters and the presence/absence of clusters reported in this study are generally secure. However, differences in timing and in proportions of cells in a given cluster between species may be more problematic. If the authors are aware of any empirical data that support direct comparisons between snRNAseq and scRNA seq, citing these would build confidence in the results. At a minimum, the authors should state more clearly that they are making an assumption when combining different data types in this study, and also comment on how this might affect the interpretation of results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided comments on this in Essential Revisions under point 2.</p><p>After careful consideration we have decided to maintain our focus on 1:1 orthologs for our mapping as we believe this gives more robust results SAMap was developed for mouse/human integration (~100 Mya) and will be limited for sea star/sea urchin integration (~400 Mya). First it should be noted that our orthology mapping between these two species has been extensively performed using the principles of the Alliance of Genome Resources that at least three DIOPT tools should agree on the orthology. We have used BLAST, phylogenetic-based tools (InParanoid v4.1, ProteinOrtho v6, SwiftOrtho, FastOrtho, OMA and OrthoFinder) as published in âIntegration of 1: 1 orthology maps and updated datasets into Echinobase, Foley et al. Database, 2021â. We think mapping using orthologous genes provides a more reliable comparison for our integrated echinoderm datasets.</p><p>We also show that several results from this integrated mapping corroborate observations from other data types to support that we are making meaningful findings. For example, we identify a sea urchin specific integrated cluster (Int CL 14) that corresponds to <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> Piwil3+ Cells. The near absence of sea star nuclei in Int CL 14 is supported by previous gene expression studies (Fresques et al. 2014) which show that <italic>piwil3</italic>, <italic>nanos2l</italic> and <italic>pum2</italic> orthologs/paralogs are not expressed in these stages in <italic>P. miniata</italic>.</p><p>To reflect our focus on ortholog driven clustering we have changed the title to of the paper.</p><p>New hypotheses of cell type diversity and novelty from orthology-driven comparative single cell and nuclei transcriptomics in echinoderms.</p><p>We also comment here on the differences between single nuclei and single cell approaches. We carefully considered the approaches to isolation and thought for this and future studies that single nuclei sequencing would be less biased, robust and easier to achieve reliability; especially as researchers look to later and more complex stages and tissues. We therefore took great care to evaluate the two procedures since we do rely on comparison to scRNA sequencing. Figure 2 and Supplementary file 5 strongly support that there are no significant differences between approaches and that they can be reliably compared. We showed bulk RNA profiles are not significantly different when obtained from whole embryos, isolated cells or isolated nuclei (Figure 2) and that the single nuclei atlas prepared in our studies was highly similar to the atlas previously prepared from single cells (Foster et al. 2019).</p><p>We added the following sentence in the fourth paragraph of the results to more thoroughly clarify our position on this.</p><p>&quot;These results thus strongly support that single nuclei and single-cell RNA isolation and sequencing each resulted in appropriate representative clusters thus providing confidence that either isolation method was an effective way to establish cell clusters. snRNA-seq is more likely to capture earlier transcriptional responses than scRNA-seq, but such timing differences are much smaller than the sampling times here and unlikely to affect our analyses.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Sampling only embryonic stages limits the ability to confidently identify the absence of a cell type. In an adult organ composed mostly of differentiated cells, determining the presence/absence of a cell type is fairly straightforward, assuming fairly representative cells/nuclei and reasonably high-quality data. In contrast, a gastrula-stage embryo contains very few, if indeed any, fully differentiated cells. Further, it is well established that homologous cells can differentiate at different stages of development in different species. Thus, a cell type might appear to be absent in the gastrula of one species and present in another simply because it has not yet begun to differentiate in the first species. It's a situation where the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This makes it impossible to reach any firm conclusions about which cell types might be unique to seastars or sea urchins. The authors are clearly aware of this limitation, e.g. lines 446-447: &quot;thus making Int CL 16 the only S. purpuratus-specific cell type at this stage of development&quot; (emphasis added). Here and elsewhere, the authors are good about stating this caveat. However, these statements come across as each applying to a specific case rather than a general limitation that applies to all cell types. This more general caveat should be clearly stated, as it is key to understanding what can and can't be learned from the data. This is particularly important because many non-specialists reading this paper will get lost in, or simply skip over, the numerous details presented for any given cell type and could easily miss both the individual caveats and the more general point that in no case is it possible to conclude that a particular cell type is present or absent from one species or the other.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it can be extremely difficult to demonstrate that a cell type is entirely absent in one species and hence truly novel in the other. We think the novelty we can assess here is developmental timing and context. We have tried to be more clear about the role of timing differences in what we have found, which was also suggested by reviewer 2.</p><p>Text in intro:</p><p>âTheir larval forms in particular have several cell types that, based on developmental, morphological, and functional criteria, are considered to be novel (Figure 1).&quot;</p><p>Text added to discussion:</p><p>âFurther work examining these cell types across species of echinoderms is needed to better define these novelties and allow for a more comprehensive characterization of their evolutionary timing.â</p><p>âAdditionally, work comparing fully differentiated neurons, immune cells and pigment cells would help elucidate any further similarities in cell function and gene expression, possibly providing insights into how novel cell types arise and develop unique phenotypes via the co-option of regulatory pathways.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Data from only two species limits the ability to confidently identify the direction of evolutionary change. Even if we accept that some cells are truly present/absent, figuring out whether these cases represent novelties or losses is problematic when only examining two species: is it a gain in the species with the unique cell type or a loss in the species without? The usual approach to answering this question is getting data from an outgroup species, but in the present case, the data simply aren't available. The authors are not always clear about this limitation, for example (lines 462-463) &quot;this cluster can be considered novel to S. purpuratus&quot;. More accurate would be to say that it is uniquely present rather than novel. It could also be the case that the ancestral echinoderm had an early specification of germ cells and that this has been lost in seastars and perhaps other echinoderms. Here again, the limitation is a general one rather than specific to this particular cell type and should be clearly stated as such. Again, this is key to understanding what can and cannot be inferred from the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer and have worked to be more clear and not assume direction and be more careful about what we have discussed as novel versus simply missing at this time point.

These observations are interesting because they have implications for the evolution of cell fate specification mechanisms. For instance, germ cells are specified clonally and very early in sea urchins and the molecular mechanisms and cellular processes responsible are well studied. The absence of any cells with a similar transcriptional profile in seastar embryos implies no that early segregation of the germ line does not occur, and thus it is unlikely that localized maternal determinants are responsible. Given the wealth of information available about cell fate specification mechanisms in sea urchins, inferences about evolutionary differences could be made about other cell types as well. This seems to me a missed opportunity for the authors to highlight some interesting and informative aspects of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added some new text into the âEssential Revisions #4â. We agree that timing changes are very important in our system and should be highlighted better in our text.</p><p>We have added some discussion about differences in the timing of germ line specification while also being careful to take into account the points made by Reviewer #1 about the lack of confidence in our identification in PGCs, which we have re-annotated as piwi3l+ Cells:</p><p>âWe hypothesize that this could be caused by the differences in the timing of PGC formation. Previous work has shown that the genes typically used to identify them, such as piwi nanos, and pumillo, only begin to show cell-type-specific expression in P. miniata by the late gastrula stage when the posterior endocoelom forms (Fresques et al., 2014), a time point that lies outside our sampling window. Therefore, this cluster can be considered novel to S. purpuratus within our sampled window. â</p></body></sub-article></article>
