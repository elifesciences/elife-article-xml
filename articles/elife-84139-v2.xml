requires a highly specialized membrane structure, the triad, composed of a plasma membrane invagination, the T-tubule, surrounded by two sarcoplasmic reticulum terminal cisternae. Although the precise mechanisms governing T-tubule biogenesis and triad formation remain largely unknown, studies have shown that caveolae participate in T-tubule formation and mutations of several of their constituents induce muscle weakness and myopathies. Here, we demonstrate that, at the plasma membrane, Bin1 and caveolae composed of caveolin-3 assemble into ring-like structures from which emerge tubes enriched in the dihydropyridine receptor. Bin1 expression lead to the formation of both rings and tubes and we show that Bin1 forms scaffolds on which caveolae accumulate to form the initial T-tubule. Cav3 deficiency caused by either gene silencing or pathogenic mutations results in defective ring formation and perturbed Bin1-mediated tubulation that may explain defective T-tubule organization in mature muscles. Our results uncover new pathophysiological mechanisms that may prove relevant to myopathies caused by Cav3 or Bin1 dysfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>caveolae</kwd><kwd>T-tubules</kwd><kwd>caveolin 3</kwd><kwd>correlative microscopy</kwd><kwd>caveolinopathies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-21-CE13-0018-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vassilopoulos</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE17-0006-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bitoun</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007393</institution-id><institution>Association Française contre les Myopathies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bitoun</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Caveolae and Bin1 form tubulation platforms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle contraction is induced by the release of intracellular calcium resulting from the transmission of the neuronal action potential to the muscle fiber. This step called excitation-contraction coupling (E-C coupling), relies on the physical interaction between the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), two calcium channels anchored in different membrane compartments of the muscle cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franzini-Armstrong, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marty et al., 1994</xref>). The DHPR is a voltage-activated calcium channel present in invaginations of the plasma membrane called transverse tubules (T-tubules) and RyR1 is the main calcium channel located in cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in close proximity to T-tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franzini-Armstrong and Protasi, 1997</xref>). The function of this calcium release complex relies on a unique membrane system composed of two SR cisternae apposed to one T-tubule, a structure named the triad. While the structure and function of the triad are now well characterized, its biogenesis remains poorly understood, especially regarding the formation of the T-tubule.</p><p>It was initially thought that T-tubule formation occurs in two stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flucher et al., 1991</xref>). In the first step, tubules emanate from the plasma membrane longitudinally. In the second step, tubules subsequently meet and become connected with a cytosolic membrane compartment. An involvement of caveolae has long been suspected in the formation of the nascent T-tubules from mouse, chick, and rat skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franzini-Armstrong, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishikawa, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schiaffino et al., 1977</xref>). Caveolae are small cave-like indentations of the plasma membrane that are very abundant in skeletal muscle, where they have many functions including signal transduction, lipid homeostasis and mechanoprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>). Caveolins were the first caveolae-constituting molecules described; caveolin-1 (Cav1) and caveolin-3 (Cav3) but not caveolin-2 are required for caveolae formation at the membrane of non-muscle and muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fra et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rothberg et al., 1992</xref>). Caveolins associate with cavin family proteins (cavins 1–4) to stabilize caveolae at the plasma membrane. Cavin 1 (also known as Polymerase I and transcript release factor PTRF) is essential for caveolae formation in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2008</xref>) by interacting with Cav1 (in non-muscle cells) and Cav3 (in muscle cells). The muscle-specific cavin 4 isoform (also known as muscle-restricted coiled-coil, MURC), the last described caveolae protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogata et al., 2008</xref>), is not required for caveolae formation but may play a role in caveolar morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lo et al., 2015</xref>). In skeletal muscle, Cav3 localizes mostly on the plasma membrane of mature fibers but is also present at the core of the fiber where it is associated with the T-tubule system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ralston and Ploug, 1999</xref>). Plasma membrane openings of caveolae and T-tubules are of the same size (20–40 nm) and appear indistinguishable by electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franzini-Armstron, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franzini-armstrong and Porter, 1964</xref>). This similarity between caveolae and T-tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishikawa, 1968</xref>), as well as their dependence on membrane cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hidalgo et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rothberg et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 1991</xref>), the enrichment of caveolae at the neck of T-tubules at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franzini-Armstrong, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murphy et al., 2009</xref>), and the association of Cav3 with developing T-tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parton et al., 1997</xref>) all suggest that caveolae and their associated proteins could have a role in T-tubule biogenesis. It has been suggested that caveolae may fuse together and form a substrate for proteins capable of tubulating membranes such as Bin1 (also known as amphiphysin 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2002</xref>) and more recently, a direct interaction between Bin1 and cavin 4 was shown to be required for normal T-tubule formation in zebrafish muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lo et al., 2021</xref>). The importance of these proteins in skeletal muscle physiology is emphasized by the fact that mutations in the <italic>CAV3</italic> gene cause autosomal dominant neuromuscular diseases called caveolinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboumousa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gazzerro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Woodman et al., 2004</xref>) and mutations in <italic>BIN1</italic> induce T-tubule and triad defects in the autosomal recessive form of centronuclear myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicot et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, Bin1 splicing defects in the exon responsible for the interaction of Bin1 with membrane phosphoinositides induce T-tubule defects in myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fugier et al., 2011</xref>). In patients with caveolae deficiency and in <italic>Cav3</italic> knock-out mice, defects in T-tubule orientation and defects in calcium flow are observed, although T-tubules still develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galbiati et al., 2001</xref>). Despite its major importance, the involvement of caveolins in T-tubule formation and the effect of caveolin mutations on the T-tubule system remain poorly understood.</p><p>To explore the role of caveolae in T-tubule formation, we examined the nanoscale composition of nascent T-tubules by a correlative microscopy technique combining super-resolution fluorescence and electron microscopy on platinum replicas (PREM) applied to control and genetically modified human and murine skeletal muscle myoblasts differentiated into multinucleated myotubes. We discovered the existence of novel structures that we termed caveolae rings, formed by Cav3 and Bin1. We found that caveolae rings are formed on Bin1 scaffolds that create contact sites with RyR1-positive ER/SR tubes, are enriched in DHPR and act as platform for T-tubule nucleation. In addition, we show that the Bin1-induced membrane tubulation requires proper Cav3 function. Collectively, this work suggests that caveolae rings are the long-awaited sites for T-tubule initiation and elongation and provides the basis to better understand T-tubule biogenesis in healthy skeletal muscle and its defect in the pathophysiology of caveolinopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cav3 caveolae form nanoscale rings in differentiated myotubes</title><p>Nascent T-tubules initially have a longitudinal orientation during in vitro differentiation, and progressively gain a transversal orientation reflecting extensive differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flucher et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takekura et al., 2001</xref>). To study the formation of T-tubules during myogenic differentiation, we embedded primary murine myotubes in two layers of an extracellular matrix hydrogel (Matrigel) to avoid detachment by spontaneous contractions and supplemented the differentiation medium with agrin to promote the progression of myotube maturation toward contracting myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falcone et al., 2014</xref>). When myotubes produced from murine primary myoblasts were differentiated for 10 days, the characteristic labeling of mature triads in double transverse rows of dots was clearly observed while at 5 days, DHPR and RyR1 still presented a longitudinal distribution in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To visualize the interplay between caveolae and nascent T-tubules at the surface of well-differentiated myotubes, we unroofed myotubes using ultrasounds to access the inner side of the plasma membrane for both light and electron microscopy analyses. Unroofing allowed us to remove the intracellular structures whose labeling could hinder identification of structures at the plasma membrane and to avoid permeabilization with detergents. At the light microscopy level, tagging Cav3 with GFP produced a very characteristic pattern on unroofed myotubes with numerous circular or crescent-shaped structures from which tubules emanated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, insets 1–5). These structures were observed on both unroofed human myotubes expressing constitutively Cav3<sup>GFP</sup> and unroofed primary mouse myotubes labeled with antibodies against Cav3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The diameter of these rings from either human myotubes expressing Cav3<sup>GFP</sup> or murine myotubes labeled with antibodies against Cav3 was the same, 652±174 nm and 637±183 nm, respectively. To compare the localization of an SR marker with respect to Cav3, we labeled both Cav3 and the intracellular RyR1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel. The two proteins were partially colocalized but marked two clearly distinct networks. RyR1-labeled structures were often surrounded by or in close proximity to Cav3 rings (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We next produced platinum replicas of unroofed human and mouse primary myotubes for electron microscopy (EM) analysis. At the ultrastructural level, in addition to the numerous individual caveolae decorating the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, we confirmed the presence of circular assemblies composed of bona fide caveolae in human myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). These ‘caveolae rings’ were composed of assembled caveolae forming a circle. We also found instances of rings where caveolae would accumulate at one pole of the circle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and caveolae rings that were intertwined with cortical SR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The central part of the ring contained globular membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, orange circles). We observed similar caveolae rings in mouse primary myotubes using both PREM and conventional thin-section EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, F-G). From measurements on electron micrographs, we determined an average diameter for these rings of 573 nm in human myotubes and 546 nm in murine primary myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We counted 16.9 and 16.1 caveolae per ring on average in human and mouse myotubes respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Caveolae from primary mouse myotubes were significantly smaller than their human counterparts (64 <italic>vs</italic> 85.4 nm, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). In order to simultaneously visualize the ultrastructure of myotubes and the localization of proteins of interest, we developed a correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) assay combining observation of Cav3<sup>GFP</sup> by super-resolution fluorescent microscopy with the ultrastructure of platinum replicas observed by electron microscopy. Using this CLEM approach, we were able to show that the circular Cav3 assemblies seen at the light microscopy level correspond to rings formed by caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, K-M).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cav3-positive caveolae form nanoscale rings in differentiated myotubes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Super-resolution images of a human myotube expressing Cav3<sup>GFP</sup> and labelled with antibodies against RyR1 (red).

We compared the localization of Bin1 with the localization of the triad protein marker RyR1 and observed Bin1 labeling on a network of predominantly longitudinal T-tubules and, as expected, a partial colocalization of these tubules with RyR1-positive SR membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In order to label lipids and trace nascent T-tubules without relying on a protein marker, we used the MemBright fluorescent lipid probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collot et al., 2019</xref>). This cell-impermeable probe renders biological membranes fluorescent and allows the visualization of the intracellular tubular network emanating from the plasma membrane. We incubated myotubes with MemBright and acquired optical stacks (0.1–0.3 µm step) through the entire myotube with a spinning-disk confocal microscope equipped with a structured illumination module allowing sub-diffraction light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). After a 10 min incubation on live myotubes, the probe had diffused in the tubule in the depth of the fiber and labeled a tubular membrane system, continuous with the plasmalemma. Interestingly, the dye labeled circular structures on both the dorsal and ventral surface of myotubes, presenting an average diameter of 667±286 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Analysis of the whole fiber volume confirmed that these tubules were more abundant near the surface although a few tubes penetrated deep into the core of the muscle cell producing numerous bifurcations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). This tubular system was identical to the one described in previous attempts to label the T-tubule system in cultured cells and muscle fibers with DiIC<sub>16</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flucher et al., 1993</xref>).

To test this, we expressed the GFP-tagged version of the α1s-subunit of the DHPR using a lentivirus vector that we transduced prior to differentiating the myoblasts into myotubes. In agreement with previous work linking DHPR and Cav3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couchoux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weiss et al., 2008</xref>) we showed co-localization of both the DHPRs α1s-subunit and Cav3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). CLEM analysis confirmed that the α1s-subunit of the DHPR accumulated in regions of the plasma membrane enriched in Cav3-positive circular caveolae regions from which tubules appear. It is noteworthy that while both DHPR and Cav3 co-localized on nascent tubules, the labeling was only present on portions of the tubule containing the caveolae, suggesting a possible retention of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in caveolar regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The abundance of Cav3-positive circular structures during critical steps of T-tubule formation suggested a possible contribution of caveolae rings to their biogenesis. By unroofing the myotubes, we noticed that tubules with a characteristic beaded protein coat similar to the caveolar coat emerged from caveolae rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>).

PREM allowed us to directly visualize the membrane remodeling effect of recombinant Bin1 at 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>). It has been described that proteins of the Amphiphysin family, at high protein concentration (i.e. ≥1 μM), can deform membranes by forming scaffold-like structures, as compared to lower protein concentrations where they mainly act as curvature sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sorre et al., 2012</xref>). Along this line, we observed that at 1 μM, recombinant Bin1 assembled into circular structures from which tubules emerged radially. These structures, firmly bound to the lipid bilayer, resembled those formed on the surface of cultured myotubes indicating that Bin1 is able to spontaneously form these scaffolds on flat membranes both in vitro an<italic>d</italic> in cellulo. Using the same in vitro assay combined to sub-diffraction light microscopy, we analyzed recombinant Bin1 self-assembly dynamics on SLBs. We showed that Bin1 forms stable ring-like structures and tubules that persist over several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and kymographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, we observed that Bin1 overexpression produced both pearled tubes with caveolar material and assemblies that were similar as those observed on SLBs with recombinant Bin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The average diameter of Bin1 assemblies in vitro and in cellulo was 378±176 nm and 746±223 nm, respectively. The average length of the longest tube emanating from the central ring was 1356 nm in vitro and 2200 nm in cellulo while the average length of the smaller tubules emanating from the central ring was 420 nm in vitro and 590 nm in cellulo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Bin1 forms Cav3-positive circular and tubular structures connected to the surface</title><p>These observations led us to analyze caveolae and Cav3 nanoscale organization at the sarcolemma of human and mouse myotubes expressing Bin1<sup>GFP</sup> by CLEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

We observed instances of deformed rings with supernumerary caveolae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). A unique feature of patient myotubes was the production of beaded tubes composed of 5–10 concatenated caveolae not associated with a ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). These bead-like structures extended from the surface only a couple hundred nanometers inside the muscle fiber suggesting that caveolae have either an increased propensity to fuse with each other or a decreased ability to recruit Bin1 for subsequent tubulation. Quantification of caveolae rings from R26Q patient myotubes showed significantly less caveolae rings at the surface of patient myotubes (in agreement with a decreased Cav3 surface expression) and an increase in their average diameter compared to control myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>). We attempted to rescue this phenotype by re-expressing Cav3. We transduced patient myoblasts with a lentivirus expressing full length Cav3 and differentiated them into myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–G</xref>). Cav3 re-expression rescued caveolae ring density while reducing the average diameter to control values.

The complexity of the structures involved, their entanglement with the contractile apparatus, but also the lack of tools to visualize nanoscale assemblies have however, limited our understanding of T-tubule biogenesis. Our discovery that caveolae assemble into higher order, 600 nm on average, ring-like structures in mouse and human muscle cells suggests that caveolae may be involved in the formation of membrane platforms on the surface of muscle cells that could participate in T-tubule biogenesis.</p><p>To understand the mechanism of T-tubule formation during muscle cell differentiation, we focused on Bin1, both as a marker for T-tubules but also as a membrane sensing and deforming protein through its phosphoinositide-binding (PI) and BAR domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). In agreement with previous reports, overexpressing Bin1 induced formation of a dense network of membrane tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicot et al., 2007</xref>). The use of the MemBright fluorescent probe revealed that these tubes are in direct connection with the external environment. From the outside, we observed numerous 25–40 nm holes formed by the invagination of caveolae, which adopt a ring-like structure. While overexpression of Bin1<sup>GFP</sup> causes excessive membrane tubulation, Cav3 knock-down lead to a drastic reduction of Bin1-induced tubes, confirming that Cav3-positive caveolae are required for efficient membrane tubulation in mouse and human myotubes. Our results show that Bin1 forms a circular scaffold, which subsequently recruits caveolae and become tubulation platforms from which multiple tubules can emanate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We propose that there is a physiological mechanism in muscle cells that allows the pre-formation of the structures on which the recruitment of caveolae and their subsequent fusion into a tubule will take place. This suggests that Bin1 could directly bind to surface caveolae in order to tubulate the membrane. In agreement, it was recently shown that cavin 4 directly interacts with Bin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lo et al., 2021</xref>). We thus postulate that caveolae are recruited on circular Bin1 scaffolds and that these structures grow as additional caveolae are recruited. The platform formed by Bin1, enriched in specific lipids such as phospholipids, cholesterol and sphingolipids, would preferentially recruit Cav3-positive caveolae. Our correlative approach combining PREM to immunofluorescent labeling allowed us to show the presence of Bin1 on caveolae rings as well as Bin1-labeled tubules emanating from rings. CLEM analysis showed that while rings present the characteristic caveolar coat formed by caveolins and cavins at their rim, the omega-shape of caveolae is often lost, suggesting that caveolae are merging with the structure while newly recruited caveolae still accumulate at one of the rings poles. Both light microscopy and EM analyses showed that the tubular elongations can be initiated at several positions on the ring. This is also corroborated by Bin-GFP distribution when overexpressed in myotubes. Time-lapse imaging of the ring dynamics as well as in vitro experiments with recombinant Bin1 demonstrate that multiple tubes can emanate from a single ring. Bin1 BAR domain is responsible for membrane bending and thus for tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2002</xref>), as we showed by overexpression in cellulo and in vitro. We propose that tubulation at the start of caveolae rings is induced by Bin1, and one of the accessory proteins present on caveolae might be required to recruit Bin1 to these T-tubule nucleation sites. More recently, it was shown that cavin 4 participates in T-tubule formation by recruiting Bin1 to caveolae. A direct interaction of the proline-rich domain (PRD) of cavin 4 with the SH3 binding domain of Bin1 located at its C-terminus was shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lo et al., 2021</xref>). It was proposed that cavin 4 would have a role in T-tubule membrane remodeling during early development by recycling caveolae from the T-tubule membrane. Interestingly, cavin 4 deletion has been shown to result in formation of pearled tubules. Thus, Bin1 could be recruited at caveolae through a direct protein-protein interaction and newly formed rings could attract additional caveolae.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of Bin1 and Cav3-mediated ring formation and tubulation.</title><p>(1) Bin1 molecules polymerize into ring-like structures and recruit Cav3-positive caveolae.

In cells, Bin1 formed pearled rings from which tubes emanated, and in in vitro reconstituted lipid bilayers, recombinant Bin1 assembled in very similar ring-like structures that were tightly bound to the substrate. The structures formed by Bin1 resemble the circular structures formed by another BAR domain protein, FCHo2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El Alaoui et al., 2022</xref>) that were shown to partition at the edge of clathrin-coated pits and flat lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sochacki et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that the muscle-specific isoform of Bin1 (full length) has gained the capacity to extend tubules from these rings and this process is facilitated in the presence of Cav3-positive caveolae.</p><p>We also found that caveolae rings are entangled with cortical SR cisternae containing RyR1. We initially thought that caveolae rings might have a role in the formation of peripheral coupling sites at the plasma membrane as E-C coupling proteins are predominantly located at the cell periphery during early steps of myotube differentiation. However, electron micrographs in the literature do not show accumulation of caveolae at peripheral coupling sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franzini-Armstrong and Kish, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Protasi et al., 1997</xref>). It is thus more likely that contacts between SR cisternae and caveolae rings correspond to the initial sites of T-tubule invagination. The formation of junctions between nascent T-tubules with the SR is on the smooth part of the tubule without any caveolar material. The caveolar coat is still present on the surface of the tubules at the onset of tubulation, but as the immature T-tubules further protrude into the cytoplasm, regions of the tubes appear devoid of caveolae buds. This disappearance coincides with formation of SR and T-tubule junctions when the tubule invaginates deeper into the myotube. We propose that disassembly of caveolar proteins could free the tubule membrane allowing the subsequent formation of junctions with SR proteins such as RyR1. Thus, in agreement with observations from zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lo et al., 2021</xref>), our results support the notion that part of the caveolar material must be removed from the tubule and/or diffuse along the tubule membrane for functional junctions to form.</p><p>Lastly, our analysis of the link between caveolae rings and tubulation by Bin1 in cells from patients with <italic>CAV3</italic> mutations supports a role for Cav3-positive caveolae in the formation of a functional E-C coupling system. While caveolinopathy patients form overall normal triads, their muscles present aggregation of Cav3 at the Golgi apparatus leading to a drastic decrease in the amount of Cav3 at the plasma membrane as well as defects in T-tubule morphology which may explain in part the occurrence of myalgias and exercise intolerance characteristic of these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gazzerro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Minetti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brauers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sotgia et al., 2003</xref>). However, in agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dewulf et al., 2019</xref>), our PREM analysis of patient myotubes showed that some caveolae are still present at the plasma membrane albeit with an altered ultrastructure suggesting that some Cav3 or Cav1 oligomers do reach the sarcolemma despite their intracellular retention. Importantly, caveolae ring formation as well as tubulation by Bin1 were defective in patient myotubes. Presumably, the mixed Cav3 population (wild type and mutant) in caveolae could prevent enrichment of DHPR and reduce Bin1 tubulation. In agreement, it was shown that myotubes from caveolinopathy patients present a reduction in both depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ullrich et al., 2011</xref>) with disarrays in the colocalization of the DHPR and RyR1, thereby reducing the efficiency of excitation-contraction coupling. Alternatively, mutated Cav3 may alter caveolae fusion with Bin1 rings and thus alter tube initiation or might not recycle efficiently from the nascent T-tubule and thereby inhibit the formation of SR-T-tubule junctions. Importantly, these mechanisms could also contribute to biogenesis of T-tubules in the heart as Cav3, cavin 1 and cavin 4 mutations lead to cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rajab et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vatta et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Overall, we described caveolae rings, induced by recruitment of caveolae on circular Bin1 scaffolds at the plasma membrane, as essential structures for the initiation of T-tubule formation. We show that Cav3 deficiency leads to defects in caveolae ring formation as well as defects in Bin1 tubulation. Our results support a model where disassembly of caveolar proteins is required for establishment of triads and formation of the molecular complex responsible for excitation-contraction coupling. Thus, our discovery of caveolae rings could be the missing link for the initial steps of T-tubule formation and provides the basis for a precise characterization of T-tubule biogenesis in healthy skeletal muscle and in the pathophysiology of caveolinopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Primary antibodies are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Dried samples were then rotary shadowed with 2 nm of platinum and 4-6 nm of carbon using the ACE600 (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Areas of interest from the resulting platinum replicas were separated from glass with 5% hydrofluoric acid and deposited on carbon-coated EM grids (200 mesh formvar/carbon, LFG Distribution, France). Images were processed in Adobe Photoshop to adjust brightness and contrast, and unroofed PMs are presented in inverted contrast. Super-resolution microscopy and electron microscopy images were overlaid using Adobe Photoshop software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Anaglyphs and Tomograms</title><p>Anaglyphs were made by converting the –10° tilt image to red and the +10° tilt image to cyan (blue/green), layering them on top of each other using the screen blending mode in Adobe Photoshop, and aligning them to each other. Tomograms were made by collecting images at the tilt angles up to ±25° relative to the plane of the sample with 5° increments. Images were aligned by layering them on top of each other in Adobe Photoshop. For PREM tomograms, the sample in the TEM holder was tilted with an angle of ±20° and an image was taken every 5°. The brightness and contrast of the images were adjusted in Adobe Photoshop and the images were presented in reverse contrast. Movies were made by combining LM, PREM images produced by increasing magnifications of the same myotube, and tomograms of the highest magnification region using Adobe Photoshop and FIJI. For muscle biopsy tomograms, semi-thin sections (200 nm) were contrasted with uranyl acetate (5 min) and lead citrate (5 min); the images were acquired with Radius software and the TEM holder was tilted with an angle of ±60° and an image was taken every 2°; the alignment and reconstruction of the tilted series were carried out with the TomoJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Messaoudii et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sorzano et al., 2020</xref>) of ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Graphs and statistical analyses were performed with Excel and GraphPad Prism v. 6.00 software.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Benjamin L Prosser as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Ibrahim (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have a generally enthusiastic consensus about the potential impact of the work and its high significance to the field of striated muscle biology, barring appropriate revisions.</p><p>We recommend that the authors focus on the following essential revisions:</p><p>1) More rigorous quantification of imaging-based observations, with specific concerns outlined below.</p><p>2) Strengthening the section on pathological implications of Cav3 variants, which currently is insufficiently supported. This could include more rigorous validation of disease phenotypes and/or rescue experiments with the restoration of Cav3 levels and tubule morphology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The major issue that reduces the strength of several conclusions throughout the manuscript is the lack of quantification or appropriate controls for several imaging-based observations. Additional quantification throughout would add important context regarding the frequency, consistency, and effect size of key observations, and how they change with different molecular manipulations (such as Bin1 overexpression) or pathological variants. While the authors may have a very trained eye for detecting structural differences via EM, they cannot assume a broad readership will, and representative images are insufficient to support robust conclusions. The following 5 points are all related to this theme:</p><p>1. The conclusion that Bin1GFP induced the formation of rings and tubules while the removal of exon 11 prevented tubule formation is insufficiently supported. Some quantification of ring and tubule prevalence should be provided.</p><p>2. For figure 7A-B, necks of caveolae are seen on the extracellular surface of intact cells overexpressing Bin1, but no similar EM of a non-Bin1 overexpressing cell or quantification is presented to show such structures do not exist or exist at lower frequency in the absence of Bin1 (or with Bin1exon11 mutant).</p><p>3. For Figure 8A-C, it is claimed that the EM images show altered structure and spatial organization of caveolae rings with rare supernumerary caveolae in R26Q variants. This is not clear nor particularly interpretable without some sort of quantification of these morphological changes and their occurrence. It is not clear whether the reduction in Cav3 protein results in altered rings, or simply fewer rings, and this is an important distinction for understanding pathomechanisms.</p><p>4. For Figure 8H-K, there must also be some quantification of the observed triad abnormalities, and again a comparison to control samples, to have this be a meaningful contribution. Taken together with the prior point, this limits any insight into pathology, and the claim in discussion (line 436) that caveolae ring formation is defective in patient myotubes is insufficiently supported.</p><p>5. The addition of actin filaments in the model – particularly in the early stages of ring formation- seems speculative and potentially misleading. The authors' in vitro data in lipid bilayers (that presumably lack actin filaments) show that actin is dispensable for ring formation and even early tube formation, and actin is not mentioned in the main text. I would advise removing it from the cartoon.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is very interesting and the data are compelling. I do however have some additional comments below for the authors' consideration.</p><p>The authors should clarify the statistics used. They state that 'n' is the number of independent biological replicates, but it is not always clear what the biological replicate is. For example, in Figure 1B is 'n' the ring or the myotube, in Fig1J is it the caveolae or the experimental repeat (which I think it should be)? It would be useful for this clarity throughout.</p><p>In Figure 5G do the conditions or the Bin1 isoform vary between the upper and lower panels? Can this be added to the legend? It is not quite clear to me what is being shown in Figure 6E.</p><p>The legend for Figure 6B-E is identical to 6F – could they be combined to simplify? Similarly for Figures6G and H?</p><p>Lines 288-289 suggest BIN1 is not always localised to caveolae but the authors might consider if it would be more convincing for the data cited to include cav3 labelling.</p><p>In Fig7A are the authors suggesting the openings are caveolae or the newly formed t-tubule openings which allow entry of the MemBright to the tubule? Please clarify.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I commend the authors on an innovative and interesting investigation. I have made several suggestions in the section available for public view which I would encourage the authors to consider.</p><p>1. The pathological correlation is potentially of significant interest but is underdeveloped. In particular, I think the study would greatly benefit from a rigorous &quot;rescue&quot; experiment employing either experimentally manipulated murine or human skeletal muscle – for example with detubulation, genetic manipulation, or the myopathic samples you have. These seem like the ideal platform to test your putative mechanism to &quot;regrow&quot; t-tubules. These may get at the relative contribution of a Cav3-BIN1 mechanism versus other mechanisms active during early biogenesis. Is the CAV3-BIN 1 mechanism sufficient to rescue t-tubule pathology?</p><p>2. You should consider a simple screening western blot to map at least some of the other t-tubule regulating processes in your pathological and experimentally manipulated samples. Are JPH, Telethonin, and others constant? This may help understand whether there is any interplay between these pathways.</p><p>3. You mention in passing the observation of &quot;polarized&quot; caveolae rings – which are dense in one area – what is their significance? Have you observed a different fate for them compared to more symmetric rings?</p><p>4. What effect does unroofing have on membrane structure? Are you able to demonstrate that other ultrastructural features are unchanged?</p><p>5. You show that exon 11 is critical for tubule formation but not ring formation. Have you examined whether exon 11 alone is capable of ring formation, even in your supported lipid bilayer model? In an analogous fashion in heart, it was recently shown that JPH2- NT is capable of mediating most t-tubule regulating functions of Junctophilin. This may have consequences later on if these are conceived as gene therapies.</p><p>6. Your model scheme could include, at least in the legend, the dependence of tubule formation on exon 11.</p><p>7. You should contextualize your finding of exon 11 dependent tubule formation in the discussion. Indeed, the discussion does not adequately frame your findings in the context of either (i) what is already known about BIN 1 function and also (ii) how your findings fit into our overall understanding of multi-protein biogenesis of t-tubules. You should also mention possible translational relevance since you use a disease model.</p><p>8. A rescue experiment would involve combined or staged BIN1 and Cav3 overexpression with assays for t-tubule structure and function. This would determine whether the proposed mechanism is sufficient for t-tubule biogenesis. Likewise, more granular information on the typical temporospatial details of Cav3-BIN1 mediated tubulation is needed to fully understand their role in t-tubule biogenesis. Another understudied element is how t-tubule orientation is governed – as the authors point out immature tubules are generally oriented longitudinally. The live cell experiments shown may have promise in elucidating these features. Did you measure BIN1 protein expression in the experiments in Figures 7 and 8?</p><p>9. How does longitudinalization figure into your pathway in Figure 9? At what stage does this occur?</p><p>10. Your abstract mentions patients with BIN1 mutations but to my understanding, you did not include such patients, only those with Cav3 mutations.</p><p>11. Figure 8 – did you quantify the disordered ring structure in patient samples? You describe qualitatively but have you tried to objectively measure? This would support your statement on lines 326 and 327.</p><p>12. In your discussion you may consider commenting on the relevance to cardiac muscle.</p><p>13. Figure 9 illustration quality is poor, consider revising.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84139.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The major issue that reduces the strength of several conclusions throughout the manuscript is the lack of quantification or appropriate controls for several imaging-based observations.

We performed new experiments to quantify the tubule and ring density between myotubes expressing the Bin1 isoform without exon11 (-ex11) and with exon 11 (+ex11). These experiments have now been added in a new Figure 5—figure supplement 1 which shows that both Bin1 isoforms are capable of producing rings but only isoform containing exon11 produces significant number of tubules. In addition, to strengthen the effect of Cav3 mutations on tubule density we quantified the ring and tubule density upon expression of Bin1+ex11 in myotubes from a patient with the R26Q mutation. These experiments have now been included in a new Figure 8 panel F, G and I and the text has been amended at lines 252-254.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As expected, we have only found very few instances, one is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, but they are too rare to quantify as the criteria to decide whether it is a ring from the outside is subjective and therefore difficult to quantify.

In order to substantiate our morphological PREM data, we have now quantified the caveolae ring diameter and density formed at the surface of patient myotubes. We also quantified the density of tubules present in patient myotubes expressing Bin1 compared to con-trol myotubes. These results have been included in Figure 8 panel F, G and I. We found that there are significantly less caveolae rings at the surface of patient myotubes (in agreement with a de-creased Cav3 surface expression) and their average diameter is increased compared to control myotubes. Following reviewer #3’s advice, we successfully rescued this phenotype by producing a patient myotube line re-expressing full-length Cav3. We were able to rescue the ring density while reducing the average diameter to control values. These results have now been added in a new Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We have now included an EM image representing a control triad. However, both T-tubule swelling and T-tubule bifurcations are rare events in caveolinopathy patients and cannot be quantified easily for any meaningful point to emerge.

Indeed, we often observe an accumulation of caveolae on the ring which are dense in one area. Our time-lapse experiments with Cav3-GFP show a very bright spot prior to seeing a tubule extend from the ring suggesting that in order to grow a tubule, caveolae need to accumulate at a specific site on the ring perimeter. We have now included at lines 231-233 in the text to state that “Interestingly, Cav3 signal increased at the site from which the tubule emanated (yellow arrows in Figure 4, A and B) suggesting that the polarized accumulation of caveolae could precede tubulation” and also added yellow arrows in Figure 4 to point out the Cav3 accumulation prior to the tubule emanation.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse imaging of Cav3/Bin1 tubules extending from rings.</title><p>Gallery of consecutive frames from the time-lapse sequences of Cav3GFP expressing myotubes from figure 4 and movies 5 and 6.

Depending on the degree of unroofing some cells will be completely opened and others less. As with other EM techniques, unroofing, fixation, subsequent drying and substituting can all produce artefacts. However, we carefully check on our replicas that other ultra-structural features including the membrane itself, ER tubules, clathrin-coated pits and plaques, caveolae, actin filaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments are presenting a normal ultra-structural morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. You show that exon 11 is critical for tubule formation but not ring formation. Have you examined whether exon 11 alone is capable of ring formation, even in your supported lipid bilayer model? In an analogous fashion in heart, it was recently shown that JPH2- NT is capable of mediating most t-tubule regulating functions of Junctophilin. This may have consequences later on if these are conceived as gene therapies.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results show that exon 11 is not required for ring formation as both Bin1 isoforms form them. In our experiments exon11 is important for tubule formation and elongation from the rings. It would be interesting in future experiments to test the behavior of exon 11 alone in an in vitro setting on supported lipid bilayers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Your model scheme could include, at least in the legend, the dependence of tubule formation on exon 11.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point raised by reviewer 3 and have now amended our cartoon to show the dependence of tubule formation on exon 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. You should contextualize your finding of exon 11 dependent tubule formation in the discussion. Indeed, the discussion does not adequately frame your findings in the context of either (i) what is already known about BIN 1 function and also (ii) how your findings fit into our overall understanding of multi-protein biogenesis of t-tubules. You should also mention possible translational relevance since you use a disease model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer and this comment was also raised by reviewer#1. We have now quantified the effect of +/- exon11 on ring density and tubule density. We show that exon11 is not required for ring formation as both Bin1 isoforms are capable of forming them at the myotube surface while only Bin1+ex11 is capable of tubulating the membrane. These results have indeed important translational implications as they identify an important defect that could serve as a read-out to develop therapies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. A rescue experiment would involve combined or staged BIN1 and Cav3 overexpression with assays for t-tubule structure and function. This would determine whether the proposed mechanism is sufficient for t-tubule biogenesis. Likewise, more granular information on the typical temporospatial details of Cav3-BIN1 mediated tubulation is needed to fully understand their role in t-tubule biogenesis. Another understudied element is how t-tubule orientation is governed – as the authors point out immature tubules are generally oriented longitudinally. The live cell experiments shown may have promise in elucidating these features. Did you measure BIN1 protein expression in the experiments in Figures 7 and 8?</p></disp-quote><p>To follow the reviewer’s recommendation, we included in the revised manuscript a rescue experiment by Cav3 overexpression and several of our movies specify the spatio-temporal details of T-tubule formation. We agree with reviewer #3 that understanding T-tubule orientation is a particularly relevant question. Indeed, time-lapse imaging shows that T-tubules very often extend in the longitudinal direction. Although the experiments aiming at understanding how is the tubule oriented during its formation extends the purpose of this work. We have now performed Western blot analysis of Bin1 protein levels in control vs caveolinopathy patient myotubes (two patients with the R26Q mutation). These results show no change in Bin1 expression and are included in a new Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. How does longitudinalization figure into your pathway in Figure 9? At what stage does this occur?</p></disp-quote><p>It has been systematically reported in the literature that during development and in vitro, T-tubules grow longitudinally until post-natal days 6 to 10 in mice where tubules adopt a transversal orientation (Franzini-Armstrong C. 1991. <italic>Dev Biol)</italic>. We also observe this, and we have hypothesized that the actin stress fibers or cortical microtubules might contribute to this longitudinal extension. When the sarcomeric apparatus has matured enough, after birth and formation of the NMJ is established, a new wave of transversal tubes might extend to form the adult T-system. However, this particular aspect of T-tubule formation and maturation is not addressed by this work focused on initial formation steps.</p><p>Franzini-Armstrong C.

PMID: 1864461.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Your abstract mentions patients with BIN1 mutations but to my understanding, you did not include such patients, only those with Cav3 mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer #3. We have now added the word &quot; caused by Cav3 or Bin1 dysfunction&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Figure 8 – did you quantify the disordered ring structure in patient samples? You describe qualitatively but have you tried to objectively measure? This would support your statement on lines 326 and 327.</p></disp-quote><p>We now included the quantification of ring density and diameter in control vs patient myotubes. We observed that in patient myotubes, there is a significant decrease in ring density, associated with the reduced Cav3 levels at the surface. We also found that in agreement with our PREM data, the average diameter is increased in caveolinopathy patient cells. By rescuing Cav3 expression in the patient myotubes, we rescued the density and reduced the average ring diameter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. In your discussion you may consider commenting on the relevance to cardiac muscle.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to add this point: &quot;Importantly, these mechanisms could also contribute to biogenesis of T-tubules in the heart as Cav3, cavin 1 and cavin 4 mutations lead to cardiomyopathies (Rajab et al., 2010; Rodriguez et al., 2011; Vatta et al., 2006).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Figure 9 illustration quality is poor, consider revising.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now improved Figure 9 cartoon by removing actin filaments as suggested by reviewer #1, and have included additional text and color to describe the difference between Bin1 with or without exon 11 in neither ring or tubule formation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
