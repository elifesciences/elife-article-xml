To investigate the mechanism of oncogenic tolerance, we induced Hras<sup>G12V</sup> in single murine epidermal cells and followed them long term. We observed that Hras<sup>G12V</sup> promotes an early and transient clonal expansion driven by increased progenitor renewal that is replaced with an increase in progenitor differentiation leading to reduced growth. We attribute this dynamic effect to emergence of two populations within oncogenic clones: renewing progenitors along the edge and differentiating ones within the central core. As clone expansion is accompanied by progressive enlargement of the core and diminishment of the edge compartment, the intraclonal competition between the two populations results in stabilized oncogenic growth. To identify the molecular mechanism of Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-driven differentiation, we screened known Ras-effector in vivo and identified Rassf5 as a novel regulator of progenitor fate choice that is necessary and sufficient for oncogene-specific differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell fate choice</kwd><kwd>oncogene tolerance</kwd><kwd>skin epithelium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR070780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beronja</surname><given-names>Slobodan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cell and Molecular Biology Training Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sandoval</surname><given-names>Madeline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA015704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beronja</surname><given-names>Slobodan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Skin epithelium can tolerate oncogene-expressing clones through a novel cellular mechanism of inter-clonal competition between renewing progenitors along the clone's edge and differentiating progenitors within the clone's core.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult human skin harbors potent oncogenic mutations without any functional or morphological consequences. A striking feature of this surprising tolerance is that mutant clones that persist in the tissue are both limited and uniform in size, irrespective of a mutation’s mitogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Martincorena et al., 2015</xref>). In murine skin, gain-of-function mutant p53 clones grow extensively in naive epidermis, yet appear growth-inhibited when induced in a tissue premutagenized via acute exposure to UV. This suggests that the UV radiation introduced mutations that were able to compete with expanding p53 clones, limiting their size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Murai et al., 2018</xref>). This model of interclone growth inhibition may contribute to epithelial homeostasis in aged tissues, which contain a multitude of established mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowling et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Higa and DeGregori, 2019</xref>).</p><p>There is also evidence that growth of oncogenic clones can be ameliorated in the naive epidermis. Activating mutation in β-catenin leads to ectopic hair follicle growths, which regress and are permanently eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Epidermal activation of Pik3ca, the most commonly mutated oncogene in epithelial cancer, induces clones which are more proliferative than wild type (WT). However, they too are lost as the oncogenic progenitors are removed from the tissue due to an inability to self-renew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ying et al., 2018</xref>). Because the oncogenic clones in these studies are eliminated, neither addresses how a single oncogenic clone may be tolerated to persist in the tissue long term. This is critical as the full complement of mutations in the aged epidermis likely arose through step-wise accumulation of discrete oncogenic mutations throughout the life of the tissue.</p><p>To answer this question, we use mouse skin and single-cell activation of oncogenic Hras (Hras<sup>G12V</sup>) which we previously demonstrated results in formation of persistent clones within the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beronja et al., 2013</xref>). We follow Hras<sup>G12V</sup> single cells as they grow into stable clones and employ a novel cell fate identification (CFI) assay which allows us to discern temporal and spatial influences on progenitor cell renewal and differentiation. We demonstrate that expanding Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones develop intraclonal heterogeneity that impacts progenitor cell fate choice in a manner that restricts their growth yet ensures their persistence and does not depend on additional mutations or interclonal competition. To identify the mechanism, we conducted a genetic screen of Ras effectors and identify Rassf5 as a novel candidate regulator of progenitor cell fate choice. Lastly, using gain-/loss-of-function studies in vivo we demonstrate that Rassf5 is necessary and sufficient for progenitor cell differentiation and inhibition of Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-induced growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of activated Hras<sup>G12V</sup> promotes progenitor cell renewal in adult skin epithelium</title><p>In order to explore the immediate effect of single-cell activation of a potent oncogene on progenitor cell fate, we employed an <italic>Hras<sup>lox-WT-stop-lox-G12V</sup></italic> (<italic>Hras<sup>ll-G12V</sup></italic>); <italic>Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> (<italic>R26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic>) mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>). We transduced the epidermis of mid-gestation embryos, using ultrasound-guided intraamniotic injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beronja et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beronja et al., 2010</xref>), with lentivirus containing inducible Cre-recombinase (LV-CreER) at clonal density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Together, this model allowed for: (i) Tamoxifen-induced recombination in the adult epidermis, at a dose determined to result in sporadic single-cell activation events; (ii) expression of an oncogenic form of Hras (Hras<sup>G12V</sup>) from its endogenous promoter, ensuring both physiological mRNA/protein levels and regulatory control; and (iii) stable labeling of activated cells by Cre-mediated replacement of membrane-associated (m) Tomato fluorescent protein with mGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We induced recombination at postnatal day 19 (P19) and imaged tissues 48 hr later, allowing sufficient time for individual progenitor cells to divide and for the resulting two daughter cells to commit to either basal progenitor or suprabasal differentiated cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ying et al., 2018</xref>).

In contrast, we observed a striking change in progenitor division type following expression of Hras<sup>G12V</sup>, with a significant increase in symmetric renewal (48%) and a significant decrease in symmetric differentiation (10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We used the observed frequency of cell division types in control and oncogene-expressing epidermis to calculate the rate of progenitor renewal, which measures the proportion of new daughter cells that maintain progenitor potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ying et al., 2018</xref>). Epidermal progenitors in the control tissue had a renewal rate of ~0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Such a rate is expected to maintain a stable population of basal progenitors long term and ensure neutral tissue growth. Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-expressing progenitors showed higher renewal rate of 0.69, which implies that oncogenic Hras, unlike single-cell expression of activated Pik3ca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ying et al., 2018</xref>), promotes progenitor cell renewal. It also suggests that in contrast to loss of cellular fitness we observed in oncogenic Pik3ca epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ying et al., 2018</xref>), Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-expressing progenitors could support expansion and long-term maintenance of oncogenic clones. We tested the long-term persistence of oncogenic clones by quantifying the size of Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones at 24 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). At this point, Hras clones were significantly larger that WT clones but were smaller than anticipated based on the high renewal rate (0.69) at clone initiation. We first investigated apoptosis or senescence as a means to control clone growth but neither were significantly different between WT and oncogene expressing epidermis, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This suggests that additional mechanisms of growth suppression are at play to curtail the expansion of Hras<sup>G12V</sup> progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Development of an assay for quantification of progenitor cell fates in vivo</title><p>Next, we set to determine if high proliferation and renewal rates were sustained in Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones over time. While proliferation could be measured using standard approaches, a simple and broadly accessible assay that can directly score progenitor cell fate choice was lacking. We recently employed an EdU/BrdU differentiation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ying et al., 2018</xref>) that allowed us to analyze progenitor daughter cells as a population, and estimate tissue renewal rate based on their relative expression of differentiation marker Keratin 10 (K10). Here, we modified this approach to develop a CFI assay, which allows us to classify each progenitor cell division event as asymmetric, symmetric renewal, or differentiation. We first gave animals a pulse of EdU and 30 min later processed the tissue for standard confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed EdU<sup>+</sup> labeling of single cells throughout the tissue that was restricted to the progenitors in the K10<sup>-</sup> basal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We followed the EdU pulse with administration of BrdU 2 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This resulted in the appearance of sporadic EdU<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup> single cells and a population of EdU<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>-</sup> cells, in which ~ 15% of cells have already divided but not differentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By 24 hr all EdU<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>-</sup> cells were found as doublets and in both basal (K10<sup>-</sup>) and differentiated K10<sup>+</sup> suprabasal layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These EdU<sup>+</sup>-only cells represent the daughters of progenitor cells that have exited the S-phase within a defined period (0–2 hr), and have been given sufficient time to show their differentiation state. By keeping the epidermis intact through processing and immunofluorescence staining, we are able to image every EdU<sup>+</sup>-only doublet in tissue whole-mounts and assign daughter cell fates based on cellular morphology (cuboidal vs. flat) and location in the tissue (basal vs. suprabasal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cell fate identification (CFI) assay reveals dynamic changes in progenitor renewal in expanding Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of CFI assay.

We observed that oncogenic clones undergo more symmetric renewal initially, but by 8–10 weeks of growth the proportion of symmetric renewal divisions decreased and returned to rates observed in WT clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Early increase in symmetric renewal was accompanied by reduction in the rates of symmetric differentiation and asymmetric divisions, which also returned to WT levels by 8–10 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). From the observed frequency of cell division types, we calculated the rate of progenitor renewal. The WT progenitors maintained a renewal rate of ~0.5 throughout the duration of the study, consistent with a neutral growth potential of a homeostatic tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In contrast, the Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-expressing progenitors showed an increase in renewal rate to ~0.70–0.85 in the initial 8 weeks, but then fell to ~0.55 over the next several weeks as differentiating and asymmetric cell divisions increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>We also measured proliferation rates in control and Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones over the same period, and observed that while oncogene expressing cells had a higher rate of EdU incorporation than WT, the rates were largely stable over 24 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).

Indeed, this was confirmed through analysis of Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clone circularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and further implied that, as clones expand, their area increases at a greater rate than their circumference. This suggested that time-dependent increase in clone size may be accompanied by a change in its overall composition in respect to the ratio of ‘edge’ cells, found along the circumference of the clone and in contact with WT neighbors, to ‘inner’ cells, found in the center of the clone and in contact with other Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-expressing progenitors. To test this, we quantified the number of edge and inner cells in Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones and observed that while both populations enlarged in absolute terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), the relative abundance of inner cells increased from 14 to 45% and edge cells decreased from 86 to 55% over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Therefore, as Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones expand, their composition changes in a potentially profound way.</p><p>We hypothesized that the heterotypic (WT/Hras<sup>G12V</sup>) environment of the edge cells in Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones could influence them to behave differently than the homotypic (Hras<sup>G12V</sup>/Hras<sup>G12V</sup>) inner cells. Using CFI assay, we analyzed 10-week-old Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-clones and observed that although the rate of homeostatic asymmetric divisions was similar between edge and inner cells, they significantly differed in the ratio of growth regulating symmetric fate choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Although edge cells underwent significantly more symmetric renewing divisions, inner daughter cells more often chose differentiated cell fates. From observed division types, we extrapolated the renewal rate and established that edge cell population maintains progenitor renewal rate consistent with growth expansion (0.69) while inner population is below the 0.5 threshold required for stasis, and therefore in a state of progenitor loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>We did the same analysis in early- and late-stage WT clones and observed that while they too remain circular over time, their small size (~3 progenitor cells) prevents formation of distinct inner and edge cell compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). To approximate cell dynamics that may exist within a large lentivirus-transduced WT clone, we used multi-clonally derived fields of CreER-activated mGFP cells. We did not detect a significant change in division choices or the renewal rate in cells at the edge or the inner portion of the activated WT areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). We also analyzed the behavior of WT cells adjacent to late-stage Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones. We observed that these cells had a lower frequency of symmetric renewing divisions, as compared to WT cells not adjacent to Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). This change was reflected by a significantly lower renewal rate (0.41) compared to distant WT cells (0.50) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest a new model for how growth of oncogene-expressing cells becomes restricted to ensure normal function despite accumulation of cancer driving genes. According to it, a single Hras<sup>G12V</sup> cell initially undergoes a rapid expansion, but after several weeks, a shift in renewal driven by intraclone heterogeneity decreases the rate of clone expansion until a point of near homeostasis. Even though the inner core of the clone is pro-differentiation, the clone does not collapse because it is maintained by the pro-renewal edge. Moreover, this pro-renewal edge is further supported by the reduced fitness of clone-adjacent WT cells that increase their rate of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Our model also suggests the existence of a currently unknown molecular mechanism that regulates dynamic cell fate choice. Such a mechanism could explain how tissues can remain phenotypically normal while maintaining a high mutation burden throughout an individual’s life.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Functional screen identifies Hras effector Rassf5 as a mediator of cell fate choice</title><p>We have previously shown that developing epidermis is a powerful system to conduct large-scale genetic screens and identify physiological regulators of distinct cellular processes, including progenitor renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beronja et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ying et al., 2018</xref>).

We transduced Hras<sup>G12V</sup> epidermis with similar low titers of LV-Cre and LV-Cre-<italic>Rassf5</italic>-tdT, and readily observed numerous clones at E18.5. We noted a dramatic difference in their shape, with Rassf5-expressing clones appearing more triangular in cross-section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with either a significant loss of basal progenitors or expansion of the suprabasal differentiated cell compartment. Whole mount imaging further implied that Rassf5-expressing Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones were composed of fewer basal and relatively more suprabasal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We analyzed clone composition and observed that Rassf5 promotes significant reduction in basal cell numbers and significant increase in the suprabasal to basal surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). Together this suggests that Rassf5 is sufficient to promote progenitor cell differentiation in Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-expressing embryonic epidermis.</p><p>We next sought to investigate whether Rassf5 can also regulate progenitor renewal in adult epidermis. We first analyzed Hras<sup>G12V</sup> epidermal clones where Rassf5 was depleted with two independent shRNAs. Focusing on the difference in renewal rate between the edge and inner clone compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), we observed that depletion of Rassf5 in adult Hras<sup>G12V</sup> epidermis specifically suppressed progenitor differentiation of inner cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). As a result, the overall progenitor renewal rate was significantly elevated in Hras<sup>G12V</sup>/shRassf5 tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). We also measured rates of apoptosis and senescence in adult Hras<sup>G12V</sup>/shRassf5 epidermis and found neither to be significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). These observations suggest that Rassf5 is a negative regulator of progenitor renewal in the inner core of Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones in the adult epidermis. To test next for the sufficiency of Rassf5 in promoting increased differentiation in adult Hras<sup>G12V</sup> epidermis, we utilized a system to overexpress Rassf5 in Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-activated adult clones. We co-injected animals with a high-titer LV-TRE-<italic>Rassf5</italic>-tdT mixed with a low-titer LV-rtTA-T2A-CreER, thus generating a tissue with ubiquitous LV-TRE-<italic>Rassf5</italic>-tdT and sporadic LV-rtTA-T2A-CreER transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L,M</xref>). We induced Hras<sup>G12V</sup> expression in single cells via administration of Tamoxifen at P21, which was followed by Doxycycline-mediated activation of Rassf5-tdT expression in cells co-transduced with both viruses at P24, and tissue harvesting at P27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). Our analyses showed that resultant early clones expressing Hras<sup>G12V</sup> and Rassf5 had a significant reduction in their basal cell population compared to Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>). Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the number of Hras<sup>G12V</sup>, Rassf5 clones without any basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>), consistent with Rassf5 inducing differentiation in adult Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones. Together, our data indicate that Rassf5 is both necessary and sufficient positive regulator of Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-mediated differentiation in adult as well as embryonic epidermis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>With CFI, a modified version of our EdU/BrdU pulse-chase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ying et al., 2018</xref>) we have established a quantitative method that identifies individual progenitor cell fates that occur over a span of 24 hr in the adult epidermis. It is characterized by several features which should make it a standard in the field: (i) it quantifies progenitor renewal and differentiation rates in vivo—by including net effects of direct and indirect determinants such as spindle orientation, delamination and plasticity, it reports the ultimate daughter cell fate choice; (ii) it records progenitor/daughter cell locations—by maintaining spatial information of progenitor fate decisions, it allows for analysis of heterogeneity that may be driven by specific cell/cell and cell/niche interactions; and (iii) it is easily adoptable—by utilizing generic reagents and basic microscopy techniques, it can be readily assimilated into any research program.</p><p>Using this assay, we uncovered that Hras<sup>G12V</sup> can promote progenitor renewal or differentiation depending on whether it is active in a single cell or an oncogenic field. This surprising discovery led us to design a genetic screen that identified Ras effector Rassf5 as an oncogene-specific mediator of progenitor differentiation. Rassf5 has been long considered a tumor suppressor in epithelial cancers, where it is often silenced through methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donninger et al., 2016</xref>) and was shown to promote both apoptosis and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donninger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Khokhlatchev et al., 2002</xref>). We demonstrate that Rassf5 suppresses progenitor cell renewal to limit oncogenic growth, which suggests a mechanism of Rassf5-mediated tumor suppression via differentiation. This model is consistent with recent evidence that increasing the rate of progenitor cell differentiation can suppress tumorigenic potential of known oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ying et al., 2018</xref>), and that reducing the frequency of asymmetric spindle orientation can promote tumor development in skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morrow et al., 2019</xref>). How Rassf5 regulates progenitor fate choice is not known, but studies suggest a potential mechanism. Specifically, Rassf5 can activate Mst1, a driver of Hippo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bitra et al., 2017</xref>), which may lead to phosphorylation and eventual degradation of Yap. As Yap is enriched in the basal epidermal layer and acts to maintain it in an undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), Rassf5 may be a negative regulator of progenitor renewal through Hippo/Yap signaling.</p><p>We demonstrated that progenitor cells occupying the homogeneous environment of the inner clone were more likely to give rise to differentiated daughter cells, whereas the heterotypic environment on the edge of the clone appeared to permit progenitor renewal, as there was little difference between the renewal rate of single Hras<sup>G12V</sup> cells and late-stage edge cells. Changes in cell behavior influenced by homotypic/heterotypic cell interactions have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>), and may be driven by relatively simple processes. For instance, the homotypic adhesions of Hras<sup>G12V</sup>/Hras<sup>G12V</sup> inner cells could promote recruitment of more Ras and/or more Rassf5 to the membrane, driving an increase in differentiation. Resultant interplay between the renewing edge and differentiating core of late-stage Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones would then lead to oncogenic clone homeostasis.</p><p>In addition, our data show that WT cells near the Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clone were also more likely to differentiate. It is noteworthy that similar phenomenon was observed following clonal activation of PI3K, although in that context WT cells were more self-renewing and the oncogenic clone was in the process of being eliminated from the tissue through increased differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ying et al., 2018</xref>). Despite having opposite effects on WT cells, both observations suggest that epidermal progenitors can respond to environmental changes in order to promote the stable size of the progenitor compartment necessary for tissue maintenance. This is consistent with a model where regulation of stem cell fate choice, rather than being a sole product of cell autonomous signaling, is subject to progenitor cell dynamics among the nearest neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mesa et al., 2018</xref>). Of note, while that model was supported by observation that delamination of a basal cell precedes division of a neighboring progenitor in the context of adult tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mesa et al., 2018</xref>), it would be interesting to test if oncogenic activation of a potent mitogenic signal in a basal progenitor may reverse the relationship, and promote delamination of its neighbors.</p><p>In our model, biological outcome of a balanced clone is driven by inception of two progenitor populations with very different fates. As this emergence of distinct populations is defined by a progressive increase in clone size, which may be promoted by any oncogenic event that drives unbalanced proliferation, and overall round clone shape, which appears to be a general feature of epidermal organization and can therefore be viewed as a simple facilitator, it suggests that physical attributes of the clone can play a defining role. The dichotomy of growing edge and unstable core not only provides a model for how the growth of a single isolated clone can be constrained without requiring the presence of competing clones/mutations but may also explain the observation that oncogene-driven clones residing in aged epidermis grow to a relatively uniform size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Martincorena et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 000664</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">293-FT</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">C<sc>at</sc> #: R70007</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">PerCP/Cyanine5.5 rat monoclonal anti-human/mouse CD49f</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat #: 313617</td><td valign="top">1:50</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Chicken polyclonal anti-GFP</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat #: ab13970 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_300798">AB_300798</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat #: MoBU-1</td><td valign="top">IF: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH</td><td valign="top">Proteintech</td><td valign="top">Cat #: 60004–1-Ig RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2737588">AB_2737588</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB: 1:2000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Peroxidase AffiniPure goat polyclonal Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immunoresearch</td><td valign="top">Cat #: 115-035-003</td><td valign="top">WB: 1:5000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-K10</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat #: Poly19054</td><td valign="top">IF: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-Nore1A</td><td valign="top">Donated by G.

author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The work addresses an important question, namely what happens when cells acquire an oncogene that will ultimately progress to cancer. The authors nicely show that tumor cells in a stratified mouse epidermis generates two populations of oncogenic cells: ones at the tumor border that favor self-renewal and ones in the center of the clone that favor differentiation. As the clone grows, the intra-clonal competition between the two populations results in stabilized oncogenic growth. This knowledge could be widely applicable to many cancers derived from stratified tissues.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Interplay of opposing fate choices stalls oncogenic growth in skin epithelium&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Scott Williams (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work the authors have created a genetically engineered mouse model where the effects of activating HRAS in the epithelium allows for the analysis of cell turnover/division at single cell resolution. They use this elegant experimental model to discover that the growth of oncogenic lesions is nuanced with both pro-proliferative and restraining forces at play. They also demonstrate that this model can be used for genetic screens and performed a screen that identified Rassf5 as a negative regulator of Hras.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The description of the CFI assay is overly complicated and given it is really just a slight amendment from the assay they previously employed in Ying, Sandoval and Beronja, 2018, the novelty of this assay is a little bit oversold, especially in the Discussion. The labelling of Figure 2B is also quite confusing – the EdU pulse is actually 2.5 hours in the middle panel of images, and the top panel is tissue that hasn't been subjected to a BrdU injection if I am understanding correctly but this isn't clear initially. Also what the %s are referring to in terms of either total cell population of just doublets is also unclear. Also the CFI method relies on the fact that a cell must divide (incorporate EdU or BrdU) in order to be labeled and counted. A cell that delaminates, without having recently dividing, would not be considered.

In addition, do WT clones that are in contact with the Hras<sup>G12V</sup> edge cells behave any differently than WT clones far removed from a Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clone?

However, these analyses were performed in embryonic back rather than adult head epidermis, and presumably in tissue that has ubiquitous rather than clonal induction of Hras<sup>G12V</sup>. Since the authors show in Figure 4A that there are no apparent differences in progenitor renewal rates between WT and Hras<sup>G12V</sup> in embryonic clones, these assumptions may not be valid for their model.

In addition, statistics are missing from Figure 2G-J.</p><p>6) In order to properly contextualize the results shown in Figure 3, it would be important to show that in a large field of Hras-expressing cells (i.e. K14-Cre driven or high titer lentivirus driven expression), we don't see clonal shapes trending towards being round. This critical control would serve to reinforce the idea that in the case of clonal Hras expression, it is really interactions between wild-type and oncogenic cells that eventually contributes to the restraint of overgrowth in the tissue. An analysis of clonal growth in WT tissue would also serve to illustrate and further reinforce the same point.</p><p>7) The screen was quite limited and although they identified a new regulator, this was selected from candidate genes. How large a screen can be performed? In addition, no mention or discussion is made of the screen hits that were enriched in the SB population in Hras<sup>G12V</sup> tissue, although there appear to be several. Also, it should be clarified which genetic backgrounds were used for the screen. I assume this is the Krt14-Cre; Hrasll-G12V/+, and that WT would be without either the Krt14-Cre or Hras<sup>G12V</sup> allele, but this should be explicitly stated in the text. Data regarding the enrichment/depletion of their screen hits (Figure 4E, F) should be provided.</p><p>8) The observations regarding intraclonal heterogeneity are very interesting and quite well described. However, that Rassf5 is a bona fide contributor to these spatially distinct dynamics is not sufficiently convincing. More thorough analysis should be included to suggest that there are changes to these dynamics when Rassf5 expression is perturbed, either by shRNA-mediated knockdown, or by over-expression. It is puzzling that no data is shown to support this, and in both the initial description of these data in the Results, and in the Discussion, the authors mention that in other systems Rassf5 is thought to restrain oncogenic Ras activity through induction of senescence of apoptosis. However, according to their data, there is neither senescence nor apoptosis induced in the case of the epidermis (although this data could also be more convincing). At the very least, analysis similar to what is shown in Figure 3 should be included in the case of shRassf5 and/or Rassf5 overexpression to convincingly demonstrate that the phenomenon they describe in the first three figures can indeed be linked to Rassf5 function. Simply saying that the clones are more triangular upon Rassf5 overexpression is not sufficient. What do these clones look like in whole mount? Are they still circular like the Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones, or is this lost? Is the heterogeneity of cell behaviors between the &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;edge&quot; cells maintained or lost? Is proliferation or apoptosis affected? Also, the Rassf5 knockdown and over-expression are assessed at E18.5 rather than later post-natal time points which makes it furthermore difficult to include the relevance between the phenotypes and what they describe earlier in the paper. Another potential experiment to include that would help their case would be to stain for Rassf5 to see if there are differences on the protein expression level within clones – if there is a working antibody available this should be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54618.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The description of the CFI assay is overly complicated and given it is really just a slight amendment from the assay they previously employed in Ying, Sandoval and Beronja, 2018), the novelty of this assay is a little bit oversold, especially in the Discussion. The labelling of Figure 2B is also quite confusing – the EdU pulse is actually 2.5 hours in the middle panel of images, and the top panel is tissue that hasn't been subjected to a BrdU injection if I am understanding correctly but this isn't clear initially. Also what the %s are referring to in terms of either total cell population of just doublets is also unclear. Also the CFI method relies on the fact that a cell must divide (incorporate EdU or BrdU) in order to be labeled and counted. A cell that delaminates, without having recently dividing, would not be considered. Since there is evidence that delamination precedes division in the adult epidermis (Mesa et al., 2018), it seems that the concept of delamination should at least be considered (and this paper cited in the Discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comments on the CFI assay and the desire for more clarity. As the reviewers noted, it is adapted from the assay we used in Ying, Sandoval and Beronja, 2018, and we now clearly state so in both the Results and Discussion sections. However, we spent considerable time modifying and validating the initial assay into what is now the CFI assay. Most importantly, CFI assay can answer questions that we could not address using our previous method (described in the Discussion). Because of this, we believe that the CFI assay holds merit. As suggested, we made a series of modifications to Figure 2B, both to correct issues brought up by the reviewers and give the reader a better understanding of the assay.</p><p>The reviewers also raised an important point regarding CFI assay’s dependence on incorporation of EdU/BrdU. Indeed, as the CFI assay depends on nucleotide labeling of daughter progenitors, any division/delamination event (i.e. renewal/differentiation fate choice), made by an epidermal progenitor derived from a mother cell that went through its S phase outside of the 2hr EdU pulse, is not scored by the CFI. As the assay reports the <italic>frequency</italic> of particular fate choice and uses that to calculate the <italic>rate</italic> of renewal, these prior events do not impact either statistic (similar to, for instance, the rate of apoptosis based on a snapshot of Casp3 expression). The CFI scores daughter cell fates within a 24hr window, which brings up an additional question, of whether this is sufficient time to account for cellular fates that labeled progenitors ultimately make. Specifically, if daughter cell delamination occurs with any significant frequency outside of the 24hr window we employ, these delamination events would be missed. As a result, our assay would be expected to over-report the tissue renewal rate. There are several observations that suggest that this is not the case. In previous work we showed that the number of newborn daughter cells with strong expression of suprabasal marker K10, detected by IF, plateaus by ~6hrs following EdU pulse, and that these K10 high progenitors never divide again (Ying, Sandoval and Beronja, 2018). In addition, studies by the Greco and our labs, which employed direct intravital imaging of photo-labeled progenitors (i.e. an assay independent of progenitor labeling based on nucleotide incorporation), and progenitor cell fate scoring based not on their location in the epidermal basal layer after a 24hr period but by their ability to divide again (a hallmark of progenitor potential) arrived at the adult tissue renewal rates of 0.50±0.04 (calculated from quantification in Figure 2A; Rompolas et al., 2016 Science) and 0.51±0.01 (Ying, Sandoval and Beronja, 2018). This is not significantly different from the renewal rate of 0.50±0.01, which we report for the wild type tissue in the current study, and is further consistent with overall neutral growth and renewal rate required for long-term tissue maintenance. Nevertheless, in the revised manuscript we highlight that CFI employs a 24hr snapshot to assess progenitor cell fate choice, thus leaving space for possibilities that delaminated cells can maintain their mitotic potential, or that basal progenitors delaminate with any significant frequency after the 24hr period.</p><p>Lastly, we fully agree with the reviewer’s suggestion to discuss Mesa et al., especially as their observation of local regulation of stem cell fate choice (i.e. basal cell delamination is accompanied by division of a neighboring progenitor) may contribute to the phenomenon we observe where increased renewal along the edge of the Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clone is accompanied by reduced renewal of neighboring wild type cells. Our revised manuscript now has an entire paragraph dedicated to discussing our observations in the context of their elegant model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) By way of comparison, none of the analyses in Figure 3A are performed for WT clones. Does inter-clone heterogeneity and the tendency toward clonal circularity exist in WT clones?

In response, we performed a series of experiments in WT epidermis.</p><p>On the point of clonal circularity, we provide data that small WT clones are also circular in shape (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B). While we could not compare circularity for WT and Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones of the same size (see below), this experiment suggests that clone growth in the epidermis inherently trends towards a circular morphology. Importantly, we want to clarify that our model does not require that circularity to be driven by Hras<sup>G12V</sup>, but that its natural existence is critical for the emergence of two populations of cells (outer/inner) and the dynamic in their relative contribution that favors outer cells early on but inner cells over a longer time span. In our revised Discussion we clarify this view of circularity as a naturally-occurring yet critical facilitator of dynamics of clone composition.</p><p>In our revised manuscript we also show that WT clones initiated from a single progenitor do not grow to a size sufficient for emergence of inner/outer cell populations (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). To nevertheless address the reviewers’ comment we conducted an additional experiment using larger WT fields derived from several neighboring progenitors. We found that the division choices of inner and outer cells in that context were not significantly different, and further that their overall renewal rates were not significantly different from that of small WT clones (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E). These analyses suggest that the inter-clone heterogeneity is independent of lentiviral transduction, expression of Cre recombinase and/or GFP, and is specific to Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3G, although they do see significantly more self-renewal on the edges of the clone, there is not significantly more differentiation in the centre.

We found that symmetric renewal divisions occurred less often in WT cells adjacent to an Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clone (Figure 3I, J), suggesting that WT cells are responding to the local environment and compensate for the pro-renewal edge cells of Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones. We highlight this observation in our revised Discussion, and relate it to published work from the Greco lab (Mesa et al., 2018) and our own (Ying, Sandoval and Beronja, 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and in the subsection “Expression of activated Hras<sup>G12V</sup> promotes progenitor cell renewal in adult skin epithelium”, that neither apoptosis nor cell cycle length are significantly different between WT and Hras<sup>G12V</sup> mutants; thus, they exclude these factors from their growth model (Figure 1G).

In considering this idea, we would like to clarify that Ras is not driving roundness but that the overall tissue architecture induces a single cell to grow into a clone that has a circular shape.</p><p>Indeed, our analysis of WT clone shape over 24 weeks suggests that WT clones also sustain a round shape (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B). This suggests that the native tissue architecture plays a role in impeding Hras growth. Furthermore, we wish to clarify that it is not &quot;interactions between WT and oncogenic cells that eventually contribute to the restraint of overgrowth in the tissue”. Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clones are self-limiting because the inner core of cells is pro-differentiation (Figure 3H). Indeed, neighboring WT cells respond to the Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clone by undergoing divisions that produce differentiated daughter cells (Figure 3I, J), indicating that this population is not inhibiting the growth of the Hras<sup>G12V</sup> clone but is instead reacting to the pro-renewal fate choices of the Hras<sup>G12V</sup> edge cells (Figure 3K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The screen was quite limited and although they identified a new regulator, this was selected from candidate genes.

In general, we tend to use large screens in the hypothesis building stages of a study, and biologically focused ones when addressing a specific hypothesis. Here, our screen was focused on known Ras effectors to test the hypothesis that increased differentiation in oncogenic clones was caused by Hras<sup>G12V</sup> expression and mediated by one of its effectors.</p><p>The reviewers’ comments on how to improve the discussion of our in vivo genetic screen is appreciated. We now explicitly state the genetic backgrounds of the animals we used. In addition, we include a table that provides details of enrichment/depletion scores for all genes tested in the screen (Supplementary file 1).

We performed apoptosis and senescence assays in adult Hras<sup>G12V</sup> epidermis transduced with two different shRassf5 constructs, and found neither process to be significantly changed when compared to Hras<sup>G12V</sup> control (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Focusing on Rassf5-mediated regulation of progenitor renewal we demonstrated for embryonic tissues, we now show that Rassf5 knockdown in adult Hras<sup>G12V</sup> epidermal clones erased the difference in progenitor renewal rates between inner and outer clone compartments (Figure 5J), and resulted in an overall increase in population progenitor renewal rate (Figure 5K). This indicates that Rassf5 is a regulator of progenitor renewal in the adult epidermis. Furthermore, to complement the loss-of-function analysis of Rassf5, we designed a two component Doxinducible system to activate Hras<sup>G12V</sup> in adult epidermis, and follow it by overexpression of Rassf5 (Figure 5L, M). Here, our analyses show that Rassf5 expression biased early clone composition towards a differentiated fate to the point where basal progenitors were rapidly lost, suggesting that Rassf5 is sufficient for increased differentiation in the adult epidermis (Figure 5N, O). On the last point, we followed the reviewer’s suggestion to use immunostaining on clones. After testing 4 commercially available antibodies and 2 donated by other labs, and multiple fixation/staining protocols on wild type and Rassf5 knockdown and overexpression clones, we could not find an antibody that worked in tissue immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry with any specificity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
