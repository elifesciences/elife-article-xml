intrinsically governed by gene regulatory mechanisms, but the post-transcriptional regulation in SCs remains largely unknown. N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of RNAs is the most pervasive and highly conserved RNA modification in eukaryotic cells; it exerts powerful impact on almost all aspects of mRNA processing that is mainly endowed by its binding with m6A reader proteins. In this study, we investigate the previously uncharacterized regulatory roles of YTHDC1, an m6A reader in mouse SCs. Our results demonstrate that YTHDC1 is an essential regulator of SC activation and proliferation upon acute injury-induced muscle regeneration. The induction of YTHDC1 is indispensable for SC activation and proliferation; thus, inducible YTHDC1 depletion almost abolishes SC regenerative capacity. Mechanistically, transcriptome-wide profiling using LACE-seq in both SCs and mouse C2C12 myoblasts identifies m6A-mediated binding targets of YTHDC1. Next, splicing analysis defines splicing mRNA targets of m6A-YTHDC1. Furthermore, nuclear export analysis also leads to the identification of potential mRNA export targets of m6A-YTHDC1 in SCs and C2C12 myoblasts;interestingly, some mRNAs can be regulated at both splicing and export levels. Lastly, we map YTHDC1 interacting protein partners in myoblasts and unveil a myriad of factors governing mRNA splicing, nuclear export, and transcription, among which hnRNPG appears to be a bona fide interacting partner of YTHDC1. Altogether, our findings uncover YTHDC1 as an essential factor controlling SC regenerative ability through multifaceted gene regulatory mechanisms in mouse myoblast cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group

regenerative capacity, with rapid re-establishment of full power occurring even after severe damage that causes widespread myofiber necrosis. This is accomplished by satellite cells (SCs) that normally lie quiescent and uniquely labeled by the expression of paired box (Pax) transcription factor Pax7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujita and Crist, 2018</xref>). Upon injury, the master myogenic regulator MyoD is expressed to enable rapid activation of SCs, which then expand as proliferating myoblasts; the myoblasts then differentiate and fuse into myofibers to repair the damaged muscle, while a subset self-renews to restore the quiescent SC pool. Deregulated SC activity contributes to the development of many muscle diseases; it is thus imperative to understand the way SCs contribute to regeneration. Intrinsically, both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulations constitute key mechanisms governing SC activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Relaix et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we investigate the post-transcriptional gene regulation mediated by N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) modification.</p><p>m6A is the most pervasive and highly conserved RNA modification in eukaryotic cells and exerts powerful impact on almost all aspects of mRNA processing, including alternative splicing, nuclear export, stability maintenance, and translational efficiency, thus regulating diverse cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). The past decade has witnessed rapid technical and conceptual advances that allowed transcriptome-wide interrogation of m6A dynamics and galvanized interest in m6A function. It is widely accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murakami and Jaffrey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2019</xref>) that RNA m6A modification is catalyzed by a multicomponent methyltransferase complex (the ‘writer’) comprising METTL14, METTL3, WTAP, etc., and can be removed by specific demethylases (the ‘erasers’), including FTO and ALKBH5. However, it is the so-called ‘reader’ proteins that bind m6A and impart the epitranscriptomic information engraved in RNA m6A to functional signals; thus, these proteins are considered key effectors and executors of m6A functions. So far, a category of m6A readers has been identified and classified as several families, among which YTH domain family proteins, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, YTHDC1, and YTHDC2, specifically recognize m6A sites through YTH domain and are the most well-known readers.</p><p>YTHDC1 is a unique m6A reader because of its dominant location in the nucleus endowing its post-transcriptional regulatory functions such as pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasowitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>), mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lesbirel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>), and mRNA stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Widagdo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The pioneer study from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>) shows that YTHDC1 promotes exon inclusion of targeted mRNAs in Hela cells by recruiting pre-mRNA splicing factor SRSF3 while blocking SRSF10 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>); however, in a separate study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>), YTHDC1 interacting with SRSF3 facilitates the delivery of methylated mRNAs to export receptor NXF1 for cytoplasmic export, pointing to YTHDC1 and SRSF3 as adaptor proteins coupling mRNA splicing and export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, rapidly evolving evidence from the past two years implicates YTHDC1 in epigenetic and transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wei and He, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2021</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). There is thus a current advent in illuminating molecular underpinnings of m6A-dependent functions of YTHDC1 as well as in demonstrating its biological importance in vivo. In this project, we elucidate m6A-YTHDC1 functional mechanisms in skeletal muscle stem cells and muscle regeneration.</p><p>Our findings identify YTHDC1 as an essential regulator of SC activation/proliferation in the acute injury induced muscle regeneration. Inducible YTHDC1 knockout impairs SC activation and proliferation, which blocks muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, combining transcriptome-wide YTHDC1 binding profiles and global m6A map we define m6A-YTHDC1 regulatory targets in myoblasts. Further analyses demonstrate that YTHDC1 loss substantially alters target mRNA splicing; in addition, it also impacts nuclear export of a subset of target mRNAs. Lastly, we uncover that YTHDC1 interacts with a myriad of proteins in proliferating myoblasts, including regulators of mRNA splicing, mRNA nuclear export, as well as transcriptional regulators. We further demonstrate that hnRNPG interacts with YTHDC1 and synergistically promotes myoblast proliferation. Altogether, our findings suggest that YTHDC1 is a previously uncharacterized factor governing SC activities and muscle regeneration, and it can exert pleiotropic gene regulatory functions by interacting with different proteins in myoblast cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>m6A regulators are dynamically expressed during SC lineage progression, and YTHDC1 is induced upon SC activation/proliferation</title><p>To investigate possible roles of m6A regulators in SCs, we analyzed the expression dynamics of a panel of m6A writers, readers, and erasers using our recently generated RNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2021</xref>) from SCs at various time points of lineage progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Freshly isolated SCs (FISCs) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) are considered as early activating cells due to the disruption of their niche by the isolation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Machado et al., 2017</xref>); quiescent SCs (QSCs) were obtained through a pre-fixation step with paraformaldehyde (PFA) before the dissociation to preserve the quiescence status; FISCs were cultured for 24, 48, and 72 hr to obtain fully activated, proliferating, and differentiating SCs (ASC-24 hr, -48 hr, and -72 hr). As a result, we found that many m6A regulators were dynamically expressed in the lineage progression course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), reflecting their possible importance in controlling different phases of SC activities. Specifically, we found the reader <italic>Ythdc1</italic> mRNA was expressed at all stages with the highest level in FISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). By western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), we observed a very low level of YTHDC1 protein in FISC, an evident increase in activating cells (ASC-24 hr) and continued increase in proliferating cells (ASC-48 hr); YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 reader proteins appeared to show similar expression dynamics. Consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>), YTHDC1 protein was predominantly detected in the nucleus but not cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

To this end, we harnessed the recently developed LACE-seq (the Linear Amplification of Complementary DNA Ends and Sequencing) method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) that enables global profiling of RNA-binding protein (RBP) target sites with a relatively low quantity of starting cellular material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Su et al., 2021</xref>). Around 1 million ASC-48 hr were subject to LACE-seq with two biological replicates (B1, B2) and four technical replicates (T1, T2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As a result, a total of 2444 shared peaks corresponding to 951 genes were identified from comparing the four replicates and defined as YTHDC1 binding targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). All of these replicates were well correlated with each other (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.82~0.91). These genes were enriched for GO terms such as ‘Cell projection organization,’ ‘Cell junction assembly,’ etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To reinforce the result, we also performed LACE-seq with C2C12 myoblasts; two technical replicates were included, and a much higher number of cells (10 million) were used for each replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Our results showed that data from C2C12 was of very high quality with the two replicates displaying high correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.96). A total of 29107 shared peaks corresponding to 5897 genes were identified as YTHDC1 binding targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Very similar to the above result from ASCs, these genes were also enriched for a variety of GO terms such as ‘Cell projection organization,’ ‘Cell junction assembly,’ etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In fact, 1501 out of the 2444 identified peaks in ASCs could be found in C2C12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), testifying the success of the assay. Next, further probing into the binding locations, we found that in both C2C12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), a large portion of the peaks (73% and 43%) were mapped to protein coding genes, which is largely consistent with prior reports from conducting YTHDC1 global profiling through CLIP-seq or RIP-seq in other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Patil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that regulating mRNA processing is probably the dominant role of YTHDC1 in mouse myoblasts.

Our findings demonstrate the expression dynamics of several m6A regulators including writers, readers, and erasers during the course of SC lineage progression, implicating their possible involvement in governing SC activities. Among these m6A regulators, we characterize YTHDC1 function in depth and uncover it as an essential factor controlling SC activation and proliferation. Inducible depletion of YTHDC1 in SCs drastically impairs SC activation and proliferation; thus, it almost abolishes acute injury-induced muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, LACE-seq identifies YTHDC1 binding mRNA targets among which a portion are m6A dependent. Further splicing analyses provide evidence for m6A-YTHDC1 participation in modulating splicing events in myoblast cells. Additionally, subcellular fractionation/RNA-seq also defines potential mRNA export targets of YTHDC1 in myoblasts. Lastly, co-IP/MS defines a wide array of interacting protein partners of YTHDC1, including mRNA splicing and export factors, as well as transcriptional regulators, and they may function in synergism to mediate the pleiotropic functions of YTHDC1 in myoblasts. Among these factors, hnRNPG appears to be a bona fide functional partner of YTHDC1 to synergistically regulate myoblast proliferation. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that YTHDC1 is an indispensable intrinsic regulator of SC activities and muscle regeneration through multifaceted controlling of RNA metabolism in myoblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A working model of YTHDC1 function in satellite cells (SCs).</title><p>YTHDC1 is induced upon SC activation and proliferation to promote SC activation and proliferation upon acute injury-induced muscle regeneration.

This is the first study to identify potential functional m6A regulators and provides a holistic investigation of a writer protein, YTHDC1 function in SCs and muscle regeneration. The transcriptomic profiling uncovered that an array of m6A regulators were dynamically expressed in the course of SC lineage progression; notably, YTH-domain containing reader proteins, including YTHDC1, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3, were all highly expressed in SCs. The mRNA level of YTHDC1 was high across the entire course albeit showing an induction in FISC; its protein level, nevertheless, was induced in ASC-24 hr and continued to increase until ASC-48 hr, suggesting its dominant role in governing activation/proliferation. The discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression also suggests that there may be post-transcriptional regulation to control YTHDC1 protein production. It is possible that the induction of <italic>Ythdc1</italic> mRNA occurs early upon activation, but the protein translation occurs later in myoblasts, where it executes the mRNA splicing and export functions. Indeed, the subsequent dissection using the YTHDC1-iKO mouse provided solid evidence supporting its positive role in promoting SC activation and proliferation; inducible depletion of YTHDC1 largely inhibited SC activation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We believe the incompetence of SC activation/proliferation is the major cause of nearly blocked regeneration after acute injury-induced muscle damage. Nevertheless, the potential defects in other aspects such as differentiation, self-renewal, and survival need to be investigated in the future. Of note, YTHDC1 expression can also be detected in QSCs albeit to a very low level. We also noticed decreased SC numbers after long-term loss of YTHDC1 (data not shown), suggesting that it may play a critical role in QSC maintenance. Our findings thus suggest that YTHDC1 plays an indispensable role in SCs and muscle regeneration, which is not replaceable by other m6A readers. This study also adds genetic evidence for the importance of YTHDC1 in cellular processes, which is largely lacking in the field. In the future, it will also be interesting to test the functionality of other readers such as YTHDF1, 2, and 3 in SCs.</p><p>To investigate the functional mechanism of YTHDC1 in promoting SC activation/proliferation, recently developed LACE-seq was harnessed using both ASCs and C2C12 myoblasts. Even though the number of peaks identified in ASCs was not comparable with the number in C2C12, LACE-seq has enabled the profiling of transcriptome-wide YTHDC1 binding in ASCs, which was previously impossible using traditional mRNA binding probing methods. By combining with the m6A MeRIP-seq dataset available in C2C12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gheller et al., 2020</xref>), we were able to define m6A-modified binding targets of YTHDC1. From out data, YTHDC1 selectively bound a subset but not all m6A-modified RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and J</xref>). This selectivity could be achieved by dynamic multivalent interactions of YTHDC1, RNAs, and regulatory proteins that self-organize into distinct condensates (nuclear subcompartments) within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He and He, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Widagdo et al., 2022</xref>), It is also worth pointing out that a large portion of the YTHDC1 binding targets do not seem to possess m6A modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), suggesting that YTHDC1 may have m6A-independent functions. However, it is commonly believed that YTHDC1 regulatory functions are largely dependent on its m6A binding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, the mutants also failed to rescue the myoblast proliferative defect in YTHDC1-depleted C2C12 myoblasts, strongly suggesting its pro-proliferative function in myoblasts relies on its m6A binding ability. Nevertheless, since YTHDC1 is now known to participate in liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Widagdo et al., 2022</xref>), it is likely that m6A-modified RNAs may initiate the recruitment of YTHDC1 through the YTH m6A binding domain, YTHDC1 then promotes condensate formation through the two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) independent of its m6A reading function. It is also interesting to notice that about 12% of YTHDC1 binding peaks were mapped to retrotransposons in ASCs and 10% in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). In mESCs, YTHDC1 silences retrotransposons to guard ES cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu et al., 2021</xref>), it would thus be interesting to explore the possible functional relevancy of YTHDC1 regulation of retrotransposons in SCs. In the future, it will also be necessary to generate transcriptome-wide m6A mapping in SCs, which has become possible by the recently developed methods enabling the use of low number of cells.</p><p>Next, we examined YTHDC1 regulation of mRNA splicing in depth by examining altered splicing events upon YTHDC1 loss, which unveiled the splicing targets of m6A-YTHDC1. The number was relatively small in ASCs due to the relatively small number of YTHDC1 binding targets from LACE-seq; a much higher number was found in C2C12 cells but constituted only a small number (20%) of m6A-YTHDC1 targets. Additionally, we examined the potential effects of YTHDC1 loss in mRNA nuclear export and indeed identified a set of mRNAs possibly regulated by m6A-YTHDC1; upon YTHDC1 loss, the nuclear enrichment level was significantly increased. Interestingly, 20% of these mRNAs are also splicing targets of m6A-YTHDC1, suggesting that YTHDC1 binding to an m6A-modified mRNA can control mRNA metabolism at multiple levels. Of note, our study identifies a large number of splicing or/and export targets of m6A-YTHDC1, and they play a wide range of cellular functions directly or indirectly related to cellular proliferation. The observed proliferative defects upon YTHDC1 loss thus could be a combinatorial effect of many downstream targets that were enriched for a wide range of GO functions important for SC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and L</xref>). For example, canonical Wnt signaling is known to induce SC proliferation during adult skeletal muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otto et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, co-IP/MS was performed in myoblasts and led to the identification of an array of RNA processing regulators mainly including splicing and nuclear export factors. This finding is in concordance with the above demonstrated YTHDC1 functions in splicing and export regulations. In addition, transcriptional regulators were also identified. The m6A-dependent functions of YTHDC1 in regulating splicing, export, or transcription have all been individually reported in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kasowitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>); our finding thus hints pleiotropic roles of YTHDC1 in myoblasts. In terms of splicing regulation, Xiao et al. showed that YTHDC1 binds competitively to the splicing factor SRSF3, while antagonizing the binding of SRSF10 to promote exon inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). The top-ranked binding partner on our list, however, was not SR splicing factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>); instead, hnRNPG appeared as the most likely interacting partner. Its specific interaction with YTHDC1 was validated by co-IP/WB using both exogenously and endogenously expressed proteins in C2C12 and also in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), thus pointing to hnRNPG as a bona fide interacting partner of YTHDC1. Interestingly, hnRNPG also represents a multifaceted gene regulator. Originally known as a hnRNP family splicing factor via interactions with SRSF3, SRSF7, SLM, SAFB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elliott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heinrich et al., 2009</xref>), it was later shown to bind with m6A-modified mRNAs, thus possessing m6A reader function. It can co-transcriptionally interact with both RNAPII and m6A-modified nascent pre-mRNA to modulate RNAPII occupancy and alterative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Its implicated role in transcription repression was also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elliott et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, both hnRNPG and YTHDC1 are versatile m6A-dependent gene regulators yet no study so far has made functional connection between these two key m6A readers despite their physical interaction being mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heinrich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). Our result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref> demonstrates their functional synergism in promoting C2C12 myoblast proliferation. Future efforts will be focused on further delineating the regulatory and functional synergism between YTHDC1 and hnRNPG in SCs. In addition, the co-IP/MS also identifies a number of TREX components as potential interacting partners of YTHDC1, and a prior report also demonstrated the physical interaction between TREX complex with YTHDC1 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lesbirel et al., 2018</xref>). The modulation of nuclear export by YTHDC1 is thus very likely exerted together with TREX proteins, which will need to be further investigated in the future.</p><p>Altogether, biologically, our findings uncover YTHDC1 as an essential post-transcriptional regulator of SC activities and muscle regeneration. In the coming years, more solid genetic evidence will be needed to demonstrate the key roles of m6A regulators in various biological systems. It will also be interesting to determine whether YTHDC1 deregulation is implicated in muscle-related diseases such as aging-associated sarcopenia. Mechanistically, we demonstrate multifaceted roles of YTHDC1 in decoding m6A-marked transcripts in myoblasts; a wide range of mRNA targets are controlled by YTHDC1, thus mediating its effect in promoting myoblast proliferation. Although this study mainly focuses on delineating its post-transcriptional actions, we believe that YTHDC1 also modulates transcriptional events in myoblast nucleus and hnRNPG seems to constitute an important co-factor that may synergistically regulate both splicing and transcription functions of YTHDC1. In addition, it will be interesting to explore whether YTHDC1, hnRNPG, and the target mRNAs self-organize into distinct condensates within the myoblast nucleus as emerging evidence suggests RNA, m6A readers, and co-factors can cooperatively form distinct nuclear condensates at specific genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Widagdo et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, although YTHDC1 is predominantly found in the nucleus of myoblast cells, it may transiently shuttle into the cytoplasm as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rafalska et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shima et al., 2017</xref> and execute unexpected post-transcriptional functions such as in mRNA destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Pax7<sup>CreER</sup> (Pax7<sup>tm1(cre/ERT2)Gaka</sup></italic>) and Tg: Pax7-nGFP mouse strains were kindly provided by Dr. Shahragim Tajbakhsh. <italic>Ythdc1<sup>fl</sup>(B6;129S4-Ythdc1tm1.1Jw/Mmjax</italic>) strain (050693-JAX) and <italic>Rosa26<sup>EYFP</sup></italic> mouse (006148-JAX) were provided by Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Pax7<sup>CreER</sup></italic> mice were crossed with <italic>Rosa26<sup>EYFP</sup></italic> mice to generate the <italic>Pax7<sup>CreER</sup>; Rosa26<sup>EYFP</sup></italic> reporter mice.

After incubation with indicated antibodies overnight, protein G beads were added and incubated for another 2 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed five times with IP buffer and proteins were eluted with 1× SDS loading buffer at 99°C for 5 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>LACE-seq and data analysis</title><p>LACE-seq was performed as described. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Su et al., 2021</xref>) Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and subjected to 400 mJ UV treatment to crosslink proteins with their interacting RNAs. After crosslink, cells were pelleted and kept at –80°C before library preparation. YTHDC1 antibody (Abcam, ab122340) was used to pull down specific protein-RNA complex from lysate. In brief, MNase was used to cut RNAs into YTHDC1-associated short fragments on beads. The 3′ ends of fragmented RNAs were then dephosphorylated and ligated with a 5′ pre-adenylated linker containing four randomized nucleotides. Biotinylated primer containing the T7 promoter was used for reverse transcription, which stopped at crosslinking site (YTHDC1 binding site). cDNAs were poly(A) tailed and purified with streptavidin beads. Second-strand cDNAs were synthesized on beads with an adaptor containing oligo-(dT). After a pre-amplifying step by PCR, T7 RNA polymerase was used to amplify trace amounts of truncated cDNAs linearly. Then the products were PCR converted into libraries for single-end sequencing on Illumina platform (NextSeq 550). For the LACE-seq data analysis, first, the adapter sequences and poly(A) tails at the 3′ end of raw reads were removed using Cutadapt (v.1.15) with the following parameters: -f fastq -m 18 -n 2 -a A{15} <monospace>--quality-base=33</monospace>. Clean reads were first aligned to mouse pre-rRNA using Bowtie software (v.1.2.3) with default parameters, and the remaining unmapped reads were then aligned to the mouse (mm9) reference genome with Bowtie parameters: <monospace>--best</monospace> <monospace>--strata</monospace> -v 2 -k 10. Pearson’s correlation coefficient between LACE-seq replicates was performed using multiBamSummary module of deeptools. LACE-seq peaks are called by Piranha software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smithlabresearch.org/software/piranha/">http://smithlabresearch.org/software/piranha/</ext-link>, v.1.2.1) in ASC cells. The parameters were as follows: -sort -p_threshold 0.001 -b 20 -d ZeroTruncatedNegativeBinomial. For motif analysis, LACE-seq peaks were first extended 20 nt to upstream and downstream, respectively. Enriched motifs are scanned by findMotifsGenome.pl from Homer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Whole-cell RNA-seq and RNA splicing analysis</title><p>For the splicing analysis, RNA-seq reads were first aligned to the mm9 reference genome using STAR, and splicing events were then detected by rMATS with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). A cutoff of absolute value of ‘IncLevelDifference’ &lt; 0.1 was used to define DSEs in YTHDC1 iKO vs. Ctrl. DSE targets are the genes that having DSE in its transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Subcellular RNA-seq and mRNA exporting analysis</title><p>For the subcellular RNA-seq analysis, reads were aligned to reference genome and the quantification of gene expression was performed by Cufflink. A cutoff of FPKM &gt; 1 either in cytoplasmic (cyto) or nuclear (nuc) was used to determine the expression of genes. To identify the nuclear-enriched mRNAs upon YTHDC1 knockout or degradation, the log<sub>2</sub>(cyto/nuc) of knockout or degradation should be less than the Ctrl sample and the log<sub>2</sub>(cyto/nuc) of knockout or degradation should be less than –1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Performed YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 western blot in ASCs and helped with some mouse related experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Generated the C2C12 Ostir expressing line</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Performed LACE-seq of YTHDC1 in C2C12 and ASCs</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Performed LACE-seq of YTHDC1 in C2C12 and ASCs</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal handling procedures and protocols were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (AEEC) of CUHK (Ref.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hong Cheng (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers were positive and supportive but had significant suggestions for revision prior to acceptance.</p><p>(A) Reviewer 1 confirmed the view that your paper provides new insight into YTHDC1 function in regulating SC activation/proliferation but added that some of the data could be improved to fully support the conclusions. Specifically:</p><p>1. The title &quot;Nuclear m6A Reader YTHDC1 Promotes Muscle Stem Cell Activation/Proliferation by Regulating mRNA Splicing and Nuclear Export&quot; seems a bit overstated. Their data are not sufficient to show YTHDC1 regulating nuclear export. From figure 6 we could see some mRNAs export was inhibited upon YTHDC1 loss but intron retention also occurs on these mRNAs, for example, Dnajc14. Since intron retention could lead to mRNA nuclear retention, the mRNA export inhibition may be caused by splicing deficiency. From the data they provided we could not draw the conclusion that YTHDC1 directly affects mRNA export. I think they could not emphasize this point in the title.</p><p>2. The mechanism of YTHDC1 promoting muscle stem cell activation/proliferation is not solidified. The authors could strengthen their evidence through bioinformatics analysis or give more discussion. Besides, the previous work done by Zhao and colleagues (Zhao et al.,. Nature 542, 475-478 (2017).) reported another m6A reader Ythdf2 promotes m6A-dependent maternal mRNA clearance to facilitate zebrafish maternal-to-zygotic transition. Does YTHDC1 regulate mRNA clearance during SC activation/proliferation? The authors should explore this possibility by deep-seq data analysis and give some discussion.</p><p>3. The authors should further improve the logical connections between and within paragraphs. For example, the narration of results from lines 138 to 148 would be better if it goes on as a series of phenomenal comparisons between control and iKO muscles but not as bulk descriptions for different groups. More specifically, in lines 139-140 the author described &quot;massive immune cell infiltration was not observed on the first-day post-injury (data not shown)&quot; supposedly of the control group (without any clear indications in this sentence), while in lines 145 and figure 2D immune infiltration was compared between control and iKO muscles. There are also cases where the wording falls short of scientific interpretations such as in line 200, the phrase &quot;since there was no difficulty growing and obtaining C2C12 cells&quot; is quite inappropriate.</p><p>4. It is quite confusing to have an AID-YTHDC1 cell line starting in line 178. The authors might want to further explain the purpose of this design. In line 168 the authors used the phrase &quot;early stages&quot; and appeared to focus mainly on the early stage defects in the regeneration of satellite cells. So it is necessary to clarify how C2C12 as a more later-stage myoblast could help explain the mechanism/effect of YTHDC1 loss on SC regeneration as the subtitle described &quot;Inducible YTHDC1 knockout impairs SC activation/proliferation.&quot;</p><p>5. In figure 2G, the X-axis labels are missing.</p><p>6. In figure 3B and 3D, the IF background is too high.

In other words, does YTHDC1 play redundant or unique compartment and stage-dependent functions in satellite cells? Another question is if YTHDC1 could also exert an additional function in addition to as a reader of m6A. These should be discussed.</p><p>Figure 1B-C is meant to support the dynamics of m6A-related genes, especially Ythdc1. However, the dynamics of Ythdc1 were not obvious from these panels (especially in 1C). The results are also in contrast with the western blot results in Figure 1E.

It is true that in our initial submission, we had more data to support YTHDC1 regulation of mRNA splicing but not enough on nuclear export. It will take substantial amount of time and efforts to have thorough dissection on both mechanisms. Nevertheless, we argue that our data does provide evidence on YTHDC1 regulation of nuclear export. For example, in Figures 6 C, H, and M, only ~20% of the target mRNAs (such as <italic>Dnaj14</italic>) showed alteration in both splicing and export upon YTHDC1 loss while the majority of the export targets showed no splicing deficiency. For example, <italic>Btbd7</italic> and <italic>Tiparp</italic> in Figure 6 N showed no intron retention. In addition, we have now performed Co-IP experiments to validate the interaction between YTHDC1 and THOC7 (new result added in Figure 7L), which provides extra evidence to support YTHDC1 function in regulating mRNA nuclear export. We thus would like to keep the original title in order to reflect the multifaceted function of YTHDC1 in muscle stem cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The mechanism of YTHDC1 promoting muscle stem cell activation/proliferation is not solidified. The authors could strengthen their evidence through bioinformatics analysis or give more discussion.

Does YTHDC1 regulate mRNA clearance during SC activation/proliferation? The authors should explore this possibility by deep-seq data analysis and give some discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the critical comment. For the first concern, we think YTHDC1 promotes muscle stem cell activation/proliferation through the multi-level gene regulatory capabilities of YTHDC1 on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes and the myriads of targets regulated by YTHDC1. In addition, with the newly added data, we believe that YTHDC1’s function is largely dependent on its synergism with hnRNPG (Figure 7 K). We have added the discussion in lines 421-427 of the revised text. For the second question, our data showed that YTHDC1 predominantly localizes in the nucleus of SCs and myoblasts (Figure 1 F and G), thus it may not have a role in regulating mRNA clearance in the cytoplasm like YTHDF2. Nevertheless, there are a few existing reports<sup>1, 2</sup> suggesting its possible role in mRNA degradation and stability which may arise from its transient shuttling to cytoplasm of cells. We have now added this point in lines 469-472 of the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We apologize for the poor logic. We have now edited throughout the text to improve the logical connections between and within paragraphs. And also modified the mentioned sentences. Please see the changes in lines 127-139 and lines 196-198 in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We used the phrase &quot;early stages&quot; to emphasize the function of YTHDC1 in the activation/proliferation stage comparing the later differentiation stage during muscle regeneration. C2C12 is a proliferating myoblast cell line, which is an acceptable cell line model to study the proliferation of myoblasts. We have now changed the description in lines 156-158 and 168-170 to avoid misunderstanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We apologize for the poor quality of the images. We have now provided images with better quality in Figures 3B and 3D. We have also adjusted the arrows in Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(C) Reviewer (3) was similarly positive, flagging that these preliminary analyses provide a valuable foundation for further mechanistic investigation.

Does skeleton muscle cell activation and proliferation depend on YTHDC1's m6A binding function? Rescue experiments by overexpressing YTHDC1 and its m6A-binding mutants would help.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the great suggestion. We have now performed rescue experiments by overexpressing WT or m6A-binding mutants of YTHDC1 in the AID-YTHDC1 C2C12 cells. and found only the WT but not mutant YTHDC1 could partially rescue the proliferation defect, solidifying our finding that YTHDC1 promoting myoblast proliferation is dependent on its m6A binding function. The data is included in the revised Figure 3 J and Figure 3-—figure supplement 1 I and lines 177-183 of the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Validation of meRIP and LACE-seq-identified m6A-targets by inactivating m6A writers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the great suggestion. We have now used STM2457<sup>10</sup> to inactivate the m6A writer METTL3 and found it decreased m6A level (by MeRIP-qPCR) and also YTHDC1 binding (by RIP-qPCR) on its targets. The data is included in Figure 4 L and M and in lines 223-225 and 230-236 of the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. What are the roles of YTHDC1's splicing and export targets in skeleton muscle development?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the question. In Figure 5-—figure supplement 1 D, we performed the GO analysis of m6A-YTHDC1 splicing targets to uncover that YTHDC1 splicing targets were enriched for mRNA processing, Wnt signaling pathway, RNA splicing, etc. In Figure 6 G and L, we also performed GO analysis of YTHDC1 export targets and found these targets were enriched for histone modification, chromatin organization, etc. These YTHDC1 splicing/export targets were important for SC proliferation. For example, canonical Wnt signaling induces satellite-cell proliferation during adult skeletal muscle regeneration<sup>11</sup>. These data suggest that YTHDC1 regulates a wide range of targets important for SC proliferation and muscle development. We have now revised the text in lines 421-427 to clarify the above points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. hnRNPG is identified as YTHDC1's partner in RNA splicing, what is the role of hnRNPG in skeleton muscle development?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the question. The function of hnRNPG in skeletal muscle stem cells and muscle regeneration/development has barely been studied. To demonstrate its functional relevancy in SCs, we have now knocked down hnRNPG in activated satellite cells and found SC proliferation was reduced. The data suggests that YTHDC1 and hnRNPG function synergistically in promoting SC proliferation. The data is included in Figure 7K and in lines 326-329 of the revised text.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>1.
