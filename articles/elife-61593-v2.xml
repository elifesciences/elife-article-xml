(CS) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), serving as instructive signals. The so-called 'all-or-none' character of CSs has been questioned since the CF burst was described. Although recent studies have indicated a sensory-driven enhancement of PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, how CF responds to sensory events and contributes to PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CS remains unexplored. Here, single or simultaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of CFs and PCs in awake mice revealed the presynaptic CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude encoded the sensory input’s strength and directly influenced post-synaptic PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude. The sensory-driven variability in CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude depended on the number of spikes in the CF burst. Finally, the spike number of the CF burst determined the PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and CS properties. These results reveal the direct translation of sensory information-coding CF inputs into PC Ca<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting the sophisticated role of CFs as error signals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>climbing fiber</kwd><kwd>climbing fiber burst</kwd><kwd>purkinje cell calcium</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>sensory coding</kwd><kwd>two-photon calcium imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018R1A5A2025964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Sang Jeong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017M3C7A1029611</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Sang Jeong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016R1D1A1A02937329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Sun Kwang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Purkinje cell dendritic calcium response is finely controlled by the burst activity of climbing fiber during sensory coding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Each Purkinje cell (PC), the sole cerebellar output neuron, receives strong excitatory inputs from the inferior olive (IO) through a single climbing fiber (CF), which innervates several PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eccles et al., 1966</xref>). During cerebellar learning, the CF fires in response to unexpected sensory events to provide instructive signals to the PC, turning on Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediated plasticity mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hansel and Linden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rancz and Häusser, 2006</xref>). According to the Marr–Albus–Ito theory of learning, a CF-induced PC complex spike (CS) response is ‘all-or-none’ because IO stimulation generates seemingly binary responses in the PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Schutter and Maex, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marr, 1969</xref>). This notion has been prevailed as slice studies have show that a single CF stimulation induces similar EPSC (excitatory post-synaptic current) above a certain stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Konnerth et al., 1990</xref>) and is enough to induce parallel fiber (PF)-PC synapse long-term depression (LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>), in which the level of learning is determined by the range of PF excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reynolds and Hartell, 2000</xref>). This means that the CF’s impact has little variation in strength and does not carry quantitative information, although CF input, by controlling the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in PC, could critically affect PF-PC LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohtsuki et al., 2009</xref>). Instead, it is generally accepted that the magnitude of learning is affected by how many invariant CFs synchronously fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Squire, 2009</xref>).</p><p>However, the so-called ‘all-or-none’ property of CF error signal becomes questionable when it comes to in vivo conditions, since the CF’s bursting properties have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mathy et al., 2009</xref>) and a single non-burst stimulation of CF failed to induce associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rasmussen et al., 2013</xref>). In line with this, the previously unknown complexity of the error signal has received attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Najafi and Medina, 2013</xref>). The CF burst reflected the olivary oscillation frequency and the number of spikes ranged from 1 to 3 in anesthetized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mathy et al., 2009</xref>). Also, burst activity seemed to be affected by certain types of visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maruta et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, longer CS duration, presumably resulting from the longer burst, was associated with enhanced cerebellar motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang and Lisberger, 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is thus highly interesting to determine whether and how a CF itself encodes quantitative information of unexpected sensory events, such as differential stimulus intensities, and transmits the error signals in a graded manner to the PC in awake animals. One recent report described the sensory-driven enhancement of PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, in which the authors only observed post-synaptic PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which they claimed non-CF components affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>). Although CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was described in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishiyama et al., 2007</xref>), so far, sensory coding by the CF can hardly be investigated because sensory inputs disappear in ex vivo preparation and the direct recording of the CF axon has been technically infeasible to obtain in vivo except for recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gaffield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaffield et al., 2019</xref>). Using genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) and in vivo 2-photon microscopy imaging of CF and/or PC populations in awake mice, here we show CF burst-mediated sensory coding and its direct representation in a post-synaptic PC. At rest, the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity exhibited highly variable strength and synchrony. Electrophysiological analysis indicated a direct correlation between CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude and the number of spikes in the CF burst. Employing unexpected sensory stimuli, we revealed that CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal encodes sensory stimulus intensity, just as PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity does. Our dual-color simultaneous imaging of CF and PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals also indicated a linear correlation between CF and PC responses in awake animals, suggesting that presynaptic CF inputs carrying sensory information strongly contribute to post-synaptic PC responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is highly variable in strength and associated with the number of spikes in the burst</title><p>CF activities have been indirectly inferred from the signatures of CS in PCs by attached or field potential recordings, which are contaminated with local circuit activities such as those of the PF or molecular interneuron (MLI).

Three weeks later, we performed 2-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in awake, head-fixed mice on a disk treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The coronal projection image of the z-stack indicates the strong fluorescence of CFs that terminate in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b1</xref>). The z-projection image of molecular layer clearly shows CF axonal varicosities in the CFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b2</xref> from the box in 1b1). For accurate identification of simultaneously firing pixels of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reliable signal/event detection, we have utilized Suite2p, an open-source Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging tool, which allows detection of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from axonal varicosities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marius Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>). Suite2p efficiently identified CF varicosities where ones with correlation coefficient of 0.85 were merged in its graphical user interface, while ROIs with low signal-to-noise level are discarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Similar to a previous report about CF-evoked PC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>), the resting state CF firing frequency was 0.85 Hz ±0.24 SEM and the CFs population also showed highly synchronous activity within an imaging field of 208 µm-wide (mediolaterally) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). As the Ca<sup>2+</sup> synchrony of nearby PC dendrites is known to decline through mediolateral separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schultz et al., 2009</xref>), the synchrony level gradually fell as a function of mediolateral distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, CF amplitudes were substantially variable (2.349 ± 1.49 SD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) with maximum being up to 8.366, while the average Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes per cell converged to 2.41 SD ±0.045 SEM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mathy et al., 2009</xref> recorded in vitro CF axonal activity and described its bursting property, which encodes olivary oscillation. Also, EPSC numbers in PC, presumably evoked by the spike number of the CF burst varied between 1 and 3 under anesthesia. Because the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity we observed here was also variable, we asked whether CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is related to the number of spikes in the burst. In cerebellar slices prepared from the mice expressing GCaMP6f in IO, CFs were directly stimulated at the granule cell layer with 1 to 9 spikes in 400 Hz bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Our data indicate that increasing the number of spikes in the burst stimulations accordingly augments the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude, which is saturated with a burst of seven spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), showing that the variability of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is positively correlated with the number of spikes per CF burst. To support this notion, we performed amplitude histogram analysis with in vivo CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes of 3 min recordings. Only first-peak amplitudes within 0.5 s windows were gathered since closely following events can exert an additive effect on amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Interestingly, the distribution appeared discrete, with several amplitude clusters existing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), possibly driven by the number of spikes in the burst. Hence, the huge variability in CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude may be caused by the variable number of CF bursts.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The variable CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity encodes the spike number in the burst.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The sagittal slice image of GCaMP6f-expressed CF in the cerebellar PC and molecular layer.

In this study, we only analyzed data at resting state and excluded images in which the animals are walking or running since locomotion produces complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.

For signal correlation analysis, the correlation coefficient between the CF and PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals was computed. The CF and the identified PC dendrites spatially located in the proximity (&lt;1 μm) with the CF were regarded as ‘paired’ CF-PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,d</xref>), for which the correlation coefficient reveals a close relationship (R = 0.605 ± 0.027 SEM).

First, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in CF axon varicosities in awake mice showed great variability in a resting-state activity. The ex vivo experiments revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity directly reflects the number of spikes in CF bursts. Also, by applying air puffs as sensory stimuli, we found that CF bursts convey quantitative sensory information, just as PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals do. Further, CF-PC dual-color Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging revealed a systemic correlation between pre- and post-synaptic activity during rest. Finally, the number of spikes in the CF burst linearly affected the CS properties and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in PCs. These results suggest that PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and its sensory coding process are largely governed by the sophisticated control of presynaptic CF inputs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The substantial variability of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity stems from its burst activity</title><p>The classical view of olivo-cerebellar transmission is that PC CS is an ‘all-or-none’ response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eccles et al., 1966</xref>). The CF activity itself has also been regarded as having a binary property, but the poor signal-to-noise problem is compensated for by pooling the activity of multiple CFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Najafi and Medina, 2013</xref>). This was further supported by observations that synchronous activity of PC CS is related to cerebellar information processing, such as movements and sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, it has been thought that more significant information is processed when more CFs are activated. However, it remains unresolved whether individual CFs encode parametric information of sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Squire, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The description of CF burst activity in vivo has made the properties of individual CFs appear more complicated than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mathy et al., 2009</xref>). In that study, the recorded number of spikes in the CF burst varied from 1 to 3 in anesthetized animals, making it possible that the spike number reflects the degree or types of certain information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mathy et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, the authors concluded that the spike number may not carry the strength or intensity of sensory inputs, in support of a study in which cat IO neurons showed a unitary spike in response to the stimulation of afferent inputs to IO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crill, 1970</xref>). However, such studies rely on results from anesthetized animals and the physiological role of axon burst has remained unanswered. In our study, we overcame the difficulty of direct CF recording by employing two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and GECI expression in CFs. Also, since general anesthesia disrupts normal neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greenberg et al., 2008</xref>), we performed imaging in awake animals. The open-sources software, Suite2p, enabled us to successfully detect individual CF varicosities and their Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). The paired correlation fell off with increased mediolateral distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), which is similar with the PCs’ correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schultz et al., 2009</xref>). The high variability of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes in awake mice, even during the resting state, was very interesting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,g</xref>). Although small sounds or movement could induce CF firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rushmer et al., 1976</xref>), the maximum amplitude was 8.366 SD, suggesting a highly variable range of fold-change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). This result is in line with a study that reported the number of excitatory post synaptic potentials (EPSPs) of PCs ranges from 1 to 5 during spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maruta et al., 2007</xref>). Also, a recent study reported the variability of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the Crus II lobule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaffield et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, we revealed that the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude was directly regulated by the number of spikes in the CF axon burst stimulation at 400 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>), which suggests that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes are a readout of the degree of bursts. The physiological number of spikes likely ranges from 1 to 6 or seven in an awake state, since the ex vivo CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are saturated in a burst of 7 spikes. The discrete amplitude distribution of in vivo signals further supports the dependency on the spike number in the burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Thus, the great variability of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in awake mice tells us that the spike number in the CF burst also varies even in the resting condition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CF bursts convey sensory information to post-synaptic PCs</title><p>Several reports have shown that PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes convey sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Najafi et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>). We also confirm that PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes differentiate the strength of periocular air-puff stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). If the sensory coding of a PC is derived from presynaptic CF activity, then the CF should differentiate the sensory stimuli and its strength. Here, we observed how sensory input enhanced CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> response which was further enhanced with stronger stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is strong evidence for the critical role of presynaptic CF input in shaping PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> response during unexpected sensory events. Also, the results from dual-color Ca<sup>2+</sup> recording of CF axons and PC dendrites in resting-state revealed that the signal and amplitudes of CF-PC pairs have robust correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is strongly driven by CF burst activity.</p><p>It seems that PF and CF inputs converge onto the same PC during sensory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apps and Garwicz, 2005</xref>). This allows some to argue that PF may contribute to the sensory coding of CF-evoked PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes by showing that small supralinear non-CF inputs were detectable in the absence of CF-induced response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>). However, a recent study reported that silencing CF activity completely abrogated PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaffield et al., 2019</xref>), and it is also unlikely that PF-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is dendrite-wide as CF-evoked responses are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>). Further, the so-called ‘sensory-evoked non-CF inputs’ do not account for the tight coupling of CF-PC activity even during the resting condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). We presume that such non-CF contributions in CF-evoked PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> response are scarce, and PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity—during resting or sensory processing—is mostly determined by CF burst activity. On the other hand, however, CF and PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were not perfectly correlated. Hence, CF activity may serve as a trigger with qualitative information for post-synaptic response, and other factors, such as PC intrinsic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>), PF activity-mediated depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2000</xref>) and noradrenergic pre-synaptic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carey and Regehr, 2009</xref>), may participate to form an even more complex shape of PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CS responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Physiological impacts of CF pre-synaptic governance over PC activity</title><p>What is the meaning of CFs having such powerful and fine control over PCs? First, the strength of the cerebellar output to the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) can be regulated at the level of the CFs’ input magnitudes. It has been thought that an increased population of so-called binary CF activation will generate stronger PC-mediated outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Squire, 2009</xref>). However, our data suggest that individual CFs can provide a differential magnitude of inputs onto PCs, depending on the number of spikes in their burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Considering the high synchrony of CF population activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), they tend to fire simultaneously like PCs do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsutsumi et al., 2015</xref>). On top of that, the graded amplitudes of synchronously firing CFs can help generate a diverse range of cerebellar outputs. Second, the variable CF activities will present more sophisticated error signals to the PC during learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang and Lisberger, 2014</xref> presumed that the CS duration is the critical determinant for the degree of learning, as expected by recording CSs in monkey undergoing smooth pursuit learning. They found that the CS duration tends to be longer in the first 30 trials out of 100. This is also in line with a study showing that the degree of IO stimulation determines the direction of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rasmussen et al., 2013</xref>). We provide direct evidence that CS duration, spikelet number, and PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> are all critically affected by the number of CF bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting that stronger or newer experiences will generate longer CSs with more spikelet number and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity may be strong at first and weaken over time during cerebellum-dependent learning such as during eye-blink conditioning. Also, limiting the spike number to one or two at the initial learning phase will interrupt the learning process. Finally, the degree of learning-associated motor control could also be determined at the IO activity level. Behavioral learning may weaken CF activity over time, thereby decreasing the PC output onto the DCN, which then produces stronger motor output signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Low et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The CF burst depends on the oscillatory state of the IO neurons, which are electrically coupled by gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lampl and Yarom, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mathy et al., 2009</xref>). This oscillatory property is heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoge et al., 2011</xref>), and each olivary neuron has a distinctive and stable oscillatory property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khosrovani et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the cerebellar cortex is compartmentalized in terms of Zebrin II expression in the PC, and the CS pattern also differs by zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cerminara et al., 2015</xref>). We observed that PC and CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> properties differ significantly by zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roh et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we suspect that the heterogeneous property of oscillation of IO neurons, which determines CF burst, may shape the specific patterns of CSs across cortical zones, facilitating diversified control over CSs, and dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the PC.</p><p>This study suggests that CF pre-synaptic activity conveys variable and graded sensory information to post-synaptic PC in vivo, which is in line with other recent studies that denied the long-held ‘all-or-none’ notion for the CF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang and Lisberger, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaffield et al., 2019</xref>). Such graded signal transmission is governed by the state of olivary oscillation—the number of spikes in the burst. Hence, it calls for the investigation of how IO sophisticatedly controls PCs over the whole cerebellum, which will unveil crucial mechanisms for cerebellar learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>B6.129-Tg(<italic>Pcp2</italic>-cre)2Mpin/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:004146">IMSR_JAX:004146</ext-link></td><td>Stock no: 004146</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <italic>M. </italic></td><td>B6.Cg-Tg(<italic>Camk2a</italic>-cre)T29-1Stl/J</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005359">IMSR_JAX:005359</ext-link></td><td>Stock No: 005359</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>AAV1.<italic>Camk2a</italic>.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40</td><td>Upenn Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>AAV1.CAG.FLEX.jRGECO1a.WPRE.SV40</td><td>Upenn Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>AAV1.CAG.FLEX.GFP.WPRE.SV40</td><td>Upenn Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Zoletil</td><td>Virvac</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical coumpound, drug</td><td>Rompun</td><td>Bayer</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Dexamethasone</td><td>Samyang Phamaceutical</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Meloxicam</td><td>Boehringer Ingelheim</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB</td><td>Mathwroks Inc</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002881">SCR_002881</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Python</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008394">SCR_008394</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals, craniotomy, and genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (GECI)</title><p>The experimental processes were approved by the Seoul National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed under the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. Seven- to ten-week-old wild-type or B6.129-Tg(<italic>Pcp2</italic>-cre)2Mpin/J (Jackson Laboratory, ME, USA) mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of Zoletil/Rompun mixture (30 mg / 10 mg/kg). A small craniotomy was made over lobule IV/V of the cerebellar vermis/paravermis according to previous descriptions but with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). In short, after placing the anesthetized mouse on a stereotaxic frame (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan), the skin was incised, and bone was removed with a no.11 surgical blade. To minimize edema and related inflammation, dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg) and meloxicam (20 mg/kg) were administered by subcutaneous injection. A metal ring for head fixation was attached with Superbond dental cement (Sun Medical, Japan). For PC-specific GECI expression, 100–200 nl virus solution of 3–5 × 10<sup>9</sup> genome copies containing AAV1.CAG.FLEX.jRGECO1a.WPRE.SV40 (Upenn Vector Core, PA, USA) were injected at two or three sites at the cerebellar cortex of the <italic>Pcp2-cre</italic> TG mice with a beveled glass pipette (5 MΩ). Then, a 1.3 × 2.3 mm size glass coverslip (Matsunami, Japan) was tightly placed on the cortex and fixed by applying cyanoacrylate glue (Vetbond, 3M). For GCaMP6f expression in CF, the virus was injected into the IO 3–4 days before the creation of a chronic window, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kimpo et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, bilateral injections were made at the midpoint between the edge of the occipital bone and the C1 cervical vertebra. The glass pipette was set at a 55° angle from vertical and 7° from the midline. After approaching a 2.5 mm depth, virus solution containing 100–200 nl of AAV1.<italic>Camk2a</italic>.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 was injected with a Picopump at 5 nl / sec. The pipettes were left in place for 10 min before they were removed to minimize backflowing.

Excitation was carried out with a mode-locked titanium:sapphire laser system (Chameleon, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) operating at a 900 nm wavelength for GCaMP6f using GFP filter and 1030 nm for jRGECO1a using RFP filter. Generally, objective W Plan-Apochromat 20×, 1.0 numerical aperture (Carl Zeiss) was used. Images were acquired using ZEN software (Zeiss Efficient Navigation, Carl Zeiss) and processed using a custom-written MATLAB (MathWorks) script. High-resolution of 512 × 512 pixel reference images were acquired at a rate of 8 s per frame in the PC layer (120–150 μm from the dura) and molecular layer (around 20–60 μm from the dura). For the 3D Z-stack images of the CF, 512 × 512 pixel images were acquired at every 2 µm from the dura to a 180 µm depth using the depth correction mode by ZEN. For PC and CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, 32 Hz high-speed time-lapse scanning was performed with a 512 × 64 resolution window at 30–50 μm from the dura. For awake imaging, 10 days after chronic window surgery, the mice were subjected to handling until they show grooming (5–10 min) as well as acclimation on a custom-made disk treadmill with their head fixed using a clamp and custom-made metal rings (30–60 min) for 3 days. Imaging was performed 14 days after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>CF varicosity and PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal analysis</title><p>CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data were processed and analyzed with the open-source analysis tool Suite2p which efficiently detects Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals both at individual axonal varicocities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marius Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>). After motion correction and source extraction by Suite2p, the ROIs with low signal-to-noise ratio were discarded and ones with proper size/morphology were selected for analysis in the Suite2p’s graphic user interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). If ROIs are located in the similar parasagittal plane (~20 µm) and their correlation coefficient of signals are above 0.85, the pairs were merged in Suite2p. Then fluorescence signals (F) were subtracted with neurophil (background) signals and the signals were z-score normalized for further analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/NeuRoh1/Calcium_signal_processing">https://github.com/NeuRoh1/Calcium_signal_processing</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roh, 2020</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:rev:b0732bd900ccf0e198f52818366f93715a49cea6">swh:1:rev:b0732bd900ccf0e198f52818366f93715a49cea6)</ext-link>. The event detection was performed using Suite2p’s built-in deconvolution (tau: 0.4, window for maximum: 60, smoothing constant for gaussian filter: 25), and the deconvolved signals were scaled to match the amplitude of the z-scored F signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The amplitudes of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were obtained from peak values of detected events. To ensure the event detection quality, the events with amplitudes lower than 0.5 SD were discarded. To analyze the synchrony of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes, Pearson’s correlation coefficients for the firing patterns between every pair of ROIs were computed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). For ‘synchrony by mediolateral distance’ analysis, the mediolateral distance between pairs of all ROIs was obtained with ImageJ and paired with the corresponding calculated R values for correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals imaged with jRGECO1a were similarly processed with Suite2p. The ROIs of PC dendrites were selected based on their structural identity that appears elongated along anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ozden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schultz et al., 2009</xref>) and signal quality. Over-segmented ROIs were merged in Suite2p. For all analyses of CF and PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we only included resting-state data and excluded the images during locomotion as we are interested in sensory processing, and it generates many complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Two-photon dual-color Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and analysis</title><p>For simultaneous imaging of the CF and PC, AAV1.<italic>Camk2</italic>.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 was first bilaterally injected into the IO; after 1–3 days, AAV1.CAG.FLEX.jRGECO1a.WPRE.SV40 was then injected into the cerebellar cortex in <italic>Pcp2-cre</italic> TG mice while creating a chronic imaging window. The cerebellar cortex was excited with a 1000 nm wavelength, and the signals for GFP and RFP filters were simultaneously acquired. The CF varicosity and the PC dendrite were regarded as a pair when they spatially overlap and their signals are significantly similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>). To examine the relationship between CF and PC, we performed correlation analysis of the signals and of paired amplitudes. For the signal-correlation analysis, we computed the correlation coefficient between signals of each pair with MATLAB. If PC dendrites were spatially overlapped with CF, they were considered ‘paired’ CF-PC. The CF and the PC dendrites that were not overlapped were regarded as ‘unpaired’ CF-PC, which were further categorized as ‘neighboring unpaired’ if their boarders meet within 30 µm and ‘distant unpaired’ if the borders were separated by more than 30 µm. The signal correlations were compared in the four conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). For the amplitude-correlation analysis, the paired CF and PC amplitudes were collected where CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> events occurred.

Briefly, the sensory stimulation and motion tracking were synchronized with two-photon imaging through a trigger generated by the program. Periocular air puffs lasting 30 ms were delivered with a Pneumatic Picopump (WPI, USA) at 5 s intervals, at 20 (P1) or 50 (P2) psi. Animal motion was acquired at 64 Hz using a high-speed CCD camera (IPX-VGA210, IMPERX, USA) under infrared (IR) illumination (DR4-56R-IR85, LVS, S. Korea). Motion tracking was achieved by tracking the IR-reflective patches (4 mm diameter) attached to the mice’s forepaws. The velocity of the patch calculated on two dimensions (X and Y axes) was considered to be the animals’ velocity of motion. Small forepaw movements induced by air-puff stimulation were successfully tracked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). To analyze the correlation between motion strength and CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude, the peak speeds were acquired within 200 ms after the onset of spontaneous CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (for correlation during rest) or air-puff stimulation (for correlation during air puffs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–h</xref>).

This question is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of cerebellar learning, because climbing fibers produce an instructional signal that can drive both heterosynaptic plasticity at cerebellar Purkinje cell synapses as well as some forms of motor learning. While classical theories of cerebellar learning treat climbing fiber input as an all-or-none binary signal, recent work has questioned this doctrine by demonstrating graded climbing fiber responses recorded postsynaptically at Purkinje cells, and currently it remains unresolved how such graded responses are generated.</p><p>Here the authors propose that the number of spikes in high frequency burst firing of olivary cells could be the main determinant of postsynaptic calcium influx amplitude in Purkinje cells. If demonstrated, this would constitute a new and exciting result with deep consequence on our understanding of cerebellar supervised learning. The authors perform simultaneous calcium recordings of CF varicosities and of their postsynaptic Purkinje cells in vivo during behavior and describe a strong correlation in amplitude between presynaptic and postsynaptic signals, suggesting that presynaptic burst size may control the postsynaptic response.</p><p>The authors show nicely that, as has been reported for postsynaptic PC responses, climbing fiber inputs represent levels of sensory stimulation in a graded manner. The major conclusion of this study is that the variability in Purkinje cell dendritic calcium signal amplitude and magnitude/duration of complex spikes are a direct result of variability in the size of climbing fiber input in vivo during sensory processing. While none of the data presented in this paper contradict this claim, the data presented are all either partial or circumstantial in support of this conclusion. Moreover, there are substantial technical concerns regarding the imaging analysis and data interpretation. If the authors can address these concerns to convincingly demonstrate that the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are governed by the number of spikes in CF, and that these signals truly co-vary with the postsynaptic response, the reviewers believe the paper would be of significant interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The quantification of calcium imaging data</p><p>a) The legend of Figure 1 states that &quot;independent ROIs&quot; were selected. It is unclear how ROI selection was made for CF boutons – was this manual? And how were ROI's clustered into independent CFs, i.e., how was independence determined? A single climbing fiber makes many varicosities and innervates multiple Purkinje cells. This figure quantifies both climbing fiber firing frequency and synchrony, measurements that rely on measurements from unique climbing fibers. A simple spatial segregation of ROIs may not be sufficient to establish such independence. Observation of Figure 1C-E suggests that several of the ROIs actually correspond to the same climbing fiber, given their near perfect correlation. In particular, it looks like some ROIs that were analyzed separately may correspond to a single CF e.g. ROIs 2-3 and 4-5 in Figure 1. Related to this point, it is unclear why the correlation matrix heatmap in Figure 1E is smoothed. This is both confusing and misleading.</p><p>b) They state &quot;Hence the results indicate that the variability of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity arises from its differential spike number of burst&quot;. I assume that the authors mean by this that the variability in CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude is mainly driven by the number of spikes in the olivary response underlying it. Figure 1G is where they show the distribution of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes in vivo. One presumes that this plot is obtained by aggregating all the data from the 60 cells they recorded. Therefore it stands to reason that a lot of the variability in the amplitudes is actually driven by cell to cell variation rather than the number of spikes in the burst. Indeed, this suspicion is supported by Figure 2D, where it is obvious that CF calcium amplitudes vary widely from cell to cell for a fixed number of spikes in the burst. To strengthen their conclusions, they should analyse their in-vivo data differently: rather than lumping all the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses from all the cells together, have they tried plotting amplitude histograms for each individual recording? If they could show separate peaks in such a histogram, that would represent quite convincing evidence that the amplitude of their CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are being driven by the number of spikes in the olivary burst. They could consider getting a population histogram by normalizing each cell's data to the first peak in its histogram.</p><p>c) The authors report correlation coefficient values for CF boutons in Figure 1H, but it is unclear over what spatial extent these were calculated. It would be more useful to report these as a function of mediolateral distance. An important, and easily testable prediction would be that these correlations should fall off at a similar spatial scale as Purkinje cell dendritic calcium signals (as in Ozden et al., J. Neuroscience, 2009, Figure 1D or Gaffield et al., J. Neurophysiology, 2016, Figure 4B). This sort of analysis may also provide a useful metric for defining CF ROIs that correspond to the same olivary neuron, as these are likely to exhibit higher correlations that may be represented as outliers to distribution that decays smoothly as a function of space (as observed for Purkinje cell calcium imaging).</p><p>d) There are now a variety of freely available software suites, such as CaImAn (https://elifesciences.org/articles/38173) or Suite2p (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/061507v2), that allow for rigorous and standardized selection, curation, and analysis of imaging data. It may be advisable to use such tools for data analysis.</p><p>e) There are also no examples of how event detection was performed on the imaging data. It would be useful to show example traces with detected events. This is particularly important in Figure 4, where correspondence between CF imaging and PC imaging is necessary. Similar to the point above about image segmentation, there are also a variety of freely-available software suites that allow for event detection. It may be useful to use these. The reported methods state that signals were detected using a single threshold, but event detection algorithms take indicator kinetics into account to detect events with a particular shape (i.e. fast rise, slow decay) that match the likely waveforms of real events. In particular, I would recommend MLspike, which is well-suited for detecting sparse events that may overlap in time (https://github.com/MLspike/spikes).</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, there is a systematic lack of reporting of how many animals were used, how many repetitions were performed for different sets of experiments, and how group statistics were calculated:</p><p>a) Figure 1F-H: please report how many ROIs, how many fields of view, and how many mice were used in these analyses (and if any ROIs were resampled. The only mention of the number of samples here is regarding Figure 1H, and it states that the data come from 10 recordings (without mentioning the number of ROIs per recording, the number of recordings per animal, or the number of animals).</p><p>b) Figure 2: the data appear to be pooled from 9 CF imaged in 3 mice and the mean(?) response for each CF is shown as a thin line in Figure 2C, while the mean response across CFs is shown as a thick red line. It is unclear how many repetitions were performed per imaged CF. Furthermore, it is unclear whether a single, small, round ROI (i.e. a single bouton) was chosen as an ROI for each CF or whether multiple boutons were averaged per CF. Finally, it appears that a statistical comparison was only made between the single stimulation group and the other conditions. Are the other groups (i.e. 3, 5, 7, and 9 stimulations) different from each other?</p><p>c) Figure 3F-H: it is unclear how many CF boutons were in to the reported number of events. Given that there are several “event data points” (y-axis) for each &quot;speed data point” (x-axis), it appears that multiple CFs were imaged simultaneously. This should be made explicit.</p><p>d) Figure 4: it is unclear how many CF-PC pairs went into the 184 “events” that are reported in panel D. It is also not clear if CF or PC transients were used to define these “events.” The example Purkinje cell ROI in panel B is also inconsistent in size and shape with the criteria reported in the manuscript's methods. Analyzing these data carefully is crucial, since the main conceptual advance of the paper is to show that CF signal amplitudes co-vary systematically with postsynaptic PC signal amplitudes.</p><p>e) The main observation of the paper, the correlation in Figure 4D, raises many questions. First, only 184 events are plotted, corresponding to about 3 minutes of recording overall. This is a very small number of observations for 3 mice, as many varicosity/dendrite appositions should be visible in a single field of view. Most importantly, the number of independent pre/post pairs is not stated and all the data are pooled. Thus co-variation in signal intensity between pairs could be mistaken for co-variation within a pair. Indeed, Figure 2C shows a ten-fold variation in DF/F from one CF to the other, which should obscure the correlation in Figure 4D. Astonishingly, in vitro transients saturate at about 50 % DF/F (Figure 1C) for long bursts, while in vivo calcium transients in varicosities range from 80 % to 700 % (Figure 1D,G and 4C,D). All these issues should be addressed and in particular correlation should be established pair by pair, with many more events, not for the whole set of data.</p><p>f) Figure 5: There is no mention of the number of repetitions that were performed per cell here.</p><p>3) Small structures such as the varicosities imaged here can easily move into and out of the focal plane when there is subtle brain movement, producing artificially larger DF/F responses. There is no mention in the methods or figures of how motion correction was applied to bouton imaging data, which is likely to contain motion artifacts because the animals were awake and locomoting and the imaged structures are quite small. Was such correction done? If so, how? This is particularly striking, given how stable the baseline appears in Figures 1D, 3B-C If any transient movement (not necessarily the paw movement) is correlated with the intensity of stimulation, this could produce the “graded” responses in Figure 3. Movement artifacts could be assessed by imaging GFP in climbing fiber varicosities during stimulation, or by demonstrating that any other stimulus-induced movement is correlated in amplitude with paw movement. Related to this point, it is not clear to me what is plotted in Figure 3 F and H.</p><p>4) The contribution of movement to “sensory driven” responses is not sufficiently characterized.</p><p>a) The authors use IR tracking of a forepaw to reveal animal movement, but a periocular air puff is likely to produce orofacial movements not captured by paw tracking. The authors show no correlation between the amplitude of paw movements and peak calcium transients, but paw motion may not be the relevant movement that enhances climbing fiber responses in this recording location. The authors should demonstrate that the amplitude of paw movements correlates with the amplitude of any other movements generated by the air puff, or if that is not possible, at the very least, allow for this possible confound in their data.</p><p>b) If I understand Figure 3 G correctly, a transient paw movement is triggered by air puff stimulation. Is this distinct from the movement plotted in Figure 3 F and H, which appears to be a peak paw speed associated with running at the time of stimulation in H, and in absence of stimulation in F? Clearly in F, there is no stimulation, so paw movements must be related to running? In any case, it is not evident that running speed in panel F and the transient (unexpected) paw movement generated by puffs are the same. If not, there may be a correlation between the transient paw movement and climbing fiber activity independent of running.</p><p>5) The literature demonstrating the influence of postsynaptic factors on the CF calcium transient in Purkinje cells (Kitamura and Hausser 2011, Otsu et al. 2014, Gaffield et al. 2018 to cite only a few recent) is mostly overlooked. Similarly, presynaptic modulations able to change presynaptic calcium influx in CF varicosities and therefore glutamate release should be discussed, as a possible additional source of variability on top of the number of spikes in bursts.</p><p>There are several assertions made in the paper regarding the relationship between CF bursts (action potentials) and CF axonal calcium responses. While portions of the statements made by the authors are true, they sometimes apply faulty logic to arrive at their conclusions. Specifically:</p><p>a) “ Our data indicate that increasing the number of burst stimulation</p><p>significantly augments the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude, which is saturated at 7 bursts (Figure 2C,D).”: – While it is true (as the authors show) that increasing the stim number in a burst increases the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal amplitude, this does not definitively prove their next sentence “…the variability CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity arises from its differential spike number of burst.” Just because the first statement is true, does not mean the second one (its converse) is also true.</p><p>b) Results related to Figure 5 – The title of this section is “The spike number of CF burst determines the amplitudes of PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response.” While their data show that these events are correlated, this statement is not uniquely true. For example, Wang et al. (Nature Neuro, 2000), Kitamura and Hausser (J. Neuroscience, 2011), and others have demonstrated that PC dendritic calcium signals are related to the interactions between PF inputs, CF inputs, and the intrinsic properties of PCs. Thus, the authors' statement is not uniquely true.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Direct Translation of Climbing Fiber Burst-Mediated Sensory Coding into Post-Synaptic Purkinje Cell Dendritic Calcium&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although the reviewers were appreciative of your efforts to improve the manuscript with this revision, it was agreed in the consultation phase that the original technical concerns persist and have not been sufficiently overcome. In particular, the issues raised by reviewer 1 about ROI detection, quantification of event amplitudes, and the identification of CF-PC pairs are seen as critical and were not perceived to be adequately defended in the manuscript. Given these concerns, together with the lack of significant differences between the unpaired neighbors and the paired neighbors, the reviewers do not believe that the conclusion that climbing fiber (CF) high frequency bursts are responsible for the graded amplitude of the postsynaptic calcium transients in the Purkinje cells (PCs) is adequately supported by the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the revised version of their paper, the authors have performed an extensive new analysis of their dataset using state of the art methods. Data are quantified and displayed in a more detailed way and the paper is overall substantially improved. However, the results still fail to support convincingly the main conclusion of the paper, namely that climbing fiber (CF) high frequency bursts are responsible for the graded amplitude of the postsynaptic calcium transients in the Purkinje cells (PCs). The identification of individual CFs is problematic, and equating CF calcium transient amplitude with CF firing bursts remains correlative. Furthermore, the claim that CF-PC pairs are recorded does not seem warranted based on the data provided. In conclusion the correlations between CF and PC may result from other factors than the proposed burst coding.</p><p>1) The main issue still arises from the identification of CF ROIs and CF-PC pairs, a problem raised in the first round of reviews. The additional data provided in the revised version strongly suggest that CF ROIs defined by the authors encompass multiple CFs.</p><p>a) Morphological arguments</p><p>All data from the literature that traced the projections of single olivary cells point to the fact that the target Purkinje cells are not clustered at a given antero-posterior position but randomly spread in a thin parasagittal band. Therefore, each climbing fiber should only encompass a few varicosities in strict parasagittal alignment within a single PC dendrite, much thinner than the average 30 µm extension described in the paper.</p><p>b) Functional arguments</p><p>Functional studies on PC calcium transients indicate that PC cells displaying calcium transients with close to 100 % synchrony (hence receiving the same CF) are the exception rather than the rule (Ozden et al. 2009). Careful observation of the movies in the present dataset indicates that the only varicosities that display 100 % synchrony in their calcium transients are indeed strictly in parasagital alignment, hence contacting a single Purkinje cell.</p><p>c) In conclusion, the authors should detect events on single varicosities, which are easily identified manually and then check for 100% correlation to group varicosities in a single CF. It is hard to understand why the automatic algorithm defines such contorted ROIs covering large regions with no detectable signal. High level of correlation between nearby CF and poor signal to noise levels (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) may explain the pooling of multiple CFs in a single ROI.</p><p>2) The improper identification of single climbing fibers affects the interpretation of the supposed paired recordings of Figure 4. CF1 in Figure 4B and D seems to be two fibers, one contacting PC1 and the other PC3. However, correlation with PC2, on which there is no contact appears as good, probably because PC1 and PC2 are themselves highly correlated. More intriguing, some calcium events which are obvious in PCs 1-3 of the color raster of Figure 4D do not show in the CF1. This may indicate that this(ese) CF do not actually contact these PCs or that detection of CF events is improper. All calcium transients seen in the PC should be found in the CF and conversely.</p><p>Panels 4G-H provide a much improved analysis of the paired data, based on individual CF-PC pairs. However, considering that CF ROIs cover multiple CFs, they can be interpreted in terms of CF population synchrony. Larger CF transients would correspond to multiple CF being active at the same time, which would in turn translate in larger PC transients, as the link between population synchrony and PC calcium transients has already been described by Najafi et al. (2014). This does not preclude burst coding to be participating to the graded encoding of synchrony, as larger errors may both stimulate more olivary cells and trigger bursts, but the data do not convincingly demonstrate this point. In particular the CF-PC correlation is not significantly different between paired and neighbor unpaired, in line with the interpretation that correlation results from populational synchrony at short distance and not from direct pairing.</p><p>3) Quantification of the transients is also a problem. It is entirely unclear how events are detected after non-negative deconvolution and denoising (which may be subject to caution given the signal to noise of the recordings and the possibility of overfitting, see Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Failure to detect close-by events may arise in the report of artificially large event amplitudes. When multiple events are detected does the amplitude correspond to the summed peak of the DF/F trace or to the actual individual events amplitudes?</p><p>The very large amplitude of the CF transients (more than 2000 % in Figure 1) is surprising, as it may exceed the dynamic range of GCaMP6, particularly considering that ROIs cover large regions without any signal. Baseline subtraction, which may explain these large numbers if excess subtraction is applied, appears to be a recurrent issue in the paper with some panels displaying very low background noise (RFP in Figure 4 supplement 1a) and other very high (GFP in the same figure and in panel 1B).</p><p>Furthermore, the signals appear saturated in many of the figures as well as in the movies, which does not really allow to judge the dynamic range and shape of the activated elements. The two movies have compression issues which do not allow clear visualization on a frame by frame mode.</p><p>Finally, data of Figure 4 and the two movies originate from the same field of view and the two movies represent the same 20s but with very different levels of background subtraction and saturation. It is hard to understand why the same data are presented twice, and why not provide a more extensive sample of the data. Is it on purpose? If so, it should be explicitly mentioned.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Roh et al. have revised their manuscript to sufficiently account for my previous concerns, most importantly by re-analyzing all of their calcium imaging data and enhancing the transparency of their data and methodological reporting.</p><p>Notably, I still have some concerns over the role of movement in the amplitude of the reported signals. The authors correlate DF/F with paw speed, but not the amplitude of paw movement, or any other movements the animals make in response to airpuff stimulation. However, they now perform additional controls suggesting that imaging artifacts from bouton movement do not contribute to their results, and they have tempered their conclusions regarding the role of movement appropriately. Given the challenging nature of this problem, the level with which the authors have now addressed the role of movement seems reasonable. Likewise, the enhanced analysis of “independent” CF ROIs remains less than airtight, but in my opinion now meets a reasonable standard.</p><p>Finally, there remain some typos, and some odd writing choices.

Here we have utilized CaImAn, the open source software tool to detect single CFs (Giovannucci et al., 2019). It includes non-rigid motion correction, constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) algorithm for source extraction and sparse non-negative deconvolution for event detection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) The legend of Figure 1 states that &quot;independent ROIs&quot; were selected. It is unclear how ROI selection was made for CF boutons – was this manual? And how were ROI's clustered into independent CFs, i.e., how was independence determined? A single climbing fiber makes many varicosities and innervates multiple Purkinje cells. This figure quantifies both climbing fiber firing frequency and synchrony, measurements that rely on measurements from unique climbing fibers. A simple spatial segregation of ROIs may not be sufficient to establish such independence. Observation of Figure 1C-E suggests that several of the ROIs actually correspond to the same climbing fiber, given their near perfect correlation. In particular, it looks like some ROIs that were analyzed separately may correspond to a single CF e.g. ROIs 2-3 and 4-5 in Figure 1. Related to this point, it is unclear why the correlation matrix heatmap in Figure 1E is smoothed. This is both confusing and misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>As CaImAn was designed to be suitable for soma calcium signal detection, we slightly modified the analysis protocol by selecting the initialization method as “sparse NMF,” a method that is appropriate for detecting arbitrary structures such as axons rather than circular soma. Processing CF calcium imaging data with CaImAn gave many ROIs that are overlapping each other, so we performed manual curation of ROIs (4 out of 12 ROIs) and the ones overlapping or with bad signal were excluded by a human expert. This process was depicted in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Independent CFs were well identified as axonal arborization structures that have mediolateral size of about 30.2 µm in average (Figure 1C, D, G) and their synchrony are moderately reduced with mediolateral separation (Figure 1E, F). Thus, we have successfully detected independent CFs and their calcium signals using the modified CaImAn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) They state &quot;Hence the results indicate that the variability of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity arises from its differential spike number of burst&quot;. I assume that the authors mean by this that the variability in CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude is mainly driven by the number of spikes in the olivary response underlying it. Figure 1G is where they show the distribution of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes in vivo. One presumes that this plot is obtained by aggregating all the data from the 60 cells they recorded. Therefore it stands to reason that a lot of the variability in the amplitudes is actually driven by cell to cell variation rather than the number of spikes in the burst. Indeed, this suspicion is supported by Figure 2D, where it is obvious that CF calcium amplitudes vary widely from cell to cell for a fixed number of spikes in the burst. To strengthen their conclusions, they should analyse their in-vivo data differently: rather than lumping all the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses from all the cells together, have they tried plotting amplitude histograms for each individual recording? If they could show separate peaks in such a histogram, that would represent quite convincing evidence that the amplitude of their CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are being driven by the number of spikes in the olivary burst. They could consider getting a population histogram by normalizing each cell's data to the first peak in its histogram.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have plotted amplitude histograms for each individual 3 minute recording for 11 cells (Figure 2D, E). As calcium spikes closely following the 1<sup>st</sup> event will present an additive effect on amplitudes, only events within the first 0.5 seconds were used for analysis, as shown in Figure 2D. The amplitude histogram for the 11 cells shows a “discrete” distribution, suggesting several clusters of events with similar amplitudes (Figure 2E). These data would suggest that CF calcium responses are driven by the number of spikes in the olivary burst.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The authors report correlation coefficient values for CF boutons in Figure 1H, but it is unclear over what spatial extent these were calculated. It would be more useful to report these as a function of mediolateral distance. An important, and easily testable prediction would be that these correlations should fall off at a similar spatial scale as Purkinje cell dendritic calcium signals (as in Ozden et al., J. Neuroscience, 2009, Figure 1D or Gaffield et al., J. Neurophysiology, 2016, Figure 4B). This sort of analysis may also provide a useful metric for defining CF ROIs that correspond to the same olivary neuron, as these are likely to exhibit higher correlations that may be represented as outliers to distribution that decays smoothly as a function of space (as observed for Purkinje cell calcium imaging).</p></disp-quote><p>We have computed synchrony values between CFs in terms of mediolateral distance (Figure 1F). Similar to the previous results from the Purkinje cell calcium imaging, the correlation decreased as a function of distance. The identification of CF ROIs was carried out by clustering pixels that fire together using the CaImAn CNMF algorithm. The average mediolateral width of CF ROIs was 30.2 ± 2.9 (SEM) µm with the largest at 75.8 µm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) There are now a variety of freely available software suites, such as CaImAn (https://elifesciences.org/articles/38173) or Suite2p (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/061507v2), that allow for rigorous and standardized selection, curation, and analysis of imaging data. It may be advisable to use such tools for data analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have successfully adapted CaImAn to CF calcium signal analysis in combination with human expert curation for selecting ROIs out of a suggested ROI set. We have uploaded the code that runs CaImAn for CF Ca2<sup>+</sup> signal analysis including the parameters as well as the code that performs curation to</p><p>GitHub repository (https://github.com/NeuRoh1/Calcium-analysis-tools).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) There are also no examples of how event detection was performed on the imaging data. It would be useful to show example traces with detected events. This is particularly important in Figure 4, where correspondence between CF imaging and PC imaging is necessary. Similar to the point above about image segmentation, there are also a variety of freely-available software suites that allow for event detection. It may be useful to use these. The reported methods state that signals were detected using a single threshold, but event detection algorithms take indicator kinetics into account to detect events with a particular shape (i.e. fast rise, slow decay) that match the likely waveforms of real events. In particular, I would recommend MLspike, which is well-suited for detecting sparse events that may overlap in time (https://github.com/MLspike/spikes).</p></disp-quote><p>In this revision, we have utilized the non-negative deconvolution method (Vogelstein et al., 2010), which has been used for PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> event detection (Gaffield et al., 2016), as well as CF and PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> event detection (CaImAn also utilizes this algorithm). As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1b and Figure 3—figure supplement 2c, event detection was successful for each cell type. The event detection of CF-PC pairs from dual imaging also reveals a high degree of correspondence (Figure 4C).</p><p>As for PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> analysis, we first performed non-rigid motion correction (NoRMCorre), and manually selected PC dendrites based on the structural uniformity and signal properties (human expert). The event detection was performed using sparse non-negative deconvolution algorithm (Vogelstein et al., 2010). For the source extraction, we’ve tried principle component analysis followed by independent component analysis (PCA/ICA) (Mukamel et al., 2009). However, the signal quality has no advantages against human expert analysis supported by NoRMCorre and deconvolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Also, as PCA/ICA processing misses some ROIs, we proceeded with human expert ROI selection (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61593-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, there is a systematic lack of reporting of how many animals were used, how many repetitions were performed for different sets of experiments, and how group statistics were calculated:</p><p>a) Figure 1F-H: please report how many ROIs, how many fields of view, and how many mice were used in these analyses (and if any ROIs were resampled.

It is unclear how many repetitions were performed per imaged CF. Furthermore, it is unclear whether a single, small, round ROI (i.e. a single bouton) was chosen as an ROI for each CF or whether multiple boutons were averaged per CF. Finally, it appears that a statistical comparison was only made between the single stimulation group and the other conditions. Are the other groups (i.e. 3, 5, 7, and 9 stimulations) different from each other?</p></disp-quote><p>Five round CF axonal varicosities of &lt; 2 µm that respond to stimuli were chosen as ROIs and then averaged for a single CF trace. 1 or 2 repetitions were performed and traces were randomly selected for analysis.

It is also not clear if CF or PC transients were used to define these “events.” The example Purkinje cell ROI in panel B is also inconsistent in size and shape with the criteria reported in the manuscript's methods. Analyzing these data carefully is crucial, since the main conceptual advance of the paper is to show that CF signal amplitudes co-vary systematically with postsynaptic PC signal amplitudes.</p></disp-quote><p>We take this comment very seriously and as such performed an in-depth correlation analysis between CF and PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals: this included signal correlation as well as amplitude correlation analysis. We first identified CF signals by CaImAn and selected PC dendrites within the established CF territories. These pairs are regarded as “paired” CF-PC. When the PC dendrites are out of the CF territories, they are regarded as “unpaired” CF-PC (Figure 4B-D). Such “unpaired” CF-PC were further categorized as “neighboring unpaired” if CFs’ borders are touching each other and “distant unpaired” if the borders are at least 30 µm apart. Here, we report highest signal correlation in paired CF-PC with reduced correlation depending on mediolateral distance (Figure 4C,D). For the amplitude correlation analysis, CF and PC amplitudes were used where CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients take place. The number of events, pairs, recording session, and animal numbers are clearly stated in the figure legend (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The main observation of the paper, the correlation in Figure 4D, raises many questions. First, only 184 events are plotted, corresponding to about 3 minutes of recording overall. This is a very small number of observations for 3 mice, as many varicosity/dendrite appositions should be visible in a single field of view. Most importantly, the number of independent pre/post pairs is not stated and all the data are pooled. Thus co-variation in signal intensity between pairs could be mistaken for co-variation within a pair. Indeed, Figure 2C shows a ten-fold variation in DF/F from one CF to the other, which should obscure the correlation in Figure 4D. Astonishingly, in vitro transients saturate at about 50 % DF/F (Figure 1c) for long bursts, while in vivo calcium transients in varicosities range from 80 % to 700 % (Figure 1D,G and 4C,D). All these issues should be addressed and in particular correlation should be established pair by pair, with many more events, not for the whole set of data.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have established the correlation pair by pair with a larger number of event pairs (1661 pairs) in this revision (Figure 4E-G). We provide pair by pair correlation for 19 CF-PC pairs (Figure 4G), while presenting the example of correlation of single pair (Figure 4E) and 1CF-3PC pairs (Figure 4F). Although there is a discrepancy in amplitude saturation between in vitro and in vivo transients, there are apparently many differences between them, such as imaging condition (widefield imaging vs 2-photon imaging), health of sample (sliced brain tissue vs intact brain), and baseline intensity (already increased in slice vs very low baseline). We also provide a video for the CF-PC dual imaging (Video 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Figure 5: There is no mention of the number of repetitions that were performed per cell here.</p></disp-quote><p>Now we state that the number of experiments is “7 recordings of 7 independent cells from 3 mice” (Figure 5). 1 or 2 repetitions were performed, but only the representative data were analyzed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Small structures such as the varicosities imaged here can easily move into and out of the focal plane when there is subtle brain movement, producing artificially larger DF/F responses. There is no mention in the methods or figures of how motion correction was applied to bouton imaging data, which is likely to contain motion artifacts because the animals were awake and locomoting and the imaged structures are quite small. Was such correction done? If so, how? This is particularly striking, given how stable the baseline appears in Figures 1D, 3B-C If any transient movement (not necessarily the paw movement) is correlated with the intensity of stimulation, this could produce the “graded” responses in Figure 3. Movement artifacts could be assessed by imaging GFP in climbing fiber varicosities during stimulation, or by demonstrating that any other stimulus-induced movement is correlated in amplitude with paw movement. Related to this point, it is not clear to me what is plotted in Figure 3 F and H.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revision, we processed and analyzed all CF data with CaImAn, which includes motion correction by “non-rigid motion correction (NoRMCorre)” (Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017). It gives a very stable video, which is uploaded as a video file for the CF-PC dual color imaging (Video 2). Moreover, CaImAn employs a template-matching algorithm to detect calcium events with fast rise and slow decay. Also, here we present 2-photon in vivo GFP imaging results under periocular air puff stimulation. These results show that air puff-induced movement is not deforming to CF-GFP and PC-GFP for both P1 and P2 stimulation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We also present a video showing before and after motion correction using NoRMCorre for both CF and PC during air puff stimulation (Video 2).</p><p>Previously we did not clearly describe that the motion we observed was not locomotion or walking/running but rather a subtle twitch-like movement of the forepaw induced by air puff stimulation. We apologize for any confusion the omission of this detail may have caused. We exclude the recordings where animals walk or run because we are interested in sensory coding at rest and locomotion produces a lot of complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Figure 3F,H presents the correlation of CF calcium amplitude and forepaw twitch movement at rest. We claim that air puff stimulation-induced CF calcium transient is not related to the peak speed of air puff-induced twitch movement. These additional details and clarifications are now included in the Results and Materials and methods sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The contribution of movement to “sensory driven” responses is not sufficiently characterized.</p><p>a) The authors use IR tracking of a forepaw to reveal animal movement, but a periocular air puff is likely to produce orofacial movements not captured by paw tracking. The authors show no correlation between the amplitude of paw movements and peak calcium transients, but paw motion may not be the relevant movement that enhances climbing fiber responses in this recording location. The authors should demonstrate that the amplitude of paw movements correlates with the amplitude of any other movements generated by the air puff, or if that is not possible, at the very least, allow for this possible confound in their data.</p></disp-quote><p>The movement we observed is a general movement for an unexpected stimulus. Although we have observed that eyeblink and forepaw movement occur simultaneously upon stimulation, we have now clearly stated the possibility of a confounding link to any other movements generated by air puff: “Although we did not examine any other movements related to air-puff stimulation, such as orofacial movement, we suggest that the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity could differentiate the graded sensory stimuli but not movement strength in an assumption that fore-paw motion is representing startle movement during air-puff stimulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) If I understand Figure 3G correctly, a transient paw movement is triggered by air puff stimulation. Is this distinct from the movement plotted in Figure 3F and H, which appears to be a peak paw speed associated with running at the time of stimulation in H, and in absence of stimulation in F? Clearly in F, there is no stimulation, so paw movements must be related to running? In any case, it is not evident that running speed in panel F and the transient (unexpected) paw movement generated by puffs are the same. If not, there may be a correlation between the transient paw movement and climbing fiber activity independent of running.</p></disp-quote><p>The confusion the reviewer indicated is because we previously did not state that we excluded the data with locomotion (see also our response to the above comment #3). The “spontaneous response” data in Figure 3F are limited to small and transient movements with CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> events but not during walking or running. The peak speed is defined by the peak speed of fore-paw speed within 200 ms after the movement onset for spontaneous response (Figure 3F) or stimulation onset for air puff-induced movement (Figure 3H). These definitions are now described in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The literature demonstrating the influence of postsynaptic factors on the CF calcium transient in Purkinje cells (Kitamura and Hausser 2011, Otsu et al. 2014, Gaffield et al. 2018 to cite only a few recent) is mostly overlooked. Similarly, presynaptic modulations able to change presynaptic calcium influx in CF varicosities and therefore glutamate release should be discussed, as a possible additional source of variability on top of the number of spikes in bursts.</p><p>There are several assertions made in the paper regarding the relationship between CF bursts (action potentials) and CF axonal calcium responses. While portions of the statements made by the authors are true, they sometimes apply faulty logic to arrive at their conclusions. Specifically:</p><p>a) “ Our data indicate that increasing the number of burst stimulation</p><p>significantly augments the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude, which is saturated at 7 bursts (Figure 2C,D).”: While it is true (as the authors show) that increasing the stim number in a burst increases the CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal amplitude, this does not definitively prove their next sentence “…the variability CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity arises from its differential spike number of burst.” Just because the first statement is true, does not mean the second one (its converse) is also true.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revision, we provide additional evidence that in vivo CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude distribution appears discrete, which could further support the CF spike number-driven variability of CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitudes. However, we toned down the conclusion sentence as “Hence, the huge variability in CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude may be formed by the variable number of CF burst.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Results related to Figure 5 – The title of this section is “The spike number of CF burst determines the amplitudes of PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response.” While their data show that these events are correlated, this statement is not uniquely true. For example, Wang et al. (Nature Neuro, 2000), Kitamura and Hausser (J. Neuroscience, 2011), and others have demonstrated that PC dendritic calcium signals are related to the interactions between PF inputs, CF inputs, and the intrinsic properties of PCs. Thus, the authors' statement is not uniquely true.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s recommendation, the section title was changed to “The spike number of CF burst directly affects the amplitudes of PC dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response.” Also, the other contributions (intrinsic property of PC, PF activity, and noradrenergic CF control) to PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> response were discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In the revised version of their paper, the authors have performed an extensive new analysis of their dataset using state of the art methods. Data are quantified and displayed in a more detailed way and the paper is overall substantially improved. However, the results still fail to support convincingly the main conclusion of the paper, namely that climbing fiber (CF) high frequency bursts are responsible for the graded amplitude of the postsynaptic calcium transients in the Purkinje cells (PCs). The identification of individual CFs is problematic, and equating CF calcium transient amplitude with CF firing bursts remains correlative. Furthermore, the claim that CF-PC pairs are recorded does not seem warranted based on the data provided. In conclusion the correlations between CF and PC may result from other factors than the proposed burst coding.</p><p>1) The main issue still arises from the identification of CF ROIs and CF-PC pairs, a problem raised in the first round of reviews. The additional data provided in the revised version strongly suggest that CF ROIs defined by the authors encompass multiple CFs.</p><p>a) Morphological arguments</p><p>All data from the literature that traced the projections of single olivary cells point to the fact that the target Purkinje cells are not clustered at a given antero-posterior position but randomly spread in a thin parasagittal band. Therefore, each climbing fiber should only encompass a few varicosities in strict parasagittal alignment within a single PC dendrite, much thinner than the average 30 µm extension described in the paper.</p><p>b) Functional arguments</p><p>Functional studies on PC calcium transients indicate that PC cells displaying calcium transients with close to 100 % synchrony (hence receiving the same CF) are the exception rather than the rule (Ozden et al. 2009). Careful observation of the movies in the present dataset indicates that the only varicosities that display 100 % synchrony in their calcium transients are indeed strictly in parasagital alignment, hence contacting a single Purkinje cell.</p><p>c) In conclusion, the authors should detect events on single varicosities, which are easily identified manually and then check for 100% correlation to group varicosities in a single CF. It is hard to understand why the automatic algorithm defines such contorted ROIs covering large regions with no detectable signal. High level of correlation between nearby CF and poor signal to noise levels (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) may explain the pooling of multiple CFs in a single ROI.</p></disp-quote><p>We admit that the identification of CF ROIs and consequently CF-PC pairs was problematic, compounding the interpretation of the results. Reviewing the literatures and data we conclude that CaImAn is not appropriate for CF Ca<sup>2+</sup> analysis because it detects too large area (~30um) as indicated by the reviewer #1. Here, we tested and verified that another open source tool Suite2p effectively detects individual CF varicosities (Figure 1). If ROIs are located in the similar parasagittal plane (~20 um) and their correlation coefficient of signals are above 0.85, the pairs were merged in Suite2p GUI, resulting in less than 10 μm size of each ROI mediolaterally. Some CF ROIs appeared small which are less than 2-5 um, while some portion of bigger ROIs appeared parasagittaly aligned (i.e. ROI #1, 2, 7, 9, 13 in Figure 1C). Confirming that Suite2p analysis ensures proper interpretation of the results, we reanalyzed whole data set with the new method established and dispelled the concerns about CF ROI identification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The improper identification of single climbing fibers affects the interpretation of the supposed paired recordings of Figure 4. CF1 in Figure 4B and D seems to be two fibers, one contacting PC1 and the other PC3. However, correlation with PC2, on which there is no contact appears as good, probably because PC1 and PC2 are themselves highly correlated. More intriguing, some calcium events which are obvious in PCs 1-3 of the color raster of Figure 4D do not show in the CF1. This may indicate that this(ese) CF do not actually contact these PCs or that detection of CF events is improper. All calcium transients seen in the PC should be found in the CF and conversely.</p><p>Panels 4G-H provide a much improved analysis of the paired data, based on individual CF-PC pairs. However, considering that CF ROIs cover multiple CFs, they can be interpreted in terms of CF population synchrony. Larger CF transients would correspond to multiple CF being active at the same time, which would in turn translate in larger PC transients, as the link between population synchrony and PC calcium transients has already been described by Najafi et al. (2014). This does not preclude burst coding to be participating to the graded encoding of synchrony, as larger errors may both stimulate more olivary cells and trigger bursts, but the data do not convincingly demonstrate this point. In particular the CF-PC correlation is not significantly different between paired and neighbor unpaired, in line with the interpretation that correlation results from populational synchrony at short distance and not from direct pairing.</p></disp-quote><p>The data analysis and its interpretation related to simultaneous CF-PC Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging were fundamentally improved by obtaining well segmented CF varicosities (less than 10um) using Suite2p. The CF and the PC were regarded as a pair when they spatially overlap and their signals are significantly similar. The pair 1 and 2 in Figure 4 present excellent examples of CF-PC pair definition as the CF is surrounding the PC dendrite and their Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity also show robust correlation. Employing the strategy, we re-analyzed the entire data set, showing that the signal correlation and the amplitude correlation are significantly high between the CF-PC pairs. In response to the argument pointing out that CF-PC correlation is not significantly different between paired and neighbor unpaired, they now show significant difference with the data analyzed with Suite2p (Figure 4D) and it is in line with the population synchrony result that CF correlation falls as a function of mediolateral separation (Figure 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Quantification of the transients is also a problem. It is entirely unclear how events are detected after non-negative deconvolution and denoising (which may be subject to caution given the signal to noise of the recordings and the possibility of overfitting, see Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Failure to detect close-by events may arise in the report of artificially large event amplitudes. When multiple events are detected does the amplitude correspond to the summed peak of the DF/F trace or to the actual individual events amplitudes?</p><p>The very large amplitude of the CF transients (more than 2000 % in Figure 1) is surprising, as it may exceed the dynamic range of GCaMP6, particularly considering that ROIs cover large regions without any signal. Baseline subtraction, which may explain these large numbers if excess subtraction is applied, appears to be a recurrent issue in the paper with some panels displaying very low background noise (RFP in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A) and other very high (GFP in the same figure and in panel 1B).</p><p>Furthermore, the signals appear saturated in many of the figures as well as in the movies, which does not really allow to judge the dynamic range and shape of the activated elements. The two movies have compression issues which do not allow clear visualization on a frame by frame mode.</p><p>Finally, data of Figure 4 and the two movies originate from the same field of view and the two movies represent the same 20s but with very different levels of background subtraction and saturation. It is hard to understand why the same data are presented twice, and why not provide a more extensive sample of the data. Is it on purpose? If so, it should be explicitly mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>In the new manuscript the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event detection was performed with the state-of-the-art built-in deconvolution of Suite2p. The extracted Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were subtracted with background signals and then z-score normalized to avoid bias in amplitude quantification. The issue related to surprisingly large amplitudes of CF transients when CaImAn is employed was resolved with this approach (Suite2p and z-score normalization). Although the reviewer raised concerns regarding the saturation of figures and video, the data acquisition was carried out with high signal-to-noise level by minimizing laser power and properly adjusting gains. However, the images and movies were adjusted with contrast and brightness for clearer presentation of representative data. Please note that all analysis with Suite2p have been done with the original file. At this version of manuscript, we only present Video 1 for dual calcium imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Roh et al. have revised their manuscript to sufficiently account for my previous concerns, most importantly by re-analyzing all of their calcium imaging data and enhancing the transparency of their data and methodological reporting.</p><p>Notably, I still have some concerns over the role of movement in the amplitude of the reported signals. The authors correlate DF/F with paw speed, but not the amplitude of paw movement, or any other movements the animals make in response to airpuff stimulation. However, they now perform additional controls suggesting that imaging artifacts from bouton movement do not contribute to their results, and they have tempered their conclusions regarding the role of movement appropriately. Given the challenging nature of this problem, the level with which the authors have now addressed the role of movement seems reasonable. Likewise, the enhanced analysis of “independent” CF ROIs remains less than airtight, but in my opinion now meets a reasonable standard.</p><p>Finally, there remain some typos, and some odd writing choices. Examples include statements like &quot;this notion has been prevailed&quot;, and &quot;sensory inputs disappear ex vivo&quot;.
