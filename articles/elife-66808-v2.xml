HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes expand in cancer, autoimmune diseases and viral infections, but their appearance and immunoregulatory effects on T-cells after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remain underexplored. We found an expansion of circulating immature CD16<sup>+</sup>CD66b<sup>+</sup>CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes in AMI patients, correlating with cardiac damage, function and levels of immune-inflammation markers. Immature CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils expressed high amounts of MMP-9 and S100A9, and displayed resistance to apoptosis. Moreover, we found that increased frequency of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and elevated circulating IFN-γ levels were linked, mainly in patients with expanded CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells. Notably, the expansion of circulating CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells was associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity. Using bioinformatic tools, we identified a tight relationship among the peripheral expansion of immature CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils, CMV IgG titers, and circulating levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 in patients with AMI. At a mechanistic level, CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils enhanced IFN-γ production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells through a contact-independent mechanism involving IL-12. In vitro experiments also highlighted that HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes do not suppress T-cell proliferation but secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after differentiation to macrophages and IFN-γ stimulation. Lastly, using a mouse model of AMI, we showed that immature neutrophils (CD11b<sup>pos</sup>Ly6G<sup>pos</sup>CD101<sup>neg</sup> cells) are recruited to the injured myocardium and migrate to mediastinal lymph nodes shortly after reperfusion. In conclusion, immunoregulatory functions of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils play a dynamic role in mechanisms linking myeloid cell compartment dysregulation, Th1-type immune responses and inflammation after AMI.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>monocytes</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>immunoregulation</kwd><kwd>cytomegalovirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BA 1742/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fraccarollo</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name><name><surname>Bauersachs</surname><given-names>Johann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Immature CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes inducing proinflammatory and adaptive immune responses emerge in patients with large acute myocardial infarction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite advances in interventional therapies patients with large acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are at higher risk of heart failure morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heusch and Gersh, 2017</xref>). Immunity and inflammation play a key role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart failure, and the complex role of immune cells during the wound healing process after injury is currently the focus of intensive research efforts. Understanding the immune mechanisms operating during AMI could pave the way to develop more effective strategies to prevent progressive dilative cardiac remodeling, functional deterioration and heart failure and to reduce adverse cardiovascular events.</p><p>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes and immature neutrophils expand in pathological conditions such as cancer, infection, and inflammation, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009</xref>) and have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Silvin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deutsche COVID-19 OMICS Initiative (DeCOI) et al., 2020</xref>). A rapid depression of monocytic HLA-DR expression was observed in patients with AMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haeusler et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maréchal et al., 2020</xref> studying neutrophil phenotypes in acute coronary syndrome found increased percentage of immature low density neutrophils in patients with ST-elevation MI. However, the role of immature neutrophils as well as HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes in immune mechanisms operating during AMI remains largely unexplored.</p><p>By integrating flow cytometric immunophenotyping of monocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte subsets, ex vivo experiments with sorted cells as well as bioinformatic tools this study investigated the appearance and the functional immune properties of immature neutrophils and HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes in patients with AMI. Moreover, we explored whether increased frequency of immature neutrophils and HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes are linked to circulating levels of immune regulators and acute inflammation markers such as G-CSF, S100A9/S100A8, MMP-9, NGAL, MPO, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1ß and IFN-γ.</p><p>Since a crucial role for immature neutrophils in the orchestration of adaptive immunity has recently emerged, we mostly focused on neutrophil-mediated regulation of T-cell response. Environmental factors especially cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection are likely to provide a significant contribution to functional diversity of T-cells. Therefore, we also investigated the impact of CMV on CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell homeostasis and on the immunoregulatory properties of immature neutrophils derived from patients with AMI.</p><p>In addition, using a mouse model of reperfused AMI we addressed whether immature neutrophils migrate into the injured myocardium and populate heart-draining lymph nodes in response to acute ischemic injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients and study design</title><p>The study protocol is in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by the local ethics committee of Hannover Medical School.

A recent study revealed complex associations between of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tomas et al., 2020</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells are associated with a lower risk for first-time coronary events in a population-based cohort. In contrast, in patients with advanced atherosclerotic disease an increased frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells was associated with more frequent major adverse cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tomas et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings point to a potential link between CMV induced immune alterations following repeated antigen exposure and the peripheral expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells in ACS patients. CMV has been associated with atherosclerosis and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. Recent clinical data showed that myocardial ischemia in CMV-seropositive patients leads to significant changes in the composition of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell repertoire, accelerating immunosenescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoffmann et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In spite of numerous studies on polymorphonuclear myeloid cells the presence and functional characteristics of immature neutrophils is underexplored in the setting of AMI in mice. The present study demonstrated for the first time that CD101 can be used as a marker to define the maturation status of neutrophils mobilized into the peripheral blood in response to ischemia and recruited to sites of ischemic injury after reperfusion. Previous studies in a human model of experimental endotoxemia showed that banded neutrophils exhibit efficient migration to sites of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Grinsven et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, developmental analysis of bone marrow neutrophils revealed that immature neutrophils possess functional migratory machinery and are recruited to the periphery of tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evrard et al., 2018</xref>). Of note, we found that immature CD101<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils are released into the bloodstream within minutes after reperfusion and are capable of efficient migration to ischemic tissues, displaying increased expression of MMP-9 and IL-1ß at 3 and 24 hr after reperfusion, respectively. There are significant differences between mouse and human immunology. In mice, 10–25% of circulating leukocytes are neutrophils, while in humans neutrophils are the predominant leukocyte population, accounting for 50–70% of leukocytes. Moreover, the transit time of leukocytes may be quite different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mestas and Hughes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mackey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riehle and Bauersachs, 2019</xref>). During homeostasis, trafficking of neutrophils/myeloid cells from bone marrow into the circulation takes between 1–2 days in mice and 5–8 days in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mackey et al., 2019</xref>). Such differences should be considered when comparing animal and human studies on immune mechanisms underlying wound healing. However, future studies that employ intravital microscopy are required to track the fate of immature neutrophils mobilized from the bone marrow and recruited to the ischemic myocardium as well as lymph nodes after AMI.</p><p>The recruitment of immune cells to sites of tissue repair is a complex highly regulated process involving cytokines, chemokines, and interactions between infiltrating immune cells. HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes from patients with AMI are not immunosuppressive but express high amounts of IL1R1. Thus, immature neutrophils, as an important source of IL-1ß in the reperfused heart, may be actively involved in the recruitment of HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saxena et al., 2013</xref> showed that IL1R1 signaling mediates early recruitment of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes to the infarcted myocardium. Reperfused myocardial infarction had intense infiltration with Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes expressing IL1R1 that peaked after 24 hr of reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saxena et al., 2013</xref>). Noteworthy, recent studies demonstrated that the failing human heart also contains HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajpai et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several immune mechanisms operate during cardiac wound healing and IFN-γ plays different roles depending on the cellular and microenvironmental context intrinsically linked to the stages of ischemic injury. By integrating cell sorting and in vitro experiments, we found that macrophages differentiated from HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes produced more TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1ß upon IFN-γ stimulation as HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> monocyte-derived macrophages. These findings may support a role for HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes in pathogenic mechanisms operating during AMI and may, at least in part, explain why an expansion of circulating HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes correlates with circulating levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1ß.</p><p>The interleukin-1 pathway plays a key role in post-MI inflammation and the progression to heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbate et al., 2020</xref>). Our in vitro mechanistic experiments with immune cells from AMI patients as well as mouse studies provide a potential linkage between the induction of immature CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils/HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes and increased interleukin-1 activity during AMI. Emerging evidences highlight that targeting interleukin-1 may hold promise for patients after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckley and Abbate, 2018</xref>). In STEMI patients, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra significantly reduced the systemic inflammatory response. Moreover, in the CANTOS trial, administration of canakinumab (a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-1β) prevented the recurrence of ischemic events, reduced heart failure-related hospitalizations and mortality in patients with prior AMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckley and Abbate, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Neutrophils may orchestrate post-MI healing through induction of MerTK expression and increased efferocytosis capacity of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horckmans et al., 2017</xref>). Of interest, we found significantly higher expression of MerTK on macrophages differentiated from CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes and polarized in the presence of secretome derived from CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils. It is tempting to speculate that HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes had the potential to differentiate into macrophages with enhanced capacity to phagocyte apoptotic cells when exposed to CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils after AMI. Nevertheless, in vitro studies have limited ability to explain the complexity of macrophage activation within the infarct environment.</p><p>The apoptosis rate of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils was strongly reduced compared with CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils. This finding is consistent with recent studies showing that cellular immaturity influences apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). We also observed that CD101<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils sorted from reperfused ischemic hearts were resistant to apoptosis. Apoptosis is essential for neutrophil functional shutdown, phagocytic clearance by macrophages and timely resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koedel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elliott et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, apoptosis resistance of immature neutrophils may play a crucial role, hitherto overlooked, after MI. Further depletion/modulation studies in mice will shed light on the immunoregulatory functions of immature neutrophils in the inflammatory response during wound healing.</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows that immature CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes expand in patients with AMI and highlights their potential role as triggers of immune/inflammatory dysregulation after ischemic injury. These findings could have major implications for understanding immunoregulatory mechanisms operating during AMI and for the development of future therapeutic strategies. Nevertheless, further studies deciphering the relationship between elevated CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes/CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and ensuing mortality and morbidity after ischemic injury are necessary and ongoing.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for the support of Dr Matthias Ballmaier from the Central Research Facility Cell Sorting of the Hannover Medical School.

The findings in patients are supported by in vitro co-culture experiments and animal studies indicating that these cells are pro-inflammatory and enhance IFN-γ production by T cells. These findings add to the understanding how white blood cells become activated in patients with coronary artery disease following myocardial infarction and contribute to inflammatory activation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript &quot;Expansion of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes driving inflammatory responses after myocardial infarction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It seems that the authors identified CD101 as a neutrophil gene that is downregulated following ischemia. On that basis, they used CD101 as a maturation marker. However, why does this suggest that CD101 selectively labels mature vs immature neutrophils? Perhaps its downregulation reflects neutrophil activation, rather than immaturity. Perhaps the use of CD101 as a marker for mature neutrophils in reference 14 may provide a better rationale.</p><p>13) The rationale for the study of CMV seropositivity is not well-explained. The data show infiltration of the infarcted heart with immature neutrophils and CD14+HLA-DRneg monocytes.

The focus on CMV+ patients needs to be better introduced in the manuscript.</p><p>14) What was the rationale for the experiment examining interactions of CD10neg neutrophils with T cells?

AUC resulted equal to 0.970 with 95% CI: 0.927-1, a higher value compared to those ones obtained by single parameters (0.949, 0.798 respectively). Regarding UA/NSTEMI, AUC of combination resulted equal to 0.772 with 95% CI: 0.584-0.960, a higher value compared to CD16<sup>+</sup>CD66b<sup>+</sup>CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils (0.687, 95% CI: 0.482-0.892) but lower compared to CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes (0.786, 95% CI: 0.612-0.961).

What is the link the authors want to do here? These discrepancies should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Our in vitro experiments showed that CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils had no effect on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells (Figure 9A, 9B), thus demonstrating that overproduction of IFN-γ is confined to CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells expressing CD28. Moreover, using bioinformatic tools (PCA, hierarchical clustering, and Spearman-correlation matrix) we were able to highlight the tight relationship among the peripheral expansion of immature CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils, CMV-altered CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell homeostasis, CMV IgG titers, and high levels of IFN-γ in patients with large AMI. (Figure 8, Figure 8—figure supplement 1, Figure 8—figure supplement 2). As extensively discussed, these findings suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> T-cells from CMV<sup>+</sup> patients display a distinct phenotype. Environmental factors especially CMV infection are likely to provide a significant contribution to functional diversity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Our results highlight that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>+</sup> T-cells from CMV-seropositive AMI patients are skewed toward a Th1 phenotype, producing large amounts of IFN-γ in presence of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Where do the authors think the interaction between neutrophils CD10neg and lymphocytes occurs? In the circulation? In the infarcted heart? Do the authors see increased IL-12 levels in plasma from patients with increased amounts of neutrophils CD10neg? Also, the authors should discuss this potential interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>A crucial role for neutrophils in the orchestration in adaptive immunity has recently emerged. Neutrophils can traffic to lymph nodes during homeostasis and inflammatory conditions. Our new data obtained from the mouse model of AMI are first to provide evidence that immature neutrophils can populate heart-draining lymph nodes in response to acute ischemic injury. Consistent with recent studies we found a small population of neutrophils in mediastinal lymph nodes at steady state (Figure 7A). In mice subjected to ischemia followed by 3 hours of reperfusion the percentage of neutrophils in heart-draining lymph nodes increased significantly (Figure 7A, 7B). Of interest, we found that approximately 50% of infiltrating neutrophils were CD101<sup>neg</sup> cells. Morphologic analysis of cytospins confirmed the presence of neutrophils with ring‐shaped nuclei as well as mature neutrophils with segmented nuclei in mediastinal lymph nodes (Figure 7B). Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils can migrate into lymph nodes where they could encounter T-cells and shape adaptive immune responses. Future studies that employ intravital microscopy are required to visualize immature neutrophils dynamics mobilized from the bone marrow and recruited to lymph nodes after AMI.</p><p>Our additional bioinformatic analysis presented in the revised manuscript shows that circulating levels of IL-12 resulted enhanced in CMV<sup>+</sup> patients with increased frequency of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils (Figure 8—figure supplement 2B). Moreover, Spearman's correlation matrix showed multiple inter-correlations among IL-12 circulating levels, CMV IgG titers, frequency of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils, expanded CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells and particularly circulating levels of IFN-γ (Figure 8—figure supplement 2C). The Results section was changed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is there only a relationship between CMV+ patients and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28null? In Figure 7, supplement 1 panel C seems not to be a clear correlation between CMV positivity and neutrophil CD10neg numbers. Is this the case? For instance, with CMV-IgG? If not in numbers, how CMV positivity affects neutrophil CD10neg phenotype? Do neutrophil CD10neg isolated from patients CMV+ or CMV- have different ability to induce IFNγ in T-cells?</p></disp-quote><p>In the Results section of the original submission, we had suggested that cell expansion of CD10<sup>neg</sup> cells may be due prevalently to grade of coronary disease masking the effect of CMV-seropositivity. To assess the questions raised by the reviewers we investigated the correlation between CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and CMV-IgG titers as suggested. Principal component analysis (PCA) performed with the percentage of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils, IFN-γ levels and CMV-IgG titers (Figure 8—figure supplement 2A) showed a better cluster grouping compared to that one obtained with percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> cells (Figure 8C), with similar represented total variance (PC1+PC2: 79.5% vs. 83% respectively). Moreover, as reported in the panel (Figure 8—figure supplement 2C), a highly significant positive correlation resulted between CMV-IgG and the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> cells, whereas a non-significant correlation was observed between CMV-IgG and CD10<sup>neg</sup> cells. In the heatmap shown in Figure 8—figure supplement 2B, CMV-IgG titers and the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> cells are grouped together, confirming the relationship between CMV-seropositivity and the expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> cells. In addition, to test whether neutrophils from CMV<sup>-</sup> or CMV<sup>+</sup> patients have different ability to induce IFN-γ, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells from CMV<sup>+</sup> patients were cultured in presence of supernatants derived from CMV-seronegative patients (Figure 9—figure supplement 1). We found that CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophil supernatants markedly enhanced IFN-γ secretion (Figure 9—figure supplement 1), thus suggesting that CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils from CMV<sup>-</sup> and CMV<sup>+</sup> patients exhibit the same ability to induce IFN-γ production by CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors focus on the interaction of immature neutrophils and the adaptive immune system, but multiple studies associate neutrophil activity with monocyte/macrophage functionality. Is there any relation between CD10neg neutrophils and the observed phenotype of monocytes? Is the alarmin S100A9 relevant for monocyte chemotaxis?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original submission (Figure 6) a significant correlation between CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils and HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes and their link to circulating levels of immune-inflammation markers had been shown through Spearman-correlation matrix. Since a crucial role for immature neutrophils in the orchestration of adaptive immunity has recently emerged, in the present study we mostly focused on neutrophil-mediated regulation of T-cell response. However, to address the concerns raised by the reviewers we performed additional in vitro experiments investigating potential interactions/relations between CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes. Horckmans and co-workers showed that neutrophils orchestrate cardiac healing after AMI by influencing macrophage polarization. This work (Ref. 21) reported an induction of MerTK expression in macrophages (differentiated from peripheral blood monocytes of healthy donors) exposed to IL-4 in the presence of neutrophil supernatants from healthy individuals. Therefore, in the present study we assessed MerTK expression on macrophages differentiated from CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> and CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> monocytes and polarized in the presence of supernatants derived from CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils as well as CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C, 3D). CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup>/CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> cells and CD10<sup>neg</sup>/CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils were isolated from patients with AMI. Of interest, we found a significantly higher expression of MerTK on macrophages differentiated from CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes and stimulated with IFN-γ and IL-4 in presence of secretome derived from CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils. Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells by human macrophages requires MerTK induction. Therefore, we speculated that HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes could have the potential to differentiate into macrophages with enhanced capacity to phagocyte apoptotic cells when exposed to CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils post-AMI. Nevertheless, in vitro studies have limited ability to explain the complexity of macrophage activation within the cardiac environment after ischemic injury.</p><p>Regarding the last question, we underline that alarmin S100A9 has been shown to have chemotactic activity for monocytes. Previous experiments have focused on monocytic THP-1 cells and monocytes isolated from healthy human subjects. To address the issue raised by the reviewers, we analyzed S100A9-induced chemotaxis of CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup>/CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> monocytes from patients with AMI. We found that S100A9 significantly induced the migration of CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> as well as CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup> monocytes (Figure 4—figure supplement 3E). It is tempting to speculate that S100A9 regulates CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup>/CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> monocytes recruitment during AMI by functioning as a chemoattractant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There are major discrepancies between mouse and human immature monocytes and neutrophils. The authors should discuss it. The samples analyzed in mice for RNAseq are total FACS-sorted neutrophils. Do the authors see more similarities when analyzing CD101- mouse neutrophils?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the concern raised by the reviewers we performed additional experiments and isolated by FACS sorting CD11b<sup>pos</sup>Ly6G<sup>pos</sup>CD101<sup>neg</sup> and CD11b<sup>pos</sup>Ly6G<sup>pos</sup>CD101<sup>pos</sup> cells from peripheral blood of mice subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. We performed RT-qPCR of the highlighted genes in MA plot of Figure 4—figure supplement 1B. Of interest, we found that CD101<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils express higher amounts of Irg1, Il1r1, Mmp8, Nos2, and Stat3 than CD101<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils and showed markedly reduced CD101 expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, 1E) in good agreement with RNAseq analysis. Our findings emphasize interspecies differences in immune responses after ischemic injury, suggesting caution in applying findings in murine models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion to patients with AMI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) How are the levels of immature neutrophils altered in the bone marrow of mice after ischemia-reperfusion? The authors should also provide absolute numbers of CD101+ and CD101- neutrophils within the ischemic heart to evaluate their contribution.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the issues raised by the reviewers we performed additional experiments using the mouse model of reperfused AMI. As showed in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 2C the levels of CD101<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils in the bone marrow of mice subjected to ischemia/reperfusion were markedly reduced, suggesting early release of immature neutrophils from bone marrow into the circulation after AMI. The absolute numbers of CD101<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils as well as CD101<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils within the ischemic heart at 3 hours and 24 hours after reperfusion were now reported in the Figure 6A, 6B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In some cases, conclusions are not supported by robust data.

However, taking into account the questions raised by the reviewers, to further define the functional properties of the immature neutrophil populations derived from AMI patients we investigated spontaneous apoptosis. Remarkably, the apoptotic rate of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils was strongly reduced compared with CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils after 24 hours in vitro culture as determined by flow cytometric analysis using Vybrant DyeCycle Violet/SYTOX AADvanced stain (Figure 4E) as well as Apotracker Green (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A). The decreased apoptosis rate of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils was reflected by an increase in the percentage of live cells. Morphological assessment of cytospins (Figure 4—figure supplement 3B) confirmed the results obtained by flow cytometry. We also studied the apoptosis rate of CD101<sup>neg</sup> and CD101<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils isolated from ischemic hearts 24 hours after reperfusion. We found that CD101<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils were more resistant to apoptosis than their CD101<sup>pos</sup> counterparts (Figure 6D). Apoptosis is essential for neutrophil functional shutdown and effective resolution of inflammation requires timely phagocytic clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that apoptosis resistance of immature neutrophils may play a crucial role, hitherto overlooked, after MI and future studies will certainly shed light on its role in cardiac wound healing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors need to explain the rationale for assessment of specific inflammatory genes. For example, in neutrophils, what was the basis for selection of these specific genes (MMP9, IL1R1, IL1R2, STAT3 etc), vs. other inflammatory genes known to be expressed at high levels by neutrophils?</p></disp-quote><p>Our first goal was to identify specific surface antigens that characterize normal-density CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils derived from patients with AMI. Therefore, we examined markers of neutrophil maturation/activation often investigated in inflammatory diseases. Amazingly, we found that CD11b, CD101, CD114 and CD177 were expressed at equivalent levels on CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils versus CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils (Figure 4C). In the absence of significance, these data were not included in the original submission. Next, we investigated the expression of inflammatory mediators playing a pathophysiological role in wound healing after AMI expressed at high levels by neutrophils (MMP-9, S100A9) and, above all regulated in circulating neutrophils as well as in infarct neutrophils in the mouse model of reperfused AMI (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The rationale for the use of CD101 as a marker differentiating between mature and immature neutrophils in the mouse needs to be better presented. It seems that the authors identified CD101 as a neutrophil gene that is downregulated following ischemia. On that basis, they used CD101 as a maturation marker. However, why does this suggest that CD101 selectively labels mature vs immature neutrophils? Perhaps its downregulation reflects neutrophil activation, rather than immaturity. Perhaps the use of CD101 as a marker for mature neutrophils in reference 14 may provide a better rationale.</p></disp-quote><p>As reminded by the reviewers using next-generation RNA sequencing we identified Cd101 among the genes down-regulated by ischemia in circulating neutrophils (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). To address the concern raised by the reviewers we performed additional experiments. As reported in the (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D) we found that CD11b<sup>pos</sup>Ly6G<sup>pos</sup>CD101<sup>neg</sup> cells sorted from peripheral blood after AMI showed markedly reduced expression of Cd101. However, as suggested by the reviewers in the revised manuscript we refer CD101 as a surface marker to identify the mature neutrophil subset among the heterogeneous neutrophil populations, released into the bloodstream after ischemia/reperfusion. Anyway, as revealed by morphological analysis circulating CD101<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils have a mature morphology, whereas CD101<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils are immature neutrophils with ring‐shaped nuclei (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). More importantly, analysis of cytospin preparations of sorted neutrophils also showed that CD101<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils isolated from ischemic myocardium 24 hours after reperfusion still have an immature morphology (Figure 6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The rationale for the study of CMV seropositivity is not well-explained. The data show infiltration of the infarcted heart with immature neutrophils and CD14+HLA-DRneg monocytes. One would have anticipated experiments investigating the (proposed) role of these cells in the post-infarction inflammatory response. The focus on CMV+ patients needs to be better introduced in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The study of CMV-seropositivity was not one of our primarly goal(s) but was introduced during the course of the study following our attempt to explain the anomalous, very skewed distributions of IFN-γ levels in patients with AMI having expanded CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and increased frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells (Figure 8B). As mounting evidence indicated that altered T-cell homeostasis and increased frequency of circulating CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells are linked to cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity, we next analyzed the impact of CMV serostatus on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells frequency. Strikingly, we discovered that CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> expansion occurs in cytomegalovirus-seropositive patients (Figure 8D) and that maximum levels of circulating IFN-γ among ACS patients were detected in CMV-seropositive STEMI patients displaying increased levels of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils (Figure 8E). Therefore, we searched for criteria to define expansion of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell frequency using CMV-seropositivity as discriminating factor (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A-D). Derived cut-offs permitted grouping patients into well-defined clusters by PCA (Figure 8C) but chiefly providing evidence of the above-described link (Figure 8—figure supplement 1E). Moreover, derived cut-off for CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophil frequency together with CMV-seropositivity factor (±) permitted also to highlight the relationship among CD10<sup>neg</sup>, IL-12, IFN-γ as described in response to point 4 (Figure 8—figure supplement 2B). The validity to introduce CMV-seropositivity in the study is strengthened looking at PCA in Figure 8—figure supplement 2A, since patients resulted better clustered compared to PCA where CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cell frequency were analyzed in place of CMV IgG titers, this with a negligible loss of total explained variance. We have now explicitly highlighted these points in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Facit: operative steps over the course of the study conducted us to consider CMV positivity as factor strictly jointed to altered frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD28<sup>null</sup> T-cells associated with IFN-γ production and in turn of CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils and to represent their complex interplay through bioinformatic tools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) What was the rationale for the experiment examining interactions of CD10neg neutrophils with T cells? Considering the effects of neutrophils on macrophages and on cardiomyocytes, study of interactions with other cell types may have made more sense.</p></disp-quote><p>Increasing evidence supports that under pathological conditions low-density neutrophils display both immunosuppressive or proinflammatory functions. However, the immunoregulatory effects of normal-density CD10<sup>neg</sup> neutrophils after AMI and in context of cardiovascular diseases remains largely unexplored. Since a crucial role for immature neutrophils in the orchestration of adaptive immunity has recently emerged, we mostly focused on neutrophil-mediated regulation of T-cell response. However, to address the concerns raised by the reviewers (as described above in response to point 6) we performed additional in vitro experiments investigating potential interactions between CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>neg/low</sup>/CD14<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> monocytes and CD10<sup>neg</sup>/CD10<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C, 3D).</p></body></sub-article></article>
