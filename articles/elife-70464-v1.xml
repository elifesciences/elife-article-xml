remains elusive. This work, through analyzing transcript-3′end-sequencing data of <italic>Methanococcus maripaludis</italic>, found genome-wide positive correlations of both the terminator uridine(U)-tract and aCPSF1 with hierarchical transcription termination efficacies (TTEs). In vitro assays determined that aCPSF1 specifically binds to the terminator U-tract with U-tract number-related binding affinity, and in vivo assays demonstrated the two elements are indispensable in dictating high TTEs, revealing that aCPSF1 and the terminator U-tract cooperatively determine high TTEs. The N-terminal KH domains equip aCPSF1 with specific-binding capacity to terminator U-tract and the aCPSF1-terminator U-tract cooperation; while the nuclease activity of aCPSF1 was also required for TTEs. aCPSF1 also guarantees the terminations of transcripts with weak intrinsic terminator signals. aCPSF1 orthologs from Lokiarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota exhibited similar U-tract cooperation in dictating TTEs. Therefore, aCPSF1 and the intrinsic U-rich terminator could work in a noteworthy two-in-one termination mode in archaea, which may be widely employed by archaeal phyla; using one trans-action factor to recognize U-rich terminator signal and cleave transcript 3′-end, the archaeal aCPSF1-dependent transcription termination may represent a simplified archetypal mode of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II termination machinery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription termination</kwd><kwd>archaea</kwd><kwd>aCPSF1</kwd><kwd>terminator U-tract</kwd><kwd>Methanococcus maripaludis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Specific binding</kwd><kwd>KH domains</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0905500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Xiuzhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020YFA0906800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91751203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Xiuzhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Xiuzhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Term-seq, genetic and biochemical experiments reveal that the trans-action factor aCPSF1 and the terminator U-tract cis-element work in a noteworthy two-in-one termination mode in archaea, and may represent an archetypal mode of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II termination machinery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription termination is an essential and highly regulated process in all forms of life, which not only determines the accurate 3′-end boundary of a transcript and transcription-related regulatory events, but is also important in shaping programmed transcriptomes of living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peters et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porrua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Porrua and Libri, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ray-Soni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>). Highly controlled transcription termination, which prevents read-through resulted undesired increases in downstream coding regions and the accumulation of antisense transcripts, can be particularly important in prokaryotes because of their densely packed genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peters et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Research has indicated that bacteria primarily employ two transcription termination mechanisms, Rho-dependent and -independent (intrinsic). In the Rho-dependent mechanism, the RNA translocase Rho, via recognizing a cytosine-rich sequence in nascent transcripts, dissociates the processive transcription elongation complex (TEC) based on its ATPase activity. In contrast, the intrinsic termination merely depends on a nascent RNA structure with a 7–8 base-paired hairpin followed by a run of uridines (Us) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gusarov and Nudler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peters et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porrua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ray-Soni et al., 2016</xref>). A bacteria-like intrinsic termination mechanism that depends on a U-stretch is also found in the eukaryotic RNA polymerase (RNAP) III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nielsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Orioli et al., 2011</xref>). Distinctively, transcription termination of the eukaryotic RNAP II, which transcribes mRNAs and non-coding RNAs, usually involves a transcript 3′-end processing event, in which the cleavage and polyadenylation factor complex (CPF/CPSF), under assistance of the accessory cleavage factors CFIA and CFIB, recognizes the termination signal, a poly(A) site at transcript 3′-end. Following recognition, the CPF/CPSF complex cleaves downstream the termination signal of the nascent RNA and polyadenylates at the cleaved 3′-end for mRNA maturation, and triggers RNAP II dissociation for transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baejen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eaton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grzechnik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kuehner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larochelle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porrua et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Compared with bacteria and eukaryotes, knowledge of the transcription termination mechanisms in the third form of life, archaea, is very limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dar et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier and Marchfelder, 2019</xref>). Archaea represent a primary domain of cellular life and phylogenetically are more closely related to eukaryotes than bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eme et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, archaea employ a eukaryotic RNAP II homolog, archaeal RNAP (aRNAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Werner and Grohmann, 2011</xref>), but have compact genomes with short intergenic regions (IGRs) and co-transcribed polycistronic operons, highlighting the importance of a controllable transcription termination. Earlier studies have suggested that, similar to the bacterial intrinsic termination, transcription termination of aRNAP may depend on a short U-rich sequence at the transcript 3′-end but with no strict requirements of an upstream hairpin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirtreiter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier and Marchfelder, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Santangelo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Santangelo and Reeve, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spitalny and Thomm, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomm et al., 1993</xref>). Recently, Term-seq, an approach that enables accurate mapping of all exposed RNA 3′-ends in prokaryotes and determines the transcription termination sites (TTSs) at the genome-wide level in representative bacteria and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dar et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Porrua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>), has been developed. Through Term-seq, U-rich sequences preceding TTSs, without preceding hairpin structures, were identified to be overrepresented in the transcripts of four representative archaeal species: <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic>, <italic>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</italic>, <italic>Haloferax volcanii,</italic> and <italic>Methanococcus maripaludis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berkemer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dar et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the U-tract sequences at the transcript 3′-ends are assumed to be the intrinsic termination signals of archaea; in addition, without strictly requiring an upstream hairpin structure in most of the archaeal terminator sequences suggests a distinct intrinsic termination mechanism of archaea from that of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier and Marchfelder, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The protein factors that mediate archaeal transcription termination have been reported in recent years. The <italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic> Eta (<italic>e</italic>uryarchaeal <italic>t</italic>ermination <italic>a</italic>ctivity) has been reported to transiently engage the TEC and release the stalled TEC from damaged DNA lesions, resembling the bacterial Mfd termination factor and functioning specifically in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Most recently, aCPSF1, also named FttA (<italic>F</italic>actor that <italic>t</italic>erminates <italic>t</italic>ranscription in <italic>A</italic>rchaea), has been demonstrated as a transcription termination factor of archaea because it could competitively disrupt the processive TEC at normal transcription elongation rate and implement a kinetically competitive termination dependent on both the stalk domain of RNAP and the transcription elongation factor Spt4/5 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>). aCPSF1 is affiliated within the β-CASP ribonuclease family, and is ubiquitously distributed in all archaeal phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>). Initially, aCPSF1 was assumed to function in RNA maturation and turnover of Archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clouet-d’Orval et al., 2015</xref>), and endoribonuclease activity was identified for three aCPSF1 orthologs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silva et al., 2011</xref>), with one also exhibiting 5′–3′ exoribonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phung et al., 2013</xref>). Our recent study reported that aCPSF1, depending on its ribonuclease activity, controls in vivo transcription termination at the genome-wide level and ensures programmed transcriptome in <italic>M. maripaludis</italic>, and its orthologs from the distant relatives, <italic>Lokiarchaeota</italic> and <italic>Thaumarchaeota</italic>, implement the same function in termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>). However, although the in vitro enzymatic assay determined that aCPSF1 primarily and endoribonucleolytically cleaves downstream of a U-rich motif that precedes the identified TTSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>), some open questions remain, such as (i) whether the aCPSF1-dependent and the U-tract terminator-based intrinsic terminations are two independent mechanisms, or the two in fact work cooperatively in archaea, or (ii) if the aCPSF1-dependent termination simply serves as a backup mechanism for the genes/operons containing less-efficient intrinsic termination signals as assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wenck and Santangelo, 2020</xref>); (iii) what the exact sequence motifs that aCPSF1 recognizes are, and (iv) whether, like the eukaryotic multiple subunit composed termination complex, aCPSF1 also requires others to recognize the termination signals.</p><p>In the present work, via an intensive analysis of the Term-seq data in <italic>M. maripaludis,</italic> we comprehensively evaluated the correlations of the transcription termination efficacies (TTEs) for all identified TTSs with both the cis-element U-tract terminator and the trans-action termination factor aCPSF1. Further, in combination with molecular and genetic validations, we determined that aCPSF1 and the terminator U-tract cooperatively dictate high TTEs. The in vitro and in vivo assays together demonstrated that the N-terminal K homolog (KH) domains of aCPSF1 specifically recognize and bind to the terminator U-tract. Therefore, the archaeal termination factor aCPSF1 could accomplish the U-tract terminator recognition and transcript 3′-end cleavage by itself, and the factor-dependent transcription termination may be the primary mechanism used by archaea.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A positive correlation is found between the TTEs and the terminator four-uridine (U4) tract numbers preceding TTSs in <italic>M. maripaludis</italic></title><p>In an attempt to evaluate the specific termination signals recognized by the termination factor aCPSF1 and its role in dictating the in vivo TTEs, we intensively reanalyzed the Term-seq data of <italic>M. maripaludis</italic> obtained previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>). By following a stringent filtration workflow in TTS definition and to preclude identifying sites derived from stale RNA processing or degradation products, TTS searching was restricted within 200 nt downstream of the stop codon of a gene. This served to maximally enrich the authentic TTSs near the gene 3′-ends and only sites that appeared in both biological replicates with high coverage (see Materials and methods) were selected. In total, 2357 TTSs were obtained, including the previously identified 998 primary and 1,359 newly identified secondary TTSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Multiple consecutive TTSs were found in &gt;50% of transcription units (TUs) of <italic>M. maripaludis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which could produce multi-isoforms of a transcript with varying 3′-UTRs, as found in <italic>M. mazei</italic> and <italic>S. acidocaldarius</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dar et al., 2016a</xref>). Nevertheless, compared with the primary TTSs, which have the highest Term-seq reads among all identified 3′-end sites in each TU, much lower median read abundances, TTEs, and motif scores were found for the secondary TTSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that TUs are mainly terminated at the primary TTSs, which were therefore used for further investigation.</p><p>Sequence analysis of the 961 primary TTSs of coding TUs found a featured terminator motif, a 23 nt U-tract with four consecutive uridine nucleotides (U4) that are most proximal to the TTS having the highest matching. To evaluate the contribution of the U-tract sequence preceding TTSs to transcription termination in <italic>M. maripaludis</italic>, we first defined and calculated TTE of each TU. After inspecting the genome-wide Term-seq mapping file, a dramatic decreasing pattern was observed in the mapping reads at four nucleotides (nts) between sites +2 and −2 flanking TTS (−1 nt) in the majority of the primary TTSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates that transcription appears to be terminated most frequently at the four nucleotides, which was therefore defined as the TTS quadruplet. Through pair-wisely comparing the reads of each nt in a TTS quadruplet, the maximal abundance decrease was found from sites −2 nt (upstream) to +2 nt (downstream) flanking most TTSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, the read ratio between −2 and +2 nts was used as the measurement of TTE, which was calculated based on “TTE = 1−[+2] / [−2]”, where [−2] and [+2] represent the read abundances at −2 nt and +2 nt in Term-seq data, respectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><bold>A positive correlation is observed between the terminator U4-tract numbers and the TTEs among the TUs of <italic>M.</italic></bold><italic>maripaludis</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative Term-seq map of <italic>MMP0020</italic> showing a dramatical decreasing pattern of sequencing reads at four nucleotides that flank the identified transcription termination site (TTS, -1 site indicated by bent arrow).

We classified the 961 TUs into three groups based on the TQRRs: the highly aCPSF1-dependent (TQRR ≤0.6), moderately aCPSF1-dependent (0.6&lt; TQRR &lt; 1) and non-aCPSF1-dependent (TQRR ≥1) groups, and generated the TTS preceding sequence motif for each group using Weblogo. Interestingly, we found not only that 29.3% (282/961) and 62.2% (597/961) of TUs belonged to the highly and moderately aCPSF1-dependent groups respectively, and only 8.4% (81/961) of TUs belonged to the aCPSF1-independent group, but also a significant positive correlation between the aCPSF1-dependency and the numbers of U4-tract preceding TTSs, namely, the higher aCPSF1 dependency, the more featured U4-tracts of the TU groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between the aCPSF1-dependency and the above four U4-tract TU groups analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.

These findings indicate that the majority of TUs with U4-tract depend on aCPSF1 for termination and the TU groups containing more U4-tracts have lower median TQRR values, namely, higher aCPSF1-dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Reciprocally, by mutating two As to Us to increase 1 to 2 U-tracts on the RNA with the <italic>MMP0229</italic> 3′-end sequence (T0229-18nt and T0229-18nt-M1, respectively), the binding affinity of aCPSF1 was notably increased compared to T0229-18nt, whereas mutation of the four Us to four As at T0229-18 nt to obtain an RNA sequence lacking a U-tract (T0229-18nt-M2) completely abolished aCPSF1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the footprint assay was performed on the above used RNA with the T0204 terminator sequence using RNase I digestion in the absence or presence of aCPSF1, and a clear footprint of aCPSF1 on the U-tract region was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results demonstrated that both of the two U-tracts in the transcript 3′-end are necessary for efficient and specific binding of aCPSF1, and that the U-tract region is the exact region that aCPSF1 binds to. Followingly, the minimum length of the consecutive uridines in the two U-tracts was evaluated. U to C mutation was performed on the two U-tracts RNA of T0204-24nt to shorten the length of the consecutive uridines to generate T0204-DU5, T0204-DU4, and T0204-DU3, which carry 5, 4, or 3 consecutive uridines in each U-tract, respectively. The rEMSA results indicated that aCPSF1 efficiently bound to T0204-DU5 and T0204-DU4, but could not bind to T0204-DU3. This suggests that the two U4-tracts is the minimum terminator sequence for efficient binding of aCPSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Collectively, the in vitro RNA binding experiments demonstrated that an RNA fragment embedding a two U4-tracts and with a minimum length of 18 nt is the cis-element required by the termination factor aCPSF1 for efficient and specific binding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The minimal RNA length and U-tract base stringency required for the specific binding of aCPSF1 determined by rEMSA assays.</title><p>RNAs with indicated lengths and base mutations shown in the top panels that are derived from the native terminator sequences of <italic>MMP0204</italic> (T0204) and <italic>MMP0229</italic> (T0229) were used as the binding substrates of aCPSF1.

This further verifies that terminators carrying more U4-tracts have a higher aCPSF1-dependency.

To test this hypothesis, two aCPSF1 orthologs, <italic>Loki</italic>-aCPSF1, from Ca. <italic>Lokiarchaeum</italic> sp.

The above five tested terminator reporters were transformed into strains Com(<italic>Loki</italic>-aCPSF1) and Com (<italic>Csy</italic>-aCPSF1) that were generated by complementing the <italic>Loki</italic>-aCPSF1 and <italic>Csy</italic>-aCPSF1 into ▽<italic>aCPSF1</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>). Through quantifying transcript abundances of the reporter genes, the TTEs of the tested terminators in Com(<italic>Loki</italic>-aCPSF1) and Com(<italic>Csy</italic>-aCPSF1) were calculated as described above. Noticeably, in strains Com(<italic>Loki</italic>-aCPSF1) and Com(<italic>Csy</italic>-aCPSF1), a similar U4-tract number related TTE pattern was determined as that in strain Com(WT) that contains <italic>Mmp</italic>-aCPSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, Com(Loki-C1), Com(Csy-C1), and Com(WT)), that is, the highest TTEs were determined for terminators with 2 U4-tracts (T1149 and T0204), and the TTEs with 1 U4-tract (T0911 and T0229) were lower.

In this study, through systematic analysis of the transcript 3′-end sequencing data in a genetically tractable archaeon <italic>M. maripaludis</italic>, we found that aCPSF1 cooperatively with the terminator U-tracts dictates the genome-wide in vivo TTEs, but not restricted to the TUs with weak intrinsic termination signals. Further, this work has elucidated that aCPSF1, functioning as a dimer and through its N-terminal KH domains, specifically binds to the terminator U-tract signals at transcript 3′-ends, and through its nuclease domain cleaves downstream, so cooperates with the terminator to dictate TTEs. Therefore, distinct to the two independent termination mechanisms, of Rho- and intrinsic terminator-dependent respectively, in bacteria, a two-in-one termination mode, that the trans-action factor aCPSF1 and the intrinsic terminator U-tract cis-element cooperatively determines high TTEs, could be employed in archaea. The termination relying on aCPSF1 cleavage at transcript 3′-end resembles the eukaryotic RNAP II termination mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>).

First, the N-terminal KH domains of aCPSF1 could recognize the intrinsic U-tract terminator signals at nascent transcript 3′-ends, and the direct association of aCPSF1 with aRNAP provides the spatial vicinity for the recognition. Upon specific binding, the nuclease module of aCPSF1 could perform endoribonucleolytic cleavage downstream to produce the transcript 3′-end, which has been determined to be necessary for transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yue et al., 2020</xref>) and the U-tract mediated hierarchical TTEs in vivo as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

However, the eukaryotic CPSF73/Ysh1 lacks the KH domains in archaeal aCPSF1, but requires the interacting subunits in the CPF/CPSF complex and the accessory cleavage factors IA and IB (CFIA and CFIB) to recognize the poly(A) terminator signal and the flanking U-rich sequences to facilitate the 3′-end cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Porrua and Libri, 2015</xref>). Very few homologs of the eukaryotic 3′-end processing complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casañal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shi et al., 2009</xref>) and termination factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baejen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eaton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grzechnik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larochelle et al., 2018</xref>) have been identified in archaea.

The two-in-one mechanism, but not two independent termination systems, may be the principal termination mechanism of archaea. Although resembling the eukaryotic RNAP II termination mode, archaea may employ a simplified termination strategy, as aCPSF1, a single protein factor, could initiate archaeal transcription termination through (i) specifically binding of the N-terminal KH domains to the terminator U-tract and (ii) cleavage at the transcripts 3′-end by the nuclease domain. Therefore, the archaeal transcription termination mode might represent the archetype of the eukaryotic RNAP II transcription termination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, plasmids, and culture conditions</title><p>Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4a</xref>. <italic>M. maripaludis</italic> S2 and its derivatives were grown in pre-reduced McF medium under a gas phase of N<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> (80:20) at 37°C and 22°C as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sarmiento et al., 2011</xref>), and 1.5% agar was used in the solid medium.

However, additional experiments are necessary to go deeper in the understanding of how aCPSF1 specifically recognized PolyU-tract signals. First, a more precise picture of how aCPSF1 binds to PolyU-tract could be obtained by quantifying the gel retardation experiments (EMSA) or/and SPR binding assays. This will give affinity constants for aCPSF1 proteins (WT or ∆KH domain) binding to poly-U tract substrates. In addition, footprint assays could allow determining how aCPSF1 sits on PolyU-tract. Finally, the authors should consider including experiments with aCPSF1 invalidated for its C-terminal region (last 16-AA) which has been shown to be important for the dimerization of aCPSF1. It is important to decipher if aCPSF1 is acting as a monomer or a dimer. Footprint experiments should also be carried with this mutant.</p><p>In addition, the writing of the manuscript should be improved. The authors should revise the manuscript by choosing a more appropriate vocabulary and a more synthetic writing, using shorter sentences and avoiding repetition. This will facilitate the reading and highlight the important key points.</p><p>Below are the detailed specific comments by section of the manuscript.</p><p>Vocabulary:</p><p>• The term &quot;efficiency&quot; is not appropriate. It should be replaced by &quot;effectiveness&quot; or &quot;efficacy&quot;.</p><p>• What the authors meant by &quot;heterogeneous aCPSF1 orthologs&quot; (lane 420) ?</p><p>• Two-in-one termination mode? To my understanding, it is a one mode of termination that implicated a cis-element and aCPSF1</p><p>• The title should be shortened by removing &quot;via the KH domain recognizing U-tract&quot;</p><p>Results/Figures:</p><p>By reinvestigating their Term-seq data, the authors state they want to evaluate the role of aCPSF1 on &quot;transcription termination efficiency&quot;. In my opinion, using the term &quot;efficiency&quot; is not appropriate. Indeed, the authors do not define the efficiency of termination by analysing the Term-seq data but rather its effectiveness: they aim at defining the degree to which transcription termination is successful in producing the transcript 3' end, and not how quickly it can be done. Therefore, the term &quot;efficiency&quot; should be replaced by &quot;effectiveness&quot; or &quot;efficacy&quot;.</p><p>Why is there such heterogeneity at the 3' end from +2 to -2? Is the heterogeneity comes from a random cleavage by aCPSF1 and/or to additional exonucleolytic activities?</p><p>The Term-seq data analysis specifically identified TTS of mRNAs by searching the 200-nt sequence located downstream a stop codon. What about transcription termination of noncoding RNAs? Is aCPSF1/U-tract dependent transcription termination specific for mRNAs? or can it drive transcription termination of ncRNAs? Is there Poly-U stretch at the 3' end of ncRNAs ? Nonetheless, in the description of the results, the authors should clearly specify that their results point to the 3' end of mRNAs.</p><p>The authors need to define their ∆aCPSF1 mutant more clearly by indicating that it still exhibits 20% of aCPSF1 molecules (Yue et al., 2020). From Figure 6B, when expressing the ∆KH-aCPSF1, the quantity of wild type aCPSF1 seems even higher. They should take these into account when discussing their results.</p><p>While the authors defined the TQRR as TTS quadruplet ratio, it is almost never expressed as such. Somehow, it becomes percentages with no explanation from the authors. In Figure 2B and 2D, while the y-axis is labelled as &quot;TTS quadruplet read ratios&quot; (please, note that the 't' of 'ratios' is missing), it exhibits percentages as values. This makes the results hard to follow. The same comment stands for the TA Ratios when measuring transcript abundance.</p><p>EMSA results showing binding of aCPSF1 to poly-U are only qualitative and not quantitative. Quantification of retardation gels (EMSA) and/or SPR binding assays is necessary to define the affinity constants of each substrate and each protein (WT or ∆KH domain). Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of the SPR experiment could allow determining the association and dissociation constants. To go further on the understanding of the binding of aCPSF1 on U-tract , footprint experiments could be performed. This will be helpful in understanding the mechanism of action of aCPSF1.</p><p>aCPSF1 has been shown to be a dimeric enzyme. This dimerization relies on the last 16aa of aCPSF1 which are conserved across species. The authors should test if this motif is important for the function of aCPSF1 to terminate transcription in their assays and for RNA binding.</p><p>In Yue et al. 2020, an association of aCPSF1 and the RNAPol was determined through co-immunoprecipitation. It would be interesting to know if the ΔKH aCPSF1 mutant still interacts with RNAPol.</p><p>In the manuscript, the use of the term synergy to define the action of aCPSF1 and the polyU-tract seems inadequate. While the two seems indispensable for transcription termination, there is no evidence that they work in synergy. Synergy is an interaction that produces an overall effect greater than the sum of individual effects of any of them. At most, the authors can say that aCPSF1 and the polyU-tract cooperate in terminating transcription.</p><p>Finally, as a general comment, on several occasions, the conclusions of the experiments are missing and let to the interpretation of the readers. For example, see Lanes 367 to 372. The authors should also revise the title of the Figures that are not informative.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>The Discussion section is too long and difficult to follow. A more synthetic writing will facilitate the reading and highlight the important key points. For example the paragraph Lanes 527 to 546 could be synthetically summarized in few short sentences.</p><p>The authors seem to imply that aCPSF1 is acting alone without additional factors (Lanes 456 to 462). It might be due to the phrasing that can be improved. If not, from the manuscript, it is not clear how they can make such a statement.</p><p>In the model presented in Figure 7, the authors do not propose 5'-3' Exo activities (from aCPSF1 or other β-CASP ribonucleases) as being involved in the removal of the cleaved RNAs attached to the RNAP as it is proposed in the case of the eukaryal RNApolII. This was part of their previous model in Yue et al. 2020? Do the authors have evidence that it is not the case?</p><p>The authors should not forget that aCPSF1 could have additional roles in the cell. Indeed, a study in H. volcanii identified Hvo-aCPSF1 as a protein partner of NcsA that is involved in the formation of thiolated tRNA (Lys)UUU together with homologues of ubiquitin-proteasome (Chavarria et al. 2014).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript by Li et al. examine U-rich motifs enriched for the transcript end sites in archaea M. marpaludis and analyze the role of aCPSF1 and its KH domains in binding these U-rich motifs. Their data indicate aCPSF1 binding to U-rich motifs is necessary for efficient 3' end definition of transcripts. Overall this work is well carried out. However, there several key issues the authors need to address before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1. The conclusion that aCPSF1 functions as a back-up termination is not supported by their data. As far as I can tell, back-up termination should happen at non-primary sites, which have a lower frequency of U quadruplex. It is not clear how aCPSF1 functions at those sites.</p><p>2. The authors appear to indicate that aCPSF1 is the sole factor for 3' end cleavage of archaeal transcripts. But this is not supported by the data. Their data indicate both U-rich motif and aCPSF1 are necessary for cleavage. No data are shown to indicate that these two alone are sufficient for 3' end cleavage.</p><p>3. The U-rich motif (U quadruplex) was recently reported in their NAR paper (Yue et al.). There appears to be limited additional information on motifs in this work. It would be useful to readers to know if U-rich motifs are the only type for 3' end cleavage. The authors may want to examine motifs beyond single nucleotide models (which is what they are doing in this work). For example, are there any k-mer enrichments besides U quadruplex?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;aCPSF1 cooperates with terminator U-tract to dictate archaeal transcription termination efficacy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

No experiments are suggested and the comments are only meant to improve clarity in the text and figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have improved the manuscript by addressing the main criticisms raised in the first round of review. However, one key issue described below remains to be addressed.</p><p>The authors should show on Figure 3 and 4 the binding curves that allow determining Kd values. It is not clear how these values are calculated and the number of experimental replicates is not mentioned. Comparison of the binding curves on the same graph would highlight the differences in affinity between the different substrates. Moreover, in view of the values of the affinity constants, it is unlikely to obtain values (µM) with a standard deviation of up to three digits after the decimal point. The Kd values should be revised. Finally, I do not think it is possible to determine Kd if the RNA is not 100% bound to the highest protein concentration. This is the case of the substrates: T0204-18nt (Figure 4B) , T0229-18nt (Figure 4C) and T02046-DU5 -DU4 (Fig4D).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am satisfied with the authors' response to my comments.

As you say, the term-seq pipeline filtered out majority of the noncoding RNA TTSs. Therefore, the TTSs of non-coding RNAs in <italic>M. maripaludis</italic> (Supplementary File 3 in revision) were intensively and manually analyzed based on the Term-seq data by following the same criteria for the coding genes except for the item of within 200 nt downstream the stop codon of a gene.

Noteworthily, similar U-tract motif, and similar cooperative trend of TTEs and aCPSF1 dependency were found present in noncoding RNAs (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Additionally, the aCPSF1 dependency for the termination of two representative noncoding RNAs was verified by the prolonged transcript 3′-ends detected by both the transcriptomic sequencing and the northern blot assay (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) in ▽<italic>aCPSF1</italic>. These supplemented data suggest that the noncoding RNAs of <italic>M. maripaludis</italic> could employ the similar termination mechanism as that of the genes, i.e. depending on both aCPSF1and the U-tract terminator.

The same comment stands for the TA Ratios when measuring transcript abundance.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for reminding, and “Percentage” has been revised to “ratio” throughout the revised manuscript and the missing 't' of 'ratios' in Figure 2B and 2D has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EMSA results showing binding of aCPSF1 to poly-U are only qualitative and not quantitative. Quantification of retardation gels (EMSA) and/or SPR binding assays is necessary to define the affinity constants of each substrate and each protein (WT or ∆KH domain). Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of the SPR experiment could allow determining the association and dissociation constants. To go further on the understanding of the binding of aCPSF1 on U-tract , footprint experiments could be performed. This will be helpful in understanding the mechanism of action of aCPSF1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by the binding curves that were generated through quantifying the unbound and bound substrates in Figures 3, 4, and 6A.

This dimerization relies on the last 16aa of aCPSF1 which are conserved across species.

A gel filtration coupled western-blot experiment has been performed on Com(ΔKH) strain, which detected the co-occurrence of aCPSF1 and its KH domain deletion mutant with RNAP subunit RpoD, indicating that the ΔKH-aCPSF1 mutant still interacts with the RNAP. These results have been supplemented in the revised manuscript (Lines 383-385 and 1168-1175).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the manuscript, the use of the term synergy to define the action of aCPSF1 and the polyU-tract seems inadequate. While the two seems indispensable for transcription termination, there is no evidence that they work in synergy. Synergy is an interaction that produces an overall effect greater than the sum of individual effects of any of them. At most, the authors can say that aCPSF1 and the polyU-tract cooperate in terminating transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. “synergy” has been revised as “cooperation” throughout the – revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, as a general comment, on several occasions, the conclusions of the experiments are missing and let to the interpretation of the readers.

The related paragraph and the Discussion section have been abbreviated to be more synthetic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors seem to imply that aCPSF1 is acting alone without additional factors (Lanes 456 to 462). It might be due to the phrasing that can be improved. If not, from the manuscript, it is not clear how they can make such a statement.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid ambiguity, the related description has been revised as “…, the working mode of archaeal termination is also noteworthy as aCPSF1 may be the only trans-action factor in triggering termination, by …” (Lines 475-479) in the revision. We mean that aCPSF1 is the only protein factor for the U-tract terminator recognition and transcript 3' end cleavage in archaeal termination process, which is distinct from its eukaryotic homologous CPSF73, which only performs the 3' end cleavage but dependent other interacted proteins in the multiple-subunits CPSF complex in eukaryotic termination process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the model presented in Figure 7, the authors do not propose 5'-3' Exo activities (from aCPSF1 or other β-CASP ribonucleases) as being involved in the removal of the cleaved RNAs attached to the RNAP as it is proposed in the case of the eukaryal RNApolII. This was part of their previous model in Yue et al. 2020? Do the authors have evidence that it is not the case?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the point. 5'-3' Exo activities were proposed and added in Figure 7, though not experimentally proved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should not forget that aCPSF1 could have additional roles in the cell. Indeed, a study in H. volcanii identified Hvo-aCPSF1 as a protein partner of NcsA that is involved in the formation of thiolated tRNA (Lys)UUU together with homologues of ubiquitin-proteasome (Chavarria et al. 2014).</p></disp-quote><p>As you have pointed, aCPSF1 could have additional roles in the cell.

Their data indicate aCPSF1 binding to U-rich motifs is necessary for efficient 3' end definition of transcripts. Overall this work is well carried out. However, there several key issues the authors need to address before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1. The conclusion that aCPSF1 functions as a back-up termination is not supported by their data. As far as I can tell, back-up termination should happen at non-primary sites, which have a lower frequency of U quadruplex. It is not clear how aCPSF1 functions at those sites.</p></disp-quote><p>Combination of the comments of you and the reviewer 1, this related inappropriate conclusion has been removed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors appear to indicate that aCPSF1 is the sole factor for 3' end cleavage of archaeal transcripts. But this is not supported by the data. Their data indicate both U-rich motif and aCPSF1 are necessary for cleavage. No data are shown to indicate that these two alone are sufficient for 3' end cleavage.</p></disp-quote><p>The obscure related description has been revised as “the only trans-action factor”. (Line 36 in the Abstract and Lines 476-477)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The U-rich motif (U quadruplex) was recently reported in their NAR paper (Yue et al.). There appears to be limited additional information on motifs in this work. It would be useful to readers to know if U-rich motifs are the only type for 3' end cleavage. The authors may want to examine motifs beyond single nucleotide models (which is what they are doing in this work). For example, are there any k-mer enrichments besides U quadruplex?</p></disp-quote><p>According to your advice, we searched RNA sequences proximal to TTSs; however, no other motif in addition the U-rich sequence is found.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.

It is not clear how these values are calculated and the number of experimental replicates is not mentioned. Comparison of the binding curves on the same graph would highlight the differences in affinity between the different substrates. Moreover, in view of the values of the affinity constants, it is unlikely to obtain values (µM) with a standard deviation of up to three digits after the decimal point. The Kd values should be revised. Finally, I do not think it is possible to determine Kd if the RNA is not 100% bound to the highest protein concentration. This is the case of the substrates: T0204-18nt (Figure 4B) , T0229-18nt (Figure 4C) and T02046-DU5 -DU4 (Fig4D).</p></disp-quote><p>The binding curves for the rEMSA gels in Figure 3 and 4 have been supplemented in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2. The Kd values have been revised accordingly by showing one digit after decimal point. Moreover, the Kd values for the substrates mentioned (T0204-18nt, T0229-18nt and T02046-DU5 -DU4) were calculated through the same methods for other RNA substrates shown in Figure 3 and 4. The binding curve for each indicated RNA was obtained through quantifying the shifted RNAs (%) vs. the protein concentrations and the Kd values were calculated by the software Prism using the nonlinear regression method. The Kd values and the standard deviations are calculated from three independent binding assays, which has been indicated in the figure legends of Figure 3, 4, Figure 3—figure supplement 2, and Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
