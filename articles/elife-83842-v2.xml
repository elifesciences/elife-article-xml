unclear how K<sup>+</sup> efflux is activated in response to select cues. Here, we report that during homeostasis, TWIK2 resides in endosomal compartments. TWIK2 is transported by endosomal fusion to the plasmalemma in response to increased extracellular ATP resulting in the extrusion of K<sup>+</sup>. We showed that ATP-induced endosomal TWIK2 plasmalemma translocation is regulated by Rab11a. Deleting Rab11a or ATP-ligated purinergic receptor P2X7 each prevented endosomal fusion with the plasmalemma and K<sup>+</sup> efflux as well as NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Adoptive transfer of Rab11a-depleted macrophages into mouse lungs prevented NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory lung injury. We conclude that Rab11a-mediated endosomal trafficking in macrophages thus regulates TWIK2 localization and activity at the cell surface and the downstream activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Results show that endosomal trafficking of TWIK2 to the plasmalemma is a potential therapeutic target in acute or chronic inflammatory states.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATP</kwd><kwd>Rab11a</kwd><kwd>P2X7</kwd><kwd>caspase 1</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01-HL60678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Asrar B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01-HL077806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Asrar B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL118068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Asrar B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HL90152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Asrar B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-HL007829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Asrar B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rab11a-mediated endosomal trafficking in macrophages regulates potassium channel localization and activity at the cell surface and the downstream activation of the inflammasome and is a potential therapeutic target in acute or chronic inflammatory states.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammasomes are key components of the immune system and inflammatory signaling platforms responsible for detecting injury mediators released during infection and tissue damage and that thereby initiate the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharma and Kanneganti, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sefik et al., 2022</xref>).

Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex is a multi-step process involving the assembly of essential proteins, and activation of caspase 1 which cleaves pro-interleukin-1Î² to release the active form of this inflammatory cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swanson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2016</xref>). NLRP3 inflammasome consists of a sensor (NLRP3), an adaptor (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain â ASC), and an effector (caspase 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharma and Kanneganti, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sefik et al., 2022</xref>). Oligomerized NLRP3 recruits ASC which in turn recruits caspase 1 and enables proximity-induced caspase 1 self-cleavage and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharma and Kanneganti, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sefik et al., 2022</xref>). Several studies have elucidated the structure and assembly of the NLRP3 complex. The inactive NLRP3 form (double-ring cages of NLRP3) is membrane-associated organelles (such as endoplasmic reticulum [ER], mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus) and is recruited, assembled, and activated at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Subramanian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Magupalli et al., 2020</xref>). However, little is known about the initiating triggers of the assembly and activation of NLRP3 complex.</p><p>We showed that essential mechanism of NLRP3 assembly involves the efflux of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) at the plasmalemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">PÃ©trilli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MuÃ±oz-Planillo et al., 2013</xref>) through the potassium channel TWIK2 (the <underline>Tw</underline>o-pore domain <underline>W</underline>eak <underline>I</underline>nwardly rectifying <underline>K<sup>+</sup></underline> channel 2), a member of the two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup> channel (K<sub>2P</sub>) family (K<sub>2P</sub> 6.1, encoded by <italic>Kcnk6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enyedi and CzirjÃ¡k, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di et al., 2018</xref>). Efflux of potassium generates regions of low intracellular K<sup>+</sup> which promote conformational change of the inactive NLRP3 to facilitate NLRP3 assembly and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tapia-AbellÃ¡n et al., 2021</xref>). Based on our model, TWIK2-mediated plasmalemmal potassium efflux thus serves as a checkpoint for the initiation of adaptive host defense signaling as well as maladaptive inflammatory signaling mediated by NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di et al., 2018</xref>). This essential function of TWIK2 raises the question how TWIK2 activity is fine tuned to avoid premature or intracellular triggering of NLRP3 during homeostasis while at the same time providing a rapid TWIK2 activation mechanism in response to extracellular tissue damage. Due to the high gradient of K<sup>+</sup> across the plasmalemma, the presence of TWIK2 at the plasma membrane results in basal K<sup>+</sup> efflux and thus may lead to inappropriate inflammasome activation. Therefore, the question of fine control of TWIK2-mediated K<sup>+</sup> efflux becomes prescient.</p><p>The activity of several ion channels such as the G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grant and Donaldson, 2009</xref>) and cardiac pacemaker channels â hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels HCN2 and HCN4 is regulated by endosomal trafficking from the cytosol to the plasmalemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hardel et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we investigated whether TWIK2 can be sequestered in the steady state in cytosolic endosomal compartments to shield cells from pathogenic inflammasome activation through the efflux of K<sup>+</sup> and that TWIK2 is only trafficked to the plasmalemma on a need basis in response to cues elicited by tissue injury that trigger potassium efflux and activate NLRP3.</p><p>Using confocal and electron microscopy and electrophysiological studies, we found that TWIK2 K<sup>+</sup> channel in macrophages was expressed in endosomes at rest but translocated to the plasmalemma upon extracellular ATP challenge or release, an indicator of tissue damage. We demonstrated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive GTP-binding protein Rab11a was responsible for endosomal TWIK2 translocation to the plasmalemma. Furthermore, inhibition of endosomal fusion with the plasma membrane prevented NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Adoptive transfer of Rab11-depleted macrophages into mouse lungs prevented NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory lung injury. The studies thus demonstrate a mechanism by which endosomal trafficking of TWIK2 and K<sup>+</sup> efflux trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation without self-harm to the cell. Further the results point to inhibition of endosomal plasmalemma fusion as a potential anti-inflammatory therapy target.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endosomal TWIK2 plasmalemmal translocation induced by ATP in macrophages</title><p>TWIK2 belongs to the constitutively active K<sub>2P</sub> background potassium channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enyedi and CzirjÃ¡k, 2010</xref>); however, TWIK2 plasmalemmal currents in macrophages are only observed following challenge with extracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di et al., 2018</xref>). A explanation for this funding is that TWIK2 is not present at the plasmalemma during the basal state and can only trafficked to the plasmalemma in response to environmental cues, similar to reports for activation of other ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grant and Donaldson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hardel et al., 2008</xref>). To address this question, we imaged intracellular TWIK2 plasmalemma translocation upon ATP challenge by expressing TWIK2-GFP in macrophages. TWIK2-GFP plasmids were transfected into RAW 264.7 macrophages for 48 hr after which the cells were imaged with confocal microscopy after challenge with extracellular ATP to mimic tissue injury.

NLRP3 activation is comprised of an initial priming phase involving NF-ÎºB-dependent transcription of NLRP3 and pro-interleukin-1Î² release initiated by pro-inflammatory cytokines or stimulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) by agonists such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burns et al., 2003</xref>).

Based on studies on the structure and assembly mechanisms of NLRP3 complex, an endogenous, stimulus-responsive form of full-length mouse NLRP3 is a 12- to 16-mer double-ring cage held together by leucine-rich-repeat (LRR)âLRR interactions with the pyrin domains shielded within the assembly to avoid premature activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>). NLRP3 (consisting of double-ring cages of NLRP3) is predominantly membrane associated, such as in ER, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Subramanian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), and trans-Golgi network dispersed vesicles (dTGNvs), an early event observed in response to NLRP3-activating stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>). Double-ring caged NLRP3 is recruited to the dispersed TGN (dTGN) through ionic bonding between its conserved polybasic region and negatively charged phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) on the dTGN. dTGNvs serves as a scaffold for NLRP3 aggregation into multiple puncta, leading to polymerization of the adaptor protein ASC, and thereby activates the downstream signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Chen, 2018</xref>). NLRP3 oligomer on the membrane is poised to sense diverse signals and induce inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>). NLRP3 inflammasome is also assembled and activated at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Magupalli et al., 2020</xref>), the microtubule organizing center in mammalian cells, accounting for the singularity, size, and perinuclear location of activated inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2022</xref>).

TWIK2 contains sequence signals responsible for the expression of TWIK2 in the Lamp1-positive lysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bobak et al., 2017</xref>), and sequential inactivation of these trafficking motifs prevented the targeting of TWIK2 to lysosomes, thus enabling plasmalemmal relocation of the functional channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bobak et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we determined the mechanism of TWIK2 expression at the plasmalemma to address how the channel is functionalized in macrophages in the face of high intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration. We showed that TWIK2 in macrophages was primarily distributed in endosomes, but importantly it translocated on demand by ATP within 2 min to the plasmalemma by Rab11a-dependent mechanism. We showed that TWIK2 was primarily located in the endosomal compartment at rest, thus preventing TWIK2-mediated K<sup>+</sup> efflux into the extracellular space to avoid unchecked NLRP3 activation. However, upon ligation of the purinergic P2X7 receptor by extracellular ATP, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via P2X7 activated the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive endosomal GTPase Rab11a to induce endosomal TWIK2 translocation to the plasma membrane. K<sup>+</sup> efflux via plasma membrane translocated TWIK2 caused local K<sup>+</sup> concentration ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>) to decrease leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and phenotype transition of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Rab11a-null embryos formed normal blastocysts but died at peri-implantation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). We have previously described the role for Rab11a in regulating efferocytosis via the modulation of disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17-mediated CD36 cell surface expression as a promising strategy for activating the resolution of inflammatory lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). The present results show an obligatory role of Rab11a in mediating cycling endosomal TWIK2 plasmalemma translocation. Importantly as a test of Rab11a relevance, adoptive transfer of Rab11a-deleted macrophages into mouse lungs after alveolar macrophage depletion prevented NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory lung injury. Thus, Rab11a in macrophages has a fundamental check-point role in TWIK2 plasmalemmal translocation and regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation and endotoxemia-induced inflammatory lung injury.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice, cell cultures, and reagents</title><p>C57 black 6 (C57BL/6) mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratory. <italic>Twik2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice was a generous gift from Dr. Lavannya M.

Briefly, cell-free supernatants were collected and then assayed for murine IL-1Î² (MLB00C, R&amp;D Systems), IL-18 (7625, Medical Biological Lab), and TNF-Î± (SMTA00B, R&amp;D Systems) by ELISA kit according to the manufacturerâs protocol and the adherent macrophages were collected to generate whole-cell lysate. The cytokine concentration of the properly diluted or undiluted samples in 96-well plates was measured at 450 nm wavelength of absorbance, and calculated by GraphPad Prism linear regression analysis. Cell lysate samples and lung protein samples from mice were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfateâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to membrane for western blot analysis using various primary antibodies (Caspase 1-p20 and IL-1Î²).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>MPO assay</title><p>The lungs were homogenized in 1 ml of PBS with 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. The homogenates were sonicated, centrifuged at 40,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 20 min, and run through two freezeâthaw cycles. The samples were homogenized and centrifuged a second time. The supernatant was then collected and mixed 1/30 (vol/vol) with assay buffer (0.2 mg/ml o-dianisidine hydrochloride and 0.0005% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The change in absorbance was measured at 460 nm for 3 min, and MPO activity was calculated as the change in absorbance over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Alveolar macrophage depletion and reconstitution</title><p>Commercially available clodronate liposomes (Clodrosome) were administered directly into lungs of 10-week-old mice using a minimally invasive endotracheal instillation method. The mice were anesthetized by ketamine and xylazine (45 and 8 mg/kg, respectively) and were suspended on a flat board and placed in a semi-recumbent position with the ventral surface and rostrum facing upwards. Using curved blade Kelly forceps, the tongue is gently and partially retracted rostrally and 50 Âµl of clodronate liposomes is placed in the back of the oral cavity, which is then aspirated by the animal. Control liposomes (50 Âµl) alone were similarly administered in the control group. After 2 days of clodronate treatment, mice were reconstituted by i.t. instillation in a similar manner with differentiated MDMs (these MDMs have been treated with siRab11a for 48 hr) at dose of 2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> in a 50 Âµl volume per mice. The mice were injected with i.p. LPS (20 mg/kg) after 24 hr of macrophage reconstitution. The lungs were flushed and harvested after 24 hr of LPS challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test for comparisons of two groups or one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukeyâs post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons when appropriate with Prism 6 (GraphPad). Experimental values were reported as the means Â± standard error of the mean. Significance between groups was determined using the <italic>t</italic>-test (two tails) and asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference with the number of experiments indicated in parentheses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mice were housed in the University of Illinois Animal Care Facility in accordance with institutional and NIH guidelines.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1. The authors arrive at their conclusions regarding the role of Rab11a-dependent TWIK2-translocation to the plasmalemma in K<sup>+</sup> efflux-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation using a single stimulus, treatment with extracellular ATP. K<sup>+</sup> efflux is involved in NLRP3 activation by numerous stimuli including nigericin, pore-forming toxins such as hemolysin, LL-OMe, particulate matter such as silica, and infection with pathogenic bacteria such as pneumococcus. The authors should include many of these activators in addition to ATP in their experiments to conclusively show that Rab11a-TWIK2 translocation- K<sup>+</sup> axis is a universal requirement for K<sup>+</sup> efflux-mediated NLRP3 activation.</p><p>2. The authors use ip injection of LPS in their in vivo experiment. It is well-established that LPS injection in vivo activates the caspase-11-dependent noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome. To connect their in vitro and in vivo findings and increase the relevance of their in vivo data, the authors should show that Rab11a-TWIK2 translocation- K<sup>+</sup> axis is required for noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro. They could use LPS transfection or infection with Gram negative bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>4. Figure 3, 4, 5: in their inhibitor/siRNA experiments the authors should measure control inflammasome-independent cytokines such as IL-6 or TNF to show that the cells are functional, and the defect observed is inflammasome specific.</p><p>5. To establish the role of Rab11a, P2X7 and calcium influx in mediating the translocation of TWIK2 to the plasma membrane, the authors would need to perform the following experiments:</p><p>â Immunostaining of TWIK2 in wildtype and Rab11a-depleted macrophages following ATP stimulation to compare the distribution of TWIK2.</p><p>â Immunostaining of TWIK2 in wildtype and P2X7-KO macrophages following ATP stimulation to compare the distribution of TWIK2.</p><p>â Immunostaining of TWIK2 in wildtype macrophages left untreated, treated with vacuolin/BAPTA, and removed calcium, followed by ATP stimulation to compare the distribution of TWIK2.</p><p>6. The incomplete characterization of the inflammasome activation can be addressed by:</p><p>â Providing IL-1b and IL-18 data to support Figure 3C-F.</p><p>â Providing IL-1b and IL-18 data to support Figure 4D-G.</p><p>â Providing IL-1b and IL-18 data to support Figure 6B-D.</p><p>â Providing caspase-1 western blot data to support Figure 4A-C.</p><p>7. The colocalization data in Figure 2 should be quantified. Some co-localization signals between TWIK2 and the ER marker PDI can be seen but this was not addressed in the manuscript.</p><p>8. The time course of TWIK2 localization in Figure 1a is unconvincing, as it only appears that the abundance of TWIK2 reduces in the ATP-treated cells relative to the control cells. The use of plasma membrane markers could reinforce this conclusion. These experiments should be performed in BMDMs rather than RAW264.7 cells which are not a good model for inflammasomes given their absence of ASC and altered NF-ÎºB/MAPK signaling. Why was TWIK2-GFP used in immunofluorescence microscopy when an antibody was available? Antibody staining specificity could be validated with TWIK2 knockouts.</p><p>9. For the NLRP3 inflammasome activation experiments carried out in Figures 3, 4 and 5, a knockdown or knockout of TWIK2 should be included to reinforce the role of TWIK2 in this activation. As it stands, the results only suggest that something in the Rab11a-containing recycling-endosome is leading to activation of the inflammasome. Authors have not shown that Rab11a deficiency reduces TWIK2 trafficking in Figure 5.</p><p>10. Authors conclusions on inflammasome activation defects with Rab11a can only be supported when western blotting and other experiments ruling out effects on pro-IL-1Î² expression and NLRP3 priming. That Rab11a only acts to prevent TWIK2 trafficking has not been conclusively shown. Vacuolin can inhibit many processes, including autophagy, lysosome exocytosis etc. therefore, its use does not necessarily only implicate Rab11a-mediated TWIK2 trafficking.</p><p>11. Would the loss of NLRP3 activation following ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, BAPTA treatment or Vacuole treatment be reversed via expression of a plasma-membrane targeting TWIK2 variant (as has been done for other proteins via incorporation of the N-terminal RTK palmitoylation/myristoylation motif)? Say under the control of an inducible promoter to prevent constitutive inflammasome activation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This important study by Di et al., focuses on the mechanism by which potassium channels are activated prior to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Using confocal- and electron-microscopy studies the authors demonstrate that the potassium channel, TWIK2, located in the endosomal compartment during basal conditions, is translocated onto the plasmalemma upon ATP stimulation. The authors suggest that this translocation triggers potassium efflux and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Using Rab11a-deficient cells, the authors also show an essential role for Rab11a in this process. This is a well written study that has novel findings that are of interest to the inflammasome field. However, multiple issues need to be addressed and important controls should be included to sufficiently justify the authors' conclusions. Detailed comments are given below.</p><p>1. The authors arrive at their conclusions regarding the role of Rab11a-dependent TWIK2-translocation to the plasmalemma in K<sup>+</sup> efflux-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation using a single stimulus, treatment with extracellular ATP. K<sup>+</sup> efflux is involved in NLRP3 activation by numerous stimuli including nigericin, pore-forming toxins such as hemolysin, LL-OMe, particulate matter such as silica, and infection with pathogenic bacteria such as pneumococcus.

They could use LPS transfection or infection with Gram negative bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>3. Figure 3A-B: The authors conclude that ATP-induced exocytic event is required for plasmalemma K<sup>+</sup> efflux by measuring membrane capacitance increase. Does this specifically measure K<sup>+</sup> efflux? If not, the authors should directly assess K<sup>+</sup> efflux by measuring intracellular K<sup>+</sup> levels via commonly used methods such as (APG)4 and pluronic acid F-127 assays ( Refer Eil et al., Nature 2016; Prindle et al., Nature 2015).</p><p>4. Figure 3, 4, 5: in their inhibitor/siRNA experiments the authors should measure control inflammasome-independent cytokines such as IL-6 or TNF to show that the cells are functional, and the defect observed is inflammasome specific.</p><p>5. There are discrepancies is the figure call outs in the text. Eg: Figure 5 is called out as Figure 4 in the text and Figure 6 as Figure 5.</p><p>6. Authors mention that they evaluated the siRNA-Rab11a efficiency via western blot, however, have not included the data in the manuscript. This western image should be included to show that the siRNA treatment in fact depleted Rab11a (both in the in vitro and in vivo experiments).</p><p>7. As mentioned in comment 2, LPS injection activates noncanonical inflammasome in mice. In this pathway, K<sup>+</sup> efflux-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation occurs downstream of gasdermin D activation. To show that the defect they observed in mice that received Rab11a-depleted macrophages is specific to the NLRP3 arm of the pathway and not an upstream event, they should assess gasdermin D cleavage in the lung lysates. Similarly, they should measure inflammasome-independent cytokines such as TNF or IL-6 to show that Rab11a-deficiency does not affect upstream TLR4 activation.</p><p>8. The authors should include the number of mice they used for each experiment in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

The statistical analysis in Figure 5G is not applied appropriately. The comparison should be made between LPS+ATP (scRNA) versus LPS+ATP (Rab11a siRNA).</p><p>5.

In the introduction, (p5 of 38), &quot;This essential function of K<sup>+</sup> TWIK2 mediated efflux in initiating macrophage inflammatory response&quot; suggests that TWIK2 is an essential component of all inflammatory responses, whereas the authors' previous Immunity paper shows that it is essential only for the inflammatory response to the extracellular DAMP ATP. Please clarify this in the text.</p><p>2.

The authors arrive at their conclusions regarding the role of Rab11a-dependent TWIK2-translocation to the plasmalemma in K<sup>+</sup> efflux-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation using a single stimulus, treatment with extracellular ATP. K<sup>+</sup> efflux is involved in NLRP3 activation by numerous stimuli including nigericin, pore-forming toxins such as hemolysin, LL-OMe, particulate matter such as silica, and infection with pathogenic bacteria such as pneumococcus. The authors should include many of these activators in addition to ATP in their experiments to conclusively show that Rab11a-TWIK2 translocation- K<sup>+</sup> axis is a universal requirement for K<sup>+</sup> efflux-mediated NLRP3 activation.</p></disp-quote><p>These are good suggestions. We do not argue Rab11a-TWIK2 translocation- K<sup>+</sup> axis is a universal requirement for K<sup>+</sup> efflux-mediated NLRP3 activation. Also we do not think Rab11a is involved in nigericin mediated changes, it has a role in pore-forming toxins such as hemolysin, LL-OMe, particulate matter such as silica, and in mediating infection with other bacteria than the model we used. This statement is based on findings that TWIK2 does not play a role in pore-forming toxins such as nigericin and infection such as <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced NLRP3 activation; please see the Figure 3 and related text in our <italic>Immunity</italic> paper <sup>1</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors use ip injection of LPS in their in vivo experiment. It is well-established that LPS injection in vivo activates the caspase-11-dependent noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome. To connect their in vitro and in vivo findings and increase the relevance of their in vivo data, the authors should show that Rab11a-TWIK2 translocation- K<sup>+</sup> axis is required for noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro. They could use LPS transfection or infection with Gram negative bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good insight, but we do not argue based on our in vivo data that Rab11a-TWIK2 translocation- K<sup>+</sup> axis is in fact the sole pathway for LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammation. There potentially could be other pathways including caspase-11-dependent noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome in LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our in vitro data clearly showed that Rab11a-TWIK2 translocation- K<sup>+</sup> axis is a fundamental pathway mediating LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This was the focus and the important point of this study.</p><p>On the other hand, Caspase 11-dependent non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation does not need K<sup>+</sup> efflux (see review <sup>2</sup>). Caspase 11 directly activated NLRP3 inflammasome, thus we do not think Rab11a-TWIK2 translocation- K<sup>+</sup> axis is required for noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3, 4, 5: in their inhibitor/siRNA experiments the authors should measure control inflammasome-independent cytokines such as IL-6 or TNF to show that the cells are functional, and the defect observed is inflammasome specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added TNF-Î± as control in these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. To establish the role of Rab11a, P2X7 and calcium influx in mediating the translocation of TWIK2 to the plasma membrane, the authors would need to perform the following experiments:</p><p>â Immunostaining of TWIK2 in wildtype and Rab11a-depleted macrophages following ATP stimulation to compare the distribution of TWIK2.</p><p>â Immunostaining of TWIK2 in wildtype and P2X7-KO macrophages following ATP stimulation to compare the distribution of TWIK2.</p><p>â Immunostaining of TWIK2 in wildtype macrophages left untreated, treated with vacuolin/BAPTA, and removed calcium, followed by ATP stimulation to compare the distribution of TWIK2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these experiments in Figure 5C-F. Since the TWIK2 staining by TWIK2 antibody is weak in mouse monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), and also it is hard to transfect MDMs with TWIK2 plasmids, we used the mouse cell line â RAW 264.7 macrophage cells transfected TWIK2-GFP plasmid in these studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The incomplete characterization of the inflammasome activation can be addressed by:</p><p>â Providing IL-1b and IL-18 data to support Figure 3C-F.</p><p>â Providing IL-1b and IL-18 data to support Figure 4D-G.</p><p>â Providing IL-1b and IL-18 data to support Figure 6B-D.</p><p>â Providing caspase-1 western blot data to support Figure 4A-C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added IL-1Î² and IL-18 to the original Figures 3C-F, 4D-G, 6D-D in Figure 3G-H, 4I-J, 6E-F. We have also added the caspase-1 Western blot results to support the original Figure 4A-C in Figure 4G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The colocalization data in Figure 2 should be quantified. Some co-localization signals between TWIK2 and the ER marker PDI can be seen but this was not addressed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified these data (Figure 2E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The time course of TWIK2 localization in Figure 1a is unconvincing, as it only appears that the abundance of TWIK2 reduces in the ATP-treated cells relative to the control cells. The use of plasma membrane markers could reinforce this conclusion. These experiments should be performed in BMDMs rather than RAW264.7 cells which are not a good model for inflammasomes given their absence of ASC and altered NF-ÎºB/MAPK signaling. Why was TWIK2-GFP used in immunofluorescence microscopy when an antibody was available? Antibody staining specificity could be validated with TWIK2 knockouts.</p></disp-quote><p>First, the reason for âit only appears that the abundance of TWIK2 reduces in the ATP-treated cells relative to control cells (in the time course of TWIK2 localization in Figure 1A)â is that these images were taken from videos in which the resolution was poor, thus the distributed TWIK2 in the plasma membrane was difficult to see. We have now used membrane marker to confirm the TWIK2 plasma membrane translocation after ATP challenge (Figure 1B).</p><p>Second, the TWIK2 staining by TWIK2 antibody is weak in mouse monocyte- derived macrophages (thus it is also hard to validate the TWIK2 antibody staining specificity with TWIK2 knockouts MDMs). Furthermore, itâs hard to transfect MDMs with TWIK2 plasmids. Thus in these experiments, we used RAW264.7 cells transfected with TWIK2-GFP. We studied TWIK2 translocation, not NLRP3 inflammasome activation (all NLRP3 inflammasome activation in this study was carried out in MDMs); thus, absence of ASC and altered NF-ÎºB/MAPK signaling should not affect TWIK2 translocation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. For the NLRP3 inflammasome activation experiments carried out in Figures 3, 4 and 5, a knockdown or knockout of TWIK2 should be included to reinforce the role of TWIK2 in this activation. As it stands, the results only suggest that something in the Rab11a-containing recycling-endosome is leading to activation of the inflammasome. Authors have not shown that Rab11a deficiency reduces TWIK2 trafficking in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown the key role of TWIK2 in the mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in our <italic>Immunity</italic> paper <sup>1</sup>. Here we focussed specifically on the role of Rab11a in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In this context, we show additional new added Rab11a deficiency reduces TWIK2 trafficking in Figure 5C-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Authors conclusions on inflammasome activation defects with Rab11a can only be supported when western blotting and other experiments ruling out effects on pro-IL-1Î² expression and NLRP3 priming. That Rab11a only acts to prevent TWIK2 trafficking has not been conclusively shown. Vacuolin can inhibit many processes, including autophagy, lysosome exocytosis etc. therefore, its use does not necessarily only implicate Rab11a-mediated TWIK2 trafficking.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the effects of siRNA-Rab11a on pro-IL-1Î² and NLRP3 priming using Western blotting (Figure 5 I). The results showed siRNA-depletion of Rab11a treatment did not affect pro-IL-1Î² expression and NLRP3 priming (Figure 5 L).</p><p>Vacuolin was used based on its inhibitory role on both endosome trafficking<sup>3</sup> and exocytosis of lysosomes <sup>4</sup>. Our electrophysiological studies (both capacitance measurements as an indicator of exocytosis and whole cell current measurements as an indicator of activation of ion channels) show not only ATP-induced exocytosis was blocked by Vacuolin (Figure 3A); but importantly, they also showed that ATP-induced potassium current was blocked in the cells treated with vacuolin (Figure 3B). These results indicate that ATP-induced TWIK2 activation was the result of the plasmembrane fusion event. This was our intent in using vacuolin here. We donât argue its use here only implicates Rab11a-mediated TWIK2 trafficking.</p><p>On the other hand, the functional study of NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by ATP was inhibited by vacuolin (Figure 3C-H). Also electrophysiological studies showed that ATP-induced potassium channel activation occurred via the plasmlemma membrane fusion event (Figure 3A-B). These result together provide strong evidence that plasma membrane fusion event was linked to the potassium channel activation; hence, this was our intent in using vacuolin for these studies. The key evidence for Rab11a-mediated TWIK2 trafficking is shown in Figure 5C-D in this revised version of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.
