Here, we show that in a social insect, the ant <italic>Lasius neglectus</italic>, the negative consequences of fungal infections (<italic>Metarhizium brunneum</italic>) can be mitigated by employing an efficient multicomponent behaviour, termed destructive disinfection, which prevents further spread of the disease through the colony. Ants specifically target infected pupae during the pathogen’s non-contagious incubation period, utilising chemical ‘sickness cues’ emitted by pupae. They then remove the pupal cocoon, perforate its cuticle and administer antimicrobial poison, which enters the body and prevents pathogen replication from the inside out. Like the immune system of a metazoan body that specifically targets and eliminates infected cells, ants destroy infected brood to stop the pathogen completing its lifecycle, thus protecting the rest of the colony. Hence, in an analogous fashion, the same principles of disease defence apply at different levels of biological organisation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32073.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ants live in crowded societies where disease can spread rapidly and take a heavy toll on the community. Ants have a number of ways to prevent these outbreaks before they become a problem. Like many other social species, they practice good hygiene and groom nest mates that have picked up a pathogen, which helps them to recover and to reduce the likelihood of the disease spreading.</p><p>Unlike other social species, ants appear to have evolved collective disease defence, or social immunity, because their colonies behave like a ‘superorganism’, in which the society behaves much like a single organism would. Like an individual animal that has an infection, the colony needs to be able to eliminate infections collectively when a nest mate falls ill, to prevent the disease from spreading.</p><p>To understand how an ant colony protects itself when the care fails and a colony member contracts a lethal infection, Pull et al. infected the brood of the invasive garden ant with a common soil fungus. Using a combination of chemical analyses and behavioural observations, it was shown that the infected pupae emitted a chemical cue, which the tending ants could detect. Using a microscopic camera, Pull et al. found that when the ants sensed the cue, they would unpack the infected pupae from their cocoons and bite them. They then sprayed them with an antiseptic poison, which entered the hole in the pupae’s body, killing both the pupae and the fungus inside, before it had a chance to spread.</p><p>This process of destructive disinfection may seem like a large sacrifice, but it helps to protect the rest of the colony from a fungus that could lead to much greater damage. The tending ants were acting within the superorganism of the colony much like immune cells act within an individual’s body – honing in on infected cells and destroying them before the pathogen can spread to other cells. This suggests that the ability to detect and destroy harmful elements was necessary for both the evolution of multicellular organisms, and from single animals to superorganisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Metarhizium brunneum</italic></kwd><kwd>social immunity</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interactions</kwd><kwd>social evolution</kwd><kwd>brood</kwd><kwd><italic>Lasius neglectus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Starting Grant 243071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cremer</surname><given-names>Sylvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC-IEF 302004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ugelvig</surname><given-names>Line V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Upon detecting a fatal infection using chemical cues, ants puncture the cuticle of sick brood and inject antimicrobial poison that disrupts the pathogen's life cycle and prevents it from reproducing, thus protecting the colony from disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pathogen replication and transmission from infectious to susceptible hosts is key to the success of contagious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schmid-Hempel, 2011</xref>). Social animals are therefore expected to experience a greater risk of disease outbreaks than solitary species, because their higher number of within-group interactions will promote pathogen spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nunn and Altizer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schmid-Hempel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander, 1974</xref>). As a consequence, evolutionary immunology predicts that traits mitigating this cost, such as detecting sick conspecifics and using that information to prevent self-infection, should have been selected for in group-living animals as an essential adaptation to social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hamilton, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ezenwa et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Social animals, including lobsters, tadpoles, mice and mandrills, can use conspicuous disease-associated changes in the physical appearance, behaviour and chemical odour of conspecifics to identify sick group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shakhar and Shakhar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arakawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lopes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bozza, 2015</xref>). Upon detection, healthy animals usually respond by interacting with sick conspecifics less or avoiding them completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Poirotte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kiesecker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behringer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Behringer, 2013</xref>). In addition, they may prophylactically increase the expression of their immune defences in preparation for a potential immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hernández López et al., 2017</xref>), and a similar phenomenon is observed in animals and plants in response to chemicals released by wounded conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Heil and Silva Bueno, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Peuß et al., 2015</xref>). Because there are downsides to being socially excluded, sick animals may, under some circumstances, attempt to hide their illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lopes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lopes et al., 2012</xref>). However, signalling infection to others should be adaptive if (i) this elicits care from conspecifics that improves the chance of recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hart, 1990</xref>) or (ii) if the infection is otherwise likely to spread and infect kin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shakhar and Shakhar, 2015</xref>). This is because individuals can gain indirect fitness by enhancing the propagation of shared genes, present in relatives, into the next generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hamilton, 1964</xref>). Hence, in a closely related social group, an animal that warns its relatives if it is sick is likely to have a greater inclusive fitness than an animal that does not, since fewer of its kin will fall sick and suffer reductions in fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shakhar and Shakhar, 2015</xref>). Hence, in closely related social groups, there may be selection for both the detection of illnesses by healthy group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Curtis, 2014</xref>) and the advertisement of an animal’s disease status by sick individuals themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shakhar and Shakhar, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the social insects (termites and ants and the social bees and wasps), colonies are typically single families, comprised of a queen and her daughters, the workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Queller and Strassmann, 2003</xref>). They typically have an irreversible reproductive division of labour, with the two castes being highly interdependent: the queens are morphologically specialised for reproduction and cannot survive without the assistance of the workers; conversely, the workers cannot reproduce, but gain fitness indirectly by raising the queen’s offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Queller and Strassmann, 2003</xref>). Consequently, social insect societies have become indivisible, reproductive units, where natural selection acts on the colony instead of its individual members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bourke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">West et al., 2015</xref>). This has parallels to the evolution of complex multicellular organisms, that is metazoan bodies, where sterile somatic tissue and germ line cells form an indivisible reproducing body. Hence, social insect colonies are often termed ‘superorganisms’ and their emergence is considered a major evolutionary transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bourke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">West et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Wheeler, 1911</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boomsma and Gawne, 2017</xref>). Since evolution favours the survival of the colony over its members, selection has resulted in a plethora of cooperative and altruistic traits that workers perform to protect the colony from harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hamilton, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bourke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cremer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shorter and Rueppell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rosengaus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boomsma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, social insects have evolved physiological and behavioural adaptations that limit the colony-level impact of infectious diseases, which could otherwise spread easily due to the intimate social interactions between colony members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cremer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rosengaus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boomsma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Stroeymeyt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Meunier, 2015</xref>). These defences are performed collectively by the workers to form an emergent layer of protection known as social immunity that, like the immune system of a body, protects the colony from invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cremer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rosengaus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cremer and Sixt, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our understanding of how social immunity functions is based mostly on the behaviours social insects perform to prevent infection in contaminated colony members, referred to as sanitary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cremer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rosengaus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wilson-Rich et al., 2009</xref>). In ants, sanitary care involves grooming and the use of antimicrobial secretions to mechanically remove and chemically disinfect pathogens, reducing the likelihood that pathogen exposure leads to the development of an infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Graystock and Hughes, 2011</xref>). During sanitary care, protection of the colony is aligned with the protection of the individual colony member. In contrast, this is not the case if an individual is infected with a contagious disease, since they risk infecting the rest of the colony if the pathogen spreads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, social immunity is characterised by a care-kill dichotomy, where colony members should be cared for when possible but sacrificed if necessary, both of which benefit the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cremer and Sixt, 2009</xref>). Although the kill-component is an unique feature of social immunity that is not present in the disease defence repertoire of other forms of sociality (e.g. non-superorganismal family groups, communal breeders or aggregations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>]), it is rarely studied in comparison to the care-component. Hence, what happens when sanitary care fails and a pathogen successfully infects a colony member, with the consequent potential to create an epidemic, remains poorly understood (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rothenbuhler, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Ugelvig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tragust et al., 2013b</xref>]). To effectively protect the colony, we predict that infections should be detected quickly and accurately by nestmates, in order to overcome the pathogen before it has time to replicate and produce propagules that can infect others. Once detected, the colony should respond by eliminating the infection as effectively as possible, by preventing any further opportunities for disease transmission. This is especially pertinent in the ants and termites, because their sedentary and territorial lifestyle makes it likely infectious corpses are encountered again, even if they are removed from the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boomsma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schmid-Hempel, 1998</xref>). For example, previous studies have shown that fungus-infected ants become highly contagious to nestmates after death and can cause epidemics that result in colony collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hughes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Loreto and Hughes, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To address the above gaps in our knowledge of social immunity, we investigated how ants detect and respond to infections. To that end, we exposed the immobile brood of the invasive garden ant, <italic>Lasius neglectus,</italic> to a generalist fungal pathogen, <italic>Metarhizium brunneum</italic>. When the infectious conidiospores of this fungus come into contact with insect cuticle, they attach, germinate and penetrate the host cuticle within 24–48 hr to cause internal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Vestergaard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Walker and Hughes, 2009</xref>). During a short, non-infectious incubation period following infection, the fungus goes through a single-cell blastospore stage, which lasts 1–2 days. Once the host has died, the fungus enters a saprophytic mycelial phase, then grows out of the corpse, 1–3 days later, releasing millions of new infectious conidiospores, in a process called sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hughes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Deacon, 2006</xref>). Previous work found that brood infected with <italic>Metarhizium</italic> is removed from the brood chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Ugelvig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tragust et al., 2013b</xref>), however, it is unknown how the ants then respond to the infection. Hence, in this study, we performed a series of behavioural and chemical experiments to test how ants detect and prevent infected brood from causing a systemic colony infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Destructive disinfection of lethally infected pupae</title><p>We exposed ant pupae to one of either three dosages of <italic>Metarhizium</italic> conidiospores or a sham control. We observed that ants tending pathogen-exposed pupae prematurely removed the pupae from their cocoons in a behaviour we termed ‘unpacking’, whereas control pupae were left cocooned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; Cox proportional hazards regression: likelihood ratio test (LR) χ<sup>2</sup>= 55.48, df = 3, p&lt;0.001; hazard ratios (<italic>x</italic> greater chance of unpacking compared to control): low dose = 18, medium = 53, high = 111; post-hoc comparisons: control vs. low, p=0.004; low vs. medium, p=0.006; medium vs. high = 0.024; all others, p=0.001). Unpacking occurred between 2 and 10 days after pathogen exposure, but sooner and more frequently at higher conidiospore dosages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As unpacking was a belated response to pathogen exposure and we were unable to remove any conidiospores from the majority of the cocoons or the unpacked pupae (number of colony forming units [mean ± 95% CIs]: cocoons = 0.6 ± 0.9; pupae = 0.1 ± 0.35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we concluded that the ants were not performing unpacking to simply dispose of contaminated cocoons. Instead, we postulated that unpacking was a response to successful infection of the pupae. At the time of unpacking, the majority of pupae were still alive (i.e. had an active dorsal aorta pulse; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and fungal outgrowth had not yet occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Hence, to test if the ants were reacting to early-stage infections, we removed both unpacked and non-unpacked pathogen-exposed cocooned pupae from the ants and incubated them under optimal conditions for fungal outgrowth. We found that, on average across the conidiospore dosages, 85% of unpacked pupae harboured infections that sporulated in the absence of the ants.

Prior to unpacking, we observed the typical sanitary care behaviours reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Graystock and Hughes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hughes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Reber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Okuno et al., 2012</xref>). Namely, the ants groomed the pupae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which has the dual function of removing the conidiospores and applying the ants’ antimicrobial poison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>). In <italic>L. neglectus</italic>, the poison is mostly formic acid and is emitted from the acidopore at the abdominal tip, where the ants actively suck it up and transiently store it in their mouths until application during grooming. Additionally, the ants can spray their poison directly from the acidopore; yet, this behaviour is rarely expressed during sanitary care (about once every 28 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">[Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>]). However, after unpacking, we observed a set of behaviours markedly different to sanitary care (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The ants sprayed the pupae with poison from their acidopore approx. 15-times more frequently than during sanitary care (~13 times/d; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; generalised linear mixed model [GLMM]: LR χ<sup>2</sup> = 17.04, df = 1, p&lt;0.001), and grooming duration doubled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; linear mixed effects regression [LMER]: LR χ<sup>2</sup> = 145.26, df = 1, p&lt;0.001). Given that there was no fungus to remove at the time of unpacking, the increase in grooming probably functioned solely to apply poison from the oral store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>). Furthermore, the ants repeatedly bit the pupae to make perforations in their cuticles and to remove their limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; GLMM: LR χ<sup>2</sup> = 39.44, df = 1, p&lt;0.001). Together these three behaviours resulted in the death of the pupae and left their corpses heavily damaged and coated in the ants’ poison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>).

Previous work establishing the composition of <italic>L. neglectus</italic> poison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>) allowed us to create a synthetic version for use in this experiment (60% formic acid and 2% acetic acid, in water; applied at a dose equivalent to what ants apply during destructive disinfection; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), with water as a sham control. We then performed these ‘behaviours’ in different combinations in a full-factorial experiment. We found that all three behaviours must be performed in the correct order and interact to prevent pathogen replication (overview graph showing odds ratios of sporulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, full data dataset displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; GLM: overall LR χ<sup>2</sup> = 79.9, df = 5, p&lt;0.001; interaction between behaviours LR χ<sup>2</sup> = 20.6, df = 2, p&lt;0.001; all post-hoc comparisons in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). As in sanitary care, the poison was the active antimicrobial compound that inhibited fungal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3,</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Graystock and Hughes, 2011</xref>). However, for the poison to function the pupae had to be removed from their cocoons and their cuticles damaged. Firstly, this is because the cocoon itself is hydrophobic and thus prevents the aqueous poison from reaching the pupae inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Secondly, as the infection is growing internally at the time of unpacking, the cuticle must be broken in order for the poison to enter the hemocoel of the pupae. This is achieved with the perforations created by the ants biting the pupal cuticle. It is possible that in the wild biting also helps to desiccate the pupae, since high levels of humidity are important for <italic>Metarhizium</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Doberski, 1981</xref>). However, in our experiments, the relative humidity inside the petri dishes was always a stable 95%, so desiccation cannot have played a role in fungal inhibition. As the active antimicrobial component, we concluded that the poison is probably the limiting factor determining whether destructive disinfection is successful. Because the poison has a slow biosynthesis and each ant can only store a limited amount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hefetz and Blum, 1978</xref>), it would explain why destructive disinfection was more likely to be successful the longer the ants had to treat the pupae, and as the number of ants increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Into one of the chambers we placed an infectious sporulating pupa – simulating a failure of the ants to detect and destroy the infection – or a pupa that had been destructively disinfected, and was thus non-infectious. The ants groomed, moved around and sprayed both types of corpses with poison. In the case of the sporulating pupae, all conidiospores were removed from the corpse by the ants.

This is achieved through the detection of chemical cues emitted by infected pupae during the non-transmissible incubation period of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The ants then engage in destructive disinfection, a multicomponent behaviour that utilises the ants’ antimicrobial poison, in conjunction with cocoon removal and biting, to prevent pathogen replication within the body of the pupae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Ultimately, this prevented the pathogen from completing its lifecycle and infecting new hosts, thereby effectively reducing pathogen fitness to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These findings show that ants do not only avoid, groom and isolate pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cremer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>) but can detect and eliminate infections developing inside the bodies of their nestmates, even before they have shown external disease symptoms.</p><p>Whilst the role of ant poison as a topical disinfectant by ants and other animals (i.e. ‘anting’ behaviour in birds) is well characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Clayton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Verderane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tragust, 2016</xref>), its use as an internal disinfectant within the body of others during destructive disinfection is a novel and a rare example of the kill-component of social immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cremer and Sixt, 2009</xref>). Eliminating infected kin to protect the rest of the group, observed in termites and honeybees as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rothenbuhler, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chouvenc and Su, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Spivak and Gilliam, 1998</xref>), requires an unconditional level of altruism that is expected to be absent or at least rare in other forms of sociality (e.g. aggregations, non-superorganismal family groups and communal breeders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>]), but has parallels to the immune system of the metazoan body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cremer and Sixt, 2009</xref>). Both the immune system and social immunity have first lines of defences that reduce the risk of infection: pathogens that enter the body are met with mechanical and chemical defences, such as ciliated cells in the lung that move pathogens trapped in mucus out of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cremer and Sixt, 2009</xref>), and in ants, sanitary care plays an analogous role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Graystock and Hughes, 2011</xref>). However, if a pathogen circumvents these first defences in the body and an infection occurs, the second line of defence is often a targeted elimination of the infected cells. This starts with immune cells detecting an infection and then transporting cell death-inducing and antimicrobial compounds into infected cells by creating pores in their membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Walch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kägi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chowdhury and Lieberman, 2008</xref>). Likewise, our experiments revealed that ants unpack infected pupae and make perforations in their cuticle, enabling the ants to spray their poison directly into the pupae’s body; hence they display mechanisms analogous to immune cell elimination. In both cases, this second line of defence destroys the infected cell/insect, along with the infection, to prevent transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shore et al., 1976</xref>). Since the loss of both somatic cells and individual insect workers can be tolerated with negligible effects on fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cremer and Sixt, 2009</xref>), these convergent strategies have likely evolved at both the multicellular and superorganismal levels of biological organisation, as an effective way to clear infections and avoid any further damage to the body and colony, respectively.</p><p>Animals from a variety of taxa are known to identify sick conspecifics based on odour signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bozza, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Poirotte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kiesecker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Behringer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shirasu and Touhara, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Swanson et al., 2009</xref>), and although it has been hypothesised that ants should also use chemical cues to detect sick colony members, evidence has so far been lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Ugelvig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Leclerc and Detrain, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bos et al., 2012</xref>). To our knowledge, we have therefore observed ants using chemical information for the first time to rapidly and accurately target infected individuals. We found that the chemical compounds with increased abundances on infected pupae are distinct from those that induce the removal of corpses in ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Diez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Qiu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Wilson et al., 1958</xref>), and, like in tapeworm-infected ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Trabalon et al., 2000</xref>), are not pathogen-derived. This alteration of the hosts’ chemical profile may arise during infection from the breakdown of hydrocarbons by <italic>Metarhizium</italic> penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lin et al., 2011</xref>) or after infection due to an immune response affecting the synthesis of specific hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Richard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Richard et al., 2008</xref>). The latter is more likely because the ants only display destructive disinfection once the fungus is growing inside the pupae and injection of a fungal immune elicitor in the absence of live pathogen induced similar changes. The four CHCs specifically increased on unpacked pupae are all long-chained CHCs (carbon chain length C<sub>33-35</sub>) with a low volatility, meaning that the ants have to be close to or touching the pupae to detect them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). As ants keep pupae in large piles, using low-volatility CHCs may be important so that the ants can accurately identify the infected pupae and do not mistakenly destroy healthy ones. Interestingly, two of the four CHCs that were increased on infected pupae, as well as on pupae that were injected with the fungal cell wall component, also had higher abundances on virus-infected honeybees (Tritriacontadiene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baracchi et al., 2012</xref>]), or their brood when injected with a bacterial cell membrane component (Tritriacontene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Richard et al., 2012</xref>]). This raises the possibility that these hydrocarbons are evolutionarily conserved ‘sickness cues’ in Hymenopteran social insects. Such cues may have evolved into general sickness signals in social insects as they alert their kin to the presence of a developing infection that will harm the colony if it spreads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Shakhar and Shakhar, 2015</xref>). Relying on cues generated by an immune response to detect infections, over pathogen-specific cues, is likely more robust and general, similar to the expression of ‘find-me/eat-me’ signals by infected cells in vertebrate bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ravichandran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Grimsley and Ravichandran, 2003</xref>), as well as the immune system responding to cell damage signals (danger signal hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Matzinger, 2007</xref>]). Such signals will be selected for in social insects because they can enhance colony fitness (and hence the indirect fitness of the sick individual) by preventing a systemic infection. Therefore, altruistic displays of sickness can evolve in superorganisms, even if this results in the destruction of the individual that expresses them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments show that destructive disinfection was highly effective and prevented 95% of infections becoming transmissible. Destructive disinfection will thus keep the average number of secondary infections caused by an initial infection low and the disease will die out within the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schmid-Hempel, 2017</xref>). This may explain why infections of <italic>Metarhizium</italic> and other generalist entomopathogenic fungi like <italic>Beauveria</italic>, though common in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Reber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hughes et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cremer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Keller et al., 2003</xref>), do not seem to cause colony-wide epidemics in ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>), but are more numerous in solitary species that lack social adaptations to resist disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Roberts and St Leger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shimazu, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lomer et al., 1997</xref>). Behaviours like destructive disinfection that are able to reduce pathogen fitness to zero could have selected for host manipulation in fungi that specialise on infecting ants, for example <italic>Ophiocordyceps</italic> and <italic>Pandora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hughes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Loreto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Małagocka et al., 2017</xref>). These fungi manipulate their ant hosts into leaving the nest before they become infectious and our study supports previous suggestions that this may be to avoid social immunity defences, like destructive disinfection, which would prevent them completing their lifecycle inside the nest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Loreto et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to specialists, generalist pathogens like <italic>Metarhizium</italic> infect a broad range of solitary and social hosts, making it less likely that they evolve strategies to escape social immunity defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agosta et al., 2010</xref>). We have also observed destructive disinfection in an unrelated supercolonial population of <italic>L. neglectus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Ugelvig et al., 2008</xref>) and another non-supercolonial/non-invasive <italic>Lasius</italic> species, <italic>L. niger</italic> (see Materials and methods for more information), suggesting that it may be a common behaviour that has evolved in <italic>Lasius</italic>, and possibly other ant genera, in response to the constant selection pressure applied by generalist pathogenic fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>). Future work that investigates how social immunity disrupts typical host-pathogen dynamics will shed light on the co-evolution of pathogens and their social hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schmid-Hempel, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Destructive disinfection has probably evolved in ants because the removal of corpses from the colony alone does not guarantee that disease transmission is prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Loreto et al., 2014</xref>). Ants are usually sedentary, building nests that remain in the same location until the colony dies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boomsma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schmid-Hempel, 1998</xref>). Additionally, they are highly territorial and forage mostly in the area around their nests, meaning that if they do not clear it of dead and potentially infectious nestmates, they are likely to be reencountered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boomsma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cremer et al., 2017</xref>). Ants tend therefore to place corpses onto specific midden (trash) sites that are located inside or outside near the nest, but these sites are still regularly visited by midden workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Verza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hart and Ratnieks, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Farji-Brener et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, although middens likely reduce a colony’s exposure to corpses, they still represent a potential route for disease transmission back into the colony; hence the need to destroy infected corpses rather than simply taking them out of the nest. This is in contrast to honeybees, where corpses are dumped randomly outside of the hive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wilson-Rich et al., 2009</xref>). This behaviour is sufficient to prevent disease transmission because honeybees are unlikely to reencounter corpses whilst foraging on the wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Spivak and Reuter, 2001</xref>). Termites on the other hand cannibalise their dead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chouvenc and Su, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rosengaus and Traniello, 2001</xref>). Cannibalism is effective because the termite gut and/or its microbiome neutralises ingested pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chouvenc et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rosengaus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rosengaus et al., 1998</xref>) and has likely evolved because dead nestmates are a source of valuable nitrogen in their cellulose-base diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rosengaus et al., 2011</xref>). The same selective pressure has driven this suite of independently evolved innovations – the need to eliminate or remove infected individuals early in the infectious cycle – with the ants expressing a particularly complex behavioural repertoire. This seems to be a general principle in disease defence, as cells are also rapidly detected and destroyed shortly after infection to prevent pathogen spread in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cremer and Sixt, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Understanding how natural selection can result in similar traits at different levels of biological organisation and in organisms with different life histories is a central question in evolutionary biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bourke, 2011</xref>). Studying the similarities and differences between organismal immunity and social immunity could therefore potentially lead to new insights about how disease defences evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cremer and Sixt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kennedy et al., 2017</xref>). For example, in most social animals, where relatedness is low or altruism is only conditionally expressed (e.g. by young that eventually disperse to reproduce themselves), disease defences tend to rely on self-protective infection avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Curtis, 2014</xref>), mutually expressed sanitary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nunn and Altizer, 2006</xref>) and herd immunity only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">John and Samuel, 2000</xref>). In contrast, the results of our study suggest that equivalent selection pressures during the major evolutionary transitions from unicellularity to multicellularity in the metazoans, and from sociality to superorganismality in the social insects, have resulted in convergent defences that protect multicellular organisms and superorganismal insect societies from systemic disease spread, by ensuring the survival of the whole over its parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cremer and Sixt, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ant host</title><p>We studied the invasive garden ant <italic>Lasius neglectus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cremer et al., 2008</xref>) that forms large, underground nests in the soil.

We included the day of unpacking as a covariate to test if pupae unpacked sooner or later were more or less likely to have already died.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Estimation of poison load on pupae after destructive disinfection</title><p>As <italic>L. neglectus</italic> poison has a very high acidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tragust et al., 2013a</xref>), we could measure the pH of pupae to determine if ants apply higher amounts poison to pupae during destructive disinfection. We kept a pair of pathogen-exposed or sham control pupae with two ants. When one of the pathogen-exposed pupae in a pair was unpacked, we let the ants perform destructive disinfection for 24 hr (<italic>n</italic> = 25). In the control, we experimentally unpacked one pupa in a pair and placed it back with the ants for 24 hr (<italic>n</italic> = 17). After 24 hr, we removed the unpacked pupae in both treatments along with their discarded cocoons. At the same time, the second, still cocooned pupae in each pair was removed and experimentally unpacked so that pH measurements were consistent across pupal groups (pathogen exposed, <italic>n</italic> = 9; control, <italic>n</italic> = 16). All pupae and their cocoons were placed into individual vials containing 20 µl of autoclaved distilled water and a sterile glass pestle was used to crush each pupa and cocoon for 60 s. The pH of the resulting pupa/cocoon slurry was measured using a pH electrode meter (INLAB ULTRA-MICRO, SevenGo PRO pH SG8 pH-meter [Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, Ohio]). This gave us an indication of how much poison the ants had applied to each type of pupa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We used a LMER with Tukey post-hoc comparisons to compare the pH measurements of the pupae. Pupa treatment (pathogen-exposed or control), type (cocooned or unpacked) and their interaction were included as main effects. Petri dish was included as a random intercept effect as pairs of pupae from the same dish are non-independent. As we used a portion of this dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, we corrected the overall model p value for multiple testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chemical bioassay</title><p>We determined whether ants detect infected pupae through potential changes in the pupae’s cuticular chemical profile. We established internal infections in pupae by exposing them to the pathogen and leaving them for 3 days in isolation. In pilot studies, approx. 50% of these pupae were then unpacked within 4 hr of being introduced to ants. After 3 days, pupae were washed for 2.5 min in 300 µl of either pentane solvent to reduce the abundance of all CHCs present on the pupae (<italic>n</italic> = 28), or in autoclaved water as a handling control (<italic>n</italic> = 28). After washing, pupae were allowed to air dry on sterile filter paper. Additionally, non-washed pupae were used as a positive control (<italic>n</italic> = 30). Pupae were placed individually with a pair of ants in petri dishes and observed for unpacking for 4 hr. We used GC–MS (see below for methodology) to confirm that washing was effective at removing cuticular compounds, by comparing the total amount of chemicals present on pupae washed in pentane to non- and water-washed pupae (<italic>n</italic> = 8 per treatment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The number of pupae unpacked between the different treatments was analysed using a logistic regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As several researchers helped to wash the pupae, we included a random intercept for each person to control for any potential handling effects. Additionally, the experiment was run in two blocks on separate days, so we included a random intercept for each block to generalise beyond any potential differences between runs. The total peak area from the GC–MS analysis was compared between treatments using a KW test with post-hoc comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Chemical analysis of pupal hydrocarbon patterns</title><p>To confirm that infected pupae had chemical profiles that are different from pathogen-exposed cocooned and control pupae, we exposed pupae to the pathogen or a sham control. Pupae were then isolated for 3 days to establish infections in the pathogen-exposed treatment (as above). Following isolation, pupae were individually placed with ants and observed for unpacking for 4 hr. Unpacked pupae were immediately frozen at – 80°C with the removed cocoons (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and we also froze cocooned pathogen-exposed pupa that had not yet been unpacked (<italic>n</italic> = 10). Furthermore, we froze a pair of control pupae, of which one was cocooned (<italic>n</italic> = 12), whilst the other was first experimentally unpacked (to test if the cocoon affects cuticular compound extraction; <italic>n</italic> = 12). Cuticular chemicals were extracted from individual pupae and their cocoons in glass vials (1.8 ml [Supelco, Germany]) containing 100 µl n-pentane solvent for 5 min under gentle agitation. The vials were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 1 min to spin down any fungal conidiospores that might be remaining, and 80 µl of the supernatant was transferred to fresh vials with 200 µl glass inserts and sealed with Teflon faced silicon septa (both Supelco). The pentane solvent contained four internal standards relevant for our range of hydrocarbons (C<sub>27</sub> – C<sub>37</sub>); n-Tetracosane, n-Triacontane, n-Dotriacontane and n-Hexatriacontane (Sigma Aldrich) at 0.5 µg/ml concentration, all fully deuterated to enable spectral traceability and separation of internal standards from ant-derived substances. We ran extracts from the different groups in a randomised manner, intermingled with blank runs containing only pentane, and negative controls containing the pentane plus internal standards (to exclude contaminants emerging for example from column bleeding), on the day of extraction, using GC–MS (GC7890 coupled to MS5975C [Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California]).</p><p>A liner with one restriction ring filled with borosilicate wool (Joint Analytical Systems, Germany) was installed in the programmed temperature vaporisation (PTV) injection port of the GC, which was pre-cooled to −20°C and set to solvent vent mode. 50 µl of the sample extractions were injected automatically into the PTV port at 40 µl/s using an autosampler (CTC Analytics, PAL COMBI-xt, , CHRONOS 4.2 software [Axel Semrau, Germany]) equipped with a 100 µl syringe (Hamilton [Sigma-Aldrich]). Immediately after injection, the PTV port was ramped to 300°C at 450 °C/min, and the sample transferred to the column (DB-5ms; 30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) at a flow of 1 ml/min. The oven temperature program was held at 35°C for 4.5 min, then ramped to 325°C at 20°C/min, and held at this temperature for 11 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 3 ml/min. For all samples, the MS transfer line was set to 325°C, and the MS operated in electron ionisation mode (70 eV; ion source 230°C; quadrupole 150°C, mass scan range 35–600 amu, with a detection threshold of 150). Data acquisition was carried out using MassHunter Workstation, Data Acquisition software B.07.01 (Agilent Technologies).</p><p>Analytes were detected by applying deconvolution algorithms to the total ion chromatograms of the samples (MassHunter Workstation, Qualitative Analysis B.07.00 [Agilent Technologies). Compound identification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) was performed via manual interpretation using retention indices and spectral information, and the comparison of mass spectra to the Wiley 9<sup>th</sup> edition/NIST 11 combined mass spectral database (National Institute of Standards and Technologies). As the molecular ion was not detectable for all analytes based on electronic ionisation, we in addition performed chemical ionisation on pools of 20 pupae in 100 µl n-pentane solvent with 0.5 µg/ml internal standards. The higher extract concentration was needed to counteract the loss in ionisation efficiency in chemical ionisation mode. A specialised chemical ionisation source with methane as the reagent gas was used with the MS, while the chromatographic method was the same as in electronic ionisation mode. Use of external standards (C<sub>7</sub>-C<sub>40</sub> saturated alkane mixture [Sigma Aldrich]) enabled traceability of all peaks, and thus comparison to runs of single pupae extracts made in electronic ionisation mode. Modified Kovats retention indices for the peaks in question were calculated based on those standards. To further aid identification, we separated the substances based on polarity using solid phase extraction fractionation. For this purpose, pools of 20 pupae were extracted in 500 µl n-pentane containing 0.2 µg/ml internal standard, and separated on unmodified silica cartridges (Chromabond SiOH, 1 ml, 100 mg) based on polarity. Prior to use, the cartridges were conditioned with 1 ml dichloromethane followed by 1 ml n-pentane. The entire extraction volume was loaded onto the silica and the eluent (fraction 1, highly apolar phase) collected. A wash with 1 ml pure n-pentane was added to fraction 1. Fraction 2 contained all substances washed off the silica with 1 ml 25% dichloromethane in n-pentane, and finally a pure wash with 1 ml dichloromethane eluted all remaining substances (fraction 3). The polarity thus increased from fraction 1 through 3, but no polar substances were found. All fractions were dried under a gentle nitrogen stream and re-suspended in 70 µl n-pentane followed by vigorous vortexing for 45 s. GC–MS analysis of all fractions was performed in electronic ionisation mode under the same chromatographic conditions as before.</p><p>To quantify the relative abundances of all compounds found on each pupa, analyte-characteristic quantifier and qualifier ions were used to establish a method enabling automatised quantification of their integrated peak area relative to the peak area of the closest internal standard. For each analyte, the relative peak area was normalised, that is divided by the total sum of all relative peak areas of one pupa, to standardise all pupa samples. Only analytes, which normalised peak area contributed more than 0.05% of the total peak area, were included in the statistical analysis. We compared the chemical profiles of the pupae using a perMANOVA analysis of the Mahalanobis dissimilarities between pupae, with post hoc perMANOVA comparisons. Since there was no difference between cocooned and unpacked control pupae we combined them into a single control group for the final analysis (perMANOVA: <italic>F</italic> = 1.09, df = 23, p=0.1). We also performed a discriminant analysis of principle components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) to characterise the differences between the pupal treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">De Moraes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jombart et al., 2010</xref>).

Random forest identified nine compounds that were important in classifying the treatment group, of which eight were significant when analysed using separate KW tests (results for significant compounds in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

One hundred and fifty microliters of the conidiospore and blastospore suspensions and 155 µg of hyphae (n = 3 for each fungal stage) were transferred into 1.5 ml glass vials (La-Pha-Pack, Germany). All samples were centrifuged (2 min, 3000 g) and dried under a nitrogen stream for 2 hr. Once samples were dry, 200 µl n-pentane containing internal standards (as above) was added to the samples, which were vortexed for 2 min. Samples were centrifuged (5 min, 5000 g) and the supernatants transferred into 200 µl glass vials with inserts, and closed with aluminium crimper caps that had a silicone septum (both La-Pha-Pack). Fifty microliters of the samples were injected into a pre-cooled PTV inlet at – 20°C and GC–MS analysis carried out following the above protocol.</p><p>We determined if there was any overlap between the chemical profiles of pupae and the fungus by comparing the results of the fungal GC–MS analysis to the results of the pupal GC–MS. To that end, all fungal chromatograms were automatically de-convoluted and the mass-spectra of the compound peaks compared to a mass-spectral database, composed of the substances found on the pupae (Agilent Technologies MassHunter Qualitative Analysis, B.07.00, 2014). Twenty-seven compounds scored above 70 points, with 82.21 being the highest score. To determine if these peaks were identical to the peaks of the pupal samples, we calculated their Kovats retention time indices (RI) and compared them to that of the pupal substances. This analysis revealed that none of the fungal compound RIs were overlapping with the pupal compounds, hence confirming that the identified pupal substances are not of fungal origin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immune stimulation of pupae using β-glucans</title><p>We injected β−1,3-glucans to test whether the changes in the chemical profile of infected pupae may be caused by an immune stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Vilcinskas and Wedde, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Unestam and Söderhäll, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gunnarsson, 1988</xref>).

We cleaned the capillaries between injections using 96% ethanol.

In both the Jena population and <italic>L. niger</italic>, no control-treated pupae were destructively disinfected (proportion ± 95% CIs: Jena = 0 ± 0–0.14; <italic>L. niger</italic> = 0 ± 0–0.16), whilst &gt;60% of the pathogen-exposed pupae were destructively disinfected (proportion ± 95% CIs: Jena = 0.61 ± 0.41–0.78; <italic>L. niger</italic> = 0.95 ± 0.76–0.99).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank L Lovicar for producing SEMs, B Leyrer and E Flechl for help with the chemical analysis and RNA extraction, respectively, B Milutinović and M Bračić for assistance with the chemical bioassay, and the <italic>Social Immunity</italic> group at IST Austria for ant collection and comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript.

The authors report on serially linked behavioural acts that involve the removal of fungally infected pupae from its cocoon, followed by the perforation of the pupa's cuticle and finally the administration of poison secretions with antimicrobial properties. These coupled tasks ultimately reduce the risk of disease transmission/infection within a colony. The authors did a nice job in systematically addressing and tackling many of the aspects involved in this novel behaviour. Their methods, sample sizes and data analyses provide convincing evidence that this behaviour is inducible and adaptive. My major concern lays on the experimental design of the CHC. It appears the authors did not run chemical signature analyses on the triton+conidia suspension only? If this is the case, then they cannot ascertain that the changes in CHC profile of infected pupae represents &quot;sickness cues&quot; given off by the pupae. The possibility exists that those changes are of fungal (and not ant) origin. Given this and several other minor concerns, I cannot recommend this work for publication in its present form.

A pleasure reading such thorough research.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Overview</p><p>Social insects have served for the past two decades as models to understand the evolution of immunocompetence (in the broad sense) in animal societies. Many social insect species face significant immune challenges due to their densely populated and large colonies in which disease transmission can be facilitated. Hymenopteran species may be genetically compromised due to haplodiploidy, and polyandrous mating may enhance worker disease resistance. Social immunity involves colony-level prophylactic response (sanitation) and/or the upregulation of immune factors related to vaccination-like effects resulting from social interactions, collectively reducing infection risk.</p><p>Current submission</p><p>In the present study, Lasius neglectus ants are described as using &quot;destructive disinfection&quot; to limit disease transmission of a fungal pathogen by removing pupae within which the pathogen is undergoing non-contagious incubation. Workers appear to be able to detect chemical cues emitted by pupae, recognizing disease risk and treating such pupae with antimicrobial secretions from the poison gland.</p><p>Evaluation</p><p>Colonies of social insects are known to identify, and sanitize, by allogrooming and/or antimicrobial secretion distribution, and/or remove infected larvae or workers, elevating colony temperature and generating &quot;fever&quot; and/or signalling the presence of pathogens following their detection. The authors' work extends our understanding of how individuals may serve immune-cell like functions to achieve colony-level resistance to disease. The finding that &quot;the same principles of disease defence apply at different levels of biological organization&quot; does not in and of itself appear to be unusual and/or highly novel and unexpected; it is a well-used superorganism analogy. As the authors note, previous studies have shown that workers (of several social insect species) remove infected brood. I do not see the response now reported to be substantially different in terms of how it advances our understanding of infection control in animal societies, although the authors coin a new term for their phenomenon. Overall, the &quot;multicomponent behaviour' appears to be to remove infected individuals and sanitize them, killing them in the process (intentionally or unintentionally). This category of response to infection has been previously been shown in other social insects, for example, in the general context of undertaking behaviour. A more novel and significant result would be if workers did not destructively disinfect, but rather identified pre-contagious pupae and &quot;medically&quot; treated them with poison gland secretion, improving their survival.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Destructive disinfection of infected brood prevents systemic disease spread in ant colonies&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favourably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Reviewing editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have no further comments on the experimental side, but reviewer #2 (and after the discussion of these comments reviewer #1 agreed to them as well) suggests putting the results into a broader context. Please look through your text (i.e. Introduction/Discussion) and include these perspectives where it seems appropriate.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have addressed all my concerns and I believe that adding those extra experiments on the CHC has made this a robust and complete contribution to the field of social insect eco-immunology. I recommend this work for publication in its current form.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In their revised manuscript, the authors have effectively responded to reviewer comments by adding new data and refining the narrative. The new studies add details absent in the initial submission that demonstrate chemicals used to disinfect brood are not of fungal origin, and workers thus detect cues associated with disease symptoms. Independent of the potential impact of the study in the broader analysis of social immunocompetence, the work is rigorous, advances our understanding of mechanisms underpinning social responses to infection control, and is to be applauded. However, the question remains as to whether adding details of the mechanisms regulating the disinfection process in ants is broadly significant or serves a more specialized audience. Here it can also be noted that the first sentence of the revised Abstract focuses the study in social insect biology, rather than the broader ecological immunology of animal social systems, and &quot;completing the (superorganism) analogy&quot; similarly accentuates insect sociobiology. My sense is that most practitioners in the field would agree that &quot;the same principles of disease defence apply at different levels of biological organization&quot; is already understood, at the level of analogy. The authors draw parallels and note variation among honey bee and ant systems of disease control. The more general message for the analysis of social and ecological immunology should be clarified. For example, aside from the mechanistic details, do the present results offer deeper insights into the concept of herd immunity, applied across diverse taxa? If so, the authors should state so clearly, as it this would be more informative than &quot;completing the superorganism analogy.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32073.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main point that led to the reject decision is not so evident from the text of the reviews, but became clear in the discussion session.

We have addressed this point using separate approaches that have produced complimentary results.</p><p>Firstly, we used GC–MS to analyse the chemical profiles of all of the separate life stages of the fungus: the conidiospores, blastospores and mycelia. By comparing the chemical profiles of the fungus to those of the pupae, we find that there are no peaks of fungal origin in the pupae profiles. Hence, this analysis provides strong evidence that the changes in the CHC profile of infected, unpacked pupae are indeed of pupal origin.</p><p>Secondly, we injected pupae with a fungal immune elicitor, β-1,3-glucans, which act as a major pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) for the invertebrate immune system. β-1,3-glucans are highly conserved components of fungal cell walls, including <italic>Metarhizium</italic>, known to trigger the major antimicrobial immune defences of invertebrates. Hence, they can be used to elicit an immune reaction in the absence of an actual pathogen. Using qPCR, we found that β-glucan injected pupae had increased expression of immune genes; namely, an IMD pathway regulator gene and a β-glucan binding protein gene that specifically recognises fungal cell wall components. Injection of fungal PAMPs also altered the chemical profile of the pupae, resulting in an increase in two out of the four CHCs that were also in higher abundance on <italic>Metarhizium</italic>-infected, unpacked pupae. Interestingly, these are also the same type of CHCs that are increased on sick honeybees, again suggesting that they may act as conserved “sickness cues” within the social Hymenoptera.</p><p>We have added the fungal chemical analysis to the manuscript:</p><p>1) Description of the fungal life stages in the Introduction: “Penetration is followed by a short, non-infectious incubation period of a few days, during which single cell fungal blastospores produce toxins that suppress the host’s immune system and eventually cause host death. The fungus then enters a second, non-infectious mycelial stage that grows saprophytically throughout the corpse. Once all available nutrients have been consumed by the mycelia, the fungus grows out of the corpse and releases millions of new infectious conidiospores in a process called sporulation, about 1-3 days after host death [Hughes, Eilenberg and Boomsma, 2002]”.</p><p>2) The methodology for the cultivation of the different fungal life stages: “In addition to fungal conidiospores, we also cultured blastospores and mycelia to obtain the chemical profiles (see below) of all stages of the fungi’s lifecycle [Deacon, 2006]. […] We incubated the flask (5 days, 180 rpm, 27°C) and vacuum-filtered (40µm mesh; Millipore Steriflip) the resulting fungal mass to remove the liquid broth. We then washed the mycelial mass three times in autoclaved distilled water”.</p><p>3) The chemical analysis and comparison to pupae: “Comparison of fungal and pupal chemical profiles. One millilitre aliquots of conidiospore (10<sup>9</sup>/ml in 0.05% TX) and blastospore (4x10<sup>6</sup>/ml in PBS) suspensions and approx. 500 mg of mycelia (in 500 µl of autoclaved distilled water) were washed three times by briefly vortexing and centrifuging the samples (5 min, 5500 g), discarding the supernatants, and replacing with 1 ml of autoclaved distilled water for the first two washes, and 500 µl for the last wash. […] This analysis revealed that none of the fungal compound RIs were overlapping with the pupal compounds, hence confirming that the identified pupal substances are not of fungal origin”.</p><p>4) And added in new results: “There were no novel compounds present on unpacked or cocooned pathogen-exposed pupae that were not also present on control pupae (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that these differences were not caused by odours emitted directly by the fungus, but were of pupal origin. By analysing the chemical profiles of each of the pathogen’s separate developmental stages (infectious condiospores, post-infection blastospores, and saprophytic mycelium) and performing a direct comparison of the fungal compounds to the pupal chemical profiles, we confirmed that there were no fungus-derived peaks in the pupal profiles (see Materials and methods for more information)”.</p><p>We have added the experimental injection of the fungal cell wall stimulus and its effect on the pupal chemical profile and immune gene expression:</p><p>1) The results of this experiment: “To investigate the possibility that CHC changes on unpacked pupae are the result of an immune response developed by the host, we injected pupae with β-1,3-glucans – polysaccharides that are an integral component of fungal cell walls, including Metarhizium. […]These data reveal that some of the changes in pupal chemical profile can be directly linked to a host reaction to an immune elicitor, similar to findings in honeybees [Richard, Holt and Grozinger, 2012; Richard, Aubert and Grozinger, 2008], mice [Arakawa, Cruz and Deak, 2011] and humans [Shirasu and Touhara, 2011]”.</p><p>2) The methodology for this experiment: “Immune stimulation of pupae using β-glucans. We injected β-1,3-glucans to test whether the changes in the chemical profile of infected pupae may be caused by an immune stimulation [Vilcinskas and Wedde, 1997; Unestam and Söderhäll, 1977; Gunnarsson, 1988]. […] This test also found a strong, significant difference between the two time points (Mann-Whitney U test, U = 157, p = 0.007); hence we report the result of the LMER”.</p><p>3) Two new supporting figures and legends: “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript in which the authors studied a previously unreported behaviour of &quot;destructive disinfection&quot; of ant pupae by Lasius workers.

A more novel and significant result would be if workers did not destructively disinfect, but rather identified pre-contagious pupae and &quot;medically&quot; treated them with poison gland secretion, improving their survival.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the concept of the supercolony analogy of social immunity has been established in a previous review (Cremer and Sixt, 2009). Yet we feel that the current work provides an experimental proof of concept that substantially extends the previously reported removal of infected brood (“hygienic behaviour”), as it includes a novel destruction phase, which is required to kill the pathogen. Hence, only this last step completes the analogy and also reveals very similar mechanisms to the find me/eat me signal emitted by infected cells, and the cell membrane piercing by perforins from the immune cells, followed by the injection of cytotoxins. As discussed, conventional hygienic behaviour, i.e. only the removal of infected brood in the absence of destructive disinfection, seems sufficient in honeybees, as they drop the infected brood to the ground, where they will not be re-encountered and hence the risk of re-infection is minimal. Ants, on the contrary, will re-encounter the dead they remove in the ‘two-dimensional’ territory surrounding their nest, hence potentially applying a stronger selection pressure for them to evolve effective mechanisms to prevent pathogen replication and re-infection of the colony. However, existing studies (Ugelvig et al. 2010, Tragust et al. 2013) failed to observe ant handling of the infected brood after its removal. In both honeybees and ants, these behaviours occur before host death, and are performed in addition to regular undertaking behaviours, such as removing and sometimes burrowing the dead (though, to our knowledge, disinfection has never been reported as a component of undertaking behaviour so far; see Sun and Zhou, 2013 for a recent review). As detailed in the third paragraph of the Introduction, we previously described that ants use their poison as a sanitary treatment, which acts as a first line of defence to prevent contaminated pupae from contracting infections (Tragust et al. 2013). Here, we describe a second, distinct line of defence, which requires the use of poison in a more complex, combination of behaviours, when this first line of defence fails. We therefore feel that our work is a significant advancement for the field, given that few animals are known to actively prevent successful infections from developing and transmitting to new hosts; generally infected individuals are simply avoided.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have no further comments on the experimental side, but reviewer #2 (and after the discussion of these comments reviewer #1 agreed to them as well) suggests putting the results into a broader context.

We have now added text to the Introduction and Discussion to make it broader and to place it into the established conceptual framework of ecological immunology. We have also amended our discussion to make the relations between our findings and those in other social systems more explicit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have addressed all my concerns and I believe that adding those extra experiments on the CHC has made this a robust and complete contribution to the field of social insect eco-immunology. I recommend this work for publication in its current form.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer very much for their positive appraisal of our work and additional findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In their revised manuscript, the authors have effectively responded to reviewer comments by adding new data and refining the narrative. The new studies add details absent in the initial submission that demonstrate chemicals used to disinfect brood are not of fungal origin, and workers thus detect cues associated with disease symptoms. Independent of the potential impact of the study in the broader analysis of social immunocompetence, the work is rigorous, advances our understanding of mechanisms underpinning social responses to infection control, and is to be applauded. However, the question remains as to whether adding details of the mechanisms regulating the disinfection process in ants is broadly significant or serves a more specialized audience. Here it can also be noted that the first sentence of the revised Abstract focuses the study in social insect biology, rather than the broader ecological immunology of animal social systems, and &quot;completing the (superorganism) analogy&quot; similarly accentuates insect sociobiology. My sense is that most practitioners in the field would agree that &quot;the same principles of disease defence apply at different levels of biological organization&quot; is already understood, at the level of analogy. The authors draw parallels and note variation among honey bee and ant systems of disease control. The more general message for the analysis of social and ecological immunology should be clarified. For example, aside from the mechanistic details, do the present results offer deeper insights into the concept of herd immunity, applied across diverse taxa? If so, the authors should state so clearly, as it this would be more informative than &quot;completing the superorganism analogy.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for directing us to the importance of the broader ecological immunology framework, and agree that the previous version was indeed too focused on social insects, likely hiding the relevance of our findings for the wider field as a whole. In the new Abstract, Introduction and Discussion, we compare and contrast our findings in ants to other group-living animals, but make explicit why some social insects are different from other social groups, given that they have made the transition to superorganismality. We consider this an important addition, as it highlights that (i) defences such as destructive disinfection are likely to only evolve in superorganisms, due to workers typically gaining all their fitness indirectly, and (ii) that this should promote the evolution of explicit sickness signalling by infected group members, as we find in our study. In this new version we hence discuss our work much more conceptually, which we hope proves interesting for both specialists and non-specialists alike.</p></body></sub-article></article>
