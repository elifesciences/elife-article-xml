by a high mutational variance, that is the propensity to change under spontaneous mutation. The causes for a high mutational variance are still elusive. In some cases, fast evolution depends on the high mutation rate of one or few loci with short tandem repeats. Here, we report on the fastest evolving cell fate among vulva precursor cells in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes, that of P3.p. We identify and validate causal mutations underlying P3.p's high mutational variance. We find that these positions do not present any characteristics of a high mutation rate, are scattered across the genome and the corresponding genes belong to distinct biological pathways. Our data indicate that a broad mutational target size is the cause of the high mutational variance and of the corresponding fast phenotypic evolutionary rate.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Heritable characteristics or traits of a group of organisms, for example the large brain size of primates or the hooves of a horse, are determined by genes, the environment, and by the interactions between them.

The results showed that five mutations in five different genes – all responsible for different processes in the cells – were behind the supercharged evolution of this particular cell.

When they in addition appear to evolve directionally, this is called an evolutionary trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gould, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McShea, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McShea, 2000</xref>). Classical examples are the reduction in digit number of horses, the increase in brain size in hominids or the change in fractal complexity of suture lines in the fossil record of ammonites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McNamara, 2006</xref>). A possible explanation for fast evolutionary change of a trait is the sustained action of natural selection on the trait, acting in either a directional or a diversifying manner. A second explanation arises from the fact that the available phenotypic variation onto which natural selection acts is not uniform along all axes of phenotypic space (developmental constraints or the ‘arrival of the fittest’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gould, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheverud, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberch and Gale, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maynard Smith et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arthur, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dichtel-Danjoy and Félix, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denver et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rifkin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Landry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stoltzfus and Yampolsky, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wagner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hether and Hohenlohe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McGuigan and Aw, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hine et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, upon random mutation, some axes of phenotype space are more readily explored than others. In other terms, the mutational variance may not be equal along different axes of phenotype space and this may sufficiently affect the rate of evolution at the phenotypic level. Natural selection may act in an orthogonal manner to the mutational variance in phenotype space (that is, may select on a trait with low mutational variance); and along the axis of high mutational variance, it may act in the same direction or in the opposite direction. Phenotypic evolution then results from the combination of the mutational variance and natural selection.</p><p>The present study addresses the causes of high mutational variance along some directions of phenotypic space. Two non-mutually exclusive explanations may underlie such phenomenon, the first at the molecular level, the second at the level of genotype-phenotype mapping: (1) some DNA sequences, such as short tandem repeats, are more prone to spontaneous mutation; (2) a higher mutational variance could be due to a higher mutational target size affecting this phenotype. These two factors may act jointly.</p><p>In the first case, mutational hotspots affecting the phenotype disproportionately increase mutational variance for this trait. Specifically, short repeat regions in a gene may favour DNA replication slippage and recombination, leading to gain or loss of repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heale and Petes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gemayel et al., 2010</xref>), or result in fragile DNA conformation susceptible to double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). Such highly mutable repeats may lie in a coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Verstrepen et al., 2005</xref>) or within regulatory sequences of a gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vinces et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). Their variation has been shown to affect various phenotypes in different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Levdansky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Undurraga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gemayel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dai and Holland, 2019</xref>) and in humans to lead to diseases such as Huntington and fragile X syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Budworth and McMurray, 2013</xref>). Consequently, the high mutability of some DNA regions may accelerate the evolution of specific traits. Examples are the fast-evolving dog head shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fondon and Garner, 2004</xref>) or the recurrent pelvic fin reduction in sticklebacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xie et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the second case, the higher mutational variance of a phenotype may be due to a larger mutational target size rather than a high mutation rate at a given locus: the mutational variance increases with the number of genes (and size of gene regions) whose mutation alters the phenotype. This may be the case for a phenotype that is sensitive to small quantitative alterations, for example in biochemical pathways. The construction of such a trait may indeed be affected by mutations at many loci, many of which may only affect the trait at low penetrance. In another case, bacterial tolerance to antibiotics, mutations to tolerance are frequent because mutations affecting bacterial growth or lag time result in tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Girgis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Girgis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fridman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Khare and Tavazoie, 2020</xref>). Some traits are indeed known to be highly polygenic in natural populations. Some authors even proposed an ‘omnigenic’ model, where phenotypic variation may result from variation at many genes outside the core pathways known to regulate the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). This model fits quantitative genetic data of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). However, the number of loci segregating in natural populations also depends on factors such as population structure and selection. To address the origin of a high mutational variance, a more direct approach is needed and more data need to be collected to evaluate how much and in which context each of the above scenarios - highly mutable loci versus a broad mutational target - contributes to a fast rate of phenotypic evolution.</p><p>We use the nematode vulva to explore this question. This developmental system relies on six precursor cells, with several useful features: (1) the developmental fate of the six homologous cells can be followed in a wide range of species; (2) the mutational variance of the different precursor cells can be compared on the same scale; (3) much knowledge has been accumulated on the specification of vulval precursor cell (VPC) fates through laser cell ablation studies and developmental genetics. The six vulva precursors are born aligned along the ventral epidermis of the young larvae and are numbered P3.p to P8.p from anterior to posterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The six cells initially share an identical fate of ventral epidermal blast cells. Under the influence of several signalling pathways, each precursor cell differentiates with a specific terminal fate, creating reproducible patterns of cell fates shared by taxonomic groups of varying size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As showed earlier, the developmental fate of one of these six cells, P3.p, by far evolves faster than that of the other Pn.p cells, both within and among species in the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delattre and Félix, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kiontke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braendle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pénigault and Félix, 2011a</xref>). While P5.p, P6.p and P7.p divide several times to form the vulva under the influence of EGF and Notch signaling, P4.p and P8.p most often divide once and their daughters fuse with the large epidermal syncytium hyp7 at the end of the third larval stage (L3). Their fate does not evolve in most of the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus. In contrast, P3.p may either fuse to the hyp7 syncytium already at the end of the L2 stage (with no further cell division possible) or divide once in the L3 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sternberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Félix, 2012</xref>). For simplicity, we will refer to this trait as a binary choice between absence or presence of division, which we quantify as a frequency of division in an isogenic population. Isogenicity of the population is obtained easily in the two nematode species we use here, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae,</italic> because they reproduce through selfing (with the possibility of controlled outcrossing with males for genetic analysis).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Specific evolutionary features of P3.p among vulva precursor cells and the question of the origin of its high mutational variance.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic description of development of the six vulva precusor cells (VPCs).

The mutational variance is here estimated by computing the per-generation change in mean frequencies of variant vulva patterns among MA lines, ΔV.

MA experiments are ideal to test whether some traits vary more than others upon spontaneous mutation and to address the origin of variation in mutational variance. Since the effect of selection is reduced to a minimal fertility requirement at each random generational bottleneck, the mutational variance as measured in MA experiments can be compared to evolution with natural selection in the wild (the intraspecific standing genetic variance and the interspecific divergence) to infer the role of natural selection. In this manner, we previously showed that P3.p division frequency likely evolved driven by its high mutational variance and under minimal selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braendle et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, when either <italic>C. elegans</italic> or <italic>C. briggsae</italic> wild isolates are subjected to spontaneous mutation accumulation, P3.p cell fate had the highest phenotypic variance compared with the other five cells. P4.p showed the second highest mutational variance and standing genetic variance, yet an order of magnitude lower than P3.p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braendle et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, in this system as for wing shape in drosophilids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Houle and Fierst, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Houle et al., 2017</xref>) or mitotic spindle traits in <italic>Caenorhabditids</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farhadifar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farhadifar et al., 2016</xref>), the mutational variance matches the evolutionary pattern, with the added advantage here of comparing homologous cells.</p><p>Here, we use MA lines to test whether P3.p fate evolvability is caused by a high mutation rate at few loci or by a broad mutational target affecting P3.p fate. To this end, we selected five MA lines showing P3.p fate divergence with the ancestral line. We combine whole-genome sequencing, genetic linkage analysis of the phenotype in recombinant lines and candidate testing through mutant and CRISPR genome editing to identify causal mutations and the corresponding loci. In each line, we found a single causal mutation. The five causal mutations are in five different genomic regions, are not associated to highly mutable sequences and are different in nature (two SNPs, one small deletion and two large deletions). Functionally, only one of them affected an expected gene involved in the Wnt pathway, a ‘core’ signaling pathway known to regulate Pn.p fusion to the epidermis in the L2 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pénigault and Félix, 2011b</xref>). Two other loci encode general regulators of transcription and translation, while the two final loci lack functional annotation. We conclude that the fast evolutionary rate of change in P3.p cell fate may be explained by a broad mutational target for this trait.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Choice of mutation accumulation (MA) lines</title><p>Estimating accurate frequencies for a binary trait requires a high number of individuals.

Genomic DNA of the selected MA lines and their respective ancestor was sequenced at an average sequencing depth of 20x (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We used a combination of tools to cover a diversity of possible mutations (SNPs, short indels and structural variants). Prioritizing the first goal, we endeavoured to minimize false positive calls in two ways (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, we filtered out variants that were not unique to a MA line in a cohort derived from the same ancestor, so as to eliminate possible background variants that may have been missed in the ancestor. Such variants were particularly abundant in MA lines derived from the HK104 and PB306 ancestral backgrounds, which differ greatly from the reference genome of each species (AF16 for <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and N2 for <italic>C. elegans,</italic> respectively). Second, we excluded error-prone repeats from the short-variant analysis. These two filters excluded potential loci that could explain P3.p fate variation; in spite of this, the genetic linkage analysis should identify the chromosomal interval where the causal variant lies. A more sensitive variant analysis in this candidate interval would then be possible if the causal variant was not found in the first stringent analysis (which turned out not to be required).</p><p>With this strategy, we listed 595 de novo mutations in the six MA lines, spread along the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These mutations were mostly short (i.e shorter than the 100 bp read length) indels (341), SNPs (250), and four large deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We reliably used the SNPs from these calls directly as genetic markers: indeed, all but one over 60 SNP tested were validated by direct re-sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, see Materials and methods).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genetic mapping of the causal loci</title><p>Five of the six MA lines were further processed to genetically map the causal mutations affecting P3.p division frequency. The genetic mapping method relies on the same logic for all five MA lines (with some differences in the crossing schemes and selection strategies, see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">8</xref>) generating several backcrossed lines, phenotyping and sorting them as ‘ancestor-like’ or ‘MA-line-like’ according to their phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; blue and red bars and dots, respectively) then genotyping them for a set of relevant de novo mutations identified above. Backcrossed lines were selfed for several generations to render them mostly homozygous. In all cases, the phenotype segregated as a single locus. A candidate genetic interval was defined as the minimum interval that bears the MA line genotype in all phenotypically MA-line-like backcrossed lines and the ancestral genotype in all phenotypically ancestor-like backcrossed lines. Serial backcrosses (once to four times) allowed to reduce the genetic interval, which still ranged from 4 to 15 Mbp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Importantly, we identified intervals on four different chromosomes (I, III, IV and X) and two distinct regions on chromosome III.

The MMP dataset provides enough power, but is derived from lines after chemical and/or ultraviolet mutagenesis aiming at producing deletions (2007 strains with about 400 mutations each, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>). None of the five nucleotide positions (breakpoints for deletions) were mutated in this dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). One deletion was found in <italic>gcn-1</italic> but breakpoints do not match the identified direct repeats. The caveat of using the MMP dataset is that the pattern of artificially induced mutations may differ from that of spontaneous mutation. Second, we explored the <italic>C. elegans</italic> natural diversity (almost 3 million genomic variations from 766 wild strains; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2017</xref>), and none of the positions (the breakpoints for deletions) were mutated either (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). The caveat of using this dataset is that selection has acted on the polymorphism pattern; note however that the <italic>gcn-1</italic> repeats lie in intronic regions where mutations may have less functional impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1j</xref>). We thus conclude that the five identified mutations are not in mutational hotspots.</p><p>We next wondered whether the underlying genes (rather than the precise positions) - the first level of sequence to phenotype mapping - could display higher mutation rates. The mutation rate of a gene depends on its length and the mutation rate of its sub-sequences. Among the five genes, <italic>gcn-1</italic> and to a lesser extent <italic>Y75B8A.8</italic> stand out as large genes (measured from 5'UTR to 3'UTR, including introns): they are the 10<sup>th</sup> and 841<sup>st</sup> longest genes among the 21,803 <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein-coding genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

The mutation in MA line 296 is a missense in the cystein-rich Frizzled domain that binds the Wnt ligand, changing a conserved asparagine into a histidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>cdk-8</italic> gene (cyclin-dependent kinase-8, mutated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> MA line 450) codes for a subunit of the Mediator complex.

Its specificity of action on transcription is controlled by distinct dissociable subunits, such as the CDK-8 module. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the CDK-8 module acts in a highly pleiotropic fashion yet a P3.p division frequency phenotype was not previously reported. In the ventral epidermis, the CDK-8 module was shown to act at many other steps, contributing in the L1 stage to the fusion to hyp7 of anterior and posterior Pn.p cells (such as P2.p and P9.p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yoda et al., 2005</xref>), to the block of division of all VPCs in the L2 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clayton et al., 2008</xref>) and to the level of induction of 2° and 1° VPC fates via cell-autonomous repression of EGF and Notch signalling in the L3 stage; these activities being mostly revealed in a sensitized genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moghal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grants et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Underwood et al., 2017</xref>).

The valine-to-alanine substitution in the protein kinase domain found in MA line 450 likely causes a strong reduction-of-function, since the phenotypes such as dumpy animals or P3.p division frequency were indistinguishable from those in animals bearing the null deletion allele <italic>cdk-8(tm1238)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grants et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). To test whether CDK-8 acts independently of the Wnt signalling pathway to modulate P3.p division frequency, we performed epistatic analysis by combining null mutants of <italic>cdk-8</italic> and <italic>bar-1</italic>. The double mutants showed an intermediate level of P3.p division frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref>), thus <italic>cdk-8</italic> was not epistatic to <italic>bar-1</italic> suggesting that CDK-8 functions independently of the Wnt signalling pathway. In sum, CDK-8 is part of a large complex that is a general regulator of transcription; its mutation, although not lethal, is likely to affect many processes that are sensitive to the level of transcription of one or several of the many downstream genes.</p><p>The <italic>gcn-1</italic> gene (homolog of yeast General Control Non-derepressible) is a large protein of 2651 amino-acids (aa) including several Armadillo repeats, conserved throughout eukaryotes. The GCN-1 protein is involved in translational control. GCN-1 promotes the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nukazuka et al., 2008</xref>), which is thought to globally repress translation while activating expression of a few specific genes in many eukaryotes. This pathway is known to be active under various environmental stresses and to regulate global metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rousakis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2f</xref>). Local repression of this pathway by semaphorin signalling is required for <italic>C. elegans</italic> male ray morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nukazuka et al., 2008</xref>).

Using the highly tractable development of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes at the cellular scale, their powerful genetics and the recent advances in genome editing, we could precisely characterize mutational events that drove the fast evolution of a trait in a controlled evolutionary experiment. Our random sampling of mutations driving the evolution in P3.p division frequency in MA lines hit five different genes with no signature of high mutation rates, which could be connected to at least three different functional modules: Wnt signalling, transcriptional control by the Mediator complex and translational control through GCN-1. A the level of the genes, one of them (<italic>gcn-1</italic>) is particularly long so it is likely to be the target of mutations, whereas three of them are quite short.</p><p>Using this quantitative genetics approach, we were able to find new regulators of P3.p developmental fate that are available for further developmental studies. This is a small sample of possible mutations and already demonstrates that the cellular process of P3.p division is sensitive to variation in a larger number of genes and pathways. We conclude that the higher mutational variance of P3.p cell division is not specifically due to the higher mutability of particular DNA sequences and cannot be predicted from the genome sequence. Instead, it is a consequence of a broad mutational target impacting this cell fate specification, thus to the developmental context controlling the decision of P3.p to either fuse with hyp7 in the L2 stage or to further divide in the L3 stage. This result on the role of genotype-phenotype mapping in the evolutionary rate has broad implications in evolutionary biology of any organism (unicellular, multicellular, viruses). In addition, mutational effects on the phenotype are of obvious consequences in genetic disease and in the phenotypic progression of cancerous tumors.</p><p>An obvious further question is whether the mutations found in MA lines are representative of those responsible for P3.p evolution in natural populations. At least three out of five identified mutations affected important fitness-related traits such as body morphology or fertility, as well as other vulva traits (albeit at much lower frequency than changes observed for P3.p, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). The fast evolutionary rate of change in P3.p cell fate could then be driven: (1) by the subset of mutations with little pleiotropy in the corresponding genetic background (different from that tested here) or with pleiotropic effects that can be soon compensated for, or (2) by pleiotropic mutations that can be selected positively for their effect in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duveau and Félix, 2012</xref>). Among ‘target’ genes, the most polymorphic in natural populations could be a reservoir of natural mutations affecting P3.p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We also note that we selected large-effect mutations on purpose to ease the genetic mapping. It is possible that small-effect mutations would appear less pleiotropic. In any case, the diversity of functional pathways identified in this study offers opportunities to generate such non-pleiotropic small-effect mutations. A prediction from our present work is that mapping genetic determinants of P3.p division frequency in natural isolates should identify many different small-effect loci, possibly involving more functional pathways. Such an experiment remains however practically difficult to carry out, given the binary nature of the trait that imposes to score the phenotype of numerous isogenic animals to estimate reliable frequencies, the current low-throughput phenotyping and the highly multigenic nature of the trait.</p><p>From a developmental perspective, the reason why P3.p cell fate has such a broad mutational target likely lies in the sensitivity of this cell fate decision to small quantitative alterations in many biochemical pathway activities or in this cell's position. Indeed, we previously showed that P3.p division frequency is sensitive to halving the dose of either of the two Wnt ligands that are secreted from the posterior end of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pénigault and Félix, 2011b</xref>). P3.p is located at the fading end of the posterior-to-anterior Wnt gradient and may therefore often receive a Wnt dose that is below the threshold required for its division, while P4.p and the most posterior cells are more robustly induced. In addition to core Wnt pathway genes, mutations acting on other biochemical pathways and in other cells (e.g. neurons; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Modzelewska et al., 2013</xref>) could affect P3.p fate if they resulted in small variations in Wnt gradient levels, cellular position within the gradient, or interpretation of the gradient. In addition, the sustained expression of the Hox gene <italic>lin-39</italic> is required to prevent Pn.p cell fusion in the L2 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eisenmann and Kim, 2000</xref>), independently of Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pénigault and Félix, 2011b</xref>). Hox gene regulation may be a further mutational target underlying the high mutational variance of P3.p fate. In summary, P3.p is located at a very sensitive position that results in its developmental fate being highly sensitive to stochastic, environmental and genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braendle and Félix, 2008</xref>). The broad mutational target that we find here is consistent with this developmental sensitivity.</p><p>Variability of cell fates among the six vulva precursors evolved significantly among rhabditids. In another genus of the same family, <italic>Oscheius</italic>, P3.p cell fate is not highly variable (it does not divide), whereas P4.p and P8.p cell fates vary extensively both within and among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delattre and Félix, 2001</xref>). It would be interesting to test whether these different evolutionary rates correspond to an evolution in the respective mutational variances explained by broader mutational targets. The assembly and annotation of the <italic>Oscheius tipulae</italic> genome makes now possible to identify functional pathways involved in development of this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besnard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vargas-Velazquez et al., 2019</xref>). This would offer a way to study how the evolution of developmental mechanisms correlates with the evolution of mutational variance and ultimately results in the evolution of evolutionary rates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>cdk-8</italic></td><td>WormBase</td><td>WBGene00000409</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>gcn-1</italic></td><td>WormBase</td><td>WBGene00021697</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>R09F10.3</italic></td><td>WormBase</td><td>WBGene00019987</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>Y75B8A.8</italic></td><td>WormBase</td><td>WBGene00013545</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>sfrp-1</italic></td><td>WormBase</td><td>WBGene00022242</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>C. briggsae</italic>)</td><td><italic>Cbr-sfrp-1</italic></td><td>WormBase</td><td>WBGene00027904</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>C. briggsae</italic>)</td><td>HK104</td><td>DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0406056102">10.1073/pnas.0406056102</ext-link></td><td>HK104<sup>CB</sup> <break/>WormBase ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wormbase.org/species/c_briggsae/strain/WBStrain00041077#03--10">WBStrain00041077</ext-link></td><td>Wild isolate.

All strains were cleaned by hypochlorite treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>) before initiating experiments. To synchronize nematodes, three to five L4-stage hermaphrodite larvae were transferred to a fresh culture plate at 20°C. When most of their offspring reached the L4 stage (typically after three days, and up to five days for slow-growing strains), vulval cell fates were scored on larvae in the early to mid L4 larval stages, when Pn.p descendants display arrangements typical of each fate. Nematodes were anaesthetized with 1 mM sodium azide and mounted onto an agar pad for Nomarski microscopy observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wood, 1988</xref>). A fusion of P3.p at the L2 stage leaves a single nucleus in the large ventral syncytium ('S' or 4° fate), indicating that P3.p cell exited the vulva differentiation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The absence of L2 fusion allows P3.p to undergo a round of cell division in the L3 stage, revealed by the presence of two nuclei in the syncytium ('SS' or 3° fate), because its daughter cells also fuse with the syncytium during L3 stage. More rarely, unfused P3.p cells can be partially or fully induced to other vulva fates (2° or 1° fates). The division frequency of P3.p for a line (a binary trait) was estimated on samples of at least 50 nematodes per biological replicate. The number of animals scored per line was a compromise with the number of lines assayed and the number of biological replicates on different days. We use biological replicates in the sense that the measure was performed on different generations of animals of the same line, assayed on different days. Since P3.p cell fate has been shown to be sensitive to environmental variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braendle and Félix, 2008</xref>), experiments were generally performed by batch including several strains and a common control, for example the ancestral line or the parental line in the case of backcrosses (see below).

Nematodes were collected, washed in M9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>) to remove <italic>E. coli</italic>, and centrifuged. A pellet of 200–400 µl of animals was resuspended in 400 µl Cell Lysis Solution (Qiagen Gentra Puregen Cell kit) with 5 µl proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and lysed overnight at 56°C under shaking in Cell Lysis Solution (Qiagen Gentra Puregen Cell kit) with proteinase K (20 mg/ml). Lysates were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C after adding 10 µl of RNAse A (20 mg/ml) and proteins were precipitated with 200 µl of Protein Precipitation Solution (Qiagen Gentra Puregen Cell kit). After centrifugation, DNA was precipitated from the supernatant with 600 µl of isopropanol, washed twice with ethanol 70%, dried for 1 hr and finally resuspended in 100 µl TE buffer. This procedure typically yielded concentrations of ~500 ng/µL (range: 200 ng to 1 µg per µl) of high-quality genomic DNA. Short insert libraries (mean insert size around 500 bp) were prepared by BGI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomics.cn/en/index">http://www.genomics.cn/en/index</ext-link>) and paired-end sequenced on Illumina Hiseq2000 with 100 bp reads to obtain 2.2 Gb (aiming at ~20 x mean coverage) of clean data per samples after manufacturer’s data filtering (removing adapter sequences, contamination and low-quality reads).

After routine quality checks with FastQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews, 2017</xref>), clean reads were mapped using bwa with 'mem' algorithm and '-aM' options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) to the relevant reference assembly corresponding to WormBase releases WS243 and WS238 for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org/">http://www.wormbase.org/</ext-link>). Resulting bam files were further processed with <italic>samtools</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2009</xref>) to remove unmapped reads or secondary alignments and to keep only mapped reads in a proper pair. The analysis was further performed using the GATK tool suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>) (v3.6 or later) with default parameters (unless otherwise stated), and by adapting the authors' recommendations of best practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Van der Auwera et al., 2013</xref>). Read mappings were pre-processed by tagging duplicate reads with Picard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard</ext-link>), by re-aligning reads around indels (GATK tool suite) and by one round of Base Quality Score Recalibration (GATK tool suite) with the HaplotypeCaller tool, resulting in analysis-ready bam files for each sequenced sample. To call short variants (SNPs and indels generally less than 100 bp), these bam files were separately pre-called for variants using the tool HaplotypeCaller in a gVCF mode (option '<italic>-ERC GVCF'). Finally, a joint genotyping (with GATK's tool GenotypeGVCFs) was performed using as inputs all the gVCF records of a cohort consisting of</italic> the ancestor strain and its derived MA lines. This yielded one unique vcf file per cohort containing the genotypes of all strains of that cohort at each site where at least one strain bears a variation (compared to the reference genome used). We then applied conservative criteria to specifically identify de novo mutations that appeared and fixed during the course of the 250 generations of mutation accumulation. Since all strains are expected to be nearly fully homozygous by constant inbreeding, all heterozygous positions were filtered out. We also removed positions not supported by a coverage superior or equal to 3. Most of the remaining variations are background variations present in the ancestor strain compared to the reference genome of each species, that of strain N2 for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and of strain AF16 for <italic>C. briggsae</italic>. Within a cohort, especially with many MA lines, the variations shared by all strains are very likely ancestral alleles inherited from the ancestor. This high similarity of variation within a cohort was used to increase the specificity of the calls for the PB306 and HK104-derived cohorts (the N2-derived cohort had few background mutations). In both cohorts, background variations were used to train a Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR). In practice, shared variant sites within a cohort were split into background SNPs and indels to perform parallel recalibrations (tool VariantRecalibrator in mode SNP and INDEL, respectively). These training sets of variants were considered to be representative of true sites and were then used to train the model with a prior likelihood of Q12 (93.69%), corresponding to options 'training = true, truth = true, prior = 12.0'. In the case of HK104, we added another training dataset, consisting of validated SNP markers previously used to genotype recombinant progeny between the HK104 and the reference strain AF16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koboldt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ross et al., 2011</xref>) and the 13 new polymorphisms (SNPs or small indels) that were directly validated by pyrosequencing (see below). This additional set is small (948 variants, see the list in vcf format in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>) but has a high degree of confidence: we fixed the prior likelihood to Q15 (96.84%) (other parameters of VariantRecalibrator: training = true, truth = true, prior = 12.0). Then, each type of variant was recalibrated (tool ApplyRecalibration) so that 99% of the training dataset should be contained in this quality tranche (option '--ts_filter_level 99.0'). Finally, for each MA line, sites containing an allele passing the VQSR threshold but different from the ancestral line were selected and classified based on the number of other MA lines within the cohort that shared the same genotype. Since spontaneous mutations are rare events and each MA line is an independent replicate of the mutation accumulation experiment, only the variants unique to one MA line were considered as trustful candidates for de novo mutations. Identical mutations found in several MA lines of the same cohort could be either false positive (i.e a background variation present in the ancestor strain that was missed) or a potential mutational hotspot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Denver et al., 2012</xref>). However, the small size of our cohort does not allow to answer this point. For MA line 516, we simply selected all variants that differed from the re-sequenced N2 ancestor without performing VQSR.</p><p>Since repetitive sequences are prone to sequencing or mapping errors, we used versions of reference genomes with masked repetitions, as identified by RepeatMasker software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.repeatmasker.org/">http://www.repeatmasker.org/</ext-link>) run with default parameters (masked versions are directly available on WormBase, masking 21.9% and 14.6% of bases in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> genomes, respectively). However, we observed variations specifically called when using such genome versions, suggesting masking artefacts. To eliminate these, the entire variant discovery pipeline was also applied on the non-masked version of the reference genome and only variations called in both analyses were kept.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Structural variant discovery</title><p>The above procedure only retrieves SNPs and short indels (the longest indel of our final list is 87 bp long, absolute mean indel size is about 18 bp). To detect larger structural variations (SV) like long indels (&gt;100 bp), copy number variations (CNV), repeats (inverted or tandem) or translocations, we used a second approach based on two different complementary callers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2015</xref>): the read-pair algorithm Breakdancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2009</xref>) and the split-read algorithm Pindel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ye et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here again, the whole procedure was optimized to achieve high specificity and reduce false-positive calls. A non-masked version of the genome was used with both programs to generate bam files. In the BreakDancer pipeline, bam files were also filtered to keep only properly mapped reads (see above) and submitted to breakdancer-max command with default options. For each cohort, bam files of the ancestral line and derived MA line(s) were processed in parallel and results were converted to vcf format. For each MAL, variants found in the ancestor line were substracted with leniant criteria to account for the low precision of breakpoint positions achieved by structural variant (SV) callers: two SVs were considered identical if they were of the same type within a 100 bp window (corresponding to read size) and with a difference in size lower than 50%. Then, the following heuristic hard filters were applied (determined on the distribution of the corresponding parameters): QUAL &gt; 90; 50 bp &lt;= SVLEN &lt;= 1 000 000 bp and 25 &lt;= DP &lt;= 150 or 2 &lt;= DP &lt;= 150 for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, respectively. We observed that many false positive calls were generated close to repeated regions where many reads map wrongly. Hence, all variations called in a two kbp region (four times the insert size) where the mean coverage was superior to 100 (five times the mean coverage) were filtered out. Finally, as for short variations, all MALs of a cohort were compared to keep only unique variations per MAL (using aforementioned leniant criteria for SV comparison). In parallel, unfiltered bams were processed with Pindel (with parameter --<monospace>max_range_index</monospace> 6) and for each MAL, variants found in the ancestral line and other MALs of the cohort were filtered out. Finally, the lists of variants generated by Breakdancer and Pindel were intersected to keep only SV called by both procedures. This yielded few candidate SV (16 for the 6 MALs), all deletions, which were directly inspected with an alignment viewer in both MAL and PL. Only four large deletions passed this ultimate filter. All variants found by the two procedures (short and long variants) are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Variant confirmation and genotyping using pyrosequencing</title><p>About 11% of the candidate calls from our short-variant-discovery pipeline were directly tested by pyrosequencing. Variations were not randomly chosen, but selected to be used as helpful genotyping markers during the genetic mapping of the causative locus affecting P3.p division frequency. However, this selection was constrained by the low number of variations per MA line (typically eight per chromosome in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and 34 in <italic>C. briggsae</italic>). Prior to any evidence, two to three variations were selected on each chromosome (ideally one variation in the middle of each chromosomal arm, one in the centromeric region if variations in the arms were excessively shifted to the tips). After the mapping gave the first genetic evidence, additional candidate variations were tested to restrict the mapping interval in the relevant chromosome. SNPs were preferred over indels. Regions containing long stretches of a single nucleotide were avoided, both because the initial call is less likely and because the interpretation of pyrosequencing results is harder in such contexts. Pyrosequencing assays were performed as previously described on a PyroMark Q96 ID instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besnard et al., 2017</xref>), using universal biotinylated primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duveau and Félix, 2012</xref>). Genotyping assays included the reference genome, the ancestral line and the tested MA line, ie: for the N2 cohort, N2 (reference and ancestor) and MA516; for PB306's cohort, N2 (reference), PB306 (ancestor), and either MA line 418, 450 or 488; for HK104's cohort, AF16 (reference), HK104 (ancestor) and MA296. Candidate SV calls were assayed by PCR with oligonucleotides flanking the predicted deletions. PCR products were controlled on electrophoresis and Sanger-sequenced.

For all back-crosses, males of the ancestral line were placed with (preferably old, sperm-depleted) hermaphrodites of the mutation accumulation line to back-cross (P<sub>0</sub>). F1 cross-progeny were isolated on fresh plates and allowed to lay eggs. They were transferred every day to new plates to ease the separation of parents and offspring and synchronization of the F2 offspring. Occasionally, F1 hermaphrodites were eventually lysed and genotyped by pyrosequencing to ensure they were true cross progeny. Several F2 animals were isolated for each cross and gave rise to an independent line of one back-cross increment compared to the initial P0. Serial back-crosses are noted as 1X, 2X, etc. Different strategies and crossing schemes were applied for the different MA lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">8</xref>). The first strategy consisting in crossing without selection was applied for the first back-cross of MAL296 and the second back-cross of MAL516. In this case, several random F2 hermaphrodites were isolated, without scoring the vulva or selecting for any other phenotype. A second strategy consisted in selecting F2 based on a phenotype. MAL296 2X and 3X lines were generated by selecting F2 hermaphrodites showing a divided ('SS') fate for P3.p. MAL516 1X lines were generated by selecting for Egl (egg-laying) or Pvl (protruding vulva) phenotypes, which were apparent in MAL516. Back-crossed lines of the PB306 cohort (MAL 418, 450 and 488) were generated by selecting a Mendelian recessive (dumpy, small, slow-growth or low-brood-size) phenotype versus wild-type F2 hermaphrodites, in equal amounts. Indeed, all three parent MA lines present a mixture of these phenotypes: this strategy was designed to test a linkage between these obvious morphological phenotypes and P3.p cell fate. Since the linkage was confirmed at each back-cross level, these selection criteria were kept over serial back-crosses (up to 4X for MAL 418 and 450). For these two lines, the morphological phenotype was used to accelerate the crossing scheme: wild-type F1 hermaphrodites (necessarily cross-progeny given the recessive transmission of morphological defects) were directly crossed with PB306 males, resulting in new F1 progeny that were isolated on fresh plates. Due to Mendelian segregation, only half of these new F1 carried a mutant allele and segregates mutant F2 progeny. Only these F1 plates were retained to select both mutant and WT F2. Resulting lines have two increment back-cross levels compared to the initial P<sub>0</sub> (for instance, 4X starting from a 2X-line).</p><p>In all strategies, F2s were singled on fresh plates and perpetuated in parallel by single-hermaphrodite transfer for four to five generations to maximize homozygosity at all loci, and finally amplified for cryo-preservation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mapping the causal mutation</title><p>For each MA line, the set of validated de novo mutations constituted genetic markers spanning all chromosomes. Independent back-crossed lines were scored for P3.p behaviour and then genotyped for some of these markers in order to identify first a linked chromosome, and then a shorter interval depending on the availability of markers (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). All lines were not systematically genotyped for all markers, except for the candidate mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing</title><p>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (HR) was used to mimic the candidate mutation of MA lines 296, 450, 488 and 516. HR was performed using single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide repair templates (ssDORT) with 35 bp 5’ and 3’ homology arms, following a combination of previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Paix et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Paix et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dokshin et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the trans-activating CRISPR RNAs (tracrRNAs; ordered from IDT) were individually annealed with CRISPR RNA guides (crRNAs) by incubation at 95°C for 5 min and cooling to room temperature (~23–25°C) for another 5 min to generate single-guide RNAs (sgRNA). Then, recombinant <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 nuclease V3 (IDT) was incubated with sgRNAs for 10 min at 37°C to form ribonucleoprotein complexes. Next, ssDORTs, plasmids and nuclease-free water were added to the mix and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min before loading into the needle. The mixes were micro-injected into gonads of 1 day old adult hermaphrodites (P0) of the ancestral lines. F1 progeny was singled from plates displaying the highest number of dumpy (Dpy) or roller (Rol) phenotypes. Two days later, single F1s were PCR screened for HR replacements using primers flanking the target region (outside the ssDORT sequence) and one HR-specific primer. Non-Rol or non-Dpy progeny (F2 or F3) of positive F1 animals were singly propagated to generate homozygous progeny and further genotyped by PCR. Genomic replacements were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. crRNAs were designed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu/">http://crispr.mit.edu/</ext-link> (Zhang lab) for <italic>C. elegans</italic> editings and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispor.tefor.net/">http://crispor.tefor.net/</ext-link> for <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, and ordered from IDT.</p><p>To generate the large deletion of 1382 bp in the exon 21 of <italic>gcn-1</italic> (as found in MAL516), we used two crRNAs (crRNA.gcn-1.E21.prox.g1 and crRNA.gcn-1.E21.dist.g1) to generate double strand breaks (DSB) flanking the deletion breakpoints and a ssDORT (gcn-1.E21.rt) to generate the large deletion by HR repair. We used the following injection mix: 0.25 μg/μl Cas9 protein (IDT), 57 μM tracrRNA, 22.5 μM of crRNA.gcn-1.E21.prox.g1 and 22.5 μM of crRNA.gcn-1.E21.dist.g1, 110 ng/μl gcn-1.E21.rt4 repair template, 40 ng/μl of the plasmid pRF4::<italic>rol-6(su1006)</italic> as an injection marker, and 50 ng/μl of empty pBluescript plasmid.

To control for the eight silent mutations, we generated control lines with another ssDORT (sfrp-1.E2.rt2) that only has the silent mutations.

author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>One of the most intriguing observations in ecology and evolution relates to the large breadth of rates at which traits evolve. Whether this variation is caused by natural selection, variation in mutation rates or by differences in the organization of the underlying molecular network is largely unexplored. Here, the authors examine whether the rapid evolution of a developmental trait in worms is caused by its underlying architecture, more specifically by the size of its mutational target, or by a high mutation rate of the genes involved in shaping this trait. They find that the rapid evolution of this trait is not caused by a high mutation rate of the underlying genes, but rather by the large number genes involved. These results show that how traits are organized at the molecular level influences their rate of evolution, demonstrating how important it is to integrate cell biology and quantitative genetics to fully understand evolution.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A broad mutational target explains a fast rate of phenotypic evolution&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David Matus (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors identified developmental traits in worms that evolve particularly rapidly in MA lines. Two factors could explain this rapid evolution.</p><p>1) A large number of loci involved in determining or affecting the trait.</p><p>2) A few loci but a high rate of mutation.</p><p>These two potential factors underlying high rate of evolution have rarely been disentangled because they require that one identifies the mutations underlying variation in the trait. Here the authors do so using the nematode vulva precursor cells and find that the high mutational variance (Vm) for this trait is likely elevated due to the large underlying mutational target size.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the study is well performed, that the question is of great interest and that the manuscript is well written and presented. The comments to be addressed are merged below into a single list.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A lot of emphasis is given to highly mutable sites such as in short tandem repeats. These are highly mutable, but they may at the same time be underrepresented in coding and functional parts of the genome. The authors eliminate the possibility of high mutation rates by not observing causal mutations in the repeats. If these repeats are rare in functional parts of the genome, the contribution of mutation rate to high Vm may come from other types of more mutable sites and not these extreme cases. Since mutation rate in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been measured using MA lines and there is a lot of data on population variation, it would be useful if the author could also examine the relative expected rates for the different types of mutations (and flanking context) they observe as causal. They could see at least in terms of ranking, whether these changes are more or less common. The genes involved for instance could be in genomic regions with high or low GC content, which could have high or low mutation rates, etc. Overall, eliminating the role of mutation rate is done in a qualitative manner and it could be much more quantitative and better reflect the continuous distribution of mutation rates and mutational target sites. I understand that this is difficult to do with a small set of mutations but if the authors could at least verify that the types of mutation they see do not exceptionally occur at high frequency that would better support their conclusion.</p><p>Another comment would be about the focus on developmental systems to study the underlying factors of variation in Vm. Some significant work has been done for instance on the underlying basis of gene expression variation in model organisms and in parallel in MA lines. Also, attempts have been made at estimating the relationship between Vm and mutational target sites in some cases. It would be good to acknowledge/discuss this work as it would show that these concepts and factors are probably true for any measurable trait and that there may be common rules across types of traits. This would make the paper appeal to a wider audience than the evodevo community.</p><p>Another critique or comment is less of a critique and more of a suggestion – there's an opportunity lost in not presenting this work as also an incredibly innovative way to leverage quantitative genetics to identify novel regulators of a biological process. Also, as a cell biologist, I am left with wanting to know whether the genes/pathways identified function autonomously or not. I fully recognize that this may be beyond the scope of the present study, but from a developmental perspective and as a strategy for identifying novel members and pathways that contribute to the evolution and development of a particular biological process, it would be interesting to know whether the newly identified pathways function autonomously to mediate P3.p fusion/division.</p><p>One potential limitation to their study is that so few lines were studied. They originally evaluated 15 lines, chose 6 due (presumably) to inconsistent P3.p division frequency results with the previous study, and then removed 1 more due to time constraints. The remaining 5 are split over two species. These lines are not representative in a random sampling sense – it isn't clear to me that we definitively know whether they are representative in terms of the biology and the question they want to answer. However, there are reasons to think that they are – at least with respect to the main question of the paper. They address this somewhat in their Discussion in the paragraph starting &quot;An obvious further question…&quot;. I am not advocating that they look at more lines. They discuss the practical difficulties of doing this experiment, there may not be more lines to look at (since they had to exclude a bunch for inconsistency), and even if they haven't definitively rejected the mutagenic DNA hypothesis for all effect sizes of mutations, they have certainly shown that it isn't an explanation for their specific data. There are enough different pathways involved among their 5 mutations that it is far easier to think that there is plenty of opportunity for mutations of small effect to arise in those pathways without postulating that there is an unknown but much more important class of P3.p affecting mutagenic loci that are really behind any smaller evolved differences in others of the MA lines. Indeed, the more likely situation is that the mutational target size is even bigger than they found and that sampling more lines would just reinforce their conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54928.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A lot of emphasis is given to highly mutable sites such as in short tandem repeats.

We also had provided quantitative data with two measures of the genomic context related to repeats: the distribution of distances to the closest repeat (Figure 5B) and the repeat content at a larger scale (50 kb-window, Figure 5—figure supplement 1), which did not show unusual values.</p><p>Although this is a qualitative argument, we had also pointed out the five mutations are so diverse that higher mutability for all these different cases is unlikely: diversity of the type of mutations (Figure 4A and Figure 5A), of their relation to functional sequences (Figure 5A) and of their chromosomal locations (Figure 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>However, it was useful to add further quantitative analyses of mutation rates. We thus performed new analyses that lead to enrich this revised manuscript with a new main figure (Figure 6), a new supplementary figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), a modified supplementary figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), a new supplementary table (Supplementary file 7) and substantial text modification corresponding to this part.</p><p>Ideally, sequencing thousands of mutation accumulation lines should cover almost all the genome of a <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species with spontaneous mutations, so that the &quot;continuous distribution of mutation rates and target sites&quot; could be computed and the five causal loci of the study positioned in this distribution. Unfortunately, such unrealistic data set does not exist, so a fine measure of spontaneous mutation rates is not possible.</p><p>However, as suggested by the reviewers, existing data, yet imperfect, allow to compare the mutations identified in this study with mutations obtained in different contexts, providing a more subtle understanding of the range of mutation rates and their likelihood. Notably, we provide data on mutability not only for the five causal nucleotide positions identified (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1), but also for the five causative genes leading to P3.p evolution (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). To this end, we combined data of mutations from different sources to mitigate their individual shortcomings. Data from other Mutation Accumulation Lines (Saxena et al., 2019) provide the perfect comparison but they are largely under-powered. Data from the Million Mutation Project (Thompson et al., 2013) provide enough power, but induced and spontaneous mutations surely have a different spectrum so that the type and target sites of mutations are not strictly comparable. Natural variation (Cook et al., 2017) is abundant and originates from spontaneous mutations with a supposedly similar spectrum as laboratory MA lines, but their final distribution is modified by the action of natural selection and genetic draft.</p><p>Here are listed the main conclusions drawn from these new analyses:</p><p>Regarding mutated positions (nucleotides)</p><p>– According to statistics of mutation accumulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> derived from previous studies (Denver et al., 2012 and Saxena et al., 2019), the three small mutations (two SNPs and a 16-bp deletion) are not the most frequent: low frequencies for these single nucleotide substitutions, low frequencies of corresponding 3-bp motifs, small indels are more infrequent than SNPs, mutations (of all type) outside repeats are less frequent (subsection “Molecular nature of the causal mutations and mutation rates at these loci”).</p><p>– Parsing whole-genome sequences of 75 other MA lines of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Saxena et al., 2019) reveals that the causal loci (nucleotide positions of mutations or deletion breakpoints) are not hit again (even neighbouring sequences up to several kb) nor the causative genes (exons), excluding the extreme scenario of super-mutable loci and/or genes (subsection “Molecular nature of the causal mutations and mutation rates at these loci”, Figure 6A).</p><p>– Using the MMP and CeNDR, none of the five nucleotide positions (breakpoints for deletions) were particularly prone to mutations (Supplementary file 7).</p><p>Regarding mutated genes</p><p>The high Vm of P3.p fate is ultimately caused by functional impacts on underlying genes, a first level in genotype/phenotype mapping. In the MMP and CeNDR, the mutation rate of the five causative genes is mainly driven by their size (which correlates with large introns and repeats) (Figure 6B). One of the five genes <italic>(gcn-1</italic>) is particularly long (the 10th longest protein-coding gene in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) so it is particularly likely to be the target of mutations.</p><p>We hope that these new elements answered the reviewers' concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another comment would be about the focus on developmental systems to study the underlying factors of variation in Vm.

Our title is generic and the Abstract does not mention development either. We use the word &quot;development&quot; in &quot;developmental constraints&quot; because of its historical importance.</p><p>We now changed: &quot;the second at the developmental level&quot; by &quot;the second at the level of genotype-phenotype mapping&quot;; &quot;development of such a trait&quot; to &quot;construction of such a trait&quot;. We kept the word &quot;development&quot; when referring specifically to vulva development.</p><p>Besides generic references that apply to any living organisms with a G/P map, we had provided in the first version examples of relationship between mutational variance and phenotypic variation in a diversity of animals as well as in several articles in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (fungi), and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (plant). We now add further references including in bacteria (Girgis et al., 2009, Girgis et al., 2012, Fridman et al., 2014, Brauner et al., 2016, Khare and Tavazoie, 2020), as well as examples using the multidimensional nature of the transcriptome (Denver et al., 2005, Rifkin et al., 2005, Landry et al., 2007, Hine et al., 2018).
