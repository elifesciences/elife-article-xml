Connecting the abundance of microscopical, molecular, biochemical, and cell mechanical data with defined topologies has turned out to be extremely difficult. Establishing such structural and functional 3D maps needed for biophysical modeling is a particular challenge for the cytoskeleton, which consists of long and interwoven filamentous polymers coordinating subcellular processes and interactions of cells with their environment. To date, useful tools are available for the segmentation and modeling of actin filaments and microtubules but comprehensive tools for the mapping of intermediate filament organization are still lacking. In this work, we describe a workflow to model and examine the complete 3D arrangement of the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton in canine, murine, and human epithelial cells both, in vitro and in vivo. Numerical models are derived from confocal airyscan high-resolution 3D imaging of fluorescence-tagged keratin filaments. They are interrogated and annotated at different length scales using different modes of visualization including immersive virtual reality. In this way, information is provided on network organization at the subcellular level including mesh arrangement, density and isotropic configuration as well as details on filament morphology such as bundling, curvature, and orientation. We show that the comparison of these parameters helps to identify, in quantitative terms, similarities and differences of keratin network organization in epithelial cell types defining subcellular domains, notably basal, apical, lateral, and perinuclear systems. The described approach and the presented data are pivotal for generating mechanobiological models that can be experimentally tested.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>intermediate filament</kwd><kwd>keratin</kwd><kwd>retinal pigment epithelium</kwd><kwd>3D network</kwd><kwd>virtual reality</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WI173/8-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Windoffer</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LE566/18-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leube</surname><given-names>Rudolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK2415/363055819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Windoffer</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name><name><surname>Yoon</surname><given-names>Sungjun</given-names></name><name><surname>Piskova</surname><given-names>Teodora</given-names></name><name><surname>Leube</surname><given-names>Rudolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007210</institution-id><institution>RWTH Aachen University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>rwth0452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Windoffer</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009398</institution-id><institution>Medizinische Fakultät, RWTH Aachen University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IZKF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piskova</surname><given-names>Teodora</given-names></name><name><surname>Di Russo</surname><given-names>Jacopo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Based on 3D visualization of fluorescently labeled cytoskeletal networks, an imaging platform is provided, which allows 3D network reconstruction, immersive visualization and quantification of local network properties serving as blueprints for functional modeling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Quantification of cellular properties is a central task of cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liberali and Pelkmans, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lidke, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lippincott-Schwartz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piston, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roca-Cusachs et al., 2017</xref>). It is necessary for scientific analysis, testing, and model building. The structural diversity of eukaryotic cells supports their complex functions and is essential to provide local microenvironments, which facilitate and enhance the probability of highly specialized molecular interactions and reactions. The cytoskeleton is a key determinant of the necessary spatial organization. It consists of filamentous polymers, which assemble into microtubules, actin filaments, and intermediate filaments. The resulting networks are interlinked and connected to intra- and extracellular targets, including cytoplasmic organelles and specialized plasma membrane sites. In this way, they act as structural and mechanical connectors between extra- and intracellular forces. The participating structures and polypeptides have been referred to as the mechanobiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kothari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parajón et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), which defines the mechanical setting of a cell. The properties of several mechanobiome components have already been quantified including their turnover and mechanical features at different levels. Comprehensive quantitative information on entire cytoskeletal networks, however, is missing for most components and, consequently, only little is known about the distribution, local composition, mesh size, orientation, and mechanical properties of cytoskeletal networks at the subcellular level. Therefore, there is an urgent need to describe cytoskeletal network architectures in quantitative terms at subcellular resolution. To this end, we present a novel approach to create the complete digital representation of keratin intermediate filament networks in three dimensions (3D), providing maps and quantitative measurements of the entire keratin network in cultured cells and in cells within their native tissue context.</p><p>The intermediate filament cytoskeleton consists of polypeptides, which are expressed in a tissue- and context-specific manner. The largest group of intermediate filaments, the keratin intermediate filaments, are the main cytoplasmic networks in epithelial tissues. They confer, together with their associated desmosomal cell-cell and hemidesmosomal cell-extracellular matrix adhesions, mechanical resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatzfeld et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Te Molder et al., 2021</xref>). The human genome contains 54 keratin genes, which are expressed in epithelia and epidermal appendages in a cell type-specific pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jacob et al., 2018</xref>). Keratin filaments are highly flexible and extensible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Block et al., 2015</xref>). They form hollow tubes with remarkable variability in local diameter and ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weber et al., 2021</xref>). Keratin filaments generate branched bundles of different thickness forming anisotropic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beil et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). The 3D organization of keratin networks differs profoundly between different epithelia: for example, the simple epithelial cells lining the intestine contain a well-defined lateral and apical network, keratinocytes contain a dense 3D network encompassing the entire cytoplasm, and hepatocytes have a prominent submembraneous network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Strnad et al., 2008</xref>). Network organization is furthermore affected by mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beriault et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Felder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fois et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lutz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quinlan et al., 2017</xref>) and differentiation-status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coch and Leube, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwatsuki and Suda, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leube et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quinlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tateishi et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, individual proteins such as Ndel1 and plectin have been shown to regulate keratin network organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osmanagic-Myers et al., 2006</xref>). Knowledge of the 3D keratin network organization in single epithelial cells is therefore important to understand and characterize the particular functional status of a given cell within its complex tissue context under different conditions.</p><p>Segmentation of cellular elements is a key task in biological image analysis. Its application to specific structures, however, can be quite difficult and requires appropriate adjustment. Networks of curvilinear objects such as keratin networks are ubiquitous ranging from cytoskeletal ﬁlaments at the micro- to nanoscale to blood vessels or neuronal networks at the tissue and organ level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Özdemir and Reski, 2021</xref>). Filament detection systems have been developed for vascular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Imran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moccia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Samuel and Veeramalai, 2020</xref>) and neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acciai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Magliaro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Quan et al., 2016</xref>). But these tools have not been optimized for subcellular structures and are specialized to detect branched, tree-like structures. The fishnet-like organization of keratin networks poses novel challenges, which are further confounded by the variably spaced branching points connecting filaments of different thickness and curvature.</p><p>A wide range of specialized tools are available for segmentation of cytoskeletal actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alioscha-Perez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nowak et al., 2020</xref>), which also work in 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haspinger et al., 2021</xref>). Further tools have been developed for the segmentation of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faulkner et al., 2017</xref>) and their prokaryotic homologue FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Özdemir and Reski, 2021</xref>). Recently, a tool was described that is suitable for segmentation of cytoskeletal networks including keratin networks using data obtained by electron microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flormann et al., 2021</xref>). This tool, however, lacks 3D capability and does not capture information on filament thickness. Another segmentation tool for filamentous networks in electronmicroscopic images was also recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dimchev et al., 2021</xref>). Until now, however, no tools are available that segment 3D fluorescence image data of keratin filament networks and transform them into a numerical graph model.</p><p>To segment keratin filament networks and generate data structures with defined nodes and internodal regions ( = segments), we used the open-source program TSOAX. TSOAX has been applied for 3D segmentation of actin networks using fluorescence images of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). It is an implementation of SOAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xu et al., 2011</xref>), which was developed from the Stretching Open Active Contours (SOAC) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2009</xref>). SOACs are open curves, which start at segment tips and delineate the ﬁlament centers. We now show that TSOAX can be used to reliably segment keratin networks in entire cells. TSOAX also provides density information of the identified keratin filaments. However, the association of nodes and segments is not detected satisfactorily as the generated TSOAX snakes are not separated consistently at filament nodes and therefore hinder statistical analysis. We therefore developed additional tools (KerNet) for optimal network representation of a node-segment structure. The combination of the established segmentation algorithms (TSOAX) and the additional KerNet analysis tools helped to create accurate numerical representations of keratin network topology.</p><p>The developed image analysis tools were applied to confocal airyscan high-resolution fluorescence image stacks of keratin networks in single cells either in cultured epithelial monolayers or within their native tissue context. We show that the image analysis tools provide cell-type-specific information on filament mesh characteristics as well as information on filament thickness, directionality, and connectivity in 3D. Cinematic rendering and immersive visualization make analysis of network heterogeneity accessible at a hitherto unknown quality and precision of 3D reconstruction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recording of the keratin intermediate filament network in 3D</title><p>In a first step, we wanted to generate high-resolution fluorescence data that would be suitable for image analysis of single filaments and filament bundles and would represent keratin filament networks in different epithelial cell types. We selected three non-carcinogenic epithelial cell types: (<italic>i</italic>) Canine kidney epithelial MDCK cells producing YFP-tagged keratin 8 (subclone H9) were chosen as representatives of polarized simple epithelial cells. MDCK cells form a one-layered coherent epithelium with the cuboidal to cylindrical cells attached to each other by highly organized junctional complexes. Intracellularly, the keratin filaments have a complex arrangement consisting of a dense subapical network, perinuclear and radial keratin filaments, and interdesmosomal filaments below the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quinlan et al., 2017</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates revealed comparable amounts of YFP-tagged and endogenous keratin 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). (<italic>ii</italic>) Spontaneously immortalized human epidermal keratinocytes expressing YFP-tagged keratin 5 (HaCaT B9) were chosen as representatives of squamous epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boukamp et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moch et al., 2013</xref>). They contain pancytoplasmic keratin filament networks whose 3D organization is only partially elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moch et al., 2020</xref>). (<italic>iii</italic>) To examine the 3D organization of the keratin intermediate filament network in its native tissue context, we made use of the recently described knock-in mouse line expressing only YFP-tagged keratin 8 but no wild-type keratin 8. Retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPE) were selected for the analysis because of their well-delineated cytoplasmic keratin filament network (see below). High-resolution airyscan confocal image stacks were prepared from each cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Transformation of 3D fluorescence recordings of keratin filaments into digital network models</title><p>The recorded image stacks were transformed into Euclidean 3D maps using TSOAX and the KerNet software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). In these maps, curved segments that are connected by nodes describe the entire keratin networks of single cells. The segments represent keratin filament bundles of different thickness and length. These segments are defined as 3D polygonal chains of vertices, each of which has a specific xyz position and brightness. The first and last vertices of a segment are defined as nodes. Nodes are either shared by adjacent connecting segments within a filament or are positioned at the end of a filament in case of loose ends.

The major difference between both domains are the thicker keratin bundles in the basal domain. Each subcellular network is characterized by a regular mesh pattern. The lateral keratin filament network is more heterogenous and dominated by filaments running between apical and basal. Circumferential subcortical keratin filaments are mainly restricted to the apical and basal network domains. In the cell interior, keratin filaments form a network around the nucleus.

A prominent property, which was already graphically encoded in the 3D-models, is filament brightness as a measure of filament thickness. The assumption is that filament thickness is a reliable indicator of filament bundling which can now be easily quantified throughout entire cells. We will therefore use the terms brightness and thickness interchangeably. The histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> depict the spread of filament segment brightness in MDCK, HaCaT, and RPE cells. The quantifications show that filament segments with a medium brightness dominated in MDCK cells with a near Gaussian distribution, whereas thin filaments were prevalent in HaCaT and RPE cells. Thin filaments were most abundant in HaCaT cells.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mapping of keratin filament brightness in MDCK, HaCaT, and RPE cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) The histograms display the distribution of relative segment brightness for each cell type.

The most heterogeneous network in terms of filament thickness was encountered in MDCK cells. The animation in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref> clearly shows that filaments in the basal network of the cell are thicker than that in the apical network. In HaCaT cells, enrichment of thin filaments was visible around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) whereas thicker filaments were detectable in the cytoplasm, many of which appeared to be arranged in parallel (see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

Furthermore, thick bundles were more frequent above the nucleus, that is at the part of the cell facing the photoreceptors. Together, the analyses of the digitalized networks revealed major differences in the extent and distribution of keratin filament bundling suggesting that the keratin network is organized to withstand and cope with different types of mechanical stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Number and length of keratin filament segments and overall keratin filament length in single cells</title><p>The number and length of individual keratin filament segments are key measurements of network organization. Significantly more segments were detected in HaCaT cells than in the other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The average segment length was shortest in MDCK cells (0.80 ± 0.04 µm), longest in RPE cells (0.88 ± 0.05 µm) and intermediate in HaCaT cells (0.83 ± 0.13 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

To see whether this difference was due to different cell dimensions, the cell volumes were determined for all three cell types. Significant differences could be detected, i.e., 4.65 ± 1.13 µm³ for MDCK, 9.16 ± 6.10 µm³ for HaCaT and 2.73 ± 0.95 µm³ for RPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The highest ratios were observed in MDCK (0.92 ± 0.09) and HaCaT (0.92 ± 0.08), which were significantly higher than in RPE cells (0.90 ± 0.10) indicating that the filaments in RPE cells are less straight.

In the vertical direction (y/z plane), horizontally oriented segments predominate in MDCK and HaCaT cells while segments are more uniformly oriented in RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Analysis of segment orientation in MDCK, HaCaT, and RPE cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) The blue polygons represent radial histograms of the orientation of keratin filament segments in relation to the cell center of single cells.

This enabled us to compare local properties of keratin intermediate filament networks such as filament thickness, curvature and orientation in different cell types in vitro and in vivo. It further facilitated comprehensive comparisons of entire networks by quantifying parameters such as entire filament length, degree of filament connectivity, and spatial network orientation.</p><p>A critical aspect of the work was evaluation of the quantification process. Since synthetic 3D data of cellular keratin networks were lacking, the quality of segmentation was evaluated by visual inspection of superimposed imaging and segmentation data demonstrating that the location and brightness of filaments were mapped with high precision and reliability. The subsequent allocation of nodes and segments was visually assessed in rendered 3D models (cinematic rendering) again revealing agreement of the assignments. Nevertheless, the numerical representation has its limitations in accuracy. Proper segment and node detection was particularly challenging in HaCaT cells because of their complex network geometry in combination with low filament bundling. Extreme bending at the single filament level with bending radii of 100 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weber et al., 2021</xref>) are not detected in the present set-up due to the resolution limit of the airyscan. Mapping of keratin filaments at the cell edges was also difficult in some regions, mostly because of the manual assignment of cell borders in the confluent cell layers with tightly attached and partially overlapping neighboring cells. In cultured cells, mixing of fluorescent and non-fluorescent cells could overcome this problem. Segmentation quality may be further improved in the future by using other and more powerful super-resolution techniques than the airyscan technology used in the present work.</p><p>A major advance of the current report is the fabrication of numerical models of the keratin filament network in 3D. The rendered 3D models can be thoroughly inspected with the help of 3D display devices such as 3D screens, virtual reality-headsets (HMDs) or Cave Automatic Virtual Environments (CAVEs). The benefits of such immersive environments have been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruz-Neira et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laha et al., 2013</xref>). Three factors thereby improve the domain scientists’ spatial judgment and thus the task performance during the visual analysis: (i) an enlarged field of regard compared to standard desktop systems reduces clutter during data exploration, (ii) stereoscopy provides supporting depth cues, and (iii) head tracking provides enhanced motion parallax. Motion parallax is a monocular depth cue which allows observers to perceive the depth of the visualized cell from their own motion. The filaments close to the observers are perceived to be moving faster than filaments in the distance.</p><p>The derived digital network models furthermore allow comparisons between cells with similar or dissimilar differentiation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). As a proof of concept, we paradigmatically investigated three different epithelial cell types finding significant differences in filament bundling, segment length, filament density, filament curvature and filament orientation. These parameters are a crucial and first step to build mechanical models of keratin filament networks in different cell types and functional contexts. The following list shows potential implications of the extracted features for our understanding of keratin filament network properties and functions:</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic drawing of the reconstructed keratin network in the three cell types investigated.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75894-fig9-v3.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Brightness of keratin filament segments</title><p>Brightness levels correspond to filaments thickness and are therefore a measure of keratin filament bundling. The observed variation in filament bundling in the different cell types may therefore be a consequence of differences in the local force balance. This force balance is the result of intrinsic cell type-specific properties such as cell shape and arrangement of the actomyosin system and is impacted by forces imposed by neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix. This is supported by the observed differences in bundling of the apical, basal and perinuclear keratin filament networks. However, the variation in filament thickness may also reflect other properties such as the propensity of the network to reorganize, for example, at different times of the cell cycle. Correlating the derived image data with information on mechanical keratin filament properties obtained by laser cutting experiments, force-sensor measurements or traction force analyses may help to better understand the relationship between filament bundling and mechanics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Length of keratin filament segments</title><p>Keratin filament segment length is an indirect measure of mesh size and may therefore describe another crucial mechanical property of the network. We were surprised to find that the segment length varied only by 10% between the different cell types and thus showed less variation than filament brightness or curvature. This means that the mesh size is fixed within a relatively small range, although the number of meshes per volume differed significantly between the different cell types. A conclusion of this observation is that mesh size may be determined by intrinsic keratin filament properties such as elastic modulus or branching capacity. However time-lapse fluorescence analyses (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wöll et al., 2005</xref>) have shown that small meshes can merge and enlarge by the combination of nodes from two segments, forming thicker filament bundles. Conversely, large meshes are subdivided into small meshes by recruitment of segments into a node. A self-regulatory mechanism may thus control the balance between enlargement and reduction of individual meshes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Branching of keratin filament segments</title><p>Experimental and mechanistic evidence has been provided for keratin filament branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beil et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng and Coulombe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nafeey et al., 2016</xref>). The fact that mostly two types of branching/intersections were detected in this study, points to a limited repertoire of connectivity. Furthermore, the Y- and X-shaped configurations may be fundamentally different. The Y-shaped joining of three segments may be linked to the recently proposed bundling mechanism involving electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haimov et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, the X-shaped intersections may be related to the disulfide-bond-mediated interactions reported for keratins 5/14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). In this instance, preventing these links resulted in altered keratin filament network dynamics and epidermal tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng and Coulombe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Curvature of keratin filament segments</title><p>Bending of keratin filaments provides important information on whether keratins are stretched, relaxed or compressed. Keratin intermediate filaments are highly elastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kreplak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yamada et al., 2003</xref>). They can be extended under tension forming straight filaments and buckle under compression ( = negative tension) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fudge et al., 2008</xref>). The measurements of segment curvature can therefore be taken as indicators of local keratin filament tension. Straight segments were almost completely absent in all cells suggesting overall negative tension of the keratin networks. The observation that filament bundle thickness and curvature are not correlated suggests that the 10 nm filaments are only loosely connected in keratin bundles. The degree of filament bending, however, differed between the different cell types indicating cell type-specific differences in intrinsic force balance and may suggest that the different networks retain different degrees of flexibility before they become stretched to function as mechanical counterbalances to strain. Curvature of keratin filaments also allowed to estimate the persistence length of network-embedded keratin filaments, that is the minimum length between two points on the polymer where they become independent of one another. The value of ~2 µm was only slightly higher than what was reported for other intermediate filaments including keratin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Block et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>). This is low in comparison to actin filaments (~10 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De La Cruz and Gardel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isambert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takatsuki et al., 2014</xref>) and microtubules (~5000 µm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawkins et al., 2010</xref>). This result emphasizes the maintained high flexibility of keratin filaments despite their connectivity through nodes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Orientation of keratin filaments</title><p>To understand the response of the keratin network to internal and external forces, it is important to have measures of filament orientation. We suggest that uniformly radial orientation of keratin filament segments indicates that cells experience mechanical forces that are homogenous in all directions. In contrast, a preferential orientation in one direction indicates that keratin filaments align in response to mechanical cues that may be induced by unevenly distributed cell-cell contacts, polarized cell-extracellular matrix adhesions or contractile activity. Our data therefore indicate that HaCaT cells are subjected to mechanical strain (uneven azimuth distribution and large sum vector), whereas MDCK and RPE are subjected to little mechanical strain (uniform azimuth distribution and small sum vector). Fine mapping of the distribution patterns of hemidesmosomes and desmosomes may help to understand the differences and to initiate mechanical modelling, improving previous models of keratin network, morphogenesis, dynamics and mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dallon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Latorre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Portet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Portet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Portet et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The observed high degree of segment property variability must be taken as an indication of the amazing plasticity of the keratin filament system. The node/segment arrangement revealed a unique 3D structure that can be modified in multiple ways affecting bundling, flexibility, and local cross-talk. Keratin isotypes, posttranslational modifications, external and internal forces, and interactions with other cytoskeletal and cellular components may determine these properties and thereby act as modulators of network structure at different length and time scales.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were stably transfected with a plasmid encoding human full-length keratin eight with an EYFP tag at its carboxyterminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Windoffer et al., 2004</xref>; recloned into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) with BamHI and EcoRI).

Fluorescence was detected with an 488 nm argon laser (module LGK 7872 ML8) and filter set BP 495–550 using 2.5% power. Optimal factory settings for z-stacks were used resulting in a voxel size of xy = 0.044–0.065 µm and z = 0.17–0.2 µm. No further image optimization was used. To assure that only single cells were analyzed, the fluorescence in individual cells was cropped from confluent MDCK monolayers and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) using Fiji standard tools. Cell borders were manually defined for each z-slice and the cell exterior was set to a grey value of 0.

TSOAX facilitates quantitative analysis of network dynamics of multi-dimensional biopolymer networks imaged by various microscopic imaging modalities. The underlying methods of TSOAX include multiple Stretching Open Active Contour (SOAC) models for extraction and a combined local and global graph-matching framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2010</xref>). For optimal results, the default TSOAX parameters were used, with the exception of ‘external-factor’ which was set to two based on internal testing. Since computation time can be extremely long, TSOAX was executed in parallel instances on the supercomputer CLAIX at RWTH Compute Cluster (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.itc.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/eucm">https://www.itc.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/eucm</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Calculation of a segment/node-based network model</title><p>To get a perfect network representation, it is necessary to divide the network into defined pieces ( = segments) that do not cross each other, and can be connected at their ends by nodes. Segmentations using TSOAX defines polygonal chains with <italic>n</italic> vertices ( = snakes). Each vertex is defined in x, y, z and has an associated density ( = fluorescence intensity). However, the snakes are not associated with each other via nodes and may cross each other. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To obtain a comprehensive and coherent numerical network definition from snakes, KerNet software was developed. It generates a graph representation consisting of segments (~ edges) and nodes. To compute such a connected network representation, vertices of a snake that lie within <italic>ε</italic> = 1.1 x voxelsize distance of one another are combined to form a node. If more than two vertices are within ε distance, a candidate set is created. Any vertex, which is at most ε away from a vertex in the candidate set, is added to the set until this is no longer possible. Then all vertices in the candidate set are combined to form a single node. Finally, any start or end vertex of a segment is a node. If two nodes are connected by a part of a snake then a segment connects the two nodes in the network. In contrast to classical edges, which are defined as lines connecting the nodes, each segment is a list of vertices (x,y,z) and their associated densities. The segments therefore inform about the trajectory of the snake between its two endpoints and the density progression along the segment. To summarize, nodes represent the first and last vertex of a segment and mark the connection between segments whose endpoints are close (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

For the representation of segment brightness as renderable tubes, density properties of segments were compiled into 3ds Max (Autodesk) script files that translate segment brightness into tube thickness, resulting in renderable splines for each segment. In some instances, random colors were assigned to each segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John E Eriksson/John (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Congratulations to the authors on a beautiful and important body of work.</p><p>2) The authors are expected to address all of the comments that were deemed &quot;required&quot; by the three reviewers, each of whom is an expert in the field and provided a balanced and informed opinion about the work.</p><p>3) The issue of whether to retain Figure 3 in the main space of the paper (cf. reviewer #3) or relocate it to supplementary material is one worth thinking about. As the reviewing editor I support reviewer 3's opinion that Figure 3 does not belong to the main space of the paper, though I would like to see it accessible to the public. The editor is expected to weigh in on this specific issue.</p><p>4) There are a number of additional comments and suggestions that were provided by the three reviewers. The authors should make a deliberate effort to address them. This contribution has the clear potential of becoming a landmark paper in the field and addressing (many of) these comments would help make the contribution clearer, stronger, and potentially more impactful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Issues that should be addressed by the authors include:</p><p>Resolution of the microscopic imaging. Can the authors detect single 10 nm filaments in the cells they studied? If not, is there a sense of how many filaments are comprised in the segments they can detect, microscopically?</p><p>Can the author convert their whole cell imaging data into a concentration of keratin proteins, and number of filaments, inside cells? Some assumptions would need to be made, but it would be interesting to compare the outcome of this analysis to biochemical measurements that have been published, e.g., for basal keratinocytes in the epidermis in situ (see X Feng et al., J Invest Dermatol 2013 PMID 23190880). How does the imaging-derived information compare to actual (biochemical) keratin concentrations in the cell lines analyzed (MDCK, HaCaT)? This comparative analysis would provide a sense of &quot;how much of the keratin pool&quot; is being captured through the imaging approach developed by the authors.</p><p>Section 3.6. Is there any trend regarding subcellular distribution for the Y-shape, X-shape, star-shaped and more complex arrangements of intersections between filaments?</p><p>Section 3.7. One would expect that thicker segments show a lower degree of bending, as they are likely to represent bundles of filaments. Comments? A key determinant, as pointed out by the authors in their Discussion, is whether fiber segments are subjected to forces (e.g., axial compression, lateral pulling, etc.).</p><p>Bundling properties. Given the known arrangement of subunits in the keratin filament lattice, there likely is a fair amount of GFP moieties in the filaments analyzed. Does the presence of a GFP fusion, which presumably is exposed at the surface of filaments, impact their ability to undergo bundling? (of relevance: what is the stoichiometry of fusion protein relative to endogenous K8 and other type II keratins?).</p><p>Line 136 – Imaging of HaCaT cells. &quot;When&quot; were the analyses performed relative to time in culture and degree of confluence?</p><p>Line 294.

While we cannot formally exclude a mild effect on bundling, the current manuscript together with many publications not only from our own lab but also many other labs world-wide indicate that fluorescent protein-tagged keratins are highly reliable, precise and fully functional reporters of the wild-type polypeptides. The healthy and inconspicuous homozygous Krt8-YFP mouse colony further attests this conclusion.</p><p>For the Reviewers’ perusal we provide a comparison of an anti-keratin immunostaining of MDCK cells (left) with one of the MDCK cells analysed in the current manuscript (right). While the quality of the immunodetection is inferior to that of the fluorescence in the viable cell because of the necessary fixation and permeabilisation, overall network morphology and filament bundling appear to be comparable.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75894-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 136 – Imaging of HaCaT cells. &quot;When&quot; were the analyses performed relative to time in culture and degree of confluence?</p></disp-quote><p>HaCaT B10 cells were imaged 1-2 days after reaching confluence corresponding to 5-7 after seeding.

This is due to the transformation of the slice-based fluorescence z-positions into continuous positions in the segmentation data. Thus, ‘new’ z-positions are created in between the slices of the original z-stack positions in the segmentation data leading to slight incongruences in the overlays of the projection images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
