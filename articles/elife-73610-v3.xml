limitations affect deliberative decision-making is not understood. We used human psychophysics to assess the impact of working-memory limitations on the fidelity of a continuous decision variable. Participants decided the average location of multiple visual targets. This computed, continuous decision variable degraded with time and capacity in a manner that depended critically on the strategy used to form the decision variable. This dependence reflected whether the decision variable was computed either: (1) immediately upon observing the evidence, and thus stored as a single value in memory; or (2) at the time of the report, and thus stored as multiple values in memory. These results provide important constraints on how the brain computes and maintains temporally dynamic decision variables.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Working memory, the brain’s ability to temporarily store and recall information, is a critical part of decision making – but it has its limits. The brain can only store so much information, for so long. Since decisions are not often acted on immediately, information held in working memory ‘degrades’ over time. However, it is unknown whether or not this degradation of information over time affects the accuracy of later decisions.</p><p>The tactics that people use, knowingly or otherwise, to store information in working memory also remain unclear. Do people store pieces of information such as numbers, objects and particular details? Or do they tend to compute that information, make some preliminary judgement and recall their verdict later? Does the strategy chosen impact people’s decision-making?</p><p>To investigate, Schapiro et al. devised a series of experiments to test whether the limitations of working memory, and how people store information, affect the accuracy of decisions they make. First, participants were shown an array of colored discs on a screen. Then, either immediately after seeing the disks or a few seconds later, the participants were asked to recall the position of one of the disks they had seen, or the average position of all the disks. This measured how much information degraded for a decision based on multiple items, and how much for a decision based on a single item. From this, the method of information storage used to make a decision could be inferred.</p><p>Schapiro et al. found that the accuracy of people’s responses worsened over time, whether they remembered the position of each individual disk, or computed their average location before responding. The greater the delay between seeing the disks and reporting their location, the less accurate people’s responses tended to be. Similarly, the more disks a participant saw, the less accurate their response became. This suggests that however people store information, if working memory reaches capacity, decision-making suffers and that, over time, stored information decays.</p><p>Schapiro et al. also noticed that participants remembered location information in different ways depending on the task and how many disks they were shown at once. This suggests people adopt different strategies to retain information momentarily.</p><p>In summary, these findings help to explain how people process and store information to make decisions and how the limitations of working memory impact their decision-making ability. A better understanding of how people use working memory to make decisions may also shed light on situations or brain conditions where decision-making is impaired.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>psychophysics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH115557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Josic</surname><given-names>Kresimir</given-names></name><name><surname>Kilpatrick</surname><given-names>Zachary P</given-names></name><name><surname>I Gold</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computed decisions degrade in working memory in a manner that depends on one of two strategies used to store relevant information as revealed by mathematical analysis of behavioral response patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many perceptual, memory-based, and reward-based decisions depend on an accumulation of evidence over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brody and Hanks, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ratcliff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shadlen and Shohamy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Summerfield and Tsetsos, 2012</xref>). This dynamic process, which can operate on timescales ranging from tens to hundreds of milliseconds for many perceptual decisions to seconds or longer for reward-based and other decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernacchia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gold and Stocker, 2017</xref>), requires working memory to maintain representations of new, incoming evidence and/or the aggregated, updating decision variable. Working memory is constrained by capacity and temporal limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oberauer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Panichello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ploner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneegans and Bays, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White et al., 1994</xref>) that, in principle, could also constrain decision performance. Several previous studies failed to identify such constraints on decisions that depend on working memory, but those studies used tasks involving binary choices that may be relatively insensitive to known working-memory limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Waskom and Kiani, 2018</xref>). It remains unclear if and how working-memory limitations affect decisions that require interpreting and storing continuously valued quantities whose representations are known to degrade over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ploner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneegans and Bays, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>To better understand how working-memory limitations affect decision-making, we examined how humans made decisions that required interpreting and storing continuously valued visuo-spatial information (visual target locations) that is sensitive to capacity and temporal limitations of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Panichello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ploner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneegans and Bays, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White et al., 1994</xref>). Specifically, we required participants to indicate a remembered spatial location that was informed by one or more briefly presented visual stimuli (‘disks’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) after a variable delay. We compared the effects of variable set size and delay when the remembered location corresponded to either: (1) the perceived location (angle) of a specific disk, identified at the time of interrogation, which is a design that has been used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ploner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneegans and Bays, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White et al., 1994</xref>); or (2) the computed mean angle of a set of multiple disks, which is a form of continuous decision variable whose sensitivity to working-memory limitations has not been examined in detail. Additionally, we examined the effects of working-memory limitations on computed locations under two conditions that are representative of certain decision-making tasks. The first was a ‘simultaneous’ condition in which all disks (and thus all information) were presented at once. The second was a ‘sequential’ condition in which one disk was presented later than the others. This condition required participants to adjust to a within-trial change of available decision-relevant information, typifying decisions that require evidence accumulation over time.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral task.</title><p>Participants were asked to maintain visual fixation on the center cross while an array of colored disks was presented for 0.5 s, followed by a variable delay and finally the presentation of a visual cue whose color was either: (1) the same as one of the disks, indicating that the participant should use the mouse to mark the remembered location of that disk (‘Perceptual’ trial) or (2) white, indicating that the participant should mark the mean angle of the array (‘Computed’ trial). Perceptual and Computed trials were presented in separate, signaled blocks. On Perceptual trials, participants did not know in advance which disk would be probed on any given trial. The number of disks and length of the delay period were varied randomly within each block. Blocks were also defined by the temporal presentation of the disks. In ‘Simultaneous’ blocks, all disks were presented at once, whereas in ‘Sequential’ blocks, the final disk (always the most counter-clockwise of all disks presented on that trial) was presented midway through the variable delay. In all blocks, the disks always had the same clockwise ordering by color, as depicted in the ‘memory array’ graphic above, to minimize binding errors between color and location in the Perceived blocks.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73610-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>For spatial working-memory tasks, the precision of working memory for perceived spatial locations is often well described by diffusion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kilpatrick, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kilpatrick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laing and Chow, 2001</xref>) that are commonly implemented in ‘bump-attractor’ models of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Constantinidis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laing and Chow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riley and Constantinidis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wimmer et al., 2014</xref>). Our analyses built on this framework by examining memory diffusion dynamics for the different task conditions and potential decision strategies. For the conditions we tested, most participants’ behavior was well fit by one of two distinct strategies, each with its own constraints on decision performance based on different working-memory demands. The first strategy was to compute the decision variable (mean disk angle) immediately upon observing the evidence (individual disk angles), and then store that value in working memory in a manner that, like for the memory of a single perceived angle, could be modeled as a single particle with a particular diffusion constant (Average-then-Diffuse model; AtD). The second strategy was to maintain representations of all disk locations in working memory, modeled as separate diffusing particles, and then to combine them into a decision variable only at the time of the decision (Diffuse-then-Average model; DtA). Such a strategy results in an effective diffusion constant for the average that is inversely related to the number of items. Our results show that like perceived locations, memory for computed mean locations degraded with increased set size (of relevant information), and delay between presentation and report. However, the degree of degradation depended on the strategy used to compute the decision variables, implying that multiple, strategy- and task-dependent effects of working-memory should be considered in the construction of future neural and computational models of decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We measured the ability of human participants to remember spatial angles as a function of set size (1, 2, or 5 disks), delay duration (0, 1, or 6 s), and task context (Perceived or Computed blocks). Specifically, we measured the error between reported and probed angles as a proxy for working-memory representations and inferred rates of memory degradation (diffusion constants) from the increase in variance of these errors over time within a framework of diffusing-particle models. Below we first describe the model framework, detailing its key assumptions and predictions. We next describe results from Simultaneous conditions, in which all items were presented simultaneously at the beginning of each trial, which demonstrate how capacity and temporal constraints on working memory relate to the accuracy of computed decision variables. We then describe results from Sequential conditions, in which one item was presented after the others in each trial, which demonstrate how capacity and temporal constraints affect the process of evidence integration over time.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diffusing-particle framework and predictions</title><p>Within our diffusing-particle framework, the memory of an item is represented by the location of a diffusing particle. This representation allows us to quantify the corruption (i.e., reduced precision) of the memory by two distinct sources of noise. The first is described by a static, additive term (<italic>η<sub>1</sub></italic>) that encompasses all potential one-time noise sources within a trial including noise associated with the sensory encoding and the motor response. The second is the dynamic degradation of memory precision over time that is modeled as the diffusion of the particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This diffusion corresponds to an increase in variability over time that is linear, with a slope equal to the diffusion constant (<italic>σ<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Consistent with past modeling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bays et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brady and Alvarez, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koyluoglu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2012</xref>), we accounted for the decrease in working-memory fidelity with item load by incorporating item number (<italic>N</italic>) dependence into both the static noise term (<italic>η<sub>N</sub></italic>) and the diffusion constant of each particle (<italic>σ<sub>N</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Diffusion model and predictions for different strategies.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fifty simulated trials of the representation of a single memorandum, <italic>x̂</italic><sub>I</sub>, corrupted by a static noise term representing sensory and motor noise (<italic>η<sub>1</sub></italic>) and time-dependent noise (increasing variance corresponding to decreasing memory precision) modeled as Brownian diffusion.

Because of the previously described relationships between <italic>σ<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>, <italic>σ<sub>N</sub><sup>2</sup>,</italic> and <italic>σ<sub>MN</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>, it is therefore also true that (the following constraints were enforced when determining best-fitting values of <italic>A</italic> using data from both Perceived and Computed blocks): (1) in the AtD model, <italic>σ<sub>N</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>=<italic>σ<sub>MN</sub><sup>2</sup>*N<sup>A</sup></italic> (i.e., the diffusion constant describing memory degradation over time for <italic>N</italic> Perceived items held in working memory is proportional to the diffusion constant describing memory degradation over time for the one Computed value held in working memory); and (2) in the DtA model, <italic>σ<sub>MN</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>=<italic>σ<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>*N<sup>A</sup>/N</italic> (i.e., the diffusion constant describing memory degradation over time for <italic>N</italic> Computed items held in working memory is proportional to the diffusion constant describing memory degradation over time for one Perceived item held in working memory). For a given static noise level and <italic>σ<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>, the <italic>A</italic> parameter dictates whether AtD or DtA has a lower <italic>σ<sub>MN</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> and thus results in lower memory loss over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Specifically, when <italic>A</italic>&lt;1, DtA has a lower <italic>σ<sub>MN</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> and less variable responses because the averaging over multiple diffusing items counteracts the greater total noise of having many items. When <italic>A</italic>=1, the additional noise cost of each individual point in DtA exactly balances the effect of averaging, such that AtD and DtA have equal <italic>σ<sub>MN</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> and equal levels of accuracy and thus are indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the models becoming increasingly indistinguishable as A approaches 1). When <italic>A</italic>&gt;1, the additional cost of storing multiple items outweighs the effect of averaging, and AtD produces a lower <italic>σ<sub>MN</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> and less variable responses than DtA.

The different storage strategies result in different patterns of memory degradation, corresponding to trial-to-trial variability (imprecision) of decision reports that increase as a function of the length of the within-trial delay period. For the AtD model, the individual pieces of information are immediately combined into a single decision variable that is then stored in memory. Thus, the rate of degradation of an estimated average is identical to the rate of degradation of a single item. In contrast, for the DtA model, all of the relevant pieces of information are stored in memory and then combined only at the time of indicating the decision. Thus, the rate of degradation of an estimated average is inversely proportional to the rate of degradation of each item held in memory. We used fits of these models to performance data from individual participants to distinguish different patterns of memory degradation and therefore different storage strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Simultaneous condition behavior</title><p>When all disks were presented simultaneously, performance was consistent with several key predictions of the particle model. Specifically, the difference in reports of Perceived spatial angles and the true probed location (i.e., the response error) tended to be unbiased, in that the mean error across participants was not reliably different from 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, full distributions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, individual participant mean errors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the variance of these errors increased roughly linearly over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), like the location of a diffusing particle or bump attractor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kilpatrick, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kilpatrick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laing and Chow, 2001</xref>). This error variance depended systematically on set size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). However, the change in error variance over time (slope of variance increase) did not depend on set size (ANOVA, significant effect of set size, <italic>F</italic>(2,32)=83.87, <italic>p</italic>=1.88e−13, and delay, <italic>F</italic>(2,32)=29.55, <italic>p</italic>=5.37e−08, but no significant interaction between set size and delay, <italic>F</italic>(4,64)=1.36, <italic>p</italic>=0.256). Errors in reports of Computed (i.e., inferred mean) spatial angles relative to true mean angles showed similar trends, albeit with a much weaker dependence on the number of items. Specifically, Computed angle reports were also unbiased (mean error from the true value was not reliably different from 0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>) but degraded (became more variable) with a roughly linear increase in variance over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).

We used these assumptions to validate whether the better-fitting model and best-fit parameters for a given participant at a given set size were likely to produce the participant’s behavior.

When set size is larger than 2, it is possible to perform a hybrid of these strategies. For example, one could diffuse the initial <italic>N</italic>–1 items until the final stimulus is presented and then combine all evidence at that point. Thus, we did an additional log-likelihood comparison using this hybrid model for set size 5 (note that AtD and this hybrid model are identical for set size 2, and all models had the same number of parameters). We found that three participants previously identified as AtD and three participants previously identified as DtA were slightly better described by the hybrid model (average LL difference for formerly DtA participants=0.34, average difference from formerly AtD participants 1.28). This finding is consistent with the idea that people likely use a spectrum of strategies, including nuanced combinations of AtD-like and DtA-like dynamics (which were the focus of the present study, to demonstrate how those dynamics can give rise to identifiable signatures of behavioral errors) that warrant further consideration when building more detailed models of memory-dependent decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Strategy comparisons across conditions</title><p>The use of different strategies (i.e., those captured by the AtD and DtA models) did not appear to reflect a tendency of individual participants to use a particular strategy across different conditions.

We failed to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between a participant’s strategy use across set size for both Simultaneous and Sequential conditions (i.e., strategy use in set size 2 Simultaneous was not predictive of use in set size 5 Simultaneous, nor was it for Sequential conditions; <italic>p</italic>=0.31 and <italic>p</italic>=1, respectively).

In all other tested cases, participants were equally likely to use either strategy, and strategy use was not predictive across conditions for individual participants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The goal of this study was to better understand if and how capacity and temporal limitations of working memory affect human decision-making. We used a task that required participants to report remembered spatial locations based on different numbers of objects and for different delay durations, both of which are known to systematically affect the precision of memory reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oberauer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Panichello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ploner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schneegans and Bays, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White et al., 1994</xref>). We used two pairs of conditions to investigate these effects across decision-making circumstances. The first condition was Perceptual versus Computed, which allowed us to recapitulate previous findings of the effects of capacity and temporal limitations of working memory for directly observed (perceptual) quantities and then extend those findings to the kind of computed quantity that is used as a decision variable for tasks that require integration or averaging to reduce uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brody and Hanks, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ratcliff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shadlen and Shohamy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Summerfield and Tsetsos, 2012</xref>). The second was Simultaneous versus Sequential conditions, which extended our investigation to include the effects of working-memory limitations on decision-making under relatively simple conditions (i.e., when all relevant evidence was presented at once) to the effects in a basic case of evidence accumulation over time (i.e., in which a new piece of evidence is used to update a computed quantity).</p><p>Our primary finding was that computed variables based on either simultaneously or sequentially presented information were susceptible to the same kinds of working-memory constraints as perceived variables. These working-memory limitations corresponded to a decrease in precision over time, which places critical constraints on the kinds of decision variables that are required to persist over time, such as when decisions are delayed. Specifically, the variability caused by singular events such as sensory encoding or averaging tended to be ~10° in Simultaneous conditions, whereas noise accumulating during memory delay periods was typically ~3.5°/s. Therefore, after ~3 s, the noise that can be attributed to memory versus non-memory sources is about equal, and after this point memory noise begins to dominate overall variability. This result appears to contradict previous findings that found no effect of extra delays on the effectiveness of evidence accumulation for certain decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Waskom and Kiani, 2018</xref>). However, those studies used tasks with binary choices that required decision variables with less clear sensitivity to the kinds of working-memory effects we found in the context of a continuous, spatially based decision variable. Additionally, we found that increasing the number of decision-relevant items also decreased the accuracy of the continuous decision variable, although the nature of this effect was variable. More work is needed to fully characterize the conditions under which temporal and capacity limitations on the precision of working-memory representations affect decisions based on those representations.</p><p>We also found that the exact nature of interactions between working-memory limitations and decision-making depend critically on the strategy used to form the decision, and those strategies can vary substantially across individuals and tasks. For our tasks, we focused on two primary strategies. The first strategy, captured by the AtD model, stipulated that a participant first calculates and then stores the Computed value. Its key prediction is that a Computed value should be susceptible to the same effects of working-memory limitations as a single remembered Perceptual value in simultaneous conditions. The second strategy, captured by the DtA model, stipulated that all individual values are stored in working memory until the time of decision. Its key prediction is that the overall rate of variance increase is inversely related to the number of items. Although the differences in performance of adopters of each of the strategies were often minimal in the present study, the differences in strategy rely on rates of degradation over time and thus performance differences would be expected to grow over longer delays. We found that participants tended to use an AtD strategy for the Simultaneous conditions with a relatively high load (five items), but otherwise were roughly equally likely to use either strategy, including for all Sequential conditions.</p><p>This finding of multiple strategy use raises several intriguing future questions. For example, we found that for the Simultaneous condition, several individuals switched from using DtA for the smaller set size to AtD for the larger set size, but we do not know if this switch was a consequence of their personal working-memory capacities. From an optimality standpoint, DtA better preserves a computed value compared to AtD for a given level of non-time-dependent noise and cost per storage item (<italic>A</italic>), but only if <italic>A</italic> remains low (&lt;1). It would be interesting to see if for more intermediate set sizes (i.e., three or four items) there is a reliable increase in the probability of a participant using AtD with a progression that relates to other measures of the individual’s working-memory capacity. Such future studies would more definitively support the conclusion that increased working-memory load corresponds to an increased tendency to discard information about individual samples and hold only the computed decision variable in memory. Future studies should also examine other factors that might govern which strategy is used for a given set of conditions. For example, participants in our study were instructed to report the average but given no additional details about how to do so, nor given strong incentives for choosing any particular strategy versus another. Future studies could provide more detailed instructions, incentives, and/or feedback to better understand the flexibility with which these different strategies can be employed.</p><p>Future work should also examine in more detail several other facets of working memory that were not included in our models but in principle could affect decision variables that are computed and retained over time. First, we did not consider possible differences in metabolic energy and other resources needed to implement the different working-memory demands of different strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van den Berg and Ma, 2018</xref>). Future studies of strategy heterogeneity may need to consider how different strategies minimize both response errors and execution costs. Second, our DtA model assumed no interference between multiple items stored in memory. This assumption is undoubtedly an oversimplification, given that storage of multiple items has been both hypothesized and shown to create attraction and repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). Such directional drift can create a decrease in variance over time that could affect decision variables that involve multiple quantities stored at once. Third, our DtA model also assumed that each item was stored individually. Alternatively, items could have been discarded or merged (chunked) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krishnan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2012</xref>), leading to different memory loads which could also affect performance. Fourth, most of our participants used strategies that were well described by the AtD or DtA model. However, under certain conditions (i.e., Sequential, set size 5) some participants seemed to use hybrid strategies. This kind of strategy would suggest extensive flexibility in when and how evidence is incorporated into computed decision variables, thereby placing potentially complex demands on working memory.</p><p>Both of our primary models were based on assumptions of a drifting memory representation. This random drift is traditionally associated with attractor models of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Macoveanu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2012</xref>) that have been used extensively to describe the underlying neural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shafi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takeda and Funahashi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wimmer et al., 2014</xref>). In these models, neural network activity is induced by an external stimulus and then maintained via excitatory connections of similarly tuned neurons and long-ranged inhibition. Random noise causes the center of this activity (which represents the stimulus) to drift in a manner that, dependent on the implementation, can depend on the delay duration, set size, and/or their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koyluoglu et al., 2017</xref>). A recent implementation even can naturally compute a running average based on sequentially presented information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esnaola-Acebes et al., 2021</xref>). Our results imply that such models should be extended to support the flexible use of different strategies that govern when and how incoming information is used to form such averages. It will be interesting to see if such a flexible model can account for neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which includes neurons with persistent activity that has been associated with both spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Constantinidis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riley and Constantinidis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wimmer et al., 2014</xref>) and the formation of decisions based on an accumulation of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curtis and D’Esposito, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heekeren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heekeren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim and Shadlen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we found that in this spatial, continuous task, participant accuracy for both perceived and computed values was subject to working-memory limitations of both time and capacity. Additionally, we found behavior that was consistent with both the storage strategies we investigated. The fact that different participants employed different strategies for storing a computed value (such as a decision variable) and that these strategies have different consequences on overall accuracy has important implications for not only future neural network models of working memory, but also for future computational models of decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human psychophysics behavioral task</title><p>We tested 17 participants (4 males, 12 females, 1 chose not to answer; age range=22–87 years).

Each participant completed 1–2 sets of four blocks of trials in their own time.</p><p>The basic trial structure is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Each trial began with the presentation of a central white fixation cross (1% of the screen height). The participant was instructed to maintain fixation on this cross when not actively responding. The participant began each trial by placing the mouse over the cross and clicking, to allow for self-pacing and pseudo-fixation. Initiating a trial caused a white annulus of radius 25% of the screen height to appear. A block-specific memory array appeared 250 ms later, centered at an angle chosen uniformly and at random on the annulus. The array consisted of 1, 2, or 5 colored disks sized 1.5% screen in diameter. The angular difference between any two adjacent disks was at least 6°, and between the two most distal disks was at most 60°. The disks from clockwise to counter-clockwise were always presented in the same order: green, red, blue, magenta, and yellow. When fewer than five disks were presented, the latter colors were omitted. The consistent color ordering was intended to reduce errors caused by misbinding of location and color. The angular differences between disks in an array were randomly selected from five preselected sets of five angular differences that obeyed the restrictions stated above, centered on a randomly selected location on the circle. If set size was &lt;5, later numbers were omitted. The sets were [–22, –11, –2, 7, 13], [–25,–4, 6, 12, 24], [–30,–18, 3, 15, 29], [–22,–10, 0, 7, 17], and [–19,–12, 0, 9, 28] (numbers are degrees clockwise relative to the randomly selected location on the circle).</p><p>The memory array remained on the screen for 0.5 s, while the annulus remained on the screen throughout the delay of 0, 1, or 6 s. At the end of the delay, the fixation cross was replaced with a response cue that either matched a color of a disk in the memory array, indicating a response to the remembered location of that disk, or was white, indicating a response to the mean angle of all disks in the present trial. The response type varied by block (see below). The participant then moved the mouse and clicked on the annulus at a position at which they remembered the requested response. Feedback was then given indicating the correct location, the participant’s response, and the difference between the two.</p><p>We used four block-wise conditions: (1) Simultaneous Perceived blocks used arrays of 1, 2, or 5 disks presented simultaneously at the beginning of the trial. Participants were told in advance that they would always be asked to report the location of one of the array disks but were not informed which one until the response period. The probed disk was picked randomly on each trial. (2) Simultaneous Computed blocks used arrays of 2 or 5 disks presented simultaneously at the beginning of the trial. Participants were told in advance they would need to report the average angle of all disks shown in the present trial. (3) Sequential Perceived blocks were identical to Simultaneous Perceived blocks, except only arrays of 2 or 5 disks were used, and all but one of the disks (the counter-clockwise most) was presented at the beginning of the trial.

A Bonferroni-corrected two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test was used to assess whether this mean response error was significantly different from zero across participants for each set size, delay, response type, and temporal presentation.

We chose variance as opposed to other measures of dispersion for consistency with our particle models (see below) in which variance scales linearly with delay. We examined the effects of set size, delay duration, and task context on response variability using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. On Simultaneous Perceived and Computed blocks, we used a 3 (delay duration: 0, 1, or 6 s) × 3 (set size: 1, 2, or 5 disks) within-participant design. On Sequential Perceived blocks, we used a 2 (delay duration: 1 or 6 s) × 3 (set size: 1, 2, or 5 disks) within-participants design for stimuli presented at the beginning of the trial (Early) and a 2 (delay: 0.5 or 3 s) × 2 (set size: 2 or 5 disks) design for stimuli presented halfway through the trial (Late). On Sequential Computed blocks, we used a 2 (delay duration: 1 or 6 s) × 3 (set size: 1, 2, or 5 disks) within-participants design.

To interrogate best fit parameter differences, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to see if the mean difference in best-fit parameter between AtD and DtA participants was significantly different from 0 for both Simultaneous and Sequential conditions. To assess learning effects, a two-sided, paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to see if the mean or standard deviation of error responses in set size 5 Sequential conditions differed between the first and second half of trials (we found no difference at either delay: for 1 s delay p=0.67 and 0.11 for mean and standard deviation, respectively; for 6 s delay p=0.75 and 0.98 for mean and standard deviation, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Model-based analyses</title><p>Our models were based on principles of working memory that are well described by bump-attractor network models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laing and Chow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wimmer et al., 2014</xref>). In such models, stimulus location is represented by a ‘bump’ in activity from neurons tuned to that and similar locations. These neurons recurrently activate each other, maintaining a bump of activity even after stimulus cessation. However, because of the stochastic nature of neural activity and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Faisal et al., 2008</xref>), there is variability in which neurons have the most activity at any given time (and thus are the center of the bump representing the stimulus). This variability in bump center corresponds to variability in the location representation and a degradation of the memory representation over time. The dynamics of this bump can be described as a diffusion process that obeys Brownian motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kilpatrick, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kilpatrick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laing and Chow, 2001</xref>).

We then estimated the empirical diffusion constants for each of these iterations in the same way that we did for our participants, namely by fitting a line to the measured variance of the simulated errors across delays, for each condition and iteration. Our 1000 simulations gave us an expected range around the expected diffusion constant relationships detailed in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ11 equ12 equ13 equ14">Equations 9–12</xref> to compare to our participants’ empirical diffusion constant relationships.

We used the log-likelihoods to determine the best model for each simulation and determined the percentage of correctly identified models. We used these results to further assess the reliability of our analyses of strategy prevalence across the population of participants, as follows. For each condition (Simultaneous vs. Sequential and set size 2 vs. 5), we determined an empirical proportion of AtD versus DtA prevalence (i.e., in terms of the relative numbers of participants whose data were best fit by the two models). We then sampled from a binomial distribution 10,000 times using a range of possible proportions between 0 and 1 in 1/34th increments. Each iteration yielded a simulated proportion, which we then adjusted with our model-identifiability results: each simulated AtD participant had a chance of being misidentified according to average percent correctly identified for that model as determined above, and likewise with DtA. The proportion of samples that matched our data was used to create the probability of obtaining our observed results, given possible underlying proportions and average model identifiability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10b</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Senior editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The task was created with PsychoPy3 and distributed to participants via Pavlovia.com, which allowed participants to perform the task on their home computers after providing informed consent.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tobias Donner as the Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter R Murphy (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Alternative strategies for sequential task.</p><p>The authors claim that some subjects follow the AtD strategy and others the DtA strategy but experimental evidence for this claim seems weak. Take Figure 10 as an example (Figure 6 is similar). The authors conclude from the data in Figure 10 that on the population level there is no significant difference between the models. On an individual subject level, the δ<sub>LL</sub> values are small (for most subjects | δ<sub>LL</sub> | &lt; 3) which one could interpret as either model fitting the data equally well.</p><p>In order to claim that there are indeed two different strategies in place, it needs to be shown that the data can only be explained by heterogeneous strategies (for example following a methodology as in Stephan et al. Neurimage 2009 and Rigoux et al. Neuroimage 2014).</p><p>Regarding the sequential task: It may be worth considering a mixed strategy model as an alternative because it may explain the data better. Specifically, subjects would follow the DtA strategy until the last stimulus is observed and then switch to the AtD strategy until the end of the delay (i.e., compute the average in the middle of the trial, once all the evidence has been observed).</p><p>2) Appropriateness of modeling choices.</p><p>The A parameter, governing the relationship between the diffusion constant for a single point and the constants for multiple points, seems estimated differently in AtD and DtA models: in AtD, it's estimated using only data from Perceived blocks with set size &gt; 1, and it plays no role in the AtD process (only, instead, in the memory maintenance process during the delay period of Perceived trials); whereas in DtA, it's estimate using data from both the same Perceived blocks, ‘and’ the Compute blocks at equivalent set sizes. This raises two concerns.</p><p>i. Because A parameters in each model are effectively fit to different data, any comparison of the parameter estimates (which is invited by placing them in same table and by some of the discussion in the text [p.9]) needs to be carefully qualified in the associated text.</p><p>ii. There is an implicit assumption that the A parameter is fixed across Perceived and Computed blocks. However, Perceived trials with set size &gt; 1 require working memory maintenance of a ‘conjunction’ of stimulus features (location and colour), whereas the latter require maintenance (assuming the DtA process is employed) of only a single feature per stimulus (location); thus, it can reasonably be expected that the effect of load may be more severe in Perceived than Computed blocks. It seems that this possibility is not allowed for in the presented model fits.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><p>a. The above concerns could be addressed by fitting another round of models, this time fitting A in the DtA model using data from only Computed blocks.</p><p>b. In addition, A estimates should be compared between fits of the AtD and DtA models (something that is not possible given the fits as currently presented): if there is a systematic difference between the two, this would indicate that A is indeed different in Perceived and Computed blocks and this should be accounted for in the fits.</p><p>3) Implications of model fits.</p><p>The implications of strategy choice could be further illuminated by examining what factors if any (overall accuracy of judgments; magnitude of non-time-dependent model parameters) differentiate AtD and DtA adopters. Further clarification of what differentiates working memory from decision computations on the presented tasks could be achieved by addressing the following questions through further analysis and/or discussion: How should the decision-specific (eta<sub>MN</sub>) parameters be interpreted in the context of other prominent models of decision-making? How does their magnitude compare to other noise sources? Does this speak to the question of whether the predominant source of noise in decision-making is sensory-/motor- or memory-related or related the decision computation itself?</p><p>4) Clarity of presentation.</p><p>The Results section is difficult read, and several key aspects of the approach and findings are only clarified during careful reading of the Methods section. Most prominently, there is insufficient explanation of key model predictions that may be counterintuitive for many readers; a lack of clarity around what individual model parameters capture; and confusing elements to how the model fits are presented. We encourage the authors to carefully revise the Results section with this concern in mind.</p><p>Specific recommendations:</p><p>a. Implications of AtD vs DtA strategy choice:</p><p>The fact that, all else being equal, the DtA strategy generates ‘more’ precise behaviour on Computed trials than the AtD model (at least for the parameter range human participants seem to occupy here) is the central feature that differentiates behaviour produced by the two strategies and renders the models identifiable. The authors also seem to take the direction of this effect to be self-evident, as no effort is made to explain to the reader why this pattern emerges. For instance, readers may wonder whether allowing for N = [2, 5] sources of gaussian noise compared to only 1 source should actually produce ‘more’ variability in behaviour. Now, the averaging over particles that takes place at the culmination of the DtA process counteracts the greater total noise to produce less variability in behavioural reports. But this was far from self-evident, and this key effect should be unpacked.</p><p>b. Model parameter descriptions:</p><p>There seems to be a general lack of clarity around what exactly each model parameter, and in particular different subscripts to different parameters, are supposed to capture. In Figure 2, for example, subscripts N, MN, 1, N(E/L) and MNSeq are all used but only explained in Methods.</p><p>c. Alternative strategy interpretation. (see also point 3):</p><p>Please clarify what exactly the finding is, because this currently seems ambiguous: Compare line 244 &quot;(…) participants had roughly equal tendencies to use either of the two strategies&quot; implying that we can distinguish which strategy individual subjects are following, vs. line 257 &quot;(…) neither of which was more likely than the other for a given participant&quot; which implies the opposite.</p><p>d. Model fitting procedures (see also point 2):</p><p>The role of the A parameter in the different fits is confusing, specifically, seeing fits of A for the AtD model since, this parameter does not seem to used at all in the AtD process. If our understanding is correct, the A parameter in these fits is only relevant to producing behavior in Perceived blocks with set size &gt; 1 – a condition of the experiment to which the AtD process is never actually applied. But at no point is this made explicit, leaving room for quite considerable confusion when the reader encounters this important section of the Results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Strategy-dependent effects of working-memory limitations on human perceptual decision-making&quot; for further consideration by eLife. Your revised article has been evaluated by Michael Frank (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Both reviewers were overall very positive about your revisions and felt that the manuscript is much more accessible now. Both support publication in eLife.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address one outstanding clarification question by Reviewer #1, with which Reviewer #2 agreed. Rather than summarizing, we paste the original reviewer point below. Once this point is addressed, the paper can be accepted without additional review.</p><p>I only have one lingering point of confusion that I would welcome clarification on. This again centres around treatment of the A parameter in the AtD model. The authors write in the current manuscript (p.7) that in this model &quot;the average is calculated immediately upon observing the evidence and then stored as a single particle in working memory&quot; (lines 95-96) and then &quot;the single estimate held in working memory diffuses with the same diffusion constant as a single perceived item (σMN<sup>2</sup> = σ1<sup>2</sup>) (lines 97-99). Based on this my understanding is that there is only ever one particle diffusing in the AtD model during Computed blocks, regardless of set size; this particle always has the same diffusion constant (σ1<sup>2</sup>), and there is, therefore, ‘no role’ for set size/the A parameter in determining diffusion noise during Computed-block memory maintenance in the AtD model. Why, then, is it later written that &quot;Because of the previously described relationships between σ1<sup>2</sup>, σN<sup>2</sup>, and σMN<sup>2</sup> it is therefore also true that in the AtD model σN<sup>2</sup> = σMN<sup>2</sup> * N<sup>A</sup>&quot; (lines 109-110)? Given the earlier sentences, the only way I can see this being true is if N here refers to the number of ‘particles’ being maintained in memory (which, in the AtD model, is always equal to 1, and so the N<sup>A</sup> term is doing no work here and just causes considerable confusion) – and not the set size presented to the participant, as N is consistently used to denote elsewhere in the paper. I'm sorry if I'm missing something here, but this seems a key conceptual point to get right for clear presentation and differentiation between the two models. The new Table 1, and my careful reading of the Methods, seems consistent with my own intuition that A plays no role on Computed blocks in the AtD model. But this seems fundamentally inconsistent with the equation emphasized on lines 109-110; and indeed with the authors' response to point 2 in the first round of reviews, which I must confess I did not understand.</p><p>Now, assuming my own interpretation is correct, and that indeed the A parameter is not doing any work on Computed blocks in the AtD model (instead, in this model it only serves to set the diffusion noise across different set sizes in ‘Perceived’ blocks), then I stand by my initial point that without clarification, it is misleading to include and invite comparison of fitted A parameters for the AtD and DtA models in the same table (new Table 2). In one case (AtD) the A parameter only captures (and in turn, will only be constrained by) behaviour in Perceived blocks; in the other (DtA) it captures (and is constrained by) behaviour in both Perceived and Computed blocks. But currently, this is never made explicit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I thank the authors for engaging well with all comments and suggestions from the first round of reviews. In my opinion the new draft – including more detailed explanation of the models and their predictions early on – is a lot more accessible. I also found the new model identifiability analyses to be quite convincing, in the sense that they provide further evidence to support the claim the distinct strategies are indeed being used by different participants and that while the specifically identified proportions are subject to quite some uncertainty (especially for low set sizes), this key result is nonetheless recoverable given the data at the authors' disposal. Altogether, these additions reaffirm my initial impression that this manuscript is a valuable contribution to the field, breaking new ground in connecting working memory and decision-making.</p><p>I only have one lingering point of confusion that I would welcome clarification on.

We investigated the use of this analysis by running our log likelihoods through the VBA toolbox. For the Simultaneous set size 5 and both Sequential data sets, the VBA agreed with our conclusions: of a greater frequency of AtD use in set size 5 and heterogeneous populations for both sequential conditions. However, for Simultaneous set size 2, the VBA suggested that there was a significantly greater frequency of AtD subjects than DtA subjects, in contrast to our finding that 8 subjects were best described by AtD and 9 by DtA (though one was not considered well fit). To try to better understand this discrepancy, we simulated 100 rounds of task performance using the parameters and models that were best fit to data from our subject population. Thus, for this simulated data set we knew the true underlying distribution of parameters and models. We then ran the VBA on data generated from these simulations. For our set size 2 Simultaneous simulations, we found that the VBA consistently overestimated the proportion of AtD subjects compared to the ground truth. We include a summary of these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. We concluded that VBA was not an effective way to reliably recover population distributions and therefore chose not to include these analyses in our revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Results of VBA simulations compared to known ground truth.</title><p>a.

We quantified model identifiability as the percent of simulated data for which the correct model had a lower negative log likelihood than the alternative. We now report these results for Simultaneous conditions in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1. We then used these identifiability results to run simulations of different underlying model-use proportions. For 10000 iterations of each sampled underlying model-use proportion (using values that ranged between 0 and 1 in 1/34 steps), we sampled 17 subjects and assigned them each a model (AtD or DtA) according to the given model-use proportion. We then used our model-identifiability results to reverse the model assignments according to our estimated probability of misidentifying each model. We used these percentages to calculate the probability of obtaining our results for different “true” underlying proportions of model prevalence given average model identifiability to supplement our log likelihood difference results. The results, presented in Figures 6b and 10b, support our conclusions that: (1) for the Simultaneous condition, more subjects used AtD for set size 5 versus set size 2; and (2) for the Sequential condition, roughly equal numbers of subjects used each strategy type for the two set sizes. The probability functions are also peaked near the underlying observed distributions, indicating that average model identifiability was sufficiently high to prevent the observed participant distribution from being observed by random chance due to misidentification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the sequential task: It may be worth considering a mixed strategy model as an alternative because it may explain the data better.

For set size 2, this suggested model is identical to AtD (because there is only one point to diffuse until the last stimulus is observed) and was thus not investigated further. In contrast, for set size 5, the suggested model is distinct, if not quite as separable from the existing two models. We include a new section (lines 353–367) reporting that when this model is included in the model selection process, 3 former AtD subjects and 3 former DtA subjects are (slightly) better fit by this hybrid. This result suggests that for more complex decision-making scenarios, a more nuanced spectrum of strategies may be in use.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Appropriateness of modeling choices.</p><p>The A parameter -- governing the relationship between the diffusion constant for a single point and the constants for multiple points -- seems estimated differently in AtD and DtA models: in AtD, it's estimated using only data from Perceived blocks with set size &gt; 1, and it plays no role in the AtD process (only, instead, in the memory maintenance process during the delay period of Perceived trials); whereas in DtA, it's estimate using data from both the same Perceived blocks, ‘and’ the Compute blocks at equivalent set sizes. This raises two concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret the confusion and have clarified in the revised manuscript that the <italic>A</italic> parameter, which describes the relationship between the diffusion constants for Perceived set size 1 and set size <italic>N</italic>, is fit to the same data for the two models: each time we fit the parameter using trials of all possible delays from Perceived set size 1, set size <italic>N</italic>, and Computed set size <italic>N</italic> (revised manuscript lines 155-156).</p><p>To further clarify, the main difference between the two models is that: 1) the AtD model enforces relationships between the diffusion constants for Perceived set size 1 and Computed set size <italic>N</italic>, and thus the <italic>A</italic> parameter also describes the relationship between the diffusion constants for Perceived set size <italic>N</italic> and Computed set size <italic>N</italic>; whereas 2) the DtA model enforces relationships between the diffusion constants for Perceived set size <italic>N</italic> and Computed set size <italic>N</italic>, and thus the <italic>A</italic> parameter also describes the relationship between the diffusion constants for Perceived set size 1 and [Computed set size <italic>N</italic>]’<italic>N</italic> (because the Computed diffusion constant is defined in DtA as 1/<italic>N</italic><sup>th</sup> the Diffusion constant for Perceived set size <italic>N</italic>) (lines 107-109). Accordingly, estimates of the <italic>A</italic> parameter are obtained using all of the aforementioned trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i. Because A parameters in each model are effectively fit to different data, any comparison of the parameter estimates (which is invited by placing them in same table and by some of the discussion in the text [p.9]) needs to be carefully qualified in the associated text.</p></disp-quote><p>See above; we clarified in the text that the <italic>A</italic> parameters for each model are fit to the same data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. There is an implicit assumption that the A parameter is fixed across Perceived and Computed blocks. However, Perceived trials with set size &gt; 1 require working memory maintenance of a ‘conjunction’ of stimulus features (location and colour), whereas the latter require maintenance (assuming the DtA process is employed) of only a single feature per stimulus (location); thus, it can reasonably be expected that the effect of load may be more severe in Perceived than Computed blocks. It seems that this possibility is not allowed for in the presented model fits.</p></disp-quote><p>See below for responses to the specific recommendations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations:</p><p>a. The above concerns could be addressed by fitting another round of models, this time fitting A in the DtA model using data from only Computed blocks.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion. We tested and report in the revised manuscript (lines 164–169) that there is no statistically significant difference when comparing best-fitting values of <italic>A</italic> estimated from Perceived blocks alone versus Computed blocks alone for DtA participants. Therefore, there is no evidence that the memory load (as captured by <italic>A</italic>) was affected by the requirements of conjunction in the Perceived vs the Computed blocks.</p><p>We also now note (Figure 1 legend, Methods: 508–509) that we used a consistent ordering of the colors of the disks to minimize any extra memory load caused by the conjunction of location and color and balance memory load between Perceived and Computed blocks (as measured by <italic>A</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. In addition, A estimates should be compared between fits of the AtD and DtA models (something that is not possible given the fits as currently presented): if there is a systematic difference between the two, this would indicate that A is indeed different in Perceived and Computed blocks and this should be accounted for in the fits.</p></disp-quote><p>We now report (Table 2, Table 3) that best-fitting values of <italic>A</italic> were slightly higher for DtA versus AtD subjects, although the difference was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) only for set size=5 Simultaneous. It is certainly true that our models do not capture all aspects of each participant’s strategy, but we still believe that the distinction of DtA versus AtD strategies parameterized in this way provides a parsimonious account of the primary strategy classes that they used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Implications of model fits.</p><p>The implications of strategy choice could be further illuminated by examining what factors if any (overall accuracy of judgments; magnitude of non-time-dependent model parameters) differentiate AtD and DtA adopters. Further clarification of what differentiates working memory from decision computations on the presented tasks could be achieved by addressing the following questions through further analysis and/or discussion: How should the decision-specific (eta<sub>MN</sub>) parameters be interpreted in the context of other prominent models of decision-making? How does their magnitude compare to other noise sources? Does this speak to the question of whether the predominant source of noise in decision-making is sensory-/motor- or memory-related or related the decision computation itself?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion. We now include an additional analysis of the factors that differentiate performance and parameters of AtD and DtA adopters. In brief, we found a significant performance difference in terms of the variability of responses for the average of AtD and DtA adopters at set size 2, delay 6, simultaneous conditions. These comparisons are now reported in lines: 172–174 and Table 2 for Simultaneous parameters, 211–216 for Simultaneous variability over conditions, 286–287 and Table 3 for sequential parameters, and 332–334 for sequential variability over conditions.</p><p>Regarding the broader questions about the decision-making/sensory/motor/memory related noise sources, we do not feel that our current study design is best suited to address these concerns. Eta<sub>MN</sub> represents all static (i.e., not diffusion-dependent) noise sources that affected the participants’ decisions. This term thus captures a combination of initial sensory cue location, motor, and averaging (decision) noise. The individual contribution of these different noise sources is difficult to disentangle given our study design. We found that eta<sub>MN</sub> was typically ~10°, whereas σ<sup>2</sup><sub>MN</sub> was ~3–4 °/second. As a consequence, after ~3 sec the majority of the response variability can be attributed to diffusion rather than the other factors, which we now note in the discussion (lines 403–407). Other studies, such as Drugowitsch et al. 2016, are more specifically designed to disentangle the different components of these non-diffusion-dependent noise sources.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Clarity of presentation.</p><p>The Results section is difficult read, and several key aspects of the approach and findings are only clarified during careful reading of the Methods section. Most prominently, there is insufficient explanation of key model predictions that may be counterintuitive for many readers; a lack of clarity around what individual model parameters capture; and confusing elements to how the model fits are presented. We encourage the authors to carefully revise the Results section with this concern in mind.</p><p>Specific recommendations:</p><p>a. Implications of AtD vs DtA strategy choice:</p><p>The fact that, all else being equal, the DtA strategy generates ‘more’ precise behaviour on Computed trials than the AtD model (at least for the parameter range human participants seem to occupy here) is the central feature that differentiates behaviour produced by the two strategies and renders the models identifiable. The authors also seem to take the direction of this effect to be self-evident, as no effort is made to explain to the reader why this pattern emerges. For instance, readers may wonder whether allowing for N = [2, 5] sources of gaussian noise compared to only 1 source should actually produce ‘more’ variability in behaviour. Now, the averaging over particles that takes place at the culmination of the DtA process counteracts the greater total noise to produce less variability in behavioural reports. But this was far from self-evident, and this key effect should be unpacked.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. We have revised the manuscript substantially to address this issue. We now include a new subsection near the beginning of results entitled “Diffusing-Particle Framework and Predictions” that provides intuitions, descriptions, and justifications of our modeling choices. We have also added a table that includes a description of the model parameters and relationships (Table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Model parameter descriptions:</p><p>There seems to be a general lack of clarity around what exactly each model parameter, and in particular different subscripts to different parameters, are supposed to capture. In Figure 2, for example, subscripts N, MN, 1, N(E/L) and MNSeq are all used but only explained in Methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded and clarified our descriptions of the model parameters in the Results section, including descriptions of all of the subscripts. We have also added Table 1 for easy reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Alternative strategy interpretation. (see also point 3):</p><p>Please clarify what exactly the finding is, because this currently seems ambiguous: Compare line 244 &quot;(…) participants had roughly equal tendencies to use either of the two strategies&quot; implying that we can distinguish which strategy individual subjects are following, vs. line 257 &quot;(…) neither of which was more likely than the other for a given participant&quot; which implies the opposite.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We now make it clear that: 1) we can distinguish the two strategies (except when <italic>A</italic>=1), and 2) under some conditions the two strategies had roughly equal prevalence across our participants. The ambiguous sentence has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Model fitting procedures (see also point 2):</p><p>The role of the A parameter in the different fits is confusing, specifically, seeing fits of A for the AtD model since, this parameter does not seem to used at all in the AtD process. If our understanding is correct, the A parameter in these fits is only relevant to producing behavior in Perceived blocks with set size &gt; 1 – a condition of the experiment to which the AtD process is never actually applied. But at no point is this made explicit, leaving room for quite considerable confusion when the reader encounters this important section of the Results.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to point 2 and Specific Recommendations for point 4a. We have made major revisions to the text to make sure the procedure for determining <italic>A</italic> is clear.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address one outstanding clarification question by Reviewer #1, with which Reviewer #2 agreed. Rather than summarizing, we paste the original reviewer point below. Once this point is addressed, the paper can be accepted without additional review.</p><p>I only have one lingering point of confusion that I would welcome clarification on. This again centres around treatment of the A parameter in the AtD model. The authors write in the current manuscript (p.7) that in this model &quot;the average is calculated immediately upon observing the evidence and then stored as a single particle in working memory&quot; (lines 95-96) and then &quot;the single estimate held in working memory diffuses with the same diffusion constant as a single perceived item (σMN<sup>2</sup> = σ1<sup>2</sup>) (lines 97-99). Based on this my understanding is that there is only ever one particle diffusing in the AtD model during Computed blocks, regardless of set size; this particle always has the same diffusion constant (σ1<sup>2</sup>), and there is, therefore, ‘no role’ for set size/the A parameter in determining diffusion noise during Computed-block memory maintenance in the AtD model. Why, then, is it later written that &quot;Because of the previously described relationships between σ1<sup>2</sup>, σN<sup>2</sup>, and σMN<sup>2</sup> it is therefore also true that in the AtD model σN<sup>2</sup> = σMN<sup>2</sup> * N<sup>A</sup>&quot; (lines 109-110)? Given the earlier sentences, the only way I can see this being true is if N here refers to the number of ‘particles’ being maintained in memory (which, in the AtD model, is always equal to 1, and so the N<sup>A</sup> term is doing no work here and just causes considerable confusion) – and not the set size presented to the participant, as N is consistently used to denote elsewhere in the paper. I'm sorry if I'm missing something here, but this seems a key conceptual point to get right for clear presentation and differentiation between the two models. The new Table 1, and my careful reading of the Methods, seems consistent with my own intuition that A plays no role on Computed blocks in the AtD model. But this seems fundamentally inconsistent with the equation emphasized on lines 109-110; and indeed with the authors' response to point 2 in the first round of reviews, which I must confess I did not understand.</p><p>Now, assuming my own interpretation is correct, and that indeed the A parameter is not doing any work on Computed blocks in the AtD model (instead, in this model it only serves to set the diffusion noise across different set sizes in ‘Perceived’ blocks), then I stand by my initial point that without clarification, it is misleading to include and invite comparison of fitted A parameters for the AtD and DtA models in the same table (new Table 2). In one case (AtD) the A parameter only captures (and in turn, will only be constrained by) behaviour in Perceived blocks; in the other (DtA) it captures (and is constrained by) behaviour in both Perceived and Computed blocks. But currently, this is never made explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers wish us to clarify the role of the <italic>A</italic> parameter, particularly with regards to the AtD strategy in Computed blocks. We regret the confusion and very much appreciate the careful reading and the opportunity to clarify this important point.</p><p>It is true that <italic>A</italic> is not directly relevant to the execution of the AtD strategy in the Computed condition, because only one value (the average) is remembered. However, <italic>A</italic> is relevant to determining the best-fitting AtD diffusion constant for a Computed item (σ<sub>MN</sub><sup>2</sup>), because in AtD, A governs the relationship between the diffusion constant of N Perceived items held in memory (σ<sub>N</sub><sup>2</sup>) and one Computed item held in memory (σ<sub>MN</sub><sup>2</sup>): σ<sub>N</sub><sup>2</sup> = σ<sub>MN</sub><sup>2</sup> * N<sup>A</sup>. Our fitting procedure therefore determined the best-fitting value of <italic>A</italic> per participant and set size by finding the value that best enforced this relationship between data from Perceived and Computed blocks. These points are now clarified in lines 109–116.</p><p>To further clarify the reviewer’s specific comments: (1) in the above relationship, <italic>N</italic> continues to refer to the set size and number of particles being maintained; and (2) because <italic>A</italic> was determined from both Perceived and Computed data for both AtD and DtA fits, we believe the comparisons we present are useful.</p></body></sub-article></article>
