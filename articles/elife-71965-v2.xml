However, the targets, impact, and dynamic of these afferents are still unclear. How BF synaptic inputs modulate activity in diverse subtypes of periglomerular (PG) interneurons using optogenetic stimulation and loose cell-attached or whole-cell patch-clamp recording in OB slices from adult mice were studied in this article. GABAergic BF inputs potently blocked PG cells firing except in a minority of calretinin-expressing cells in which GABA release elicited spiking. Parallel cholinergic projections excited a previously overlooked PG cell subtype via synaptic activation of M1 muscarinic receptors. Low-frequency stimulation of the cholinergic axons drove persistent firing in these PG cells, thereby increasing tonic inhibition in principal neurons. Taken together, these findings suggest that modality-specific BF inputs can orchestrate synaptic inhibition in OB glomeruli using multiple, potentially independent, inhibitory or excitatory target-specific pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd>basal forebrain</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>periglomerular cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003768</institution-id><institution>Université de Strasbourg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UPR3212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Saint Jan</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UPR3212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Saint Jan</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Muscarinic excitation of a previously ignored subtype of periglomerular interneuron in the olfactory bulb by endogenous synaptic release of acetylcholine.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Basal forebrain (BF) nuclei innervate many regions of the brain, including the entire neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus, with diffuse long-range projections releasing GABA, ACh, and, more rarely, glutamate. These projections provide cues about the behavioral context and internal state of the animal. They modulate multiple synaptic, cellular, and network processes at a variety of temporal and spatial scales, thereby regulating sensory perception, metabolic functions such as food intake, brain states, and important cognitive functions, including attention, arousal, memory or learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The olfactory bulb (OB), the first region that processes olfactory information in the brain, receives massive cholinergic and GABAergic BF projections that principally originate in the nucleus of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) and in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus (MCPO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Záborszky et al., 1986</xref>).

How ACh modulates these behavioral demands is less clear. Cholinergic axons innervate all layers of the OB and preferentially form synapses on inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamamoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kasa et al., 1995</xref>). Yet, a sparse subclass of deep short-axon cells in the internal plexiform layer is the only synaptic target of BF cholinergic axons known to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Case et al., 2017</xref>). Deep short-axon cells are few compared to granule cells and periglomerular (PG) cells, the two prevalent classes of GABAergic interneurons in the OB. Moreover, cholinergic synapses are particularly abundant in the glomerular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamamoto et al., 2017</xref>), where muscarinic receptors exert a strong control on intraglomerular inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that PG cells are another likely target of cholinergic axons.</p><p>BF GABAergic afferents innervate all layers of the OB at least as densely as cholinergic axons, but only a few studies have examined their function in odor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Böhm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nunez-Parra et al., 2013</xref>). This is a difficult question because BF GABAergic afferents innervate many types of interneurons, including granule and PG cells, which inhibit principal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nunez-Parra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanz Diez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Villar et al., 2021</xref>), as well as deep short-axon cells, which inhibit granule and PG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Case et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanz Diez et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, depending on their target, BF GABAergic inputs may inhibit or disinhibit principal neurons. Moreover, BF GABAergic inputs have target-specific release properties, suggesting that they arise from distinct populations of BF GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanz Diez et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, the effect on principal neurons may be hard to predict as GABA is excitatory in some PG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parsa et al., 2015</xref>) and can be co-released along with ACh from cholinergic terminals. Co-transmission of the two transmitters occurs onto deep short-axon cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Case et al., 2017</xref>), but it remains unclear whether co-release is systematic in the OB as it is in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takács et al., 2018</xref>) or target-specific as in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desikan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In such complex context, an important step towards understanding the influence and function of the BF inputs in the OB is to investigate the connections, temporal dynamics, and functional impact of each BF pathway. Recent papers have examined BF GABAergic inputs onto granule cells and their influence on adult-born granule cells survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanson et al., 2020</xref>), the firing of principal neurons, and low-field potential rhythmic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Villar et al., 2021</xref>). Here, I examined how synaptic release of GABA and ACh from BF fibers modulates the activity of the various PG cells. PG cells are small axonless GABAergic interneurons with dendritic projections in a single glomerulus. Collectively, they regulate glutamate release from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murphy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shao et al., 2009</xref>), as well as spike timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geramita and Urban, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Najac et al., 2015</xref>) and respiration-coupled theta rhythms in output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukunaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Villar et al., 2021</xref>). PG cells are classified into two broad classes with largely similar morphologies but distinct excitatory inputs: type 1 PG cells receive direct excitatory inputs from OSNs, whereas type 2 PG cells are not connected to OSNs and receive glutamatergic inputs from the dendrites of mitral and tufted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shao et al., 2009</xref>). In our previous study, we have shown that BF GABAergic inputs are an additional criterion that differentiate PG cell subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanz Diez et al., 2019</xref>). This is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. First, BF GABAergic neurons contact type 2 PG cells but not type 1 PG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, BF GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) have target-specific time courses in three classes of type 2 PG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) that also differ on the basis of their olfactory nerve (ON)-evoked excitatory response, firing properties, and molecular markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For clarity, I hereafter introduce a new nomenclature and call these three classes type 2.1, type 2.2, and type 2.3 PG cells. Type 2.1 cells correspond to the most abundant calretinin (CR)-expressing PG cells. They conserve intrinsic properties of immature neurons, that is, they have a remarkably high membrane resistance (&gt;1 GΩ, usually higher than in other PG cells), they do not fire or fire at most a single and often small action potential, they receive little excitatory inputs, and their output is uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fogli Iseppe et al., 2016</xref>). Type 2.2 cells are labeled in the Kv3.1-eYFP mouse and include calbindin (CB)-positive as well as CB-negative cells. They receive short bursts of excitatory inputs from mitral and tufted cells and, in turn, indiscriminately release GABA onto these principal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Najac et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, type 2.3 PG cells are a previously ignored subclass of regularly firing PG cells with no known chemical marker, remarkably slow BF IPSCs, and distinctive prolonged ON-evoked plurisynaptic excitatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanz Diez et al., 2019</xref>).

This photostimulation induced a significant increase in baseline spike frequency in 7% of the PG cells tested (n = 23/350). No other kind of response was observed. It is noteworthy, however, that more than half of the cells tested were silent or fired only rarely. A cholinergic input may simply be unnoticeable in these cells using LCA spike recording. Responsive PG cells had a low baseline spiking activity in control condition (range 0–6 Hz, mean 1.2 ± 1.6 Hz, n = 14) and switched to a higher-frequency firing mode (mean frequency 5.3 ± 2.7 Hz, n = 14) as soon as low-frequency photostimulations started.

Spike rate increased on average threefold compared to baseline activity (from 2.2 ± 2.1 Hz before the flash to 6.6 ± 3.3 Hz after the flash, n = 21, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), peaked about 1 s after the flash, and returned to baseline frequency after about 5–10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Thus, transient temporally and spatially precise synaptic release of ACh from BF cholinergic axons strongly excites a subset of PG cells via the activation of mAChRs. The principal focus of this study is on this previously unknown cholinergic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PG cells excited by a muscarinic input also receive an inhibitory GABAergic input from separate BF neurons</title><p>Nearly all cholinergic neurons in the BF express the molecular machinery to both synthetize and package GABA into synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>). Synaptic co-transmission of GABA from cholinergic axons would be expected to block or reduce spiking if GABA is inhibitory. If GABA is excitatory, co-release of GABA would be expected to trigger spikes even in the presence of AChR antagonists. None of these possible GABAergic responses was seen in ChAT mice, suggesting that GABA is not co-transmitted together with ACh.

In OB slices from dlx5/6 mice, 0.5 Hz photostimulations affected post-stimulus spiking activity in 30% of the cells tested (116/383). Responses were heterogeneous, but three clearly distinct types of responses were evoked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>): 12% of the cells tested (45/383) responded with a transient inhibition of spiking immediately after the stimulation, as expected for a classical inhibitory input (see also Figure 8). 7% of the cells responded with a brief excitation (29/383 cells), that is, the photostimulation induced a single spike, sometimes two (see also Figure 9). Finally, 11% of the cells (42/383 cells) responded with a transient inhibition of spiking after each flash and with a robust and long-lasting increase in baseline firing rate as soon as low-frequency photostimulations started. This last group of cells with dual responses likely correspond to those receiving a muscarinic excitation. Consistent with this, a single flash evoked a robust and long-lasting increase in firing rate in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), similar to in ChAT mice. This excitation persisted in the presence of NBQX, D-AP5, and mecamylamine and was blocked by atropine (n = 7) or scopolamine (n = 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). However, contrasting with the exclusive excitatory muscarinic responses in ChAT mice, spiking was also transiently blocked after the photostimulation. PG cells with these dual responses had a low and irregular firing activity in control condition (range 0–4 Hz, mean 1.95 ± 1.6 Hz, n = 13) and switched to a sustained higher-frequency firing mode upon the 0.5 Hz low-frequency photostimulations in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (mean 8.6 ± 3 Hz, n = 13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). This sustained spiking regime was also induced when low-frequency stimulations were done in the presence of NBQX, D-AP5, and mecamylamine (n = 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). When delivered every 2 s, each flash was followed by a period of spiking inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). Photo-evoked spiking inhibition lasted 391 ± 142 ms (n = 21), persisted in the presence of NBQX, D-AP5, and mecamylamine (n = 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>), and was blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist gabazine (5 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>).

Only one cell with the muscarinic excitatory response lacked the GABAergic component in dlx5/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although rare, this single case confirms that the cholinergic neurons stimulated in dlx5/6 mice do not co-transmit ACh and GABA. Altogether, the results are consistent with previous investigations demonstrating that although BF cholinergic neurons express molecular markers of GABAergic neurons, only a fraction of them co-releases GABA and ACh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>). They further indicate that a subset of PG cells receives both ACh and GABA inputs from separate BF axons.

To understand the mechanism underlying photo-evoked muscarinic excitation, I re-examined this question using a slightly different K-gluconate-based internal solution supplemented with phosphocreatine to improve ATP supply. PG cells receiving a muscarinic input were first identified using LCA spike recording and then WC patched with a pipette filled with the new internal solution (n = 5 cells in ChAT mice and n = 12 in dlx5/6 mice). In dlx5/6 mice, a single photostimulation evoked a biphasic response initiated by an outward IPSC followed by a slow-rising inward current in 7/12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The slow EPSC was undetectable in five other cells. In ChAT mice, BF axons photostimulation induced a slow inward EPSC in 5/5 cells. Consistent with the LCA experiments, the slow inward current was not preceded by an outward IPSC, further confirming that cholinergic axons do not release GABA on these PG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In both transgenic lines, photo-evoked muscarinic EPSCs recorded at negative holding potentials (from –30 to –60 mV) were small and often at the limit of detection (max 10 pA, mean 5 ± 3 pA, data obtained in ChAT and dlx5/6 mice pooled together).

In addition to the 17 WC-recorded cells from ChAT and dlx5/6 mice, the dataset included WC recordings from previous experiments in dlx5/6 mice in which a photo-evoked muscarinic excitation was noticed in the cell-attached configuration but not detected in the WC mode (n = 9). The morphology of each cell was assessed at the end of the recording by visual inspection of the dye present in the internal solution. Moreover, six cells filled with biocytin were successfully recovered for post-hoc morphological reconstruction. All had the typical morphology of PG cells. Their soma was small, ovoid, or round, with no apparent axon. Thin dendrites projected within a single glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>). On average, their electrical membrane resistance was 1061 ± 524 MΩ. They all fired regularly at up to 100 Hz with overshooting action potentials in response to depolarizing current steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>). Another striking hallmark of these PG cells was their prolonged response to a single electrical stimulation of the ONs. ON-evoked response consisted of a barrage of fast EPSCs lasting several hundreds of ms (average 1760 ± 927 ms, n = 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Membrane properties and ON-evoked responses were examined when possible to identify each cell type. Photostimulation of the BF fibers did not evoke any response in type 1 PG cells (n = 4), type 2.1 PG cells (n = 21), and type 2.2 PG cells (n = 17). 12 additional PG cells that could not be firmly classified did not respond either. Only one PG cell, which could not be unambiguously classified, responded with a fast IPSC, a rare event that possibly reflected unspecific expression of ChR2 in BF GABAergic neurons. Together, these results indicate that BF cholinergic axons innervating the glomerular layer of the OB have a unique and selective synaptic target among PG cells and do not release GABA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>M1 mAChR mediates the muscarinic excitation</title><p>Next, I determined what muscarinic receptor mediates the cholinergic response in type 2.3 PG cells and what downstream mechanism produces the excitation. There are five types of mAChRs, and three of those (M1, M3, and M5) are coupled to excitatory G<sub>q/11</sub> proteins that activate PLCβ, causing hydrolysis of PIP2 into DAG and IP3. Activation of these receptors most often depolarizes neurons. M1 receptors are widely expressed in the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le Jeune et al., 1995</xref>) and their blockage impairs olfactory-evoked fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ross et al., 2019</xref>), making them a likely candidate. To test this hypothesis, I examined the effects of pirenzepine (1–2 µM), a selective antagonist of M1 receptors, on BF-induced muscarinic excitation in both ChAT (n = 3 cells) and dlx5/6 mice (n = 7). Experiments were done using LCA recording in the presence of glutamate and nicotinic receptor antagonists. Pirenzepine fully blocked the excitation evoked by light stimulation of the BF fibers in six cells and reduced its strength in four cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>).

However, all the granule cells recorded in this study in ChAT mice in the LCA mode were silent and remained silent during the low-frequency photostimulations of the cholinergic fibers (n = 17, not shown). M1 could still be a useful molecular marker of type 2.3 PG cells if it is strongly and consistently expressed in these cells and have minimal expression in other cell types in the glomerular layer. However, most cells around glomeruli expressed the mRNA transcript of Chrm1. Cells with no signal were more abundant in the glomerular layer than in the granule cell layer but still represented a small fraction of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Moreover, ISH combined with immunodetection of CR or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), two commonly used markers of nonoverlapping juxtaglomerular cell types, revealed that the Chrm1 transcript was expressed in 85% of the CR-positive (n = 372 cells counted) and 94% of the TH-positive cells (n = 181 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).

The fast run-down of the BF-evoked muscarinic EPSC in WC recordings as well as its strong dependence on intracellular ATP is also consistent with this downstream mechanism. Cell dialysis is indeed often deleterious for M currents because M-channels opening depends on PIP2 binding, a process that is itself highly dependent on intracellular ATP supply for PIP2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>).

XE-991 had two noticeable effects in type 2.3 PG cells recorded in LCA. First, it increased baseline spike frequency in all the cells tested (n = 14, eight in dlx5/6 mice, six in ChAT mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>), suggesting that M-channels are indeed open at rest in type 2.3 PG cells and hyperpolarize their membrane potential. Second, although XE-991 did not fully block photo-evoked muscarinic excitation in most cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and F</xref>), it reduced the strength of BF-induced excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). A persistent photo-evoked excitation is expected if the muscarinic EPSP is partially blocked while the membrane potential is more depolarized compared to control condition. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that activation of M1 mAChRs depolarizes type 2.3 PG cells by blocking a potassium M current.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Muscarinic excitation of type 2.3 PG cells leads to an increase of inhibitory synaptic inputs in principal neurons</title><p>PG cells are classically viewed as a source of inhibitory GABAergic synaptic currents (IPSCs) for mitral and tufted cells, the two OB output channels that project to distinct cortical areas. However, the targets and output properties of type 2.3 PG cells have never been specifically investigated.

However, three of the recorded mitral cells had severed apical dendrites and most of the intact cells (10/14) projected in glomeruli located deep within the slice, where light stimulation may be less efficient.

However, unlike type 2.3 PG cells, they did not show any evidence of parallel cholinergic excitation. Baseline firing activity did not rapidly increase when BF fibers were photostimulated at 0.5 Hz and a single flash did not elicit a long-lasting mAChR-evoked increase in firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In these cells, basal firing frequency was, on average, higher than in type 2.3 PG cells (mean 7.8 ± 5.6 Hz, n = 21, p=0.00058, Mann–Whitney rank-sum test). However, the nature of this activity (single spike vs. burst of spikes) and its frequency (range 2–21 Hz) varied greatly across cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Spontaneous spiking was also diversely affected by NBQX, D-AP5, and mecamylamine, being totally blocked in some cells (n = 3) and not affected in others (n = 9).

However, it is noteworthy that cells with a prolonged inhibition often fired at low rate or fired irregularly with bursts of spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In the other cells, the average delay was longer (329 ± 191 ms) and more variable (n = 14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and E</xref>), suggesting that distinct mechanisms drive the two types of response. Strikingly, the photo-evoked BF synaptic input evoked a small but detectable gabazine-sensitive capacitive current that was inward in 14/15 cells responding with early spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A, B, and E</xref>), whereas it was outward in all the cells responding with delayed spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–E</xref>).

Data also reveal that BF cholinergic fibers strongly and exclusively excite type 2.3 PG cells. Thus, intraglomerular inhibition of principal neurons mediated by PG cells can be modulated in various ways by multiple BF pathways that potentially regulate olfactory processing in a context and behavior-specific manner.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A previously ignored cholinergic pathway</title><p>The main finding of this study is that endogenous phasic ACh release from BF cholinergic neurons selectively evokes a remarkably strong and reliable muscarinic excitation in a previously overlooked PG cell subtype, which are referred to as type 2.3 PG cells.

Here, I provide pharmacological evidence suggesting that the slow cholinergic response is mediated by M1 mAChRs that suppress an M current. This downstream mechanism classically washes out quickly, and future experiments using perforated patch-clamp experiments will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p>This pathway adds to other mAChR-dependent mechanisms capable of increasing tonic inhibition in mitral and tufted cells. Activation of M1 receptors increases the excitability of granule cells, the most abundant interneurons in the OB, by potentiating current-evoked afterdepolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pressler et al., 2007</xref>). mAChR activation also directly enhances transmitter release at reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses between mitral and granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castillo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghatpande and Gelperin, 2009</xref>) or between juxtaglomerular interneurons and mitral/tufted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). However, there is yet no evidence that endogenous ACh can recruit these previously described pathways. In the previous studies, ACh or cholinergic agonists were exogenously applied on slices. This results in prolonged and uniform activation of synaptic and extrasynaptic ACh receptors and induces multiple concomitant effects that may not necessarily be evoked by physiological release of ACh, even in case of strong afferent activity in cholinergic neurons leading to diffuse volume transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Unal et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Physiological implications</title><p>Like other sensory systems, olfactory perception is context-dependent.

This target-specific muscarinic response likely involves synaptic or perisynaptic mAChRs and provides support for phasic, spatially restricted cholinergic transmission as opposed to spatially diffuse volume transmission (Sarter and Lustig, 2020). The same stimulus repeated every 2 s, a low-frequency stimulation that is insufficiently strong to induce massive diffusion of ACh in the extracellular space, rapidly transforms type 2.3 PG cells that usually fire at low rate into tonically active neurons that fire at high frequency. This, in turn, leads to a rapid and persistent increase of synaptic inhibitory currents in principal neurons, thus potentially driving OB circuits in a different state of activity. This target-specific muscarinic transmission may have widespread circuit implications because single cholinergic axons frequently ramify and innervate multiple glomeruli in different OB areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamamoto et al., 2017</xref>).

Based on previous studies on ACh functions, increased inhibition driven by the muscarinic excitation of type 2.3 PG cells may improve olfactory perception of behaviorally important odorants. Interestingly, BF GABAergic fibers innervating type 2.3 PG cells potently block their activity and could act as a powerful brake to reverse the cholinergic effects. Future in vivo experiments will be necessary to explore these possibilities.</p><p>In vivo<italic>,</italic> optogenetic stimulation of the cholinergic axons in the OB of <italic>Chat</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice increases mitral and tufted cells’ spontaneous and odor-evoked firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Böhm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rothermel et al., 2014</xref>). This result seems at odds with the expected implications of the new muscarinic pathway described in this study. However, photostimulation was strong and sustained in these in vivo studies (light continuously on for 10 s). Although it is difficult to compare stimulations in vivo and in slices, a prolonged photostimulus could recruit additional cholinergic pathways that need volume transmission to be activated and that have opposite impacts compared with those of type 2.3 PG cells. For instance, TH-expressing dopaminergic/GABAergic juxtaglomerular neurons express the M2 mAChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crespo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamamoto et al., 2017</xref>). Activation of these receptors inhibits tonically active TH-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pignatelli and Belluzzi, 2008</xref>) that provide an inhibitory drive to mitral and tufted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Whitesell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, understanding the physiological impact of the muscarinic excitation of type 2.3 PG cells on the OB output and network activity will require targeted stimulations that selectively engage this pathway in vivo as well as specific approaches to determine the in vivo activity of the cholinergic afferents.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Multiple cell-type-specific pathways for BF control of glomerular inhibition</title><p>Results of this study also provide new insights into PG cell diversity. Immunohistochemical studies have already demonstrated that the few classical markers commonly used to label PG cells do not label all of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Panzanelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parrish-Aungst et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Whitman and Greer, 2007</xref>). Yet, most functional studies only distinguish type 1 and type 2 PG cells and ignore type 2’s diversity. CR-expressing type 2.1 PG cells are by far the most abundant, representing 40–50% of the entire PG cell population. They are predominately generated postnatally and persist in an immature stage in terms of connectivity and membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benito et al., 2018</xref>). The present data suggest that BF GABAergic inputs are excitatory in a fraction of them, likely the most immature, whereas GABA is inhibitory in the other PG cells. The functional impact of this excitation is unclear because it concerns a minority of PG cells and there is no evidence that immature CR + PG cells form output synapses. However, this result may explain why GABA appears predominantly excitatory in calcium imaging of unidentified PG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parsa et al., 2015</xref>). Type 2.3 PG cells constitute about 20% of the whole PG cell population and are approximately as numerous as type 2.2 PG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sanz Diez et al., 2019</xref>). These regular spiking interneurons have pluri-synaptic long-lasting ON-evoked responses and receive remarkably slow BF IPSCs that readily distinguish them from type 2.1 and type 2.2 PG cells. As shown here, their muscarinic input is another selective feature. Although their input and output connections are not firmly established, type 2.3 PG cells are presumably activated by the glutamate released from mitral and tufted cell dendrites and most likely release GABA unselectively onto mitral and tufted cells. Consistent with this idea, a previous study showed that mAChR activation within glomeruli increases IPSCs equally well in mitral and tufted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). The present data confirm that type 2.3 PG cells inhibit various classes of tufted cells, but I found no evidence that they also inhibit mitral cells. However, this negative result has to be interpreted with caution as it is challenging in slices from adult mice to find mitral cells projecting in surface glomeruli, a technical requirement for optimal LED stimulation of the cholinergic afferents.</p><p>The functional implications of PG cells’ diversity are not known. Cholinergic and GABAergic inputs from the BF may provide physiological tools to manipulate each PG cell subtype selectively in future studies exploring this question. Like elsewhere in the brain, BF GABAergic neurons are highly diverse and each cell population makes cell-type-specific long-range connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Do et al., 2016</xref>) and plays specific functions. For instance, somatostatin (SOM)- and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing subpopulations have distinct impacts on arousal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anaclet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) or food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Distinct classes of BF GABAergic neurons may thus modulate distinct classes of PG cells. Similarly, muscarinic excitation of type 2.3 PG cells may involve a specific population of BF cholinergic neurons. There are at least two distinct types of BF cholinergic neurons that differ in their firing modes and synchronization properties and that are differently engaged during behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>). This specificity could also rely on connectivity. For instance, BF cholinergic neurons modulating distinct areas are driven by specific combinations of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Do et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gielow and Zaborszky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zaborszky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). The recent discovery of a genetically defined subpopulation of cholinergic neurons that selectively innervates a specific subgroup of deep short-axon cells in the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Case et al., 2017</xref>) also supports the hypothesis of cell-specific innervation of OB interneurons by specific subsets of cholinergic neurons. Hence, each of the BF neuromodulatory pathways innervating PG cells might be independently recruited during specific tasks or internal states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and ethical approval</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the French Ministry and the local ethic committee for animal experimentation (CREMEAS; agreement number/reference protocol: APAFIS#5250–2016042115058488v3 and v7).

LCA recordings were made in the voltage-clamp mode of the amplifier (multiclamp 700B, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with no current injected through the pipette.

ONs projecting inside a given glomerulus were electrically stimulated using a theta pipette filled with ACSF. The electrical stimulus (100 µs) was delivered using a Digitimer DS3 (Digitimer, Welwyn Garden City, UK).

Voltages indicated in the article were corrected for the junction potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell selection</title><p>PG cells were selected based on the small size of their cell body and their position within the first rings of cells surrounding the glomerulus. Although they have a larger cell body, it cannot be excluded that TH-expressing cells or eTCs have been erroneously included in the LCA recording dataset. However, these cells usually have remarkable spontaneous activity patterns (eTCs are rhythmically bursting, TH+ cells have a highly regular rhythmic discharge) and cells with this kind of activity constituted a minority of the dataset. eTC, superficial or middle tufted cells (collectively called s/mTC), and mitral cells were identified based on the localization of their soma and the presence or not of lateral dendrites in the external plexiform layer, as seen during WC recording by visual inspection of the dye-filled cell morphology. In addition, some cells were filled with biocytin for post-hoc anatomical reconstruction. Thus, eTCs were selected based on their large pear-shaped soma within the glomerular layer, a short and thick apical dendrite extensively ramifying into a single glomerulus and the lack of lateral dendrites. In addition, they often, but not always, spontaneously fired short bursts of action potentials in the cell-attached configuration even in the presence of NBQX, D-AP5, and mecamylamine. Superficial tufted cells were found at the border between the glomerular layer and the external plexiform layer. Compared to eTC, their soma was located further from the glomerulus into which they projected, and they had long lateral dendrites extending into the external plexiform layer. Middle tufted cells and mitral cells had large cell bodies located in the external plexiform layer and the mitral cell layer, respectively, a thick apical dendrite projecting into a single glomerulus and long lateral dendrites in the external plexiform layer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Morphological reconstruction</title><p>Neurobiotin or biocytin (Vector Laboratories Inc, Burlingame, CA) was added to the intracellular solution (1 mg/ml).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Target-specific control of olfactory bulb periglomerular cells by GABAergic and cholinergic basal forebrain inputs&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the manuscript presented interesting findings on how GABAergic and cholinergic signals impact the input layer of the primary olfactory area of the mouse brain and reports that the effect depends on the cell type. The reviewers appreciate the precise analysis using brain slices and do not have major concerns regarding technical issues. However, the reviewers feel strongly that essential revisions are needed to strengthen the conclusions and to make the paper more accessible to a wide audience.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The author suggests a classification of type 2 PGs into 3 further subtypes (2.x) based on their expression of CR (2.1), Kv3.1 (2.2) and cholinergic response (2.3). However, it is unclear whether these really reflect a separate cell class. The reviewers suggest that adding further evidence substantiating this claim would be important to avoid creating a potentially unnecessary and confusing nomenclature.</p><p>2. A better characterization of the BF neurons stimulated in the experiments with Dlx5/6-cre and Chat-cre mice. Reviewer #2 noted that some technical details regarding mice are missing, and that higher resolution images would, at minimum, be needed. All reviewers suggested a better characterization of transduced neurons: What fraction of Chat neurons are captured in dlx5/6 mice (e.g. assessed by IHC)? Do the Chat-negative neurons labeled in Chat-Cre mice project to OB (perhaps assessed with retrobeads from OB)? Also Dlx5/6-cre mice likely label many GABAergic neurons in the forebrain: Do the author manage to label only cells within the HDB? If not, where else may the GABAergic inputs come from and is it fair to unambiguously refer to them as BF inputs?</p><p>3. Reviewer#2 suggested that the &quot;inhibition&quot; of sTC and eTC by cholinergic stimulation be measured in a decrease in firing rate, as opposed to an increase in sIPCS frequency. It is presently unclear that the observed sIPSC effect comes from these cells. While a demonstration of this is likely beyond the scope of this study , showing that M1 receptors are selectively expressed in PG 2,3 cells (see point 1 above, see comments by reviewer #1) or that this effect is also dependent on M-channels would help bridge that gap.</p><p>4. Additional clarity on impact and a larger picture. Multiple things can/should be done in this regard:</p><p>a. This paper follows another from the same group (Sanz Diez et al. 2019) that already looked at the postsynaptic effects of BF afferents onto OB cells using optogenetics in dlx5/6-cre mice. That paper focused mainly on GABAergic inputs, and reported dense innervation of all layers of the OB and potent GABAergic responses in granule cells, short axon cells and subpopulations of type 2 PG cells (but not type 1s). Reviewers feel that an analysis performed by the same group that ought to be repeated here to compare their new classification scheme with their previous one.</p><p>b. This paper builds onto this 2019 paper, but focuses exclusively onto PG cells for both GABA and ACh responses. What motivates this focus is not presently clear, as several classes of OB neurons express nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (Castillo et al. 1999, Liu et al. 2015, Smith et al. 2015, Brunert and Rothermel 2021). A better justification for their exclusive focus on PG cells is warranted, together with some illustration that helps understand how cholinergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition of PG cells might affect OB output.</p><p>c. Related to this, the focus of the paper remains vague: is it to define multiple subclasses of type 2 PG cells, in which case the functional GABAergic and cholinergic responses help substantiate the claim that these cells ought to be broken down into 3 subtypes? Or is the focus on the impact of BF inputs to OB function, in which case the focus on type 2 PG cells should be clarified (as well as the identity of the BF cells transduced with ChR2; see point 2)? Can we assume that ACh does not directly influence other cells? And what about the relative contribution of GABAergic signaling onto PG cells vs other interneurons and principal cells?</p><p>d. The utility of figure 1 is still unclear. All it does is to confuse the reader as to the potential existence of complex, co-transmission mechanisms, when in fact it derives from describing dlx5/6-cre mice as a specific driver of GABAergic neurons, which it isn't. Dlx5/6 labels neurons that originate in the embryonic ganglionic eminences during development, which includes GABAergic interneurons as well as cholinergic neurons in the forebrain. If one were interested in understanding how ACh modulates OB circuits, as the introduction suggests, one would not use dlx5/6-cre mice to start. Because the subsequent figures use more specific Cre lines, therefore, Figure 1 here may confuse readers who are not aware of the caveats associated with the Dlx5/6cre mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The paper would be strengthened by converging approaches that add to the data presented. Specifically, M1 AChRs appear to be a molecular identifier of type 2.3 PG neurons. It would be interesting to perform in situ hybridization for M1 AChR to examine the distribution in the olfactory bulb to determine what extent it serves as a marker for this functionally identified class of neurons.</p><p>– A novel finding of this paper is that a subset of BF neurons that release only ACh make direct connections with PG 2.3 neurons in the olfactory bulb. However, there is still a substantial population of neurons that co-release both ACh and GABA. In order to more fully appreciate the relative size of the population that releases ACh only, it would be helpful if the author could perform quantification of ChAT+ neurons in the BF that are not labeled by Dlx5/6. This could be achieved by performing ChAT immunohistochemistry in a Dlx5/6 cre mouse that was injected with a cre-dependent virus to estimate the relative size of the co-releasing and non-co-releasing populations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Has the author tested the specificity of conditional expression using the AAV? The cre-dependence of conditional expression depends on the production method and the virus titre (Fisher et al. 2019, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1915974116). If this is available, please describe this in a supplementary figure. If not, at the least, please include the titre information.</p><p>Please include more information in the methods about the Cre lines used (stock number, original reference etc).</p><p>It would be beneficial if the author could provide high resolution versions of the images used in Figure 1B and Figure 4C in the supplement, to be able to see the labelled structures better.</p><p>Figure 1C – if I understand correctly, the &quot;excitation&quot; in the pie chart is sometimes very brief type (as in Figure 1E), and sometimes the longer-lasting type, of the type analysed in Figure 3. It would be better if these could be labelled more precisely.</p><p>In general, the definition of cell types is ambiguous and not consistent with the definitions described elsewhere. For example, in Sanz Diez et al., the author used the response latency from the time of ON stimulation as a way to distinguish type 1 vs. type 2 PG cells. Please include analyses that allow comparisons with previous work(s). Similarly, a summary (e.g., a table) that describes the distinguishing properties of the PG cell types (types 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3) would help.</p><p>Figure 7 – The effect on sTC and eTCs is an increase in iPSCs in voltage clamp, which is clearly shown. The term &quot;inhibition&quot;, however, suggests a cessation of the action potential generation, which is not shown. As the net effect on the overall firing rates would likely depend on many factors, here, it is better to simply call it an increase in inhibitory synaptic inputs or similar.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The presentation of the findings could be made stronger by providing a diagram of the OB and its component cells types and microcircuits. This would help non-experts understand which cell types are recorded from and how they fit into the shaping of odor responses in the OB. While the many subtypes of neurons populating the OB, their anatomical connections and functional roles remain incompletely understood, one issue with the current presentation of the findings is that we lose track of the forest for the trees. It is difficult to shake the feeling that we keep slicing smaller and smaller parts of a circuit that is not familiar to many, obscuring the significance of the findings. A better description of the roles that PG cells play in olfaction, especially vis-à-vis other interneurons and principal neurons, supplemented with a clear diagram, is necessary to help emphasize the importance of this work.</p><p>– The paper opens with a striking observation: stimulation of BF afferents evokes a range of excitatory and inhibitory responses in PG cells. However, as the paper unfolds and more specific methods targeting BF GABAergic and cholinergic neurons are leveraged, it becomes clear that the inhibitory and excitatory components originate in separate populations of afferents. The striking observation of Figure 1 is therefore nothing more than the result of non-selective axonal stimulation. Is starting with a confusing picture necessary, especially when more specific methods yielding more classical findings are utilized in later figures? Are there reasons to believe that BF GABAergic and cholinergic neurons are co-active in vivo?</p><p>– The molecular and synaptic basis for the segregation of GABAergic and cholinergic responses onto different subtypes of PG cells is not investigated. The author interprets this finding as resulting from differences in presynaptic innervation/specialization (e.g. lines 460, or 586-588). While probable, what evidence supports this possibility over others? Can we exclude postsynaptic components, such as differential postsynaptic clustering of GABA receptors, or expression of M1 receptors and/or M-channels? Can volume transmission can be excluded as a mode of release based on the data at hand?</p><p>– Figure 9 provides evidence that GABA exerts a direct excitatory influence on some PG cells, possibly because their chloride reversal potential is elevated. The author should provide more evidence to substantiate this claim. For instance, does puffing GABA evoke a train of action potentials?</p><p>– Line 149: the author describes that AMPA, NMDA and nicotinic ACh receptor blockers prevent excitation of any interneurons. This is not true if one consideres some muscarinic receptors, and indeed this study goes on to show a striking example of this.</p><p>– Line 169: remove 'always', since the rest of the sentence describes exceptions.</p><p>– Line 208-210: 89% of ChR2+ neurons in the BF of ChAT-Cre mice are cholinergic, leaving 11% of non-specifically labeled cells. Can the author provide any indication as to which other cells are labeled and whether they also project to OB, potentially contributing to postsynaptic responses?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71965.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Previous immunohistochemical investigations have already suggested that there are at least four classes of PG cells (Panzanelli et al., 2007; Parrish-Aungst et al., 2007). However, this classification has never been corroborated by distinctive functional properties and PG cell diversity is still most often overlooked.</p><p>In our last report, we proposed a classification with three subclasses of functionally distinct type 2 PG cells (Sanz Diez et al., 2019). We showed that a subclass of type 2 PG cells with prolonged ON-evoked responses that differ from those of previously described CR and Kv3.1-expressing PG cells also has a distinctive remarkably slow BF GABAergic IPSC. The present study further confirms that type 2.3 PG cells constitute a separate subclass by demonstrating its selective muscarinic input.</p><p>As requested by reviewer 1, I did additional experiments to determine whether the M1 mAChR is a molecular marker of this new subclass. The results suggest that this is not the case. M1 is widely expressed in the olfactory bulb in multiple cell types. This new result, combined with new recordings in granule cells, i.e. the most abundant OB interneurons, is nonetheless interesting as it suggests that despite the high expression level of M1 in multiple cell types, the synaptic pathway leading to the muscarinic activation of type 2.3 PG cells appears highly specific. The new data are presented in a new figure supplement (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1) and a new paragraph in the result section (page 14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We reported that about 1/3 of the ChAT+ neurons were labeled. However, this quantification may not only reflect infection specificity but may also depend on infection rate and virus spread. If the question is on the nature of the ChAT+ neurons that were infected (those co-releasing ACh and GABA vs. those only releasing ACh), as reviewer 1 suggested, then IHC experiments do not respond to it. Our recordings indeed demonstrate that both types of cholinergic neurons are captured in BF-injected dlx5/6 mice. In addition to the exclusive cholinergic responses reported in the present manuscript, we also reported in Sanz Diez et al., (2019) mixed GABA/ACh responses in a subset of dSA cells recorded in the OB of BF-injected dlx5/6 mice (see an example in the response to reviewer 2). These responses are similar as those reported in Case et al., (2017) who demonstrated that they are mediated by a specific subpopulation of cholinergic neurons co-releasing ACh and GABA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the Chat-negative neurons labeled in Chat-Cre mice project to OB (perhaps assessed with retrobeads from OB)?</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by reviewer 3, only 11% of the neurons labeled in ChAT mice were not co-labeled with ChAT in my IHC experiments suggesting a possible non-specific infection. In the other hand, the only type of response observed in my LCA recordings from &gt;350 cells was the muscarinic excitation of type 2.3 PG cells. In addition, I recorded 54 PG cells in the whole-cell mode and only one of these cells responded with a possibly non-specific GABAergic response. This rare possibly unspecific response may have been mediated by a CB-, CR-, PV- or SOM-expressing BF GABAergic neuron. They all project to the OB, as revealed by our unpublished retrograde labeling experiments. However, this point is clearly not central to my study. Therefore, I have not done any additional experiments to determine the nature of these non-specifically labeled cells, which contribute little to the postsynaptic electrophysiological responses examined in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, Dlx5/6-cre mice likely label many GABAergic neurons in the forebrain: Do the author manage to label only cells within the HDB? If not, where else may the GABAergic inputs come from and is it fair to unambiguously refer to them as BF inputs?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair concern, as it is likely that the virus infected a larger area than just the HDB/MCPO. Virus spread was not verified in injected mice from which the OB was extracted for electrophysiological experiments. However, our own retrograde tracing experiments (unpublished) together with those of Hanson et al. (2020), indicate that the other brain areas containing OB-projecting GABAergic neurons (i.e. the medial and lateral anterior olfactory nuclei, the lateral septum, the ventral subiculum) are all located quite far from our injection site in the BF making it unlikely that they contribute to the responses described in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Reviewer#2 suggested that the &quot;inhibition&quot; of sTC and eTC by cholinergic stimulation be measured in a decrease in firing rate, as opposed to an increase in sIPCS frequency. It is presently unclear that the observed sIPSC effect comes from these cells. While a demonstration of this is likely beyond the scope of this study , showing that M1 receptors are selectively expressed in PG 2,3 cells (see point 1 above, see comments by reviewer #1) or that this effect is also dependent on M-channels would help bridge that gap.</p></disp-quote><p>I agree that the real impact of this new muscarinic pathway should be measured on the discharge of output neurons, which means not only on their firing rate but also on the synchrony of their discharge. This is a lot of work, beyond the scope of this study. As requested by reviewer 2, I replaced the term “inhibition” which implies a measure of firing activity in principal neurons with “IPSCs frequency” i.e. what was actually measured in my experiments. However, I do not agree that it is presently unclear that the increase in IPSCs frequency comes from type 2.3 PG cells. I indeed showed in Figure 7 and reported (page 17 lines 441-445) that “this response was blocked (n=8) or reduced (n=3) when the experiment was repeated in the presence of 2 µM pirenzepine (Figure 7C and 7E). Pirenzepine had little effect in 4/15 cells. A single photostimulation also transiently increased IPSC frequency in eTC (n=9) and s/mTC (n=8)(Figure 7B and 7D). Addition of pirenzepine attenuated this response in 10/11 cells.” This dependence on pirenzepine-sensitive M1 receptors together with the time course of the increase of IPSCs strongly support the idea that type 2.3 PG cells mediate the photo-evoked IPSCs in principal neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Additional clarity on impact and a larger picture. Multiple things can/should be done in this regard:</p><p>a. This paper follows another from the same group (Sanz Diez et al. 2019) that already looked at the postsynaptic effects of BF afferents onto OB cells using optogenetics in dlx5/6-cre mice. That paper focused mainly on GABAergic inputs, and reported dense innervation of all layers of the OB and potent GABAergic responses in granule cells, short axon cells and subpopulations of type 2 PG cells (but not type 1s). Reviewers feel that an analysis performed by the same group that ought to be repeated here to compare their new classification scheme with their previous one.</p><p>b. This paper builds onto this 2019 paper, but focuses exclusively onto PG cells for both GABA and ACh responses. What motivates this focus is not presently clear, as several classes of OB neurons express nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (Castillo et al. 1999, Liu et al. 2015, Smith et al. 2015, Brunert and Rothermel 2021). A better justification for their exclusive focus on PG cells is warranted, together with some illustration that helps understand how cholinergic excitation and GABAergic inhibition of PG cells might affect OB output.</p><p>c. Related to this, the focus of the paper remains vague: is it to define multiple subclasses of type 2 PG cells, in which case the functional GABAergic and cholinergic responses help substantiate the claim that these cells ought to be broken down into 3 subtypes? Or is the focus on the impact of BF inputs to OB function, in which case the focus on type 2 PG cells should be clarified (as well as the identity of the BF cells transduced with ChR2; see point 2)? Can we assume that ACh does not directly influence other cells? And what about the relative contribution of GABAergic signaling onto PG cells vs other interneurons and principal cells?</p></disp-quote><p>I thank the reviewing editor for these suggestions for improving the clarity and impact of my paper. In response to the many points raised in a- c, a new paragraph (page 3, lines 73-104, pasted below) and a new figure (Figure 1) have been added in the introduction. New Figure 1 includes a diagram of the OB glomerular microcircuits and a table that summarizes the properties of the different PG cell subtypes. The new paragraph clarifies the focus on PG cells (recent papers examined the BF connections on granule cells and the influences of this pathway on the OB circuits) and explains better their functions. It also introduces the new nomenclature proposed for the first time in this paper. I believe this addition disambiguates the definition of cell types and will help the reader contextualize the results:</p><p><italic>“</italic>In such complex context, an important step towards understanding the influence and function of the BF inputs in the OB is to investigate the connections, temporal dynamics and functional impact of each BF pathway. […] Their output connections have not been determined.”</p><p>Concerning ACh influence on other cell types, new recordings in granule cells (mentioned page 14, lines 369-371) demonstrate that these abundant OB interneurons do not respond to the same stimulations that drive the muscarinic excitation of type 2.3 PG cells. These results further justify the focus on the muscarinic synaptic responses of type 2.3 PG cells, which is an unusual example of target-specific muscarinic transmission. This muscarinic pathway provides support for phasic, spatially restricted cholinergic transmission as opposed to spatially diffuse volume transmission. Yet, experiments are currently in progress in the lab using stronger pulse trains of light to determine whether volume transmission of ACh activates receptors in other cell types. However, these types of responses caused by diffusion of ACh ought to be less specific in terms of targets than synaptic transmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The utility of figure 1 is still unclear. All it does is to confuse the reader as to the potential existence of complex, co-transmission mechanisms, when in fact it derives from describing dlx5/6-cre mice as a specific driver of GABAergic neurons, which it isn't. Dlx5/6 labels neurons that originate in the embryonic ganglionic eminences during development, which includes GABAergic interneurons as well as cholinergic neurons in the forebrain. If one were interested in understanding how ACh modulates OB circuits, as the introduction suggests, one would not use dlx5/6-cre mice to start. Because the subsequent figures use more specific Cre lines, therefore, Figure 1 here may confuse readers who are not aware of the caveats associated with the Dlx5/6cre mice.</p></disp-quote><p>I recognize that starting with a figure summarizing the results obtained in dlx5/6 mice was an error. The new version of the manuscript directly starts with the description of muscarinic responses in ChAT-cre mice. Experiments in dlx5/6 mice come next and the specificity of this line which labels both GABA and ACh neurons is now clearly indicated (page 6-7, line 201). Previous figure 1, which shows the different types of response in dlx5/6-cre and their occurrence, is now shown in a modified version in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2.</p><p>Of note, viral injection in the BF of GAD2-cre (Bohm et al., 2020; Villar et al., 2021) or vGAT-cre mice (Hanson et al., 2020) produces the same axonal projection patterns in the OB as in dlx5/6-cre mice. Moreover, in these two models a significant fraction of the neurons labeled in the BF are ChAT-expressing neurons (up to 16% in GAD2-cre mice in Villar et al. (2021)). Co-labeling of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons is therefore not a specific caveat of the dlx5/6-Cre line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The paper would be strengthened by converging approaches that add to the data presented. Specifically, M1 AChRs appear to be a molecular identifier of type 2.3 PG neurons. It would be interesting to perform in situ hybridization for M1 AChR to examine the distribution in the olfactory bulb to determine what extent it serves as a marker for this functionally identified class of neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have in the past characterized two functionally distinct classes of type 2 PG cells, CR-expressing cells (i.e. type 2.1, Benito et al., 2018) and Kv3.1-expressing cells (i.e. type 2.2, Najac et al., 2015). In our last report (Sanz Diez et al., 2019), we proposed the existence of a third class of type 2 PG cell (type 2.3) that has unique synaptic properties (prolonged ON-evoked response and prolonged BF IPSC) compared to the two previously described classes. The present study adds additional evidence that type 2.3 PG cells constitute a new subclass of PG cells by demonstrating its selective muscarinic input.</p><p>As requested by the reviewer, I have done new experiments to examine whether the M1 mAChR is a molecular marker for type 2.3 PG cells. I first tried to detect the expression of M1 mAChRs using an antibody from the Frontier Institute (Japan) that has been successfully used in the past (Yamasaki et al. JNeurosci 2010; Martinello et al., Neuron 2015). Unfortunately, I have not been able to label anything with this antibody (new batches of M1 antibody apparently do not work as well as older batches. Personal communication from the colleague who obtained the results in the Neuron 2015 paper). Then, I examined the distribution of an mRNA transcript of Chrm1, the gene encoding M1 mAChRs, using RNAscope fluorescence in situ hybridization. The results indicate that Chrm1 mRNA signals are widely expressed across all layers of the OB. The signal was particularly strong in granule cells. Thus, I did new LCA recordings in these interneurons indicating that they do not respond to the same photostimulation of the cholinergic afferents as those used to activate type 2.3 PG cells. I also combined FISH with immunohistochemistry to examine more closely the distribution of M1 in the glomerular layer. The results indicate that M1 receptors are non-selectively expressed by multiple cell types, including calretinin (CR) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressing cells. Thus, M1 is not a selective molecular marker of type 2.3 PG cells.</p><p>I have hesitated to include these new results in the paper because I am afraid that the first thing that comes to mind is that the labeling is unspecific. However, the data are consistent with a radiographic binding study (Le Jeune et al., 1995) but also with more recent ISH data in the Allen brain atlas (https://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/73907497) which have been obtained with a different probe than the one provided for the RNAscope assay. Widespread expression of M1 in the OB is also confirmed by the immunohistochemical data shown in the human protein atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000168539-CHRM1/brain). Finally, preliminary analysis of available transcriptomic datasets also suggest that M1 is expressed by multiple cell types in the OB, including CR-expressing and CB-expressing neurons (Marcela Lipovsek, personal communication). Overall, these new data are therefore potentially interesting because they suggest that despite a widespread expression of M1 in the OB, only those on type 2.3 PG cells are activated by transient synaptic release of ACh. Thus, I have decided to include these data in a new figure supplement (Figure 6, figure supplement 1). They are described in the result section page 14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A novel finding of this paper is that a subset of BF neurons that release only ACh make direct connections with PG 2.3 neurons in the olfactory bulb. However, there is still a substantial population of neurons that co-release both ACh and GABA. In order to more fully appreciate the relative size of the population that releases ACh only, it would be helpful if the author could perform quantification of ChAT+ neurons in the BF that are not labeled by Dlx5/6. This could be achieved by performing ChAT immunohistochemistry in a Dlx5/6 cre mouse that was injected with a cre-dependent virus to estimate the relative size of the co-releasing and non-co-releasing populations.</p></disp-quote><p>If I understand well the reviewer, he/she suggests that a possible reason why dual GABA/ACh responses were not detected in my study may be that cholinergic neurons that co-release both transmitters are, for some reasons, not infected in the dlx5/6 mice. However, this is not the case. In our previous report (Sanz Diez et al., 2019), we estimated using immunohistochemistry that about 1/3 of the ChAT-expressing neurons were labeled in dlx5/6 mice that were injected with the same cre-dependent virus as the one used in the present study. We also reported that “in 3 of the 11 deep short axon cells tested, the response had two components that reversed at different potentials. At V<sub>h</sub> = −70 mV, the response was biphasic with an outward component that was blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (GBZ, 5 μM), and an inward component that persisted in the presence of GBZ but was inhibited by the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (20 μM)(not shown). These dual responses are similar to those mediated by basal forebrain neurons that release both GABA and acetylcholine onto a specific subtype of dSA cells (Case et al. 2017) and were therefore not further studied.” One example of these dual ACh/GABA response is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.

An estimate of the onset latency of the ON-evoked response is now provided to support their classification as type 2 PG cells and allow comparison with our previous work. For instance, page 13 line 323 it is now indicated that “Evoked responses had an onset latency &gt;2ms (average 3.14 ± 0.66 ms) as typically seen in pluri-synaptic ON-evoked responses of type 2 PG cells (Sanz Diez, Najac, and De Saint Jan 2019; Najac et al. 2015).” See also line 494 for type 2.2 PG cells.

It is difficult to shake the feeling that we keep slicing smaller and smaller parts of a circuit that is not familiar to many, obscuring the significance of the findings.

However, as the paper unfolds and more specific methods targeting BF GABAergic and cholinergic neurons are leveraged, it becomes clear that the inhibitory and excitatory components originate in separate populations of afferents. The striking observation of Figure 1 is therefore nothing more than the result of non-selective axonal stimulation. Is starting with a confusing picture necessary, especially when more specific methods yielding more classical findings are utilized in later figures? Are there reasons to believe that BF GABAergic and cholinergic neurons are co-active in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>I thank the reviewer for raising this problem with figure 1 that unnecessarily complicated the reading of the paper.

The author interprets this finding as resulting from differences in presynaptic innervation/specialization (e.g. lines 460, or 586-588). While probable, what evidence supports this possibility over others? Can we exclude postsynaptic components, such as differential postsynaptic clustering of GABA receptors, or expression of M1 receptors and/or M-channels? Can volume transmission can be excluded as a mode of release based on the data at hand?</p></disp-quote><p>The molecular and synaptic basis for the segregation of distinct GABAergic and cholinergic responses onto different subtypes of PG cells is outside the scope of this study. While different subunit compositions of the postsynaptic GABAA receptors undoubtedly determine the time course of BF IPSCs, we have also shown in our previous report (Sanz Diez et al., 2019) that BF GABAergic inputs have target-specific release properties (i.e. distinctive paired pulse ratio and failure rate) suggesting that they arise from distinct populations of neurons. This is now clearly indicated in the introduction (lines 65-66). Consistent with this, our unpublished retrograde labeling indicates that at least four non-overlapping populations of GABAergic BF neurons (labeled with calbindin, calretinin, somatostatin or parvalbumin) project to the OB. Also, in line with this idea, our experiments using transgenic lines expressing the Cre recombinase in specific GABAergic neurons show that distinct populations of GABAergic BF neurons innervate selective territories in the OB. For instance, CR-expressing BF neurons exclusively project in the granule cell layer whereas PV-expressing neurons project to the glomerular layer (a collaborative paper is in preparation on this finding). Thus, although postsynaptic mechanisms cannot be excluded, it is reasonable to think that different sub-populations of BF neurons modulate selective targets in the OB. There is a precedent in the literature: a specific sub-population of cholinergic neurons selectively innervates a sparse and specific subgroup of deep short axon cells located in the internal plexiform layer of the OB (Case et al., 2017). Identifying the populations of BF neurons that differentially modulate PG cell subclasses is the priority of our projects in the lab.</p><p>Concerning the cholinergic innervation, I focused on the muscarinic response of type 2.3 PG cells because it is evoked by a single brief stimulation of the afferent cholinergic fibers and it is target-specific. Activation of M1 receptors by a single transient of ACh suggests that postsynaptic M1 receptors are clustered near ACh release sites, which perhaps implies the existence of real anatomically-defined muscarinic synapses. This type of response is unusual in the brain. Slow M-channel-mediated muscarinic EPSP are usually evoked by strong and prolonged stimulations of the cholinergic neurons that favor spatial diffusion of ACh. The new FISH data suggest that expression of M1 is not specific to type 2.3 PG cells. Volume transmission of ACh may thus less specifically activate M1 receptors in several other cell subtypes. M2 receptors are also expressed in spontaneously active TH-expressing juxtaglomerular neurons. Their activation by bath-applied ACh inhibits spontaneous activity (Pignatelli et al., Chem senses 2008. doi:10.1093/chemse/bjm091). Experiments with stronger pulse-trains of ChR2 activation are ongoing in the lab to test whether they are activated by endogeneous ACh.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 9 provides evidence that GABA exerts a direct excitatory influence on some PG cells, possibly because their chloride reversal potential is elevated. The author should provide more evidence to substantiate this claim. For instance, does puffing GABA evoke a train of action potentials?</p></disp-quote><p>I think that further investigating this question would distract the reader from the main point. Here the principal result is not that GABA is depolarizing in some PG cells (this is consistent with the literature, see Parsa et al. PNAS 2015 or Smith and Jahr NatureNeurosci 2002), the main point is that GABA is depolarizing and excitatory in a <italic>minority</italic> of CR-expressing PG cells. The title (line 521) and conclusion of this paragraph (lines 552-55) have been slightly modified to emphasize this point.</p><p>We have shown that CR+ cells conserve functional properties of immature neurons (Benito et al., 2018). However, each cell is at a specific stage of maturation. An elevated chloride potential may be expected in the most immature ones. Puffing GABA would not evoke a train of APs. CR-expressing PG cells only express a single potassium current, the A-type. Once this current is inactivated, they cannot repolarize quickly. Thus, in response to prolonged depolarization, these cells only fire once and after the spike stay depolarized as shown in Pignatelli et al. (2016) and in Benito et al.
