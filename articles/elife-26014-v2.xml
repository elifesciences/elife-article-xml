The development of vertebrate phenotypic assays that approach the scale and efficiency of genomic technologies hold promise to fundamentally enhance our functional understanding of genes and genomic variation. For instance, they could rapidly accelerate genetic and drug discovery by enabling organism-wide, unbiased analysis of large numbers of phenotypic features. In addition, they could expand our understanding of functional relationships between genes by helping to cluster mutations into common pathways based on similarities in phenotypic signatures. Finally, since our functional understanding of genes and genomic variation is directly coupled to the depth with which we are able to characterize their effects on phenotype, our understanding of gene function is fundamentally limited by the tendency for phenotypic assays to be restricted to a few readouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schork, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilder et al., 2009</xref>). A better understanding of the biological insights that may be attained by profiling changes in patterns in a large number of phenotypic features is essential to both guide and drive the development of next-generation phenotyping technologies.</p><p>The skeleton is an organ consisting of a large number of tissues distributed throughout the body; thus, it is a prime example of a spatially distributed organ system that may benefit from phenomic approaches. The skeleton comprises bones of different developmental origins (e.g., neural crest vs. mesoderm derived) and modes of ossification (intramembranous vs. endochondral), cellular compositions, and gene expression patterns. Different compartments can be differentially regulated through differences in local mechanical environment, proximity to tissues and organs that exert paracrine control (e.g., at the muscle/bone interface), and variations in vascularization and innervation. Since different mutations often affect different skeletal compartments, it is common practice to perform skeletal phenotyping at multiple skeletal sites. In this context, most efforts to increase the phenotypic content of skeletal assays have focused on increasing the depth of description at a given anatomical location rather than increasing the number of bones/compartments analyzed. In mice, Adams <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 2015</xref>) developed a semi-automated workflow integrating microCT and multi-image cryohistology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dyment et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hong et al., 2012</xref>) to quantify 15 phenotypic measures in the femur and lumbar spine. Using a high-throughput automated synchrotron-based tomographic microscopy system, Mader <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mader et al., 2015</xref>) quantified 22 different measurements in the mouse femur. In zebrafish, Pardo-Martin <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pardo-Martin et al., 2013</xref>) used automated sample handling and optical projection tomography to acquire high-dimensional phenotypic profiles (~200 measurements) in the craniofacial cartilage of early larvae, representing one of the most ambitious approaches to perform large-scale phenotyping in the skeleton to date. Yet, even in this analysis, traits were derived from only 9 skeletal elements. Further, this method is not readily extendable to bones outside of the craniofacial skeleton, or to adults. Finally, while both the mouse and zebrafish spine are amenable to whole-body microCT imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2014</xref>), in-depth phenotyping is usually limited to a few vertebral bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouxsein et al., 2010</xref>). In this context, methods to perform in-depth phenotyping in a large number of bones represents a unique class of problems that has not been adequately addressed.</p><p>The objective of this study was twofold: (1) to develop microCT-based methods for profiling morphological and densitometric traits at a large number of anatomical sites in the axial skeleton of adult zebrafish, and (2) to assess the benefits of analyzing phenotypic patterns in discriminating mutant populations. Here, we present a supervised segmentation algorithm, FishCuT, and a statistical workflow to test for differences in phenomic patterns in mutant populations. We demonstrate the potential for vertebral patterns to confer heightened sensitivity, with similar specificity, in discriminating mutant populations compared to analyzing individual vertebrae in isolation. To identify phenomic signatures associated with human brittle bone diseases, we perform in-depth phenotyping in two zebrafish mutants, <italic>plod2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup>. Further, to demonstrate the potential to identify novel axial skeletal mutants associated with human genetic disorders, we phenotype <italic>opallus</italic>, which harbors a mutation in thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (<italic>tshr</italic>) identical to a mutation causing hyperthyroidism in humans. Finally, we develop phenome-based allometric models and show that they are able to discriminate mutant phenotypes otherwise masked by alterations in growth. We have integrated our methods into a software package, FishCuT, whose source code has been deposited on GitHub as a beta release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwon, 2017</xref>); a copy is archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/FishCuT">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/FishCuT</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A microCT-based workflow for phenomic profiling of the axial skeleton in adult zebrafish</title><p>Due to their small size, zebrafish are conducive to whole-body microCT imaging at high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated radiopacity in adult zebrafish vertebrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2003</xref>) and the feasibility of imaging vertebral morphology in adult zebrafish via microCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gistelinck et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asharani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spoorendonk et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, the small size of zebrafish can be exploited by imaging multiple fish simultaneously. For instance, in most cases we imaged two fish at a time, enabling whole spines to be acquired at 21 µm resolution in as little as ~20 min/fish for fish that were ~20 mm in standard length. Further, in a single proof-of-concept study, we found that up to eight animals could be scanned simultaneously at 21 µm resolution, enabling whole spines to be imaged in an effective scan time of ~5 min/fish. While several practical issues will need to be resolved prior to broad application of such high-density scanning strategies (discussed below), our studies suggest that the primary bottleneck to phenomic analysis in a large number of bones is not the time required for microCT scan acquisition, but the time required for segmentation. Indeed, we found that ~60 min was required to manually segment a single vertebra of an adult fish scanned at 21 µm resolution (~60 image slices) using a user-assisted segmentation tool, a rate that would require &gt;24 hr to segment the ~27 precaudal and caudal vertebrae that comprise the zebrafish vertebral column.</p><p>To overcome this barrier, we developed FishCuT, a microCT analysis toolkit that couples supervised segmentation with connectivity analysis to enable computation of descriptors of bone morphology, mass, and mineralization at a large number of anatomical sites in the vertebral column of adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To segment vertebral bodies, FishCuT employs a region-growing algorithm which takes user-specified line regions of interest (ROIs) specifying ‘seed’ locations of vertebral boundaries, and uses them to isolate individual vertebrae. This segmentation is achieved by iteratively growing a separation boundary such that each vertebra is composed of connected components that do not contain voxels from different vertebrae. Once each vertebral body is segmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), a supervised algorithm is used to segment each vertebral body into three skeletal elements: the neural arch (Neur), centrum (Cent), and haemal arch/ribs (Haem) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). For each skeletal element, four primary measurements are computed: Tissue Mineral Density (TMD, mgHA/cm<sup>3</sup>), Volume (Vol, µm<sup>3</sup>), Thickness (Th, µm), and Surface Area (SA, µm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition to the above measurements, FishCuT computes centrum length (Cent.Le, µm), as well as intra-specimen variation in TMD and thickness (i.e. TMD.sd and Th.sd, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouxsein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burghardt et al., 2008</xref>]) for each skeletal element. For each measure, the ‘total’ value (e.g., Tot.TMD) within a single vertebra (i.e., across the centrum, haemal arch/ribs, and neural arch) is also computed. For analysis, each combination of element/outcome (e.g., Cent.TMD) is computed as a function of vertebra number. The global test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goeman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goeman et al., 2004</xref>), a regression-based statistical test designed for data sets in which many covariates (or features) have been measured for the same subjects, is used to assess whether the pattern across vertebrae is significantly different between groups. This output is provided graphically via a custom R script that computes plots of phenotypic trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and color codes them to highlight the trends that are statistically significant in the global test. Finally, for each combination of outcome/element, a standard score is computed as the difference between its value in each vertebral body and its mean value across all vertebrae in the control population, divided by the standard deviation across all vertebrae in the control population. These data are arranged into matrix constructs that we have termed ‘skeletal barcodes’, which can be input into graphing software to generate heat maps to facilitate visualization of phenotypic trends both within individuals and across groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Currently, 25 different quantities are computed for each vertebra (Cent.TMD, Cent.Th, Cent.Vol, Cent.Le, Cent.SA, Cent.TMD.sd, Cent.Th.sd, Neur.TMD, Neur.Th, Neur.Vol, Neur.SA, Neur.TMD.sd, Neur.Th.sd, Haem.TMD, Haem.Th, Haem.Vol, Haem.SA, Haem.TMD.sd, Haem.Th.sd, Tot.TMD, Tot.Th, Tot.Vol, Tot.SA, Tot.TMD.sd, Tot.Th.sd). The total number of measures that are computed is dependent on the number of vertebrae which are analyzed by the user (i.e., by seeding separation boundaries). Analyzing 24 vertebrae results in 24 × 25 = 600 phenotypic measures, and usually takes &lt;5 min/fish (~100 x faster than manual segmentation). In our studies we analyzed between 22–28 vertebrae, with an average of 24.1 ± 1.4 vertebrae per fish (mean ± SD, n = 34 fish).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26014.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MicroCT-based phenomics in the axial skeleton of adult zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MicroCT scans are acquired in adult fish (image shows 3D volume rendering). (<bold>B</bold>) For segmentation, individual vertebrae are isolated using FishCuT (image shows 16 vertebrae from the same fish, colors indicate local thickness), and (<bold>C</bold>) each vertebral body is segmented into three skeletal elements: the Neural Arch (green), Centrum (white), and Haemal Arch/Pleural Ribs (red).

We computed a DSC of 0.932 ± 0.001 (mean ± SD, n = 2 vertebrae) when we excluded pixels with intensities less than the threshold used in the FishCuT analysis, exceeding the value of 0.7 suggested to indicate excellent agreement between manual and automated segmentation approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zijdenbos et al., 1994</xref>). We computed a mean difference of 3.4 ± 1.2% (mean ± SD, n = 3 fish) in centrum length, a measure that is calculated directly from user-specified ‘seed’ locations of the vertebral boundaries, when we serially performed primary and secondary scans of the same animal. This suggests that intra-operator reproducibility during this step was high. Finally, to assess independence between phenotypic measures, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients for each pair of measurements across 34 analyzed fish. We observed a relatively low median absolute Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.34 among measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), similar to the value of 0.3 attained by Pardo-Martin et al. during high-content profiling of the zebrafish craniofacial skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pardo-Martin et al., 2013</xref>). This quantity was relatively invariant with increasing number of vertebrae used for analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the discussion, we provide examples (including fish analyzed in this study) where each vertebra might confer non-redundant information.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26014.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Pairwise correlations of phenotypic measurements.</title><p>The following procedure was used to assess the correlation between phenotypic measurements. First, we analyzed 34 different WT and mutant fish of various genotypes. As detailed in the text, analyzing 24 vertebrae results in 24 × 25 = 600 phenotypic measures for each fish. We denote measure i in fish n as x<sub>i</sub><sup>n</sup> (i = 1 to 600 and n = 1 to 34). Next, we computed absolute Pearson correlation coefficients between each pair of measurements as |ρ<sub>i,j</sub>|=|cov(X<sub>i</sub>,X<sub>j</sub>)/(σ(X<sub>i</sub>)σ(X<sub>j</sub>))| where X<sub>i</sub>=[x<sub>i</sub><sup>1</sup>, x<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>,...,x<sub>i</sub><sup>34</sup>], X<sub>j</sub>=[x<sub>j</sub><sup>1</sup>, x<sub>j</sub><sup>2</sup>,...,x<sub>j</sub><sup>34</sup>], cov is the covariance, and σ is the standard deviation.

In general, we observed extremely high correlations between values attained at the two scanning resolutions, with R<sup>2</sup> values ranging from 0.98 to &gt;0.99.

This deviation from unity is likely to due to partial volume effects (PVEs; an inherent property of microCT images that emerges from projecting a continuous object onto a discrete grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rittweger et al., 2004</xref>]). However, due to the high correlation in measurements attained at each resolution, we observed minimal impact of PVEs on sensitivity in discriminating mutant phenotypes, as t-tests for differences in single vertebrae between WT and <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish yielded similar p-values regardless of scan resolution used (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> for values).

We hypothesized that assessing vertebral patterns with the global test would provide greater sensitivity in distinguishing mutant populations compared to (a) t-tests of individual vertebrae, and (b) t-tests of quantities averaged across all vertebrae. Note that for the rest of the manuscript, we restrict our analysis to the 16 anterior-most vertebrae; this set of vertebrae contains both high (~8) and low (~8) haemal arch volumes (e.g., see Figure 5F). For each combination of element/trait (e.g., Cent.TMD), we computed the power of the global test when assessing this measure in vertebrae 1–16, and compared it to t-tests of this measure in vertebra 2, or t-tests of this measure when averaged across vertebrae 1–16.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we performed Monte Carlo simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). We first examined the potential to model the pattern of each combination of skeletal element/trait (e.g., Cent.TMD) for k = 16 vertebrae using a multivariate normal distribution. We analyzed n = 16 WT fish (SL: 20.4 ± 0.9 mm) from the same clutch, and performed Royston tests for multivariate normality for each combination of skeletal element/trait. For these studies we limited our analyses to subsets of k = 8 vertebrae (Group A: Vert 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15; Group B: and Vert 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16) so that the number of variables was less than the sample size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). The majority of phenotypic features (21 out of 25) were associated with non-significant p-values in both groups, suggesting these data exhibited multivariate normality. The four phenotypic features associated with significant p-values in either group -- Cent.Th, Neur.Th, Haem.Th.sd, and Cent.Le -- were excluded from the rest of our Monte Carlo simulations. Next, for each combination of skeletal element/trait we computed means (denoted by µ<sub>i</sub><sup>WT</sup>, where µ<sub>i</sub> is the mean in vertebra i) and covariances (denoted by ∑<sub>ij</sub><sup>WT</sup>, where ∑<sub>ij</sub> is the covariance between vertebra i and vertebra j) for k = 16 vertebrae. These parameter estimates were used to construct multivariate normal distributions for Monte Carlo simulations (≥10,000 simulations per analysis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For each analysis, we constructed two multivariate normal distributions: (1) a WT distribution using means µ<sub>i</sub><sup>WT</sup>, and (2) a ‘simulated’ mutant distribution using means µ<sub>i</sub><sup>WT</sup>+ d*σ<sub>i</sub><sup>WT</sup> (where d is a characteristic effect size, and σ<sub>i</sub> is the standard deviation in vertebra i). Covariances were assumed to be equal in both distributions, and set to ∑<sub>ij</sub><sup>WT</sup>. We first estimated the power of the global test in discriminating high Tot.TMD in simulated mutant fish as a function of sample size and alpha value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For these simulations, we assumed a characteristic effect size of d = 4, since in the <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants from the previous section, Tot.TMD was increased ~4 standard deviations above the mean in each vertebra. We found that a power of &gt;0.8 was attained with a sample size of n = 3, 4, and 5 fish/group for alpha values of 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively. Next, using a sample size of n = 3 fish/group and alpha = 0.05, we estimated test sensitivity (fraction of times in which p&lt;0.05 when comparing simulated mutant fish to WT fish) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and specificity (1 - fraction of times in which p&lt;0.05 when comparing WT to WT fish) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) for (a) the global test (using vertebrae 1:16), (b) t-tests of averaged quantities (using the mean of vertebrae 1:16), and (c) t-tests of individual vertebrae (using vertebra 2). We found that the global test conferred higher sensitivity, with similar specificity, compared to t-tests of averaged quantities as well as t-tests of individual vertebrae. For instance, at alpha = 0.05, the sensitivity of the global test, t-test of individual vertebrae, and t-test of averaged quantities was 0.96, 0.89, and 0.91. At alpha = 0.01, the sensitivity of the global test, t-test of individual vertebrae, and t-test of averaged quantities was 0.67, 0.43, and 0.46 (respectively). Specificity values were consistent with those predicted from specified levels of alpha: as an example, at alpha = 0.01, specificity was 0.99 in all three cases.

We found that the global test conferred higher power compared to t-tests of averaged quantities and t-tests of individual vertebrae, with the relative increase greatest at small characteristic effect sizes (e.g.,~1.4 to 1.5 fold greater at an effect size of 0.5, compared to ~1.2 fold greater at an effect size of 3). Higher sensitivity in the global test was also observed when we extended our analysis to other phenotypic features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we examined the effects of non-uniform phenotypic abnormalities on test sensitivity. Specifically, we constructed a new simulated mutant distribution using means µ<sub>i</sub><sup>WT</sup>+ d<sub>i</sub>*σ<sub>i</sub><sup>WT</sup>, where d<sub>i</sub>=[(i-1)/(k-1)]*d is the characteristic effect size at vertebra i, and k is the total number of vertebrae analyzed. We set d = 4 and k = 16 such that the characteristic effect size at each vertebra linearly varies from d<sub>1</sub> = 0 to d<sub>16</sub> = 4. Using this ‘high anterior’ pattern, the differences in test sensitivity became magnified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). For instance, for Cent.TMD, sensitivity of the global test was ~2 fold that of t-tests of averaged quantities, and ~18 fold that of t-tests of individual vertebra. Notably, our studies also suggested that power in the global test is affected by the assumed phenotypic pattern. For example, for Cent.TMD, sensitivity for the global test using a non-uniform pattern was 0.71, compared to 0.96 for a uniform pattern (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>We sought to corroborate the above findings using an independent experimental cohort. Specifically, we used the n = 3 <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and sibling WT controls (<italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) from the previous section to construct two multivariate normal distributions: 1) a WT distribution using means µ<sub>i</sub><sup>bmp1a+/+</sup> and covariances ∑<sub>ij</sub><sup>bmp1a+/+</sup>, and 2) a mutant distribution using means µ<sub>i</sub><sup>bmp1a-/-</sup> and covariances ∑<sub>ij</sub><sup>bmp1a-/-</sup>, and repeated Monte Carlo simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–I</xref>). Note that these sibling controls are identified as <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> to distinguish them from the WT fish used for the Monte Carlo simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–G</xref>. Consistent with our analyses using simulated mutants, we found that when using parameter estimates from <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants, the global test conferred higher sensitivity, with similar specificity, compared to t-tests of averaged quantities as well as t-tests of individual vertebrae, even when the latter was performed at higher resolution. For instance, for Cent.TMD (and assuming n = 3 and alpha = 0.05), the sensitivity of the global test, t-test of individual vertebrae, and t-test of averaged quantities was 0.89, 0.80, and 0.78, and specificity was 0.95, 0.96, and 0.96. Similar results were observed for Tot.TMD, Haem.TMD, and Neur.TMD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Identification of novel phenotypic features in known axial skeletal mutants</title><p>In employing zebrafish as a predictive model of human skeletal gene function it is important to understand how zebrafish mutant skeletal phenotypes relate to orthologous mutations associated with human genetic bone disorders.

In analyzing mutants that exhibit differences in body size (e.g., <italic>plod2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants exhibited severely diminished body size compared to WT siblings), it is difficult to discriminate to what degree altered phenotypes are attributable to differences in developmental progress, versus specific effects on skeletal function. Furthermore, although morphological developmental milestones can sometimes allow staging despite genotype-specific differences in size and growth during the larval-to-adult transformation, few such milestones have been identified, particularly during later stages. In addition, some milestones are themselves skeletal traits, necessitating an alternative approach. To help address these challenges, we developed allometric models to control for effects of body size during phenomic analysis. To model each phenotypic feature in WT fish as a function of standard length, we used a standard power-law relationship for allometric modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lleonart et al., 2000</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>y</italic> is the feature of interest, <italic>x</italic> is standard length, and <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are empirically-derived parameters. The scaling exponent <italic>b</italic> is directly interpretable when quantities are associated with mass, length, area, and volume. Thus, we converted TMD to a mass-based quantity by computing tissue mineral content (TMC, mgHA) as the product of volume and TMD in each skeletal element (e.g., Cent.TMC = Cent.Vol*Cent.TMD). To attain estimates of a and b for WT animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), we performed an ontogenetic series by profiling n = 16 WT fish over a range of standard lengths (18.4 mm to 31.8 mm), and fit these data to the power-law relationship to estimate a and b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Convergence analyses demonstrated that model parameters were relatively invariant when more than ~10 samples were included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Fig 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that our use of n = 16 samples was sufficient to provide reliable model parameter estimates. In general, we found that most features significantly deviated from isometric growth (i.e., proportional relationships were not preserved with growth) with respect to standard length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>). Specifically, features associated with thickness and volume exhibited negative allometry (scaling exponents lower than those expected for isometric growth), while TMC exhibited positive allometry.</p><p>Next, we used the following relationship to normalize for allometric effects of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lleonart et al., 2000</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where y is the feature of interest, x is standard length, x* is a reference standard length, and y* is the transformed value.

When we applied this relationship to the phenomic profiles from the WT animals in our ontogenetic series (using the mean standard length of all WT fish as the reference standard length), we found that the coefficient of variability was substantially reduced compared to unnormalized values, as well as when quantities were normalized by an alternate transformation, 1/SL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26014.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Allometric normalization for differences in body size.</title><p>Data are shown for the first precaudal vertebra of n = 6 WT fish of different standard lengths.

We profiled ~30,000 data points derived from ~3600 skeletal elements in wildtype fish of different degrees of developmental progress as well as mutant lines associated with human disease. Our studies reveal virtues of deep phenotyping in a single, complex organ system.</p><p>A challenge to the analysis of high-dimensional phenotypic data is the curse of dimensionality: when testing for changes in each feature individually, as a consequence of multiple testing correction, the number of samples required for a statistically reliable result increases exponentially with the number of features assessed. In lieu of analyzing each feature in isolation, we examined whether patterns of element/outcome combinations varied across vertebral bodies were altered in mutant populations. In Monte Carlo simulations, when holding alpha constant, power in the global test was consistently higher compared to t-tests of averaged quantities and t-tests of individual vertebrae, with the relative increase in power greatest at small effect sizes. Further, simulated levels of specificity were consistent with specified values of alpha. Our studies suggest that vertebral phenomic patterns may confer enhanced sensitivity in discriminating mutant phenotypes relative to analyzing individual vertebrae. This attribute may increase productivity in genetic screens, as well as provide opportunities to study genetic variants of smaller effect size, such as those which underlie the overwhelming majority of complex diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibson, 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that while our workflow is highly sensitive in discriminating mutants that exhibit subtle phenotypic alterations in a large number of bones, other scan resolutions and statistical testing may be appropriate in some cases. For instance, while we found that scans acquired at 21 µm and 10.5 µm resolution were comparable in their analysis of <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants, it is possible that other mutant lines may present extremely small, thin, or hypomineralized structures that require greater scanning resolution to resolve. In this context, while increasing nominal resolution did not increase power in detecting mutant phenotypes in <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants, these findings are not generalizable to all mutant phenotypes. Indeed, if changes in mutants are of a feature size much smaller than the scan resolution, increasing scan resolution would very likely increase assay sensitivity. Further, given the fact that the global test exhibits optimal power when many features exhibit minor changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goeman et al., 2006</xref>), our workflow will be most optimal when there are many small changes in a large number of vertebrae, while other statistical tests may be more powerful when testing for larger effects in a small number of vertebrae. Finally, the acquisition of additional high-resolution scans in select vertebrae may be desirable to safeguard against the possibility of missing phenotypic abnormalities that could escape detection at lower resolution.</p><p>Our studies make at least two contributions toward enabling rapid throughput analysis across a variety of different mutants/backgrounds -- (1) developing the ability to analyze microCT images in less than 5 min/fish using FishCuT, and (2) demonstrating proof-of-concept of the ability to acquire whole-spinal microCT scans at 5 min/fish, if eight fish are scanned simultaneously. Nonetheless, several practical issues must be considered before broad application. This includes designing specimen holders with optimal animal packing (e.g., scanning eight fish simultaneously requires the fish to be physically touching, preventing automatic segmentation). In addition, potential imaging artifacts associated with highly multiplexed scanning strategies need to be characterized. For instance, when scanning two fish at a time, we are able to position each fish equidistant from the scan center. This minimizes potential for erroneous measurements due to beam hardening artifacts in the radial direction. When scanning eight fish at a time this is not possible, and thus effects from beam hardening artifacts could be more significant. Finally, it should be noted that analysis of microCT scans using FishCuT typically takes less than 5 min per animal; this throughput is most likely to be useful for reverse genetic screens requiring analysis of hundreds of specimens, rather than extremely large forward genetic screens where ~ 10,000 animals may require analysis.</p><p>By phenotyping <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>plod2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants, our studies shed new light on multivariate phenotypes in the zebrafish skeleton associated with human skeletal disease. While <italic>bmp1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>plod2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants exhibited differing effects on indices of bone mass and microarchitecture, both mutants exhibited high TMD. This phenotype is consistent with the bone over-mineralization that is a hallmark of brittle bone disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bishop, 2016</xref>). While <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants exhibit increased TMD in all vertebral compartments (centrum, haemal arch, and neural arch), <italic>plod2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish exhibit high TMD in the centrum only. Further, the elevation in Haem.TMD in <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants was focused primarily to anteriorly-located vertebrae. Phenotypic abnormalities in human OI has been shown to vary among patients and anatomical site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cassella et al., 1996</xref>). The segregation of phenotypic abnormalities to different anatomical sites is likely to provide important clues into disease pathology; our workflow provides a unifying framework to systematically analyze the mechanistic basis of site-specific segregation of phenotypic abnormalities.</p><p>Our Monte Carlo simulations suggest two different cases in which analyzing vertebral phenotypic patterns via the global test confers enhanced sensitivity relative to t-tests of quantities averaged across vertebrae: (1) when the characteristic effect size of a phenotypic feature is uniformly elevated across all vertebrae, or (2) when the characteristic effect size is linearly elevated across vertebrae. In this context, of the three mutants that we analyzed in-depth (<italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, <italic>plod2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, and <italic>opallus</italic>), 2 out of 3 these mutants exhibited at least one phenotypic measure that was non-uniformly across vertebrae (i.e., Haem.TMD in <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants, and Neur.Vol in <italic>opallus</italic>). For such cases, analyzing each vertebra has clear potential to provide non-redundant phenotypic information. There are other contexts in which non-uniform phenotypic abnormalities may be expected. For instance, genetic mosaicism generated within a CRISPR-based reverse genetic screen in F0 zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shah et al., 2015</xref>) or an overexpression screen may manifest as different degrees of phenotypic penetrance and expressivity in each vertebral body. In this context, we are currently using both simulation as well as experimental approaches to explore the sensitivity of our workflow in discriminating mutant populations that exhibit variable phenotypic penetrance and expressivity both between and within individuals. Another instance in which non-uniform phenotypic abnormalities may arise is under environmental influences such as mechanical loading. Both non-uniform adaptation to swimming activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fiaz et al., 2012</xref>) as well as site-specific susceptibility to lordosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kranenbarg et al., 2005</xref>) have been demonstrated in the teleost spine. In unpublished studies we have expanded our analysis of zebrafish mutants whose orthologs are associated with human brittle bone disease; these studies suggest that mutations in genes that influence bone mechanical integrity may be most phenotypically penetrant in vertebrae that experience the highest mechanical loading.</p><p>Since developmental progress in zebrafish is more closely related to standard length than to age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parichy et al., 2009</xref>), the interpretation of mutant phenotypes can substantially differ depending on whether mutants are compared to age-matched WT siblings (which may differ in standard length and thus developmental progress), or non-sibling WT animals matched by standard length (which could mask genetic alterations on developmental progress, and exhibit greater variation in genetics and environmental influences). In high-throughput settings where resource conservation is critical, it is not practical to dedicate resources for both experimental comparisons. Our studies demonstrate that allometric modeling is effective in transforming WT sibling data to a ‘virtual’ phenome scaled to the mean standard length of age-matched mutants, providing a computational means to enable both length- and age-matched fish comparisons from a single control group. Using this approach, we identified expanded centrum diameter in <italic>plod2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants. In mammals, cortical expansion arises due to bone remodeling, with bone formation on the periosteal surface coupled with resorption on the endosteal surface. It is unknown whether the increased centrum diameter in <italic>plod2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants is attributable to accelerated bone remodeling.</p><p>In addition to identifying novel phenotypes in known skeletal mutants, we also identified a novel axial skeletal mutant, <italic>opallus</italic>, harboring a TSHR gain-of-function mutation. Excess TSHR activity has been associated with high BMD in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Lloyd et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, unlike <italic>plod2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants, <italic>opallus</italic> exhibited high TMD in the presence of mostly normal bone mass and morphology, providing evidence of the potential for these traits to be decoupled in zebrafish mutants. More broadly, we propose that expanding our initial analyses of zebrafish mutant phenomes whose orthologs are associated with mammalian bone mass and mineral accrual is likely to facilitate the identification of novel regulators of human bone mass, as well as identify phenotypic signatures in zebrafish that are predictive of human skeletal disease.</p><p>A future challenge is to increase the content and throughput of our approach. Since FishCuT supports the DICOM standard, it is readily ported to other microCT systems. In this context, commercial microCT systems optimized for rapid throughput imaging (e.g., through the use larger detectors to increase the number of animals per field of view, higher power x-ray sources to decrease sampling time per image, and robot-based sample changing systems) have been shown to increase imaging throughput by 10 fold or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wyatt et al., 2015</xref>). Further, Mader <italic>et al</italic>. described a high-throughput, fully automatic system for synchrotron-based tomographic microscopy that enabled analysis of 1300 mouse femurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mader et al., 2015</xref>). In regard to image analysis, machine learning-based approaches enable fully automated localization of boundaries of vertebral bodies in human CT/MR data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2015</xref>), and such an approach might be used to automate seeding of segment boundaries, particularly if analysis is restricted to mutants that do not exhibit severe dysmorphic phenotypes. Finally, a long-term challenge is to extend analysis to other skeletal structures, including the craniofacial skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pardo-Martin et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, as microCT scans are archived, these image libraries can be retroactively analyzed as new algorithms are developed, and re-analyzed to identify new genotype-to-phenotype associations.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a sensitive workflow for microCT-based skeletal phenomics in adult zebrafish. Our studies provide a foundation to systematically map genotype-to-phenome relationships in zebrafish as a path to advance our understanding of the genetic basis of adult skeletal health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish rearing</title><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All studies were performed on an approved protocol (#4306–01) in accordance with the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Zebrafish were housed at a temperature of 28°C on a 14:10 hr light:dark photoperiod. Studies were conducted in mixed sex adult zebrafish. WT ARO and AB fish were obtained from Aquatic Research Organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Recidoro et al., 2014</xref>) and the Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zebrafish.org">http://zebrafish.org</ext-link>), respectively. <italic>opallus<sup>b1071</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>pissarro<sup>utr8e1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quigley et al., 2004</xref>) were isolated in forward genetic screens. <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>sa2416</sup> and <italic>plod2</italic><sup>sa1768</sup> mutant zebrafish were generated by the Zebrafish Mutation Project (ZMP) and obtained from ZIRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kettleborough et al., 2013</xref>). For all mutant lines, heterozygous mutant zebrafish were incrossed to obtain homozygous mutants. All fish were housed in plastic tanks on a commercial recirculating aquaculture system. At the desired time point, zebrafish were euthanized by MS-222 overdose or immersion in ice water. For storage, fish were either frozen at −20°C, or fixed in 4% PFA. Comparisons were only performed in fish subjected to the same storage procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>MicroCT scanning</title><p>MicroCT scanning was performed using a vivaCT40 (Scanco Medical, Switzerland). Medium-resolution scans (21 µm voxel resolution) were acquired using the following settings: 55kVp, 145μA, 1024 samples, 500proj/180°, 200 ms integration time. High-resolution scans (10.5 µm voxel resolution) were acquired using the following settings: 55kVp, 145μA, 2048 samples, 1000proj/180°, 200 ms integration time. DICOM files of individual fish were generated using Scanco software, and analyzed using the custom software described below. In general, at least two fish were scanned simultaneously in each acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image processing methods were implemented as custom software developed in MATLAB (scripts were tested in v2016.a). To encourage open-source development, we implemented the MIJI package to enable calls to libraries and functions developed in FIJI/ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Further, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate user interaction. Example DICOM images (the <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants and clutchmate controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) are available on the Dryad data repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.pm41d">http://datadryad.org/review?doi=doi:10.5061/dryad.pm41d</ext-link>).</p><p>Analysis consists of several stages. Stage 1 consists of preprocessing, for which we have implemented a preprocessing module in which the user is able to specify a rotation along the anteroposterior axis to orient specimens to an upright position. This module also enables slice-by-slice visualization, as well as mean or maximum intensity projections of unprocessed DICOM images.</p><p>Stage 2 consists of thresholding. In general, we have found that fish within and across clutches can exhibit significant differences in mineralization, and thus cannot be reliably analyzed using a uniform threshold value. Thus, we calculate thresholds for each animal using a semi-automatic approach. To filter out background, the user draws a ROI outlining the fish in a maximum intensity projection, all values outside this region of interest are set to 0, and the threshold is calculated using the IsoData algorithm in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goeman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goeman et al., 2004</xref>). The threshold value may be adjusted by multiplying it by a correction factor to provide more conservative or stringent thresholding, depending on user needs. Based on a comparison of user defined thresholds and those computed using the approach described above, we multiplied the IsoData threshold by 0.73 across all experiments.</p><p>Stage 3 consists of vertebral segmentation. Our approach is to isolate individual vertebrae so that each vertebra is composed of one or more connected components that do not contain voxels from different vertebra. The user initiates planes of separation between vertebra by drawing a ‘separation line’ between each pair of centra. Voxels within a plane defined by the separation line are set to 0, the connected components are computed, and connected component labels are tallied for each of the two volumes separated by the plane. If the connected components with the plurality of votes in the two regions are distinct, the algorithm stops; otherwise, the separation line is extended, and the process repeated. While we found this approach robustly separated centra in all samples (including those that exhibited significant morphological deficits, see below), we encountered some cases in which ribs close to pterygiophores and associated fin rays would be considered as a single connected structure. In this case, we have implemented a manual ‘cutting’ tool to provide the user with the ability to sever connections between skeletal elements.</p><p>Stage 4 consists of vertebral assignment. Here, the user identifies each vertebrae’s components using a user-interactive, color-coded map of connected components.</p><p>Stage 5 consists of neural arch, centrum, and haemal arch segmentation. Using a supervised algorithm, FishCuT creates 3D image masks of the three regions for each vertebral body. The 3D masks are formed in part by utilizing the user’s inputs to the separation-plane growing algorithm, i.e. the endpoints of the line separating adjacent centra. We create the 3D neural arch mask as the entire region above the line extended between the two upper-most inputs for a vertebra. The centrum mask is defined by the region inside all four points for a vertebra. We include an adjustable buffer, with a default of five voxels, surrounding the centrum mask. The haemal arch mask is defined by substracting the region of the vertebrae from the regions defined by the centrum and neural arch masks. All segmentations can be visually inspected from an outputted image file containing colored-coded regions superimposed on the original image.</p><p>Stage 6 is the calculation of phenotypic features. Local thickness is computed using a model-independent method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hildebrand and Ruegsegger, 1997</xref>) implemented as the Local Thickness plugin in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dougherty and Kunzelmann, 2007</xref>). Volume and surface area were computed using the <italic>nnz</italic> and <italic>bwperim</italic> functions in MATLAB. TMD was computed using the following relationship: mgHA/cm<sup>3</sup> = (x/4096)*slope + intercept, where x = the pixel intensity in the DICOM image, and the values for slope (281.706) and intercept (−195.402) were acquired during scanner calibration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For mutant fish with a known axial skeletal phenotype (<italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>plod2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>), results are reported from a single experiment; for mutant fish with a newly identified axial skeletal phenotype, results are reported from two experiments (an initial screen with n = 2 fish/group, followed by follow up analysis with n = 5 fish/group). Each biological replicate represents one technical replicate. Outliers were not identified in the study. All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism or R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Team RC, 2015</xref>). For comparisons of medium and high scanning resolution, linear regressions were performed with intercept set to zero. Two tailed t-tests with unequal variances were used for univariate analysis between two groups.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>In general, all three reviewers felt this is an important contribution to the field, since it allows the zebrafish to be more readily used for analysis of complex phenotypes. Broadly, this falls under the category of phenomics, a rapidly growing field across multiple disciplines. The methodology and algorithms implemented here are well-executed and appear technically sound. However, the reviewers also felt that the authors tended to overstate their findings, and that they did not truly demonstrate that this could be used for high throughput analysis across many different mutants/backgrounds. Several times they refer to their approach as &quot;whole-body&quot; phenotyping; even with respect to the skeleton, they are not looking at the whole body, but only to a limited portion (the axial skeleton), of uniform embryological origin. They also say they are looking at &quot;hundreds&quot; of traits. This is only accurate if you count each aspect of each vertebra as a unique trait. For example, I would argue that tissue mineral density almost certainly is not unique for each vertebra, but rather varies systematically as one aspect of a mutant phenoptype. In addition, as detailed below, there are some questions regarding both the sensitivity and resolution of their methods, and how easily it can be generalized for new users. By addressing these concerns, we believe the paper will be greatly improved.</p><p>Essential required revisions:</p><p>1) Given the methods focus of this manuscript, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are critical to the conclusions of the study. There are several concerns regarding this figure.a) The authors utilize Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the power, sensitivity, and specificity of their method. However, important details regarding this simulation are absent. In particular, what type of probability distribution was used for the simulation? What evidence do the authors have that the measured phenotype (total TMD) follows this distribution function in wild type zebrafish? Are 3 fish per arm sufficient to support the assumption that this is the true probability distribution function, and to reliably measure it? If this cannot be justified, the authors should include additional fish in this analysis. Given that the authors describe their method as &quot;enabling rapid (&lt;5min/fish), whole body profiling,&quot; it is surprising that only 3 fish per arm were used for this figure. This is particularly concerning for panel 4F, in which two groups of n=2 are being sampled from a population of 3 fish.</p><p>b) While the authors devote considerable attention to total TMD, it is unclear how this test performs for other phenotypic measures. Does their method also provide increased sensitivity with similar specificity for other measures? An exploration of additional measures should be included to provide a more complete picture of the performance of this assay.</p><p>2) The authors clearly demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that for the second pre-caudal vertebrae there is a strong linear relationship between data acquired at high and medium resolution. In order to demonstrate how robust this relationship is across all vertebrae, the authors should provide a summary panel. For example, they could generate a plot analogous to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> using r-squared values instead of correlation coefficients.</p><p>3) One of the assumptions of removing allometric effects as the authors have done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> is that, as stated in Lleonart, Salat and Torres, 2000 &quot;the available observations cover different values of X and it is recommended that sampling should cover systematically the entire range of variation of X in order to get good estimates of a and b.&quot; Related to the point discussed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors should address (and provide evidence) whether n=3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) is sufficient to meet this criteria. If not, additional fish should be included in order to accurately account for allometric effects.</p><p>4) The authors should provide example data along with their FishCuT source code to allow readers to better understand the method when attempting to implement it for their own data.</p><p>5) Zebrafish have the potential for use in overexpression screens, where phenotypes would exist as gradations instead of binary outcomes. Have the authors ever looked at fish with an overexpression phenotype where the phenotype is variable or incompletely penetrant? How robust is their analytic method to this type of data? This would be useful for ensuring the broad applicability of the method, but is not a requirement for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26014.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General comments:</p><p>In general, all three reviewers felt this is an important contribution to the field, since it allows the zebrafish to be more readily used for analysis of complex phenotypes.

However, the latter was a proof-of-concept study only, and several practical issues will need to be considered before broad application. This includes designing specimen holders with optimal animal packing (e.g., scanning 8 fish simultaneously requires the fish to be physically touching, and thus is not amenable to automatic segmentation), and characterizing potential imaging artifacts. We are actively exploring these issues, and plan to publish results from these studies in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several times they refer to their approach as &quot;whole-body&quot; phenotyping; even with respect to the skeleton, they are not looking at the whole body, but only to a limited portion (the axial skeleton), of uniform embryological origin.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed instances of &quot;whole-body&quot; and &quot;organism-scale&quot; phenotyping in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They also say they are looking at &quot;hundreds&quot; of traits.

We have clarified that we used a multivariate normal distribution for our simulations. For the revised manuscript, to support the use of this distribution, we scanned a large cohort (n=16) of WT fish (all from the same clutch), and performed Royston tests for multivariate normality. We report the results from these tests in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are 3 fish per arm sufficient to support the assumption that this is the true probability distribution function, and to reliably measure it? If this cannot be justified, the authors should include additional fish in this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important, yet challenging, comment. We explored setting our sample size requirements to improve the accuracy of parameter estimates. Using formulas derived by Webb et al. (Am. Stat., 2010, 64(3): 257-262), for any single phenotypic measurement (assuming it is normally distributed), improving accuracy of parameter estimation by 10% with a reasonable probability (85%) would require an additional k=60 samples. As noted by Webb et al., in general, setting sample size requirements to improve accuracy of parameter estimation – with a reasonable probability – leads to alarmingly high sample sizes. Thus, we deemed that addressing this concern through increasing our sample size was impractical.</p><p>In light of this challenge, our strategy to corroborate our Monte Carlo simulations in <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants was to perform an alternate method of testing using probability distribution functions (pdfs) that were derived completely independently of the <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> samples. Specifically, using the data from the n=16 WT fish analyzed in our first response to Essential required revisions 1a, we simulated a range of phenotypic abnormalities and performed tests of assay sensitivity and specificity (revised panels 4A-4G). An important virtue of our revised approach is that we are now able to simulate different phenotypic abnormalities that are not observed in <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants, including different patterns of phenotypic alterations, and changes in phenotypic features that were unaffected by bmp1a mutation. In this context, our simulations in <italic>bmp1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants now serve to corroborate our main findings, rather than to function as the primary tests of assay sensitivity. Importantly, the congruence between revised panels 4A-4G and panels 4H-4I, whose pdfs were derived from independent samples, suggests that findings from each approach are valid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the authors describe their method as &quot;enabling rapid (&lt;5min/fish), whole body profiling,&quot; it is surprising that only 3 fish per arm were used for this figure.

In this context, our new studies performed in our second response to Essential required revisions 1a now make panel 4F somewhat redundant. Since panel 4F employed methods that were less rigorous and somewhat unconventional, we have decided to remove these data from the revised manuscript. However, we are prepared to re-add these data as a supplementary figure if requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) While the authors devote considerable attention to total TMD, it is unclear how this test performs for other phenotypic measures.

An exploration of additional measures should be included to provide a more complete picture of the performance of this assay.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our first response to Essential required revisions 1a, we have revised our approach to enable evaluation of sensitivity across all phenotypic features and for multiple phenotypic patterns. In revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> we describe assay performance across multiple features; a comprehensive summary of assay performance is now included as part of Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors clearly demonstrate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that for the second pre-caudal vertebrae there is a strong linear relationship between data acquired at high and medium resolution.

Note that we were unable to extend our analysis to all vertebrae due to the fact that acquiring whole-body scans at high-resolution is computationally prohibitive. However, in the three vertebrae we analyzed, we found virtually identical results, suggesting our results are generalizable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One of the assumptions of removing allometric effects as the authors have done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> is that, as stated in Lleonart, Salat and Torres, 2000 &quot;the available observations cover different values of X and it is recommended that sampling should cover systematically the entire range of variation of X in order to get good estimates of a and b.&quot; Related to the point discussed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors should address (and provide evidence) whether n=3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) is sufficient to meet this criteria. If not, additional fish should be included in order to accurately account for allometric effects.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we have clarified that once estimates of a and b are obtained in a comprehensive sample of WT animals, they can be applied to other WT fish in experimental groups of an arbitrary sample size, such as the n=3 WT fish in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. In the original manuscript, a and b were estimated from n=12 fish. In the revised manuscript, we have analyzed additional fish to increase our sample size to n=16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), providing a more uniform sampling over different standard lengths. Finally, we have included new convergence analyses suggesting that our use of n=16 samples was sufficient to provide reliable model parameter estimates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should provide example data along with their FishCuT source code to allow readers to better understand the method when attempting to implement it for their own data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included example microCT data by uploading DICOM files to Dryad (data will be published at time of paper acceptance).
