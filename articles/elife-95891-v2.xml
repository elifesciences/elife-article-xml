However, information at a single-cell level on root-specific secondary metabolism remains largely unexplored. <sc>L</sc>-Theanine, an important quality component of tea, is primarily synthesized in roots, from which it is then transported to new shoots of tea plant. In this study, we present a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-derived map for the tea plant root, which enabled cell-type-specific analysis of glutamate and ethylamine (two precursors of theanine biosynthesis) metabolism, and theanine biosynthesis, storage, and transport. Our findings support a model in which the theanine biosynthesis pathway occurs via multicellular compartmentation and does not require high co-expression levels of transcription factors and their target genes within the same cell cluster. This study provides novel insights into theanine metabolism and regulation, at the single-cell level, and offers an example for studying root-specific secondary metabolism in other plant systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>theanine</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd><kwd>root development</kwd><kwd><italic>Camellia sinensis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFF1003103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Xiaochun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFD1601101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhaoliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32072624</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhaoliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Anhui Provincial Major Science and Technology Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202103b06020024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Tianyuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Anhui Educational Committee Excellent Youth Talent Support project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>gxyqZD2022018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Tianyuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single-cell RNA sequencing reveals cell heterogeneity of secondary metabolism in tea plant root and a proposed model in which the theanine biosynthesis pathway occurs via multicellular compartmentation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Different root cell types produce diverse and complex secondary metabolites in response to environmental and developmental clues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shaw et al., 2021</xref>); furthermore, such secondary metabolites can also participate in environmental adaptation and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garcia-Lemos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hartman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santelia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schulz-Bohm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steppuhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2017</xref>).

Tea plants produce and accumulate extensive amounts of secondary metabolites, including theanine, catechins, and caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). These secondary metabolites confer tea with both unique flavor and multiple health benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Theanine, a non-protein amino acid, endows the ‘umami’ taste and relaxing effect of the tea infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). It is the most abundant free amino acid in the tea plant, accounting for 1–2% dry weight of the tender shoots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).

Ala can be decarboxylated, by alanine decarboxylase (CsAlaDC), to produce ethylamine (EA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>), which can then be combined with Glu, through the action of theanine synthase (CsTSI), to producetheanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">She, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). The high level of EA availability is likely a key factor in the elevated accumulation of theanine in tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, in the tea plant, CsAlaDC and CsTSI are both indispensable for theanine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Theanine synthesis is tightly regulated, at multiple levels, especially at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2022</xref>); CsMYB6 bound to the <italic>CsTSI</italic> promoter can regulate theanine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2021c</xref>). Furthermore, CsMYB40 and CsHHO3 bound to the <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> promoter can regulate theanine synthesis in ‘accelerator’ or ‘brake’ mode, respectively, in response to N levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). Theanine transporters, including the tonoplast-localized CsCAT2 and plasma membrane-localized CsAAPs, have been proposed to mediate in theanine storage within the root and root-to-shoot transport, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, in response to N status in tea plant roots, theanine may affect apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation to regulate lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Taken together, these studies have partially revealed the mechanisms for theanine synthesis, transport, and regulation, but information on the specific root cell types involved in these processes is lacking.</p><p>Recently, with the in-depth study of biological structure and function, it has become increasingly clear that differences exist in gene expression levels between cells, even if they appear to be within the same cell population. Bulk RNA-seq can be employed to investigate the average level of gene expression within whole tissues, whereas single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can capture single cells, from whole tissues, to detect the heterogeneity of cells, and obtain information on gene expression within single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shaw et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, scRNA-seq provides a powerful approach to elucidate the potential involvement of cell heterogeneity in secondary metabolism in tea plant roots. Currently, scRNA-seq has been performed in several plants, including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>), and <italic>Zea mays</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nelms and Walbot, 2019</xref>). Importantly, algorithms are available to decode the cellular regulatory codes from scRNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becht et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haghverdi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haghverdi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>), and these databases can provide a critical foundation for analyzing the cellular-based information on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In plants, scRNA-seq has yet to be used for studying root-specific secondary metabolism. In this study, using high-throughput scRNA-seq, we analyzed the cell heterogeneity of theanine metabolism and regulation in the tea plant root.

In contrast, <italic>CsAAP1</italic> was expressed primarily in Cluster 4 (cortex and endodermal cells).

Above regulatory relationships all have a common feature, the TFs and their target genes were highly expressed in different cell types.</p><p>Next, to further explore whether this regulatory relationship also exists in other plants, we analyzed expression of some TFs and their target genes in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, using published single-cell RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wendrich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denyer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jean-Baptiste et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shulse et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shahan et al., 2022</xref>) and databases (Root Cell Atlas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rootcellatlas.org/">https://rootcellatlas.org/</ext-link>; BAR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bar.utoronto.ca/#GeneExpressionAndProteinTools">https://bar.utoronto.ca/#GeneExpressionAndProteinTools</ext-link>).

Similar to the situation in tea plants, the regulators were not present in exactly the same cell types in which their target genes were highly expressed. For example, <italic>AtARF7</italic> and <italic>AtARF19</italic> were highly expressed in the cortex and stele, respectively, whereas their target genes <italic>AtLBD16</italic> and <italic>AtLBD29</italic> were highly expressed in endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Okushima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>); <italic>AtPHR1</italic> was highly expressed in root epidermal and pericyte cells, but its target gene <italic>AtF3’H</italic> was highly expressed in the cortex and <italic>AtRALF23</italic> was highly expressed in xylem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). In this hierarchical regulatory network, some TFs have multiple target genes, and TFs participate in multiple biological processes (root development, metabolism regulation, and plant immunity) through regulation of different target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Based on these findings, we hypothesized that, for the regulation of theanine biosynthesis, TFs and target genes are not necessarily always highly expressed in the same cells. Moreover, the regulation of theanine biosynthesis is probably coupled with the regulation of other biological processes. In the theanine biosynthesis pathway, CsAlaDC evolved a tea plant-specific activity in catalyzing EA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>), which is essential for theanine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> is highly and specifically express in tea plant roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>), and its expression levels were shown to be highly correlated with theanine content in the roots of various tea plant cultivars, and further, was under TF regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>).

The information regarding gene expression, in different type cells, is important with respect to establishing insights into both the mechanisms underlying these secondary metabolites and the regulatory events that control their syntheses. In this study, we performed a scRNA-seq-based study of tea plant roots, as an example, to elucidate the biosynthesis and regulatory processes for theanine, a root-specific secondary metabolite.

In the theanine biosynthesis pathway, and consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">She, 2022</xref>, our study established that <italic>CsTSI</italic> is expressed primarily in the pericycle cells (Cluster 8). We further clarified that <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> is generally expressed in the vasculature (Clusters 1). This differential enrichment of <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression suggests that EA and theanine are synthesized in different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), presumably reflecting multicellular compartmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for theanine biosynthesis, transport, and regulation at single-cell resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multicellular compartmentation of theanine biosynthesis. The high expression of <italic>CsTSI</italic> in pericycle cells suggests theanine is mainly synthesized in pericycle cells. <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> is highly expressed in cambium and protoxylem cells, suggesting that ethylamine (EA) is mainly synthesized in these cells. Thus, EA may move from cambium and protoxylem cells into pericycle cells, where it is a substrate for theanine biosynthesis. (<bold>B</bold>) In tea plant roots, CsAAP1 likely mediates in theanine retrieval from apoplast for its transport into cortical/endodermal cells. CsCAT2 imports theanine into vacuoles, especially in pericycle cells, which are the main cells for theanine biosynthesis. Theanine is exported, by an unidentified theanine exporter, from pericycle cells into the apoplastic pathway for entry into the xylem. (<bold>C</bold>) CsLBD37 co-regulates theanine biosynthesis and lateral root development. Increasing levels of nitrogen (N) promote theanine biosynthesis and accumulation. High accumulation of theanine and N induces <italic>CsLBD37</italic> expression. CsLBD37 inhibits <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression to reduce ethylamine synthesis, which finetunes theanine biosynthesis in feedback loop. Besides, <italic>CsLBD37</italic> is expressed in pericycle cells and also inhibits lateral root development. It is reported that apoplastic theanine can negatively regulate lateral root development, under high nitrogen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, CsLBD37 may also be involved in theanine-regulated lateral root development.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95891-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It is well known that theanine is the most abundant amino acid in the tea plant, and that theanine synthesis does not always occur, but is regulated to maintain growth and development in balance or adapted to environmental conditions. Indeed, the observed multicellular compartmentation may contribute to the regulation of theanine biosynthesis through precursor syntheses and transport within different cells. Thus, we propose a model in which multicellular compartmentation of theanine and its precursors functions like an innate design for regulation of secondary metabolism. This regulation model may be a way to avoid excessive or inhibition of theanine synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Compartmentalization of theanine biosynthesis may effectively prevent interference between secondary metabolic pathways. Similar mechanisms may also have evolved in other plants. We also cannot rule out that synthesis of theanine or EA can occur in the same cell type; after all, <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> are two of the most highly expressed genes in tea plant roots and their cell-type-specific expression partially overlapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In addition, the spatial distribution of theanine in the roots can be affected by transport processes. So, it is likely that the cell types in which theanine is distributed do not exactly correspond to the cell types in which theanine is synthesized.</p><p>On the other hand, multicellular compartmentation of theanine and its precursors EA implied EA transport from its location of biosynthetic into theanine biosynthetic cells. EA is a colorless gas, and hence it may be transported by way of simple diffusion, or via a gas channel. Perhaps aquaporins (AQPs), a class of channel proteins that transport water, gas, and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hachez and Chaumont, 2010</xref>), may be involved. At present, the mechanism of EA transport remains unknown, and the involvement of cell-type-specific AQPs would be worthy to explore in the future.</p><p>Previously, we identified theanine transporters acting in theanine root-to-shoot transport and theanine storage in the vacuole of tea plant root cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). In the current study, we elucidated the cell heterogeneity of theanine transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B and 8B</xref>), and among them <italic>CsAAP1</italic> is located primarily in cortical and endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E and 5B</xref>), and <italic>CsCAT2</italic> is co-expressed with <italic>CsTSI</italic> in the same cell type. This nicely reflects that CsAAP1 and CsCAT2 mediate in the physiological function of theanine transport and storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). However, these theanine transporters are all importers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). The exporter(s) mediating in theanine transport from the xylem parenchyma for loading into the xylem transpiration stream, within the roots, along with other theanine export processes in the shoot, remain to be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Combining the cell-type information, provided by scRNA-seq data, may assist in the identification of these specific-cell-located theanine exporter(s), and may also provide information for identifying amino acid exporters in other plant species. At present, all the exporters identified are bidirectional transporters, such as UMAMITs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besnard et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, specific-cell-located transporters, with bidirectional transport functions, could be potential theanine exporters.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The regulation of theanine biosynthesis at the single-cell level</title><p>Interestingly, genes highly correlated with <italic>CsTSI</italic> or <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> were identified, including some confirmed TFs (<italic>CsMYB6</italic>, <italic>CsMYB40</italic>, and <italic>CsHHO3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2021c</xref>), which were not always highly co-expressed in the same cell type.

Another possibility is that these theanine-associated genes are promiscuous, having many target genes and regulate multiple biological processes in tea plants. In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtARF7 and AtARF19 regulate <italic>AtLBD16</italic> and <italic>AtLBD29</italic>, thereby participating in the regulation root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Okushima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).

The highest expressed cell types of these regulators and target genes were different. Thus, TFs that regulate the theanine biosynthesis pathway may not always be co-express highly with their target genes, in the same cell type. Indeed, this point was confirmed in a subsequent study on CsLBD37 regulation of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression.</p><p>Of course, TFs also will regulate their target genes and are highly co-expressed in the same cell type. As an example, AtMYB12 activated <italic>AtCHS</italic> and they were both highly expressed in cortical cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stracke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).

Also, the processes of gene regulation may be dynamically changing. Some TFs, such as HY5, SHR, and TMO, can alter their expression in different cell types, due to their mobile characteristics or changes in cell differentiation and external conditions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ortiz-Ramírez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mankotia et al., 2024</xref>). In short, gene regulation is complicated at the single-cell level. This complexity includes the underlying nature of the biological processes involved, along with the complexity and dynamics of their regulatory mechanisms. In this regard, ScRNA-seq better enabled us to identify more details about gene regulation that were not previously noted.</p><p>To date, some identified TFs have been shown to play a role in the fine-regulation of <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression; however, the TFs that impart this <italic>CsTSI</italic> and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> root specificity and high expression remain to be identified.

Although hypomethylation in the promoters provides accessibility for transcription, activating TFs is still required for their high expression. In this regard, the current cell-type-specific expression database offers a valuable resource to identify such unknown TF activators. For example, root- and Cluster 1-specific CsMYB18 could well be an activator of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Crosstalk between theanine metabolism and root development</title><p>Recently, some TFs regulating <italic>CsTSI</italic> or <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> were identified and characterized and indicted that theanine regulates lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2021c</xref>); however, the molecular link between these processes was not elucidated.

In tea plant roots, theanine, PA metabolism and root development are also regulated by N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, <italic>CsLBD37</italic> was also N-inducible and was one of the most positively correlated TF encoding genes with <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This information provided important insights into the roles for <italic>CsLBD37</italic> in theanine biosynthesis and root development. In this study, we identified CsLBD37 as a repressor of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> transcription and root development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7 and 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). CsLBD37 may act in a similar manner to CsHHO3, namely through being a repressor of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> transcription to ‘brake’ theanine biosynthesis under high N availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we also revealed that <italic>CsLBD37</italic> probably inhibits lateral root development, at the root initial stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D–G</xref>), but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. <italic>CsLBD37</italic> expression could be induced by exogenous theanine treatment in tea seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2H</xref>). This implied that CsLBD37 may also be involved in a process by which theanine regulates lateral root development. Besides, it has been reported that LBD family TFs were regulated by, or interacted with, regulators of hormone pathways (e.g., ARF family TFs) to regulate the process of root morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). Based on these findings, we speculated that CsLBD37 is likely regulated by, or interacts with, other proteins to form a complex to regulate root development or theanine biosynthesis. Then, is <italic>CsLBD37</italic> involved in regulating root development through the hormones and ROS homeostasis pathways as well as theanine? This question is worthy of future investigation.</p><p>In summary, we generated a transcriptional map of tea plant roots, at the single-cell level, which provided cell-type-specific information on the expression of some 40,000 genes. Moreover, these datasets provide an important resource for future studies on secondary metabolism within tea plant roots, as well as other plant root systems.

The strategy followed sequential steps to draw partial conclusions.</p><p>Initially, protoplasts obtained from root tips were processed for scRNA-seq using the 10x Genomics platform. The sequencing data underwent pre-filtering at cell and gene levels, leading to 10,435 cells. These cells were then classified into eight clusters using t-SNE algorithms. The present study scrutinised cell typification through protein sequence similarity analysis of homologs of cell type marker genes. The analysis was conducted to ensure accuracy using validated genes from previous scRNA-seq studies and the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The cluster cell annotation was confirmed using <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR analyses. This methodology provided a comprehensive insight into the cellular differentiation of the sample under study. The identified clusters, spanning 1 to 8, have been accurately classified as xylem, epidermal, stem cell niche, cortex/endodermal, root cap, cambium, phloem, and pericycle cells.</p><p>Then, the authors performed a pseudo-time analysis to validate the cell cluster annotation by examining the differentiation pathways of the root cells. Lastly, they created a differentiation heatmap from the xylem and epidermal cells and identified the biological functions associated with the highly expressed genes.</p><p>Upon thoroughly analysing the scRNA-seq data, the researchers delved into the cell heterogeneity of nitrate and ammonium uptake, transport, and nitrogen assimilation into amino acids. The scRNA-seq data was validated by <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR. It allows the localisation of glutamate and alanine biosynthetic enzymes along the cell clusters and confirms that both constituent the primary amino acid metabolism in the root. Such investigation was deemed necessary due to the paramount importance of these processes in theanine biosynthesis since this molecule is synthesised from glutamate and alanine-derived ethylamine.</p><p>Afterwards, the authors analysed the cell-specific expression patterns of the theanine biosynthesis genes, combining the same molecular tools. They concluded that theanine biosynthesis is more enriched in cluster 8 &quot;pericycle cells&quot; than glutamate biosynthesis (Lines 271-272). However, the statement made in Line 250 states that the highest expression levels of genes responsible for glutamate biosynthesis were observed in Clusters 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8, leading to an unclear conclusion.</p><p>The regulation of theanine biosynthesis by the MYB transcription factor family is well-established. In particular, CsMYB6, a transcription factor expressed specifically in roots, has been found to promote theanine biosynthesis by binding to the promoter of the TSI gene responsible for theanine synthesis. However, their findings indicate that CsMYB6 expression is present in Cluster 3 (SCN), Cluster 6 (cambium cells), and Cluster 1 (xylem cells) but not in Cluster 8 (pericycle cells), which is known for its high expression of CsTSI. Similarly, their scRNA-seq data indicated that CsMYB40 and CsHHO3, which activate and repress CsAlaDC expression, respectively, did not show high expression in Cluster 1 (the cell cluster with high CsAlaDC expression). Based on these findings, the authors speculated that transcription factors and target genes are not necessarily always highly expressed in the same cells.</p><p>Lastly, the authors have discovered a novel transcription factor belonging to the Lateral Organ Boundaries Domain (LBD) family known as CsLBD37 that can co-regulate the synthesis of theanine and the development of lateral roots. The authors observed that CsLBD37 is located within the nucleus and can repress the CsAlaDC promoter's activity. To investigate this mechanism further, the authors conducted experiments to determine whether CsLBD37 can inhibit CsAlaDC expression in vivo. They achieved this by creating transiently CsLBD37-silenced or over-expression tea seedlings through antisense oligonucleotide interference and generation of transgenic hairy roots. Based on their findings, the authors theorise that CsLBD37 regulates CsAlaDC expression to modulate the synthesis of ethylamine and theanine in tea roots. Apologies for the inadvertent mistake concerning glutamate and glutamine.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The manuscript showcases significant dedication and hard work, resulting in valuable insights that are fundamental for generating knowledge. The authors skillfully integrated various tools available for this type of study and meticulously presented and illustrated every step involved in the survey. The overall quality of the work is exceptional, and it would be a valuable addition to any academic or professional setting.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors have effectively addressed the feedback and revised the manuscript, presenting their debatable conclusions as speculative. Consequently, I find the manuscript's current form free of any apparent weaknesses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95891.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, Lin et al. present a comprehensive single-cell analysis of tea plant roots.

The strategy followed sequential steps to draw partial conclusions.</p><p>Initially, protoplasts obtained from root tips were processed for scRNA-seq using the 10x Genomics platform. The sequencing data underwent pre-filtering at both the cell and gene levels, leading to 10,435 cells. These cells were then classified into eight clusters using t-SNE algorithms. The present study scrutinised cell typification through protein sequence similarity analysis of homologs of cell type marker genes. The analysis was conducted to ensure accuracy using validated genes from previous scRNA-seq studies and the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The cluster cell annotation was confirmed using in situ RT-PCR analyses. This methodology provided a comprehensive insight into the cellular differentiation of the sample under study. The identified clusters, spanning 1 to 8, have been accurately classified as xylem, epidermal, stem cell niche, cortex/endodermal, root cap, cambium, phloem, and pericycle cells.</p><p>Then, the authors performed a pseudo-time analysis to validate the cell cluster annotation by examining the differentiation pathways of the root cells. Lastly, they created a differentiation heatmap from the xylem and epidermal cells and identified the biological functions associated with the highly expressed genes.</p><p>Upon thoroughly analysing the scRNA-seq data, the researchers delved into the cell heterogeneity of nitrate and ammonium uptake, transport, and nitrogen assimilation into amino acids. The scRNA-seq data was validated by <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR. It allows the localisation of glutamine and alanine biosynthetic enzymes along the cell clusters and confirms that both constituent the primary amino acid metabolism in the root. Such investigation was deemed necessary due to the paramount importance of these processes in theanine biosynthesis since this molecule is synthesised from glutamine and alanine-derived ethylamine.</p><p>Afterwards, the authors analysed the cell-specific expression patterns of the theanine biosynthesis genes, combining the same molecular tools. They concluded that theanine biosynthesis is more enriched in cluster 8 &quot;pericycle cells&quot; than glutamine biosynthesis (Lines 271-272). However, the statement made in Line 250 states that the highest expression levels of genes responsible for glutamine biosynthesis were observed in Clusters 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8, leading to an unclear conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your interest in and feedback on the paper. We have made revisions to the manuscript as per your suggestions. We would like to emphasize that the precursors of theanine biosynthesis are alanine-derived ethylamine and glutamate, not glutamine. Furthermore, in terms of the intermediates, only ethylamine is specific to the theanine biosynthetic pathway, as glutamate is the primary product of nitrogen assimilation and serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of amino acids, proteins, chlorophyll, and many secondary metabolites.</p><p>In this study, we observed a high expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in the glutamate biosynthetic pathway (CsGOGATs and CsGDHs) across all 8 clusters, with particularly strong expression in cluster 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8 (Figure 4D and 5B). However, the gene encoding CsTSI responsible for catalyzing theanine biosynthesis from glutamate and ethylamine was determined to be more enriched in cluster 8 (Figure 5B and 5C). Therefore, we concluded that theanine biosynthesis was more enriched in cluster 8, whereas glutamate biosynthesis was more broadly active in clusters 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The regulation of theanine biosynthesis by the MYB transcription factor family is well-established. In particular, CsMYB6, a transcription factor expressed specifically in roots, has been to promote theanine biosynthesis by binding to the promoter of the TSI gene responsible for theanine synthesis. However, their findings indicate that CsMYB6 expression is present in Cluster 3 (SCN), Cluster 6 (cambium cells), and Cluster 1 (xylem cells) but not in Cluster 8 (pericycle cells), which is known for its high expression of CsTSI. Similarly, their scRNA-seq data indicated that CsMYB40 and CsHHO3, which activate and repress CsAlaDC expression, respectively, did not show high expression in Cluster 1 (the cell cluster with high CsAlaDC expression). Based on these findings, the authors hypothesised that transcription factors and target genes are not necessarily always highly expressed in the same cells. Nonetheless, additional evidence is essential to substantiate this presumption.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your advice. We fully agree that additional evidence is essential to support the presumption that transcription factors and target genes are not always highly expressed in the same cells. Therefore, in this study, we identified another transcription factor, CsLBD37, which was characterized to negatively regulate <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> expression in response to nitrogen levels. Consistent with our presumption, the expression of <italic>CsLBD37</italic> was not enriched in cluster 1, where the expression of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> was primarily enriched (Figure 5B and 6D; Line 365).</p><p>To further identify supporting evidence, we also analyzed the expression of some transcription factors and their target genes in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, using published single cell RNA-seq data (Ryu et al., 2019; Wendrich et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019; Denyer et al., 2019; Jean-Baptiste et al. 2019; Shulse et al., 2019; Shahan et al., 2022) and database (Root Cell Atlas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rootcellatlas.org/">https://rootcellatlas.org/</ext-link>; BAR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bar.utoronto.ca/#GeneExpressionAndProteinTools">https://bar.utoronto.ca/#GeneExpressionAndProteinTools</ext-link>). Similar to the situation in tea plants, the regulators were not exactly the same as the cell types in which their target genes were highly expressed. For example, <italic>AtARF7</italic> and <italic>AtARF19</italic> were highly expressed in the cortex and stele, respectively, whereas their target genes <italic>AtLBD16</italic> and <italic>AtLBD29</italic> were highly expressed in endodermal cells (Okushima et al.,2007; Supplemental figure 8B and 8C; Line 312-325 and Line 525-526); <italic>AtPHR1</italic> was highly expressed in root epidermal cells and pericyte cells, but its target gene <italic>AtF3’H</italic> was highly expressed in the cortex and <italic>AtRALF23</italic> was highly expressed in xylem cells (Liu et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2022; Supplemental figure 8B and 8C; Line 322-327 and Line 527-530).</p><p>At the same time, we discussed that we cannot rule out the possibility of transcription factors regulating their target genes in the same cell type and both being highly expressed. One of the reasons is that these theanine-associated genes are promiscuous, having many target genes and regulate multiple biological processes in tea plants. We have only shown that high expression in the same cell type is not a necessary condition (Line 534-554). We strongly agree with the reviewer's opinion that more evidence is needed to illustrate this model in the future.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Denyer, T. et al. (2019).

The authors observed that CsLBD37 is located within the nucleus and can repress the CsAlaDC promoter's activity. To investigate this mechanism further, the authors conducted experiments to determine whether CsLBD37 can inhibit CsAlaDC expression in vivo. They achieved this by creating transiently CsLBD37-silenced or over-expression tea seedlings through antisense oligonucleotide interference and generation of transgenic hairy roots. Based on their findings, the authors hypothesise that CsLBD37 regulates CsAlaDC expression to modulate the synthesis of ethylamine and theanine.</p><p>Additionally, the available literature suggests that the transcription factors belonging to the Lateral Organ Boundaries Domain (LBD) family play a crucial role in regulating the development of lateral roots and secondary root growth. Considering this, they confirmed that pericycle cells exhibit a higher expression of CsLBD37. A recent experiment revealed that overexpression of CsLBD37 in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants led to fewer lateral roots than the wild type. From this observation, the researchers concluded that CsLBD37 regulates lateral root development in tea plants. I respectfully submit that the current conclusion may require additional research before it can be considered definitive.</p><p>Further efforts should be made to investigate the signalling mechanisms that govern CsLBD37 expression to arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of this process. In the context of Arabidopsis lateral root founder cells, the establishment of asymmetry is regulated by LBD16/ASL18 and other related LBD/ASL proteins, as well as the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARF7 and ARF19). This is achieved by activating plant-specific transcriptional regulators such as LBD16/ASL18 (Go et al., 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.071928">https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.071928</ext-link>). On the other hand, other downstream homologues of LBD genes regulated by cytokinin signalling play a role in secondary root growth (Ye et al., 2021, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.05.036">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.05.036</ext-link>). It is imperative to shed light on the hormonal regulation of CsLBD37 expression in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of its involvement in the morphogenic process.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful for your valuable suggestions and we fully agree with you. In an earlier study, we also observed a link between theanine metabolism, hormone metabolism and root development (Chen et al., 2022), but there is still insufficient evidence to fully characterize these links. In the current study, the focus was on the cell-specific theanine biosynthesis, transport and regulation, and we identified that CsLBD37 negatively regulates theanine biosynthesis. However, the upstream regulatory mechanism of CsLBD37 has not been addressed in this study. It is a pertinent question for future investigation as to how CsLBD37 is regulated in root development. We have included the following additional discussion in the revised manuscript: “Besides, it has been reported that LBD family TFs were regulated by, or interacted with, regulators of hormone pathways (e.g., ARFs) to regulate the process of root morphogenesis (Goh et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2021). Based on these findings, we speculated that CsLBD37 is likely regulated by, or interacts with, other proteins to form a complex to regulate root development or theanine biosynthesis.” (Line 573-576). At the same time, we revised the text “These results provided support for a model in which CsLBD37 plays a role in regulating lateral root development in tea plants” to “These findings suggested that CsLBD37 may play a role in regulating lateral root development in tea plant roots” (Line 401-402).</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Chen, T. et al.

We acknowledge that our experiments and data require further improvement. Currently, the genetic transformation of the tea plant remains a challenge, making it difficult to obtain sufficient <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence. Despite this situation, we have made every effort to obtain support for our conclusions based on the current situation and available technology. Indeed, additional studies will be performed once the impediment associated with genetic transformation of the tea plant has been resolved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, Lin et al. present a comprehensive single-cell analysis of tea plant roots. They measured the transcriptomes of 10,435 cells from tea plant root tips, leading to the identification and annotation of 8 distinct cell clusters using marker genes. Through this dataset, they delved into the cell-type-specific expression profiles of genes crucial for the biosynthesis, transport, and storage of theanine, revealing potential multicellular compartmentalization in theanine biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, their findings highlight CsLBD37 as a novel transcription factor with dual regulatory roles in both theanine biosynthesis and lateral root development.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This manuscript provides the first single-cell dataset analysis of roots of the tea plants. It also enables detailed analysis of the specific expression patterns of the gene involved in theanine biosynthesis. Some of these gene expression patterns in roots were further validated through in-situ RT-PCR. Additionally, a novel TF gene CsLBD37's role in regulating theanine biosynthesis was identified through their analysis.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Several issues need to be addressed:</p><p>(1) The annotation of single-cell clusters (1-8) in Figure 2 could benefit from further improvement. Currently, the authors utilize several key genes, such as CsAAP1, CsLHW, CsWAT1, CsIRX9, CsWOX5, CsGL3, and CsSCR, to annotate cell types. However, it is notable that some of these genes are expressed in only a limited number of cells within their respective clusters, such as CsAAP1, CsLHW, CsGL3, CsIRX9, and CsWOX5. It would be advisable to utilize other marker genes expressed in a higher percentage of cells or employ a combination of multiple marker genes for more accurate annotation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. In this study, we first utilized classical marker genes, such as <italic>CsWAT1</italic> and <italic>CsPP2</italic>, to annotate cell types. The expression patterns of these marker genes were confirmed using <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR. Additionally, a combination of multiple marker genes was employed for cell type annotation. We also analyzed the top 10 cluster-enriched genes, in each cluster, and their homologous expression in Arabidopsis, populus, etc., to serve as a reference for cluster annotation (Figure 2D; Supplemental Figures 2-6; Supplemental data 3). Subsequently, differentiation trajectories of root cells were analyzed based on pseudo-time analyses, which aligned well with cell type annotation and further supported the reliability of our annotations through these combined methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 3 could enhance clarity by displaying the trajectory of cell differentiation atop the UMAP, similar to the examples demonstrated by Monocle 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this advice. We have supplied the trajectory of cell differentiation atop the UMAP in the revised supplemental figure 7 (Line 185).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The identification of CsLBD37 primarily relies on bulk RNA-seq data. The manuscript could benefit from elaborating on the role of the single-cell dataset in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. In this study, we determined that <italic>CsTSI</italic> was highly expressed in cluster 8, but its regulator <italic>CsMYB6</italic> was highly expressed in cluster 3, cluster 6 and cluster 1 (Line 301-304). Thus, target genes and their regulators seem not to always be highly expressed in the same cell cluster. A similar situation was also observed in terms of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> transcriptional regulation (Line 305-311). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that, for the regulation of theanine biosynthesis, it is not necessary for transcription factors and target genes to always be highly expressed in the same cells. Thus, taking the transcriptional regulation of <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> as an example, we next analyzed the TFs that were co-expressed with <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> to test this notion. We used scRNA-seq data to screen for genes that were not highly co-expressed with <italic>CsAlaDC</italic>, such as CsLBD37, to test our hypothesis (Line 338-340 and Line 365).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The manuscript's conclusions predominantly rely on the expression patterns of key genes. This reliance might stem from the inherent challenges of tea research, which often faces limitations in exploring molecular mechanisms due to the lack of suitable genetic and molecular methods. The authors may consider discussing this point further in the discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions and we totally agree. We discussed this point in the discussion section, “In some non-model plants, including tea, transgenic technologies are not currently available and, hence, we used <italic>in situ</italic> RNA hybridization to establish the location(s) for gene expression. In some studies, isolation of different cell types was combined with q-RT-PCR to detect cell-type marker gene expression (Wang et al., 2022). However, this approach has two limitations in that it cannot display the gene location directly and has only low resolution”, “After numerous trials, we were able to optimize <italic>in situ</italic> RT-PCR assays (detailed in the Methods), which enabled a cell-specific characterization of gene expression in tea plant root cells, prior to establishing a genetic transformation system for tea…we note the challenge associated with weak calling of homologous marker genes…” (Line 431-444).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lin et al., performed a scRNA-seq-based study of tea roots, as an example, to elucidate the biosynthesis and regulatory processes for theanine, a root-specific secondary metabolite, and established the first map of tea roots comprised of 8 cell clusters. Their findings contribute to deepening our understanding of the regulation of the synthesis of important flavor substances in tea plant roots. They have presented some innovative ideas.</p><p>It is notable that the authors - based on single-cell analysis results - proposed that TFs and target genes are not necessarily always highly expressed in the same cells. Many of the important TFs they previously identified, along with their target genes (CsTSI or CsAlaDC), were not found in the same cell cluster. Therefore, they proposed a model in which the theanine biosynthesis pathway occurs via multicellular compartmentation and does not require high co-expression levels of transcription factors and their target genes within the same cell cluster. Since it is not known whether the theanine content is absolutely high in the cell cluster 1 containing a high CsAlaDC expression level (due to the lack of cell cluster theanine content determination, which may be a current technical challenge), it is difficult to determine whether this non-coexpressing cell cluster 1 is a precise regulatory mechanism for inhibiting theanine content in plants.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We concur with your assessment that the accumulation level of the spatial distribution of theanine may affect the expression of these genes. However, as you said, due to some technical limitations, we are not currently in a position to verify this distribution of theanine at the root cell spatial level. The spatial distribution of theanine in the roots can be affected by transport processes. So, it is likely that the cell types in which theanine is distributed do not exactly correspond to the cell types in which theanine is being synthesized (Line 491-493). We will make efforts in this direction to characterize the spatial distribution of theanine using techniques such as spatial metabolome and mass spectrometry imaging in the future (Line 582-586).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In fact, there are a small number of cells where TFs and <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> are simultaneously highly expressed, but the quantity is insufficient to form a separate cluster. However, these few cells may be sufficient to meet the current demands for theanine synthesis. This possibility may better align with some previous experiments and validation results in this study. Moreover, I feel that under normal conditions, plants may not mobilize a large number of cells to synthesize a particular substance. Perhaps, cell cluster 1 is actually a type of cell that inhibits the synthesis of theanine, aiming to prevent excessive theanine production? I do not oppose the model proposed by the author, but I feel there is a possibility as I mentioned. If it seems reasonable, the author may consider adding it to an appropriate position in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot for your suggestion. We agree that tea plant roots likely have mechanisms aiming to prevent excessive theanine production.We have improved our discussion according your suggestion.</p><p>Theanine is the most abundant free amino acid in the tea plant, accounting for 1-2% of leaf dry weight (Line 62-63), and can even reach 4-6% in the root, accounting for more than 60%-80% of the total free amino acids (Yang et al., 2020). This means that theanine biosynthesis indeed requires the root cells to consume significant resources and energy. Thus, theanine biosynthesis needs to be controlled by a series of regulation mechanisms, which would function as a “brake”. In a previous study, we suggested that CsMYB40 and CsHHO3 bound to the <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> promoter to regulate theanine synthesis, at the transcription level, in “accelerator” or “brake” mode to maintain stable synthesis of theanines (Guo et al., 2022). At a posttranslational level, CsTSI and CsAlaDC are modified by ubiquitination, which is probably involved in the degradation of these proteins in response to N levels (Wang et al., 2021). In the current study, we discovered a novel “brake” in the form of spatial separation. The differential expression of <italic>AlaDC</italic> and <italic>TSI</italic> suggests that ethylamine and theanine are synthesized in separate different cell types, allowing cell compartmentalization of the synthetic precursor and the product to form multicellular compartmentation of metabolites (Line 270-280). On the one hand, compartmentalization may effectively prevent interference between secondary metabolic pathways, whereas compartmentalization could also be used as a way of metabolic regulation to avoid excessive, or inhibition of, theanine synthesis (Line 483-488).</p><p>Reference</p><p>Guo, J. et al.

We revised our writing to improve the manuscript clarity and coherence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Suggestions for revisions:</p><p>(1) Introduction and Discussion, there are too many paragraphs, even one sentence is a paragraph. I suggest that all the sentences in Introduction be merged into three big paragraphs. For example, lines 30-57 become the first paragraph, lines 58-87 become the second paragraph, lines 88-106 become the third paragraph, and the authors can merge them reasonably according to the content. The discussion part is also suggested to be divided into several paragraphs according to the focus, and perhaps it is more appropriate to give a title to each paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments and suggestions. We have merged several paragraphs and added a title to each paragraph in the Discussion section (“Cell cluster annotation of non-transgenic plants” in line 428; “Nitrogen metabolism and transport of tea plant root at the single cell level” in line 445; “Multicellular compartmentation of theanine metabolism and transport” in line 469; “The regulation of theanine biosynthesis at the single cell level” in line 517; “Cross-talk between theanine metabolism and root development” in line 554).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Tea is a food, while tea tree is a substance. It should be tea plant root instead of tea root, it is suggested to revise this issue in the whole text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We corrected “tea root” to “tea plant root” in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 35-43, this sentence is too long, suggest each example should be one sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We revised this sentence into short sentences. We changed this part to “Root-synthesized flavonoids regulate root tip growth through affecting auxin transport and metabolism (Santelia et al., 2008; Wan et al., 2018). Legume roots secrete flavonoids as signaling agents to attract symbiotic bacteria, such as <italic>Rhizobium</italic> for nitrogen fixation (Hartman et al., 2017). In <italic>Abies nordmanniana</italic>, volatile organic compounds (e.g., propanal, g-nonalactone, and dimethyl disulfide) function to recruit certain bacteria or fungi, such as <italic>Paenibacillus</italic>. <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. S37 produces high quantities of indole-3-acetic acid that can then promote plant root growth (Garcia-Lemos et al., 2020; Schulz-Bohm et al., 2018).” (Line 35-42)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 510 is missing a reference.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you - we have added the reference in the revised manuscript (Line 549 and Line 840-842).</p></body></sub-article></article>
