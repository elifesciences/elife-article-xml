Iron needs in mammals are met primarily by iron recycling from senescent red blood cells (RBCs), a task chiefly accomplished by splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) via erythrophagocytosis. Given that RPMs continuously process iron, their cellular functions might be susceptible to age-dependent decline, a possibility that has been unexplored to date. Here, we found that 10- to 11-month-old female mice exhibit iron loading in RPMs, largely attributable to a drop in iron exporter ferroportin, which diminishes their erythrophagocytosis capacity and lysosomal activity. Furthermore, we identified a loss of RPMs during aging, underlain by the combination of proteotoxic stress and iron-dependent cell death resembling ferroptosis. These impairments lead to the retention of senescent hemolytic RBCs in the spleen, and the formation of undegradable iron- and heme-rich extracellular protein aggregates, likely derived from ferroptotic RPMs. We further found that feeding mice an iron-reduced diet alleviates iron accumulation in RPMs, enhances their ability to clear erythrocytes, and reduces damage. Consequently, this diet ameliorates hemolysis of splenic RBCs and reduces the burden of protein aggregates, mildly increasing serum iron availability in aging mice. Taken together, we identified RPM collapse as an early hallmark of aging and demonstrated that dietary iron reduction improves iron turnover efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hepcidin</kwd><kwd>ferroportin</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sonata Bis grant (UMO-2020/38/E/NZ4/00511)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mahadeva</surname><given-names>Raghunandan</given-names></name><name><surname>Chouhan</surname><given-names>Komal</given-names></name><name><surname>Niklewicz</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2014-2021/Polish National Science Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UMO-2019/34/H/NZ3/00691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pokrzywa</surname><given-names>Wojciech</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Foundation for Polish Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Research Agendas program MAB/2017/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serwa</surname><given-names>Remigiusz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A decline in iron-recycling functions of the splenic red pulp macrophages early during aging is driven by iron loading and involves their damage and a loss in red blood cell clearance capacity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sufficient iron supplies are critical for the proper functioning of cells and organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cronin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muckenthaler et al., 2017</xref>). At the systemic level, 80% of circulating iron is utilized for hemoglobin synthesis during the daily generation of approximately 200 billion red blood cells (RBCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muckenthaler et al., 2017</xref>). The oxygen-carrying capacity of RBCs renders them sensitive to the progressive build-up of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that drive natural RBCs senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bratosin et al., 1998</xref>). Due to the prooxidative properties of free heme and iron, high hemoglobin content in physiologically senescent RBCs constitutes a threat to tissues. To reduce the risk of RBC breakdown in the blood vessels and because mammals evolved under limited dietary iron availability, 90% of the body iron needs are met by internal iron recycling from aged RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ganz, 2012</xref>). This task is accomplished predominantly by red pulp macrophages (RPMs) of the spleen, cells that engulf defective RBCs in the process called erythrophagocytosis (EP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Youssef et al., 2018</xref>). Recent findings imply that in parallel to phagocytosis of intact senescent RBCs, which is actively performed by a fraction of RPMs at a given moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akilesh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Youssef et al., 2018</xref>) part of the RBC-derived iron is recovered via hemolysis of RBCs within the splenic microenvironment and subsequent hemoglobin uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klei et al., 2020</xref>). The latter likely occurs in RPMs, but whether other cell types contribute to this process remains to be determined.</p><p>The loss of elasticity due to a build-up of oxidative damage is a key feature of naturally aged RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arashiki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bratosin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ganz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Higgins, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lutz, 2012</xref>). The unique architecture of the spleen confers a filter for verifying the biomechanical integrity of RBCs, whereby senescent rigid RBCs are retained within the spleen cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mebius and Kraal, 2005</xref>). Recognition of ‘trapped’ RBCs by RPMs involves additional mechanisms, such as the binding of exoplasmic phosphatidylserine or opsonizing antibodies, that were proposed to act additively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gottlieb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Slusarczyk and Mleczko-Sanecka, 2021</xref>). Upon engulfment by RPMs, RBCs are degraded in phagolysosomes, and heme is released to the cytoplasm by HRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pek et al., 2019</xref>). Heme is subsequently catabolized by heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1; encoded by <italic>Hmox1</italic>) to carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin, and ferrous iron that feeds the labile iron pool (LIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kovtunovych et al., 2010</xref>). Iron from the LIP is sequestered by the iron-storing protein ferritin, composed of H and L subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mleczko-Sanecka and Silvestri, 2021</xref>). Iron efflux from RPMs occurs via ferroportin (FPN) to replenish the transferrin-bound iron pool in the plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muckenthaler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). The process of iron release from RPMs is tightly regulated by hepcidin, a liver-derived hormone that mediates FPN degradation and/or occlusion, hence preventing iron release from RPMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aschemeyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nemeth et al., 2004</xref>). Despite the growing body of knowledge, it is still not completely explored how iron balance in RPMs is affected by different pathophysiological conditions and how it may influence their functions.</p><p>Similar to erythropoiesis, the rate of RBC clearance is very high, reaching 2–3 million per second in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Higgins, 2015</xref>), and is considered largely constitutive under physiological conditions. Some reports showed that the intensity of EP can be enhanced by proinflammatory conditions and pathogen components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delaby et al., 2012</xref>). Recent work employing genetic mouse models showed that altered calcium signaling in RPMs due to overactivation or the loss of the PIEZO1 mechanoreceptor controls EP efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is largely unknown if the capacity for RBC uptake and their degradation within the phagolysosomes are regulated by intrinsic or systemic iron status per se.</p><p>Iron dyshomeostasis hallmarks physiological aging. This is exemplified by progressive iron accumulation and iron-dependent oxidative damage in aging organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arruda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cook and Yu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sukumaran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). At the same time, limited plasma iron availability is frequent in aged individuals and is a leading cause of a condition referred to as anemia in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Girelli et al., 2018</xref>). RPMs are derived from embryonic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yona et al., 2013</xref>), exhibit low self-renewal capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimoto et al., 2013</xref>), and are only partially replenished by blood monocytes during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, these specialized cells continuously perform senescent RBCs clearance during their lifespan, thus processing and supplying the majority of the organism’s iron requirements. We hypothesized that the exposure to high iron burden might accelerate their aging, affecting body iron indices and RBC homeostasis. Therefore, we aimed to explore the exact relationship between substantial splenic iron deposition during early aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altamura et al., 2014</xref>) and the iron-recycling functions of RPMs. Here, we found that aging expands iron accumulation in RPMs and their partial demise in female mice, largely attributable to the downregulation of ferroportin. We propose that the depletion of RPMs depends both on iron-triggered toxicity, resembling ferroptosis, and on the cell death mechanisms involving proteostasis defects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that iron loading impairs the capacity of RPMs to engulf and lyse RBCs. We show that age-related RPM dysfunction affects local RBC balance in the spleen, and RPM decay leads to the formation of iron- and heme-rich extracellular protein aggregates. Finally, we provide evidence that reducing dietary iron during aging ‘rejuvenates’ RPM functions and fitness, and improves iron homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RPMs of aged mice show increased labile iron levels, oxidative stress and diminished iron-recycling functions</title><p>To investigate iron-recycling capacity during aging, we used young (2–3 month-old) and aged (10–11 month-old) C57BL/6 J mice fed a diet with standard iron content (200 ppm). The latter age in mice corresponds to approximately 40–45 years in humans when senescent changes begin to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox et al., 2006</xref>). We used female mice which show more pronounced iron deposition in the spleen than males with age progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altamura et al., 2014</xref>). As expected, aged mice showed tissue iron loading, with the spleen being most affected, followed by the liver and other organs such as muscles and the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Aging mice exhibited decreased blood hemoglobin values, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peters et al., 2008</xref>), and a drop in transferrin saturation, a feature that thus far was observed mostly in elderly humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Girelli et al., 2018</xref>). Next, we aimed to verify if aging affects the iron status and essential cellular functions of RPMs. Using intracellular staining and flow cytometric analyses, we uncovered that RPMs [gated as CD11b-dim, F4/80-high, TREML4-high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haldar et al., 2014</xref>) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>] in aged mice exhibited a significant deficiency in H ferritin levels, with unchanged L ferritin protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, B</xref> for validation of antibodies for intracellular staining). Consistently, using the fluorescent probe FerroOrange that interacts specifically with ferrous iron, we detected a significant increase in LIP in aged RPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>) accompanied by marked oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). We next tested if this increase in labile iron in RPMs would impact the phagocytic activity. Hence, we incubated splenic single-cell suspension with temperature-stressed RBCs fluorescently labeled with PKH67 dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Theurl et al., 2016</xref>). In parallel, we employed another standard cargo for phagocytosis, zymosan, a yeast cell wall component. Using this <italic>ex vivo</italic> approach, we detected a significant drop in RBC clearance capacity in aged compared to young RPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Notably, their capacity for the engulfment of zymosan remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L</xref>), thus suggesting a specific defect of EP in aged RPMs. RPMs rely on lysosomal activity to lyse RBC components in phagolysosomes and hence exert their iron-recycling functions. Using a fluorescent probe, we observed decreased lysosomal activity in RPMs isolated from 10- to 11-month-old mice compared to those derived from young control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M</xref>). Of note, we also detected diminished mitochondrial activity, a well-established aging marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sun et al., 2016</xref>), in aged RPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1N</xref>). Interestingly, peritoneal macrophages of aged mice did not show altered ROS levels or impaired functions of lysosomes and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that these age-related changes affect RPMs earlier than other macrophage populations. Altogether, these insights suggest that during aging, RPMs increase LIP and exhibit a reduced capacity for the RBCs engulfment and lysosomal degradation of erythrocyte components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Iron-reduced diet normalizes body iron parameters during aging, diminishes iron retention in RPMs, and rescues age-related decline in RPMs' iron-recycling capacity</title><p>We next set out to explore whether an age-related alteration of systemic iron indices could be prevented.

In addition, we did not observe a contribution of inflammatory cues to hepcidin regulation, as the plasma IL-6 levels remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We next examined FPN levels in RPMs using an antibody that recognizes the extracellular loop of murine FPN (validated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). As expected from the pattern of hepcidin expression, cell membrane FPN levels in RPMs were decreased in aged mice and this was rescued by feeding them an IR diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We further characterized RPMs' iron status. We found that despite decreased ferritin H levels in aged mice, regardless of the dietary regimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), accumulation of both labile iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) and total iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) was completely reversed in RPMs of aged mice fed an IR diet as compared to a standard diet. Likewise, we observed alleviation of oxidative stress in aged RPMs in response to a dietary iron restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed whether altered RPM iron content in aged mice that were maintained on a standard affects their functions. First, we detected a lower representation of RPMs in the spleens of aged mice, a phenotype that was alleviated by limited dietary iron content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). We noticed that among 55 genes that were differentially regulated in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data between standard and IR diets, 9 genes are involved in proliferation control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8A</xref>). Consistent with the pattern of their regulation, we found that RPMs derived from aged mice on an IR diet showed mildly increased levels of the proliferation marker Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8B</xref>), a phenomenon that was previously reported to drive RPM niche replenishment after erythrophagocytosis-driven depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Youssef et al., 2018</xref>). Next, by reanalysis of published data from Ms4a3-tdTomato reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) (where macrophages of monocyte origin are fluorescently labeled) we demonstrated that the shortage of RPMs during aging is chiefly driven by the depletion of RPMs of embryonic origin, whereas the low rate of RPM replenishment from monocytes remained constant during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9A</xref>). In line with this, we did not observe any robust change in the splenic population of monocytes or pre-RPMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2020</xref>) in our aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9B, C</xref>), and we did not detect significant differences in the numbers of granulocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9D</xref>). These data suggest that the drop in RPM representation is not underlain by insufficient recruitment from monocytes or a concurrent increase in granulocyte representation, but involves the demise of embryonically derived cells.</p><p>We further assessed if RPM iron status during aging reflects their capacity to engulf and degrade RBCs. To this end, we first performed <italic>in vivo</italic> EP assay via transfusion of PKH67-stained temperature-stressed erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Theurl et al., 2016</xref>). We observed that aged RPMs were less efficient in sequestering transfused RBCs, an impairment that was partially rescued by feeding mice an IR diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Similarly to the EP rate, we found that RPMs isolated from aged IR mice restored the lysosomal activity to the levels observed in young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). These data imply that the diminished capacity of RPMs to engulf and lyse RBCs in phagolysosomes during aging can be ameliorated by limiting dietary iron content. Since earlier studies demonstrated that under conditions of RPM impairment, iron-recycling functions are significantly supported by liver macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Theurl et al., 2016</xref>), we also measured their EP capacity during aging. Using the transfusion of PKH67-stained RBCs we did not detect significant differences in the percentage of RBC-positive hepatic macrophages in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). However, consistently with the <italic>de novo</italic> recruitment of iron-recycling myeloid cells to the liver upon erythrocytic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Theurl et al., 2016</xref>), we noticed a significant expansion of the KC-like population in aged mice but not in the aged IR group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). This implies that the liver macrophage may partially compensate for the decreased EP activity in RPMs. In sum, we demonstrate that dietary iron restriction normalizes both systemic and RPM iron levels and reverses the age-related reduction in their numbers and iron-recycling ability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Aging triggers the retention of senescent RBCs, increased hemolysis, and the formation of non-degradable iron-rich aggregates in the spleen</title><p>Having established that dietary iron content in aging modulates RPM representation and EP capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), we examined parameters related to RBCs’ fitness. First, we performed an RBC lifespan assay and found no differences in the rate of RBCs removal from the circulation between young and aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for RBC gating strategy), suggesting intact fitness of circulating RBCs. Likewise, these RBCs did not show increased labile iron or ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). However, physiologically aged RBCs are first filtered in the spleen due to the loss of their elasticity, and this step is a prerequisite for their removal via EP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Slusarczyk and Mleczko-Sanecka, 2021</xref>). In agreement with this model, RBCs isolated from the spleen of young mice showed ROS build-up, a marker of their natural senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bratosin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We thus hypothesized that the reduced numbers and phagocytic capacity of RPMs in aging might impact local rather than systemic RBCs homeostasis. Consistently, splenic RBCs isolated from aged mice showed more pronounced ROS levels than RBCs derived from young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In line with the partial mitigation of the defective iron-recycling capacity by restricted dietary iron content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>), we found that mice fed an IR diet exhibited erythrocytic oxidative stress parameters similar to the young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We further corroborated that the differences in ROS levels of splenic RBCs during aging reflect their senescence status, and are not a consequence of diminished FPN or LIP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> and B). In agreement with the notion that a part of senescent RBCs undergoes local hemolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klei et al., 2020</xref>), we further detected significantly higher levels of extracellular heme in the aged spleens, likely reflecting a higher burden of defective RBCs that evade efficient EP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the levels of heme in aging spleens were partially rescued by the IR diet. In support of these data, we detected higher levels of heme in plasma obtained from the portal vein (that carries the blood from the spleen to the liver) of aged <italic>versus</italic> young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and higher serum concentrations of heme-scavenging hemopexin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The latter tended to be rescued by the IR diet (p=0.057; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In conclusion, our data suggest that the reduced iron-recycling capacity of RPMs during aging may promote the retention of senescent RBCs prone to undergo local lysis and that these manifestations may be partially rescued by maintaining mice on an IR diet.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Aging triggers the retention of senescent RBCs, increased hemolysis, and the formation of non-degradable iron-rich aggregates in the spleen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The RBC biotinylation lifespan assay was performed on circulating RBCs from young, aged, and aged IR mice.

However, the identity of splenic iron deposits in RPM-depleted spleens remains unclear. We thus aimed to characterize iron deposits in the aging spleen. Perls’ Prussian blue staining that detects iron deposits showed that aged mice on a standard diet exhibited enhanced iron accumulation in the red pulp, a less pronounced phenotype in mice fed an IR diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This primarily reflected RPMs' iron status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Intriguingly, eosin and hematoxylin staining visualized deposits in aged spleens that, in contrast to Perls’ staining, were completely absent in young controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). They appeared as large and extracellular in the histology sections and seemed smaller and less abundant in mice fed an IR diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Flow cytometry analyses confirmed that splenic single-cell suspension from aged but not young mice contained superparamagnetic particles, likely rich in iron oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Franken et al., 2015</xref>), that are characterized by high granularity as indicated by the SSC-A signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These particles did not show staining indicative of dead cells and failed to express typical splenocyte and erythroid markers (CD45, TER119, CD11b, or F4/80) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). With different granularity and size parameters, such particles appeared in mice aged on an IR diet, however, to a lesser extent. To further examine the composition of these aggregates, we established a strategy involving splenocyte separation in the lymphocyte separation medium followed by magnetic sorting, which successfully separated them from iron-rich cells (chiefly RPMs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We found that these aggregates contained large amounts of total iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>) and, interestingly, heme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), implying their partial RBC origin. Importantly, both iron and heme content was significantly reduced in mice fed an IR diet. In sum, our data show that aging is associated with local RBC dyshomeostasis in the spleen, and the formation of iron- and heme-rich aggregates, and that both these responses can be alleviated by limiting dietary iron content.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Splenic age-triggered iron deposits are rich in aggregation-prone proteins derived from damaged RPMs</title><p>We next sought to explore the origin of the splenic iron aggregates. We imaged spleen sections from young and aged mice with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to obtain ultrastructural information. We noticed that RPMs in young mice contained only intracellular dark-colored deposits, rich in structures that resemble ferritin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ai</xref>). Their appearance likely mirrors a form of iron deposits that were in the past referred to as hemosiderin, an intracellular clustered insoluble degradation product of ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harrison and Arosio, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ward et al., 2000</xref>). In older mice, we likewise observed intracellular deposits in morphologically intact cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Aii</xref>). However, in agreement with histological staining, we detected two other classes of aggregates: those that are still granular and enclosed within the membrane, but present in cells that are morphologically damaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Aiii</xref>) and those that are large, amorphic, and located extracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Aiv</xref>). Next, we conducted label-free proteomic profiling to determine the composition of magnetically-isolated aging-associated splenic aggregates. We identified over 3770 protein groups, among which 3290 were significantly more abundant in isolates from aged mice compared with the samples derived from young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We assume that low-level detection of peptides from the young spleens may represent remnants from intracellular deposits that we observed via TEM and which may be released from RPMs during splenocyte processing. We performed a functional enrichment analysis of the top 387 hits (log2 fold change &gt;5) with DAVID and ShinyGO bioinformatic tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). We first noticed that although the identified proteins were derived from different organelles, one of the top characteristics that they shared was a disordered region in their amino acid sequence, a factor that may increase the risk of protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Uversky, 2009</xref>). Consistently, the top hits were enriched in proteins related to neurodegeneration pathways, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and heat shock protein binding, linking their origin to proteostasis defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Medinas et al., 2017</xref>). These included aggregation-prone huntingtin (HTT), amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), and ataxin 3 (ATXN3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lieberman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2018</xref> #251; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In agreement with the substantial iron load of the aggregates and the fact that iron promotes protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klang et al., 2014</xref>), we identified ‘metal-binding’ as another significant functional enrichment. We further observed that the top components of the aggregates included several proteins associated with immunoglobulin-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), such as antibody chain fragments as well as Fc receptors, proteins associated with complement activation and phagocytosis, thus linking the aggregates to the removal of defective cells, likely senescent RBCs or damaged RPMs. Finally, consistent with our conclusions from EM imaging that cell death likely contributes to the formation of the aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Aiv</xref>), their top components were enriched with apoptosis-related protein (e.g. BID, DFFA, DAXX, and MRCH1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and those linked to the response to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Supporting the idea that iron-rich protein aggregates emerge primarily from damaged RPMs, and may likely contain some erythrocyte components, we observed an overlap between their protein components and the proteome of RPMs and erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gautier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Splenic age-triggered iron deposits are rich in aggregation-prone proteins derived from damaged RPMs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ultrastructural analyses of the spleen red pulp sections by transmission electron microscopy.

We identified 570 differentially expressed genes, including 392 up- and 178 down-regulated transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). RNA-seq data revealed rather an anti-inflammatory transcriptional pattern of aged RPMs, exemplified by the downregulation of genes encoding for MHC class II complexes and the induction of <italic>Il10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Most importantly, functional enrichment analysis showed that aged RPMs were hallmarked by ER stress, unfolded protein response, and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), regardless of the diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This observation corroborates the finding that aging-triggered splenic iron-rich protein deposits, enriched in aggregation prone-proteins, may result from proteotoxic stress in aged RPMs. ERAD is a pathway for targeting misfolded ER proteins for cytoplasmic proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). Correspondingly, we identified a significant increase in proteasomal activity in aged RPMs, measured with a dedicated fluorescent probe that undergoes proteasomal cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The IR diet reversed this proteasomal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Since misfolded proteins can be also cleared from ER via ER-to-lysosome–associated degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Leonibus et al., 2019</xref>), and lysosomal activity was diminished in aged RPMs in a diet-dependent fashion, our data imply that proteasomal activity likely compensates for the reduced lysosomal-mediated protein quality control in RPMs during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Finally, assigning a causal relationship between the iron loading of RPMs and their global proteostasis defect, we found that forced iron accumulation in RPMs in response to iron dextran injection in young mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) provoked the formation of iron-rich protein aggregates whose composition largely overlaps with those from aged spleens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>To explore how limited dietary iron content during aging affects the formation of splenic iron-rich deposits, we conducted TMT-based proteomic quantification of their composition.

Functional enrichment analysis identified components of lysosomes as by far the most overrepresented hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref> and B), suggesting that alleviation of the lysosomal defects likely contributes to less pronounced aggregates formation in iron-reduced mice. The hits included also both H and L ferritin as being significantly increased in aggregates from aged mice on a standard diet. Of note, we failed to detect ferritin in the aggregates using antibody staining and flow cytometry, thus suggesting that cytoplasmic ferritin deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) may result from ferritin aggregation.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that the splenic heme- and iron-rich deposits are formed of a broad spectrum of aggregation-prone protein debris that most likely originates from RPMs that have been damaged by proteotoxic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RPM dysfunction occurs early in aging and involves ferroportin downregulation</title><p>To explore early events that underlie RPM impairments during aging, we monitored in a time-wise manner how the formation of iron-rich aggregates corresponds to the functions of RPMs. We found that RPMs started to show increased LIP levels, and reduced their EP and lysosomal degradation capacity early during age progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Likewise, at 5 months of age, we observed that a larger proportion of splenic RBCs exhibited the senescence marker - increased ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, these changes reflected the accumulation of non-heme iron in the spleen and the appearance of splenic protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Since these deposits are insoluble, we assumed that their formation limits the bioavailability of iron for further systemic utilization. In support of this possibility, we noticed that the drop in transferrin saturation during aging coincided with RPM failure and the appearance of splenic aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To address the primary events that underlie RPM impairments we investigated mice very early during aging. We observed that ferroportin dropped significantly already in mice aged 4 months, which at least partially was coupled with increased hepatic hepcidin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I</xref>). At the same time point, the cells started to exhibit decreased EP activity [here determined by intracellular staining of the erythrocytic marker TER119 in RPMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akilesh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>], and only afterward, at the age of 5 months, we detected significant retention of senescent, ROS-rich RBCs in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).

Consistent with these data, we failed to detect augmented ROS levels in the mitochondria of aged RPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Instead, we observed that mitochondria mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), as well as mitochondrial activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), decreased in RPMs of aged mice, and both these phenotypes were alleviated by an IR diet. This corresponded to higher ATP levels in FACS-sorted RPMs derived from aged mice fed an IR diet <italic>versus</italic> a standard diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Previous ultrastructural studies showed that mitochondria of ferroptotic cells are hallmarked by reduced size and fewer cristae, increased membrane density, and some appear swollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently, our TEM imaging showed that in contrast to the RPMs of young mice, those from aged animals exhibited the above mitochondrial defects with some appearing disintegrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Mitochondria from mice fed an IR diet were small and dense, but they displayed a lesser degree of swelling and damage.</p><p>Since aged RPMs are characterized by proteotoxic stress and iron retention, we investigated how these two factors contribute to their viability. To this end, we employed a cellular model of RPMs [which we termed induced (i)-RPMs] that were generated by exposing bone marrow-derived macrophages to hemin and IL-33, two factors that drive RPM differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haldar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2020</xref>) and induce RPM-like transcriptional signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). We observed that iron loading (with ferric ammonium citrate [FAC]) and blockage of ferroportin by synthetic mini-hepcidin (PR73) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stefanova et al., 2018</xref>) caused protein aggregation in iRPMs and led to their decreased viability but only in cells that were exposed to heat shock, a well-established trigger of proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H, I</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that although FAC treatment increased lipid peroxidation to a similar extent in intact cells and those exposed to heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), cell viability was only reduced when the iron loading and proteotoxic challenge were combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Even more strikingly, the latter synergistic cytotoxic effect was prevented by the ferroptosis blocker Liproxstatin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Finally, consistent with the observation that apoptosis markers can be elevated in tissues upon ferroptosis induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>) and proteotoxicity may lead to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brancolini and Iuliano, 2020</xref>), we detected DNA fragmentation (via TUNEL assay) in the spleens of aged mice, a phenotype that was less pronounced in mice on an IR diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that RPM demise during aging is driven by iron-dependent cell death with ferroptosis characteristics coupled with proteostasis collapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Iron loading but not oxidative stress undermines the phagocytic activity of aged RPMs in concert with impaired heme metabolism and ER stress</title><p>The contribution of iron deposition to age-related deterioration of cellular functions is believed to be primarily mediated by the pro-oxidative properties of labile iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). We observed a clear indication of oxidative stress in aging RPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) that was rescued by an IR diet. Next, we aimed to verify whether the increased ROS levels solely contribute to RPM decline during aging. To this end, we supplemented aging mice with the antioxidant N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), which was previously shown to revert aging-related physiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). With this strategy, we successfully reduced oxidative stress in aged RPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, we did not observe an improvement in the EP capacity of RPMs isolated from NAC-supplemented mice compared to untreated aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistently, the retention of senescent RBCs in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and their local hemolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>) were not rescued by the NAC administration. Likewise, enhanced RPM lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), a ferroptosis marker, the formation of insoluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>), and splenic iron overload (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>) were equally present in aged mice regardless of the NAC treatment. These data suggest that RPM dysfunction and damage during aging are chiefly driven by RPM iron loading rather than excessive ROS.</p><p>Next, we investigated in more detail the causative role of iron loading in suppressing EP. We confirmed that iRPMs significantly decreased the ability for RBC uptake upon iron overload with FAC in a manner that was partially rescued by the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). In addition, we observed that iron loading by FAC suppressed lysosomal activity, an important factor for RBC degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We also found that mitochondria membrane potential was similarly diminished by FAC and DFO alone, thus uncoupling the phagocytic and lysosomal activity of iRPMs from their mitochondria fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Mechanistically, we found that iron loading reduced protein expression levels of the receptors that recognize phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells MERTK, AXL, and TIM4, and which are highly expressed by RPMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Slusarczyk and Mleczko-Sanecka, 2021</xref>), likely contributing to EP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>).

Consistent with the important role of calcium signaling in the regulation of EP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2021</xref>), we observed that iron accumulation reduced calcium levels in iRPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

We validated this result using intracellular staining and flow cytometry, and uncovered a marked decrease in HO-1 protein level in RPMs during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> for antibody validation). Correspondingly, the blockage of HO-1 in iRPMs with zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) suppressed the EP intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>) and, to a lesser extent, the capacity for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Next, we explored why ZnPP, but not hemin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>), suppressed EP. We speculated that possibly another co-product of HO-1 enzymatic activity (CO or/and biliverdin), which we expect to be high in hemin-exposed iRPMs, counterbalances the suppressive effect of iron release after EP. Interestingly, we found that the CO donor CORM-A1, but not biliverdin, rescued EP capacity under ZnPP exposure in iRPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref> and D), suggesting that CO acts as a modulator of EP activity in RPMs. Whether deficient CO levels in RPMs <italic>in vivo</italic> contribute to EP suppression would require further investigation. However, in support of this possibility, our RNA-seq data implied that enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, such as <italic>Tkt</italic>, a transcriptional target of CO-mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bories et al., 2020</xref>), are downregulated in aged RPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>RPMs derived from aging mice show similar HO-1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) and the degree of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) irrespective of diet and differ primarily in iron status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>). Therefore, we next tested how the combination of ZnPP and the ER stress inducer tunicamycin with a mild FAC exposure (10 μM) affects EP. Although ER stress alone did not significantly affect EP, we uncovered that FAC treatment elicited an additive effect with combined exposure to ZnPP and tunicamycin, but not with ZnPP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>).

Recent findings show that aging promotes a global decrease in protein solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sui et al., 2022</xref>). The longevity of embryonically-derived RPMs, reaching at least 32 weeks in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), puts pressure on these cells to handle the constant flux of iron, a factor that increases protein insolubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klang et al., 2014</xref>). This may render RPMs particularly sensitive to the build-up of protein aggregates. Consistently, we found a clear transcriptional signature for unfolded protein response and ER stress in aged RPMs, which may be linked to the constitutive phagocytic activity of this macrophage population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). We propose that unrestricted iron availability from the diet further ameliorates RPM fitness during aging, chiefly via early ferroportin downregulation and intracellular iron accumulation. The latter further decreases protein solubility and inhibits lysosomal activity which is critical for autophagy-mediated protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015</xref>). Critically, an increase in labile iron ultimately leads to the appearance of toxic lipid peroxides, the oxidation products that drive ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). Our results show that only the combination of proteotoxic stress, likely associated <italic>in vivo</italic> with specialized iron-recycling functions of RPMs, with iron loading or ferroportin blockage, is cytotoxic to the cellular model of RPMs. The fact that Liproxstatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>), rescues cell viability in this context implies the involvement of ferroptosis, but how mechanistically proteome instability and iron-triggered toxicity synergize remains an open question.</p><p>Thus far ferroptotic cell death was mainly described in genetic models, for example with disturbed detoxification of lipid peroxides due to conditional loss of <italic>Gpx4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsushita et al., 2015</xref>) or in various pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we propose that ferroptosis may critically contribute to RPM loss during physiological aging. Notably, the excessive clearance of damaged RBCs in mouse models of blood transfusion, hemolytic anemia, or the anemia of inflammation induced by heat-killed <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> was previously shown to cause transient or sustained RPMs depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haldar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Theurl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Youssef et al., 2018</xref>). Although the splenic niche may be replenished to some extent via splenic monocyte recruitment and/or resident RPMs proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haldar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Youssef et al., 2018</xref>), our data imply that the damage of embryonically derived RPM in these models may lead to the irreversible formation of insoluble iron-rich splenic protein aggregates. Premature clearance of defective RBCs also hallmarks β-thalassemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Slusarczyk and Mleczko-Sanecka, 2021</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, RPM loss was not extensively studied in a mouse model of thalassemia. However, interestingly, thalassemic mice display enhanced splenic Perls’-stained deposits that appear to be extracellular and are not amenable to iron chelation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sanyear et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vadolas et al., 2021</xref>), possibly resembling those identified by the present study. Of note, genetic disruption of <italic>Hrg1</italic> leads to the formation of heme aggregate hemozoin inside enlarged phagolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pek et al., 2019</xref>). The large size, extracellular localization, and high content of proteins distinguish age-triggered splenic aggregates from hemozoin. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this polymer-like structure may expand during aging and contribute to the formation of splenic iron deposits.</p><p>Our study identified three new factors that affect the intensity of EP, the iron content, the activity of HO-1, and, to less extent, ER stress. Among them, iron accumulation in RPMs, independently of ROS generation, emerged as a major driver of EP suppression during aging, likely via the downregulation of apoptotic cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Slusarczyk and Mleczko-Sanecka, 2021</xref>) and calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). The underlying mechanisms for excessive iron deposition in aged RPMs most likely include reduced FPN protein levels and may be further aggravated by the sequestration of ferritin in protein aggregates via the mechanisms that remain to be explored in detail. It is also plausible that, like neurons, aged RPMs show low capacity for heme synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atamna et al., 2002</xref>), which may lead to defective iron utilization in the mitochondria and increased cytoplasmic iron burden. Mitochondrial damage that we identified in aged RPMs may support this possibility. We also demonstrated that iron loading decreases the capacity of RPMs for phagolysosomal RBC degradation. Of note, patients who suffer from lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease, show iron deposits in the splenic macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lefebvre et al., 2018</xref>). Iron sequestration in Gaucher macrophages was attributed to the hepcidin-mediated downregulation of ferroportin, or more recently to increased erythrophagocytosis of Gaucher RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dupuis et al., 2022</xref>). Based on our study, it is plausible that defects in proteostasis, due to defective lysosomal-mediated protein quality control, may contribute to aberrant iron management in Gaucher macrophages.</p><p>HO-1 is well characterized for its cytoprotective, anti-oxidative, and anti-inflammatory functions, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gozzelino et al., 2010</xref>), and its activity was proposed to prevent cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Even et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hedblom et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suliman et al., 2017</xref>). Since RPMs are key cells where HO-1 exerts its enzymatic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vijayan et al., 2018</xref>), our observation that HO-1 levels decrease in these cells during aging is of high physiological significance. Although aged RPMs show some hallmarks of senescence linked to HO-1 deficiency, such as defective mitochondria or excessive ROS, they do not exhibit proinflammatory gene expression signatures. The suppression of EP by inhibition of HO-1 activity may be mediated by heme overload, as shown previously for general phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martins et al., 2016</xref>). However, we provide evidence that another product of HO-1, CO, restores the EP capacity of cells subjected to HO-1 blockage, thus emerging as an inducer of RBC uptake. These findings are in agreement with the previous work, reporting that CO administration protects <italic>Hmox1</italic> knock-out mice from sepsis-induced lethality via stimulation of bacterial phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our study implies that intracellular iron loading of RPMs impairs their EP capacity and synergistically with proteostasis defects leads to their demise. These impairments result in local RBC dyshomeostasis in the spleen, due to the shift from phagocytosis to splenic RBC lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klei et al., 2020</xref>), and the formation of extracellular proteinaceous aggregates, rich in iron and heme, emerging from damaged RPMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We propose that the build-up of un-degradable iron-rich particles, in concert with increased hepcidin levels, and limited iron-recycling activity of the remaining RPMs limit plasma iron availability during aging. Future studies may address whether the consequences of RPM dysfunction for the splenic microenvironment, together with their anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile, contribute to the immunosenescence that accompanies aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nikolich-Žugich, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, microglia iron overload and ferroptosis were recently identified as critical drivers of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kenkhuis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ryan et al., 2023</xref>). In such context, our findings suggest that in addition to various iron chelation approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), long-term reduction of dietary iron intake may represent an alternative for neurodegeneration prevention. Finally, our study has some limitations. We characterized in detail RPM dysfunction in female mice on a relatively low-iron C57BL/6 J background. Although we have observed similar phenotypes in Balb/c females, we failed to observe the formation of splenic iron-rich protein aggregates in C57BL/6 J males (data not shown). Having established that the degree of RPM collapse depends on dietary iron and internal hepcidin-ferroportin regulatory circuitry, it remains to be investigated how it is manifested in male mice on iron-rich genetic backgrounds or humans. Lastly, since standard mouse diets contain more-than-sufficient amounts of iron, our study could be also interpreted as the effect of long-term exposure to excessive iron on RPM functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Iqbal Hamza (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Slusarczyk et al. present a comprehensive and extensively documented examination of the effects of aging and cumulative iron-mediated damage on the function of iron-recycling (red pulp) macrophages in the murine spleen. Although the conclusions are not unexpected, the detailed characterization of the functional impairment of this important macrophage population is important and novel. Taken together, we find the manuscript to be of significant potential interest to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, based on the reviewers' comments, several conceptual and technical elements require resolution prior to further consideration and prevent the acceptance of the manuscript in its current form. The main points to be addressed are listed below and a full listing of reviewers' comments can be found in the individual reviews.</p><p>1) There is no clear explanation of why iron increases during aging although the authors appear to be saying that iron accumulation is both the cause of and a consequence of decreased RPM erythrophagocytic capacity. By what mechanism does iron restriction benefit RPM aging?</p><p>2) Clarification of whether there is shortage of RPMs with aging because of an insufficient recruitment from the circulating pool or there is a functional deficit. What is the underlying mechanism for lower erythrophagocytosis?</p><p>3) The proposed model is that during aging both EP and HO-1 expression decreases in RPMs but iron and ferroportin levels are elevated making for a discrepancy with elevated LIP in RPMs under these conditions.</p><p>4) Some technical elements, specifically the validation of antibodies for flow and the methods for free heme measures, require further clarification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Since major conclusions are derived from alterations in various iron/heme metabolism protein levels, it is critical to show that these antibodies (ferritin, HO1, FPN) actually are specific and work in flow cytometry experiments. I am unware of whether these Abs were ever authenticated for flow/FACS analyses.</p><p>2. What is the underlying mechanism for lower EP? The authors propose that aging RPMs have decreased lysosomal activity, lower H ferritin, increase LIP and oxidative stress. What is the cause and effect for RPMs from aged mice to behave this way?</p><p>3. Figure 2: FPN is high in aged RBCs while Hamp is high in the liver. What is the explanation for this phenomenon? Does BMP6 mRNA increase in the liver too? Or is high Hamp level the result of low-grade inflammation (in aged mice) and consequently the activation of the Stat3 pathway?</p><p>4. Does the iron accumulation in aged RPMs due to iron accumulation in aged RBCs?</p><p>5. Page 8: Why does Fe restriction decrease ROS production in RBCs? (Figure 2CandD)</p><p>6. Page 8: How was heme determined and quantified? How do you know that heme is extracellular? How do you know it is &quot;free&quot;? (Figure 2F)</p><p>7. Page 8, line 42,: … our data suggest that reduced EP rate during aging may promote the splenic retention..&quot; I would think that this means that there is higher ROS in red cells from aged mice which could pre-dispose them for preemptive clearance by RPMs, which are unhealthy to begin with in aged mice.</p><p>8. Page 9, line 25: &quot;… these aggregates contain large amounts of total iron (Figure 2J) and, interestingly, heme (Figure 2K)&quot;. The numbers (fold-change) don't match with total Fe and heme in Figure 1A, even if these were aggregates while the others are total.</p><p>9. Page 12, lines 35/36: &quot;… we propose that their formation limits the bioavailability of iron for further systemic utilization&quot;.</p><p>How does this reconcile with the fact that there is 200ppm dietary Fe to overcome Fe bioavailability? Given that the authors have only looked at the spleen (and in some figures, also the liver), how does the bone marrow, the major erythropoietic organ, deal with this &quot;limited Fe availability&quot;?</p><p>If the authors hypothesize that heme-iron deposits are insoluble thus limiting iron bioavailability for systemic utilization, then why is the anemia not corrected in aged IR mice if there is less heme-iron aggregates, and thus, presumably, more available iron?</p><p>10. Page 18, line 2: &quot;… causative link between iron loading…&quot;.</p><p>But the &quot;iron-loaded&quot; cells in vivo have low Ftn levels. Wouldn't this mean that the reason for their perturbation is something else?</p><p>11. The justification for use of only female mice is inadequate. We find major differences between male and female mice in iron/heme metabolism and macrophage recycling.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Impaired iron recycling from erythrocytes is an early hallmark of aging&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Carlos Isales (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) While the authors explained clearly in the response to reviewers regarding point 1 of the essential revision, the explanation does not appear evident or as clear in the revised manuscript. Can the authors note where this is in the abstract, introduction, or discussion? There should be a sentence somewhere in the abstract or discussion or both that says &quot;inflammation with aging leads to increasing hepcidin which suppresses ferroportin, leading to iron accumulation, aggregate formation, and RPM depletion/dysfunction.&quot; Furthermore, aggregates correlate with RPM loss in which the only conclusion is that monocyte recruitment does not compensate sufficiently for RPM loss with aging. Please modify in the Discussion on Page 16. The authors are hedging through the manuscript about what is the primary cause and what effect, and it is unclear what causes the initial inflammatory trigger (maybe just accumulated inefficiency of EP?). Removing some of the data and discussion that is afield and focusing on the main thrust of this manuscript would help enormously with readability. 6 figures with 8-16 panels each detract from understanding the main points. Please edit (suggestions made here and below).</p><p>2) There appears to be a discrepancy between ferritin decrease with aging and the expectation that it is increased in inflammation, aging, and Figure 7. The authors note that they think ferritin is aggregated but labile iron in RBCs is increased in the spleen from IR-aged mice (Figure 2F). Please edit Figure 7 accordingly, explain the findings in Figure 2F, and add to the Discussion that how ferritin aggregation is affected by excess iron during aging remains to be explored.</p><p>3) IR diet does not rescue anemia or alter RNA seq data and the use of agents to remove macrophages altogether does not worsen anemia in mouse models of the disease. Taken together, this raises doubt regarding the central role of RPMs in anemia of aging. While the data is strong overall, there is a possibility that the findings are related more to the standard mouse chow which is a super-physiological iron diet. This must be addressed as a weakness of the study since what the authors actually demonstrate is a comparison between the long-term effects of an iron overload diet and a normal iron diet on RPMs. The manuscript can be modified toward this conceptually or include this idea in the Discussion section since it may not be relevant for normal aging.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79196.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Slusarczyk et al. present a comprehensive and extensively documented examination of the effects of aging and cumulative iron-mediated damage on the function of iron-recycling (red pulp) macrophages in the murine spleen. Although the conclusions are not unexpected, the detailed characterization of the functional impairment of this important macrophage population is important and novel. Taken together, we find the manuscript to be of significant potential interest to warrant publication in eLife. However, based on the reviewers' comments, several conceptual and technical elements require resolution prior to further consideration and prevent the acceptance of the manuscript in its current form. The main points to be addressed are listed below and a full listing of reviewers' comments can be found in the individual reviews.</p><p>1) There is no clear explanation of why iron increases during aging although the authors appear to be saying that iron accumulation is both the cause of and a consequence of decreased RPM erythrophagocytic capacity. By what mechanism does iron restriction benefit RPM aging?</p></disp-quote><p>We are proposing that intracellular iron accumulation progresses first, chiefly due to ferroportin downregulation, which leads to the depletion of RPMs and the formation of iron-rich extracellular iron-rich protein aggregates. More explanation can be found below (R1 Ad. 1). In addition, we show that iron loading suppresses the erythrophagocytic activity of RPMs, hence further contributing to their impairment during aging.</p><p>We believe that iron restricted diet affects RPM aging mainly in two ways. First, it derepresses ferroportin levels and fully prevents iron deposition in RPMs (Figure 1F, H and G). This limits their defective phagocytic activity (Figure 1K; as we also demonstrated in vitro via DFO iron chelation, Figure 6A) and limits their damage (Figure 5C). The importance of the hepcidin-ferroportin axis during RPM aging is discussed in our replies below (please, see R1 Ad. 1; R3 Ad). Furthermore, we noticed that among 55 genes that are differentially regulated between standard and iron-restricted diets, 9 genes (Eps15, Nox1, Ddit4, Cep192, Alms1, Met, Dusp2, Kif5b, Tpra1) are involved in proliferation control (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Their response uniformly implies an increased proliferative capacity in response to restricted iron feeding. Consistently, we now found that RPMs derived from mice on the IR diet showed higher levels of Ki67, a marker of proliferative cells (Figure 5D). A similar phenomenon was previously shown to drive RPMs recovery after massive erythrophagocytosis-driven depletion (Youssef et al., 2018) and hence can be considered a beneficial mechanism that contributes to RPM niche replenishment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarification of whether there is shortage of RPMs with aging because of an insufficient recruitment from the circulating pool or there is a functional deficit.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this comment in detail in point R1 Ad. 2. We re-analyzed data from Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2019) and we provided the outcome as a new Figure 5E. It clearly shows that the shortage of RPMs during aging is driven by the depletion of RPMs of embryonic origin, not by insufficient recruitment from the monocyte pool. At the age of 10 months, we have not observed any robust change in the population of monocytes or pre-RPMs in the spleen (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B), and the numbers of granulocytes showed a mild non-significant decrease (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C).</p><p>Furthermore, we now measured in situ apoptosis marker and found a clear sign of apoptosis in the red pulp of aged mice, a phenotype that is less pronounced in mice on an IR diet (Figure 5O). This is consistent with the observation that apoptosis markers can be elevated in tissues upon ferroptosis induction (Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014) and that the proteotoxic stress, which we now emphasized better in the context of RPM aging, may also lead to apoptosis (Brancolini and Iuliano, 2020). Taken together, we strongly believe that the functional defect of embryonically-derived RPMs chiefly contributes to their shortage during aging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the underlying mechanism for lower erythrophagocytosis?</p></disp-quote><p>As we now show in additional panels in Figure 6E-G, iron loading reduced protein expression levels of the apoptotic cell receptors MERTK, AXL and TIM4, which are expressed in high levels in RPMs (Slusarczyk and Mleczko-Sanecka, 2021) and thus likely contribute to erythrophagocytosis. Investigation of their exact roles in RBC clearance would need to be addressed by future studies, outside the scope of the current manuscript. Consistent with the important role of calcium signaling in the regulation of erytrophagocytosis (Ma et al., 2021), we now also show that iron accumulation affects macrophage calcium levels in iRPMs (Figure 6H). Importantly, the effects of iron excess on the levels of the receptors and calcium can be rescued by DFO, similarly to overall erythrophagocytic activity (Figure 6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The proposed model is that during aging both EP and HO-1 expression decreases in RPMs but iron and ferroportin levels are elevated making for a discrepancy with elevated LIP in RPMs under these conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We can only assume that a small misunderstanding in the interpretation of the presented data underlies this comment. We show that ferroportin levels in RPMs (Figure 1F) are modulated in a manner that fully reflects the iron status of these cells (both labile iron and total iron levels, Figures 1 H and I). FPN levels drop in aged RPMs and are rescued when mice are maintained on an iron-reduced diet, consistent also with the mRNA expression levels of hepcidin (Figure 1D). As pointed out by Reviewer#3, and explained in detail in our replies below (R1 Ad. 1; R3 Ad), we believe that ferroportin levels are critical for the observed phenotypes in aging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some technical elements, specifically the validation of antibodies for flow and the methods for free heme measures, require further clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide data as figure supplements where antibodies against HFT, LFT, FPN and HO-1 are validated for flow cytometry – they show the expected expression in response to alteration of iron levels/holo-ferritin treatment. Regarding the measurements of splenic heme levels: we fully agree with Reviewer#2 that the method is not perfect. We now clarified it better in the Methods section (p. 32) and supported these data with additional measurements, including heme levels in plasma from the portal vein (which also carries blood from the spleen, Figure 2H) and serum hemopexin levels determined by ELISA (Figure 2I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Since major conclusions are derived from alterations in various iron/heme metabolism protein levels, it is critical to show that these antibodies (ferritin, HO1, FPN) actually are specific and work in flow cytometry experiments. I am unware of whether these Abs were ever authenticated for flow/FACS analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer raised an important issue. As explained in detail in our reply Essential Revisions Ad. 4. we now provide the data for the validation of the antibodies against HFT, HFL, HO1 and FPN for flow cytometry measurements (Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and Figure 6—figure supplement 3). Of note, we also use the antibody against FPN in our parallel projects and we see that it performs as expected (eg. we detect high FPN levels in RPMs in iron deficiency and we see FPN downregulation upon mini-hepcidin treatment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What is the underlying mechanism for lower EP? The authors propose that aging RPMs have decreased lysosomal activity, lower H ferritin, increase LIP and oxidative stress. What is the cause and effect for RPMs from aged mice to behave this way?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the primary phenotype of the aging RPMs is a progressive iron accumulation as hallmarked by an increase of both total and labile iron (Figure 1I and H). Our data in iRPMs in vitro show a causative effect of iron loading on both lysosomal and erythrophagocytic activity (Figures 6A and C). As described in the reply Essential Revisions Ad. 2b, we now provide more extensive new data demonstrating that iron loading decreases the levels of apoptotic cell receptors (MERTK, AXL, and TIM4) and of calcium levels (implicated in erythrophagocytic activity as reported by Ma et al. (Ma et al., 2021) (new Figure 6E-H)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2: FPN is high in aged RBCs while Hamp is high in the liver. What is the explanation for this phenomenon? Does BMP6 mRNA increase in the liver too? Or is high Hamp level the result of low-grade inflammation (in aged mice) and consequently the activation of the Stat3 pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the protein levels of FPN in splenic RBCs to exclude the possibility that their high ROS levels are underlain by low FPN and hence excessive intracellular iron, as shown in erythrocyte-specific FPN KO mice (Zhang et al., 2018)(Figure 2E). We do not have a clear answer as to why these levels are even higher than in young cells, especially that RBCs lack the machinery for transcriptional control. Bmp6 mRNA levels are increased in the livers of aged mice which is now included in our independent manuscript that focuses on iron sensing mechanisms (to be submitted soon). We have not observed any signs of low-grade inflammation in aged versus young mice at the age we investigated for this manuscript. To illustrate this, we now included serum IL-6 levels in young, aged, and aged IR mice (new Figure 1E). We also observed rather a downregulation of the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines in spleens in aged mice, and these data may be followed by our further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Does the iron accumulation in aged RPMs due to iron accumulation in aged RBCs?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above (R1 Ad. 5) we now provide additional data regarding RBC fitness. Consistent with the time life-span experiment (Fig, 2A), we show that oxidative stress in RBCs is only increased in splenic, but not circulating RBCs (new Figure 2C, replacing the old Figure 2B and C). In addition, we show no signs of age-triggered iron loading in RBCs, either in the spleen (new Figure 2F) or in the circulation (new Figure 2B). Hence, we do not envision a possibility that RPMs become iron-loaded during aging as a result of erythrophagocytosis of iron-loaded RBCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Page 8: Why does Fe restriction decrease ROS production in RBCs? (Figure 2CandD)</p></disp-quote><p>As described above (Ad. 6 to Reviewer’s#1 recommendation for the authors) we use ROS in RBCs as a readout for their senescence status. We propose that the increased proportion of high-ROS RBCs in the aged spleen is a consequence of lower RPMs number as well as diminished erythrophagocytic activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Page 8: How was heme determined and quantified? How do you know that heme is extracellular? How do you know it is &quot;free&quot;? (Figure 2F)</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the Reviewer that our method has some limitations. It for sure may capture heme that is bound by proteins, such as hemoglobin or heme/hemoglobin scavengers (hemopexin or haptoglobin). We also cannot fully exclude that the measured levels come explicitly from extracellular space. Therefore, to better support our findings, we now measured heme levels in plasma derived from portal blood (that is derived also from the spleen). Consistently, we found higher levels of heme in the portal circulation from aged mice compared to young controls (new Figure 2H). In addition, we measured hemopexin levels in the serum (new Figure 2I) and we found that it follows to a large extent the levels of extracellular heme from the spleen (Figure 2G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Page 8, line 42,: … our data suggest that reduced EP rate during aging may promote the splenic retention..&quot; I would think that this means that there is higher ROS in red cells from aged mice which could pre-dispose them for preemptive clearance by RPMs, which are unhealthy to begin with in aged mice.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above in our replies (R1 Ad. 5 and R2 Ad. 4) we did not observe any hints of decreased fitness of circulating RBCs (as indicated mainly by their normal life-span and unaltered ROS levels, Figures 2A and C). Hence, we do not expect that during aging circulating RBCs are pre-disposed to preemptive clearance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Page 9, line 25: &quot;… these aggregates contain large amounts of total iron (Figure 2J) and, interestingly, heme (Figure 2K)&quot;. The numbers (fold-change) don't match with total Fe and heme in Figure 1A, even if these were aggregates while the others are total.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. In Figure 1A we present non-heme iron content of the whole spleen. In our Figure 2M and N we show solely total iron content (likely including heme) and heme iron content of the isolated aggregates. These three pieces of data originate from different sample types and are obtained with different methods (ie, they measure different forms of iron). We assume that this likely influences the difference in fold changes. Another important factor is that splenic non-heme iron content will be also dependent on various other cell types in the spleen, whose iron status during aging is ill-understood and would require further investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Page 12, lines 35/36: &quot;… we propose that their formation limits the bioavailability of iron for further systemic utilization&quot;.</p><p>How does this reconcile with the fact that there is 200ppm dietary Fe to overcome Fe bioavailability? Given that the authors have only looked at the spleen (and in some figures, also the liver), how does the bone marrow, the major erythropoietic organ, deal with this &quot;limited Fe availability&quot;?</p><p>If the authors hypothesize that heme-iron deposits are insoluble thus limiting iron bioavailability for systemic utilization, then why is the anemia not corrected in aged IR mice if there is less heme-iron aggregates, and thus, presumably, more available iron?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment. This is right that the standard diet contains a more-than-sufficient amount of iron. However, what we assume is that during aging a part of RBC-derived iron becomes unavailable in the spleen in the form of protein aggregates, likely due to RPMs’ damage. Concomitantly, hepcidin expression increases in the liver, and FPN drops in RPMs. We have not determined FPN in the aged duodenum, but it may also be decreased. As a consequence, if iron absorption may be mildly restricted and iron recycling is impaired, less iron is available for replenishment of the transferrin pool. Our data regarding transferrin saturation support such a model. Still, this mild iron deficiency is not enough to significantly alter all RBC parameters (see more extended data as Figure 1—figure supplement: we see a mild significant effect on Hgb, and a tendency (p=0.054) for a drop in hematocrit). The bone marrow erythropoietic activity is unaltered (Figure 1—figure supplement F). Nevertheless, the fact that EPO is mildly increased in aged mice and extramedullary erythropoiesis rate is enhanced suggests that the body senses lower iron availability/mild hypoxia in aged mice. This indeed is not corrected by the iron-reduced diet. The reason for this is not clear to us. However, as Reviewer#1 pointed out (point 3), anemia in aging is likely multifactorial, and dissection of the contributing factors (apart from iron availability) would require further studies (as we mention on p.6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Page 18, line 2: &quot;… causative link between iron loading…&quot;.</p><p>But the &quot;iron-loaded&quot; cells in vivo have low Ftn levels. Wouldn't this mean that the reason for their perturbation is something else?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that aged RPMs accumulate large amounts of total iron and exhibit increased labile iron levels (Figure 1H and I). Our in vitro data show a causative role of iron loading in downregulating erythrophagocytosis and we now present additional insights into the candidate mechanisms (new Figure 6). We propose that likely the staining of cytoplasmic ferritin H in flow cytometry is not recognizing those ferritin particles that start to form the aggregates (in fact, extracellular aggregates were negative for flow cytometric detection of L-ferritin, even though according to MS analysis they contain large amounts of both L and H ferritin). Thus, we think that fully biologically active ferritin may be depleted in aged RPMs, hence promoting a build-up of high labile iron levels. We now included this additional reasoning in the manuscript (p. 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The justification for use of only female mice is inadequate. We find major differences between male and female mice in iron/heme metabolism and macrophage recycling.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Indeed, several aspects of iron homeostasis differ between males and females. The fact that C57Bl/6J females show higher iron levels in the spleen actually inspired us to study primary females in our project. Investigation of both sexes in parallel would exceed our project budget. However, we now present some aspects of RPM aging in Balb/c females (Figure 2—figure supplement 4) and we comment on C57BL/6J males (p. 9). We made it clear in the revised version of the manuscript that our observations refer to female mice (eg, in the Abstract) and that the degree of splenic aggregates formation likely depends on overall body iron burden and the functioning of the hepcidin-FPN axis (please, see also the last paragraph of the Discussion, p. 18).

Can the authors note where this is in the abstract, introduction, or discussion? There should be a sentence somewhere in the abstract or discussion or both that says &quot;inflammation with aging leads to increasing hepcidin which suppresses ferroportin, leading to iron accumulation, aggregate formation, and RPM depletion/dysfunction.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a new sentence in the Abstract, pointing to the drop in ferroportin as the most likely cause for intracellular iron loading of RPMs (page 2, line 39-40). The fragment of the Introduction that contains this information is on page 4 (line 119-120) and in the Discussion on page 16 (line 544-546). As we show in our data in Figure 1E, the inflammatory cues are rather unlikely to cause an increase in hepcidin and a drop in ferroportin, and therefore we would prefer not to include ‘inflammation’ as the factor. Of note, this is also consistent with rather an anti-inflammatory not a pro-inflammatory transcriptional profile of aged RPMs in the RNAseq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, aggregates correlate with RPM loss in which the only conclusion is that monocyte recruitment does not compensate sufficiently for RPM loss with aging. Please modify in the Discussion on Page 16.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to modify the indicated fragment of the Discussion for better clarity (now on page 15, lines 522-529). Our point was that similar to the aging model, also the other conditions/challenges mentioned in the text are hallmarked by RPM depletion (for some of them it is not clear from the published data if the reduction of RPM numbers would be transient or sustained). Nevertheless, what we want to propose is that independent of the replenishment of the niche, damaged RPMs may give rise to the formation of iron-rich protein aggregates in the models mentioned, a possibility that was not addressed by previous studies.</p><p>We hope that overall our data are convincing to show that RPMs are the major source of the aggregates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors are hedging through the manuscript about what is the primary cause and what effect, and it is unclear what causes the initial inflammatory trigger (maybe just accumulated inefficiency of EP?).</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the first round of revision, we understood that assigning causality to our observations is important and we followed this suggestion with additional experiments and argumentation in the text. We attempted to understand the primary cause for iron loading in RPMs, and we show that it might be attributable to ferroportin downregulation. We propose that it is linked to hepcidin upregulation, but we do not assign this regulation to ‘inflammaging’ (Figure 1E). As mentioned in our replies to the previous round of revision, we do see that Bmp6 expression is also increased in aging, but we characterize this response in an independent manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Removing some of the data and discussion that is afield and focusing on the main thrust of this manuscript would help enormously with readability. 6 figures with 8-16 panels each detract from understanding the main points. Please edit (suggestions made here and below).</p></disp-quote><p>We now removed some data from the manuscript or included them in the supplement, following the suggestions below. We hope that these efforts improved the readability of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There appears to be a discrepancy between ferritin decrease with aging and the expectation that it is increased in inflammation, aging, and Figure 7. The authors note that they think ferritin is aggregated but labile iron in RBCs is increased in the spleen from IR-aged mice (Figure 2F). Please edit Figure 7 accordingly, explain the findings in Figure 2F, and add to the Discussion that how ferritin aggregation is affected by excess iron during aging remains to be explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We now modified Figure 7 to illustrate a drop in ferritin, which is paralleled by the formation of iron-rich aggregates that contain large amounts of ferritin (based on our MS data), as we write in the manuscript (page 11, line 353-356). We think that high amounts of labile iron in aged RPMs appear mostly due to a drop in ferroportin, as only the ferroportin expression on RPM membranes, but not ferritin levels or protein aggregation are rescued by the IR diet.</p><p>Still, deficient levels of fully-functional ferritin likely contribute to the labile iron build-up. We now added the sentence suggested by the Reviewer to the Discussion (page 16, line 545-546)</p><p>Regarding the previous Figure 2F, we measured labile iron in splenic RBCs in response to the comments that we received from the Reviewers. The aim of this was to show that RPMs do not become iron loaded in aging because of EP of iron-loaded RBCs. We do not see a direct connection between the ferritin status of RPMs and labile iron in RBC. Following the suggestions below, we now moved these data to Supplements and commented that the increased ROS status in splenic RBCs reflects their senescence and is not underlain by FPN drop or iron accumulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) IR diet does not rescue anemia or alter RNA seq data and the use of agents to remove macrophages altogether does not worsen anemia in mouse models of the disease. Taken together, this raises doubt regarding the central role of RPMs in anemia of aging.</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript we do not emphasize the anemia of aging, as at least in the studied mice at the given age the anemic phenotype is very mild. We focus on the phenotypic changes of RPMs in response to increased iron levels in the context of aging, which are novel and we believe may be of broader relevance. We think that a mild drop in transferrin saturation, which we partially rescue by the IR diet, and which at least to some extent may be caused by less efficient iron recycling by RPMs, is more important and in principle may affect as well other cell types than only erythroid cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the data is strong overall, there is a possibility that the findings are related more to the standard mouse chow which is a super-physiological iron diet. This must be addressed as a weakness of the study since what the authors actually demonstrate is a comparison between the long-term effects of an iron overload diet and a normal iron diet on RPMs. The manuscript can be modified toward this conceptually or include this idea in the Discussion section since it may not be relevant for normal aging.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer raised a valid issue. Modifying the whole manuscript conceptually would be very difficult at this stage. We now included the suggested idea in the Discussion (page 17, line 588-590).</p><p>References</p><p>Bennett, L.
