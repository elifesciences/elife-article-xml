containing methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins. Two MBD proteins, Mbd2 and Mbd3, were previously shown to bind methylated or hydroxymethylated DNA, respectively; however, both of these findings have been disputed. Here, we investigated this controversy using experimental approaches and re-analysis of published data and find no evidence for methylation-independent functions of Mbd2 or Mbd3. We show that chromatin localization of Mbd2 and Mbd3 is highly overlapping and, unexpectedly, we find Mbd2 and Mbd3 are interdependent for chromatin association. Further investigation reveals that both proteins are required for normal levels of cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation in murine embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, Mbd2 and Mbd3 regulate overlapping sets of genes that are also regulated by DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation factors. These findings reveal an interdependent regulatory mechanism mediated by the DNA methylation machinery and its readers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21964.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21964.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>DNA hydroxymethylation</kwd><kwd>NuRD</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD072122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fazzio</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA130807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hainer</surname><given-names>Sarah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Special Fellows Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hainer</surname><given-names>Sarah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD080224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rando</surname><given-names>Oliver J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholars Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fazzio</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two methyl-binding domain proteins have interdependent functions in embryonic stem cells, and this interdependency extends to the DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation machinery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammalian cells, 5-methylcytosine (5mC), a heritable epigenetic modification on DNA, occurs mainly at CpG dinucleotides through the actions of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bester, 1988</xref>). The members of the DNMT family that modify cytosine on DNA include Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okano et al., 1998</xref>). Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are de novo DNA methyltransferases, which establish methylation during development. On the other hand, the more abundant Dnmt1 predominantly methylates hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides to restore methylation patterns following genomic replication (although it also has some de novo methylation activity) and therefore, is considered to be the 'maintenance methyltransferase' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kho et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pradhan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Probst et al., 2009</xref>). Dnmt1 is responsible for the majority of methylation in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells, as <italic>Dnmt1</italic> knockout (KO) ES cells carry only about 20% of normal methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lei et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Active demethylation of 5mC involves a relatively complex series of reactions that starts with oxidation by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases (including Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2015</xref>), which actively demethylate DNA by oxidizing the 5-methyl group of 5mC to form 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>). Further oxidation can occur through conversion of 5hmC into 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ito et al., 2011</xref>). The level of 5hmC is approximately 10% the level of 5mC in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>), whereas 5fC and 5caC are much less abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ito et al., 2011</xref>). Together, Tet1 and Tet2 are responsible for essentially all the 5hmC present in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koh et al., 2011</xref>). However, Tet1 is responsible for 5hmC production at promoter-proximal regions, whereas Tet2 is poorly chromatin-associated and primarily acts within gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vella et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, knockdown (KD) or KO of <italic>Tet1</italic> or <italic>Tet2</italic> skews the profile of ES cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawlaty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ficz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koh et al., 2011</xref>), and some reports suggest <italic>Tet1</italic> KD also leads to a defect in self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freudenberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2010</xref>). However, the functions of Tet proteins during development remain incompletely resolved as <italic>Tet1<sup>-/-</sup> Tet2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>double KO mice have been shown to be viable with only modest phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dawlaty et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The methylation status of DNA influences many biological processes during mammalian development, and cytosine methylation of promoter-proximal regulatory sequences in mammals is generally considered repressive for gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klose and Bird, 2006</xref>). One of the best-studied families of cytosine methylation effectors consists of the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) family of proteins, most of which specifically bind methylated CpG dinucleotides and play important roles in determining the transcriptional state of the mammalian epigenome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Filion et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendrich and Bird, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prokhortchouk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Unoki et al., 2004</xref>). MBD proteins are transcriptional regulators, primarily thought to act as repressors, which play a major role in coordinating crosstalk between cytosine methylation and chromatin structure to regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denslow and Wade, 2007</xref>). The MBD has the ability to bind single symmetrically methylated CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohki et al., 2001</xref>), and the functions of MeCP2 and the Mbd1-4 family members have been well-studied. With the exception of Mbd3, these proteins preferentially bind 5mC over unmethylated cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendrich and Bird, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). Consistent with this binding activity, Mbd2 occupies methylated CpG island–containing promoters of inactive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chatagnon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Menafra et al., 2014</xref>). Although Mbd3 does not bind 5mC, MeCP2 and Mbd3 can bind 5hmC in vitro and Mbd3 is enriched in regions of elevated 5hmC in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mellén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this reported localization, knockdown (KD) of <italic>Mbd3</italic> leads to misregulation of 5hmC-marked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, Mbd3 binding in ESCs was strongly reduced upon RNAi-mediated KD of <italic>Tet1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>) However, arguing against the above studies, other in vitro studies using short DNA probes containing a single symmetric 5hmCpG find poor binding of 5hmC by MBD family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cramer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spruijt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mbd2 and Mbd3 are highly similar in amino acid sequence and are components of mutually exclusive versions of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendrich and Bird, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Guezennec et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wade et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, Mbd2 and Mbd3 exhibit partially overlapping localization profiles at some methylated regions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Günther et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with the possibility that these factors bind to DNA enriched for 5mC or its derivative, 5hmC. However, these highly similar complexes play distinct biological roles in vivo. Mbd3/NuRD is necessary for ES cell pluripotency and differentiation, as well as embryonic development, whereas <italic>Mbd2</italic> KO mice are viable and fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hendrich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaji et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reynolds et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, Mbd3/NuRD coordinates cytosine methylation by recruiting DNA methyltransferases to the promoters of tumor suppressor genes in colon cancer cell and leukemia cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morey et al., 2008</xref>), and depletion of <italic>Mbd3</italic> results in reduced DNA methylation levels at some locations in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Latos et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recently, evidence has arisen questioning the dependence of Mbd2 and Mbd3 on cytosine methylation for genomic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2013</xref>). The authors of this study reported that the enrichments of Mbd2 and Mbd3 at LMRs (low-methylated regions that are enriched for transcription factor-binding sites and exhibit approximately 30% methylation on average) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>) were minimally altered in <italic>Dnmt1<sup>-/-</sup> Dnmt3a<sup>-/-</sup> Dnmt3b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> triple knockout (TKO) ES cells. Here, we sought to resolve the conflicting data addressing the dependence of Mbd2 and Mbd3 localization on 5mC and 5hmC. Analyses of ChIP-seq data from Baubec et al. as well as multiple new ChIP-seq datasets reported here demonstrate methylation-dependence of Mbd2 and Mbd3 binding throughout the genome. Interestingly, we show that Mbd2 and Mbd3 exhibit significantly overlapping localization in vivo and find that Tet1 activity is required for normal chromatin association by both Mbd3 and Mbd2. Furthermore, we show that Mbd3 and Mbd2 are each required for the binding of the other, as well as for normal levels of 5mC and 5hmC. Finally, we find that individual KD of <italic>Mbd2</italic>, <italic>Mbd3, Dnmt1,</italic> or <italic>Tet1</italic> results in highly concordant changes in gene expression. Together these data reveal interdependence among Mbd2/NuRD, Mbd3/NuRD, 5mC, and 5hmC to maintain normal chromatin structure and gene regulation in ESCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evidence of methylation-dependent localization of Mbd3 and Mbd2 in bio-MBD datasets</title><p>Multiple studies have established that Mbd2, but not Mbd3, binds methylated DNA with higher affinity than unmethylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendrich and Bird, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). We previously found that Mbd3 occupies genomic regions containing 5hmC in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, we found that KD of <italic>Tet1</italic> results in a reduction of Mbd3 occupancy, and that KD of <italic>Mbd3</italic> results in a reduction in bulk 5hmC levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>), demonstrating interdependence between Mbd3 and 5hmC. These findings also lead to a straightforward prediction that cytosine methylation would be required for Mbd3 binding, since 5hmC is generated by oxidation of 5mC. However, Baubec et al. reported that both Mbd3 and Mbd2 occupancies at LMRs are minimally altered in TKO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2013</xref>), arguing against our previous findings regarding Mbd3 and long-standing models of Mbd2 function.</p><p>To assess the discrepancies between these studies, we first re-analyzed the datasets from Baubec et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). There were two ChIP-seq replicates for the biotin-tagged <italic>Mbd3a</italic> isoform (bio-Mbd3a) in wild-type (WT) cells and a single replicate reported for bio-Mbd3a ChIP-seq in TKO cells (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We initially focused on genomic binding at the subset of LMRs that are larger than 150 bp and at least 3 kb away from another LMR or an unmethylated region (hereafter denoted as 'LMR subset') that was utilized in the prior study. We observed only a modest reduction (~28%) in bio-Mbd3a occupancy at the LMR subset upon loss of DNA methylation in TKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), similar to the original observation (see Figure 7A of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al. (2013)</xref>). However, when we assessed the change in overall bio-Mbd3a enrichment by examining all bio-Mbd3a peaks (called from pooled WT bio-Mbd3a ChIP-seq reads), we observed a ~75% reduction in bio-Mbd3a binding in TKO cells relative to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). These data demonstrate that Mbd3a relies heavily on DNA methylation in order to bind chromatin in ES cells and that confining analysis to a subset of LMRs obscures the global impact of methylation on Mbd3 localization.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21964.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of bio-Mbd3 and bio-Mbd2 ChIP-seq datasets reveals methylation-dependent chromatin localization in ES cells.</title><p>Mbd3 and Mbd2 ChIP-seq datasets from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2013</xref>) were obtained from GEO (GSE39610; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

We observed high variation among the three replicates for bio-Mbd2 in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–I</xref>). For example, while two WT replicates are modestly enriched for bio-Mbd2 binding relative to the two TKO replicates (~10% reduction) at the LMR subset, the third bio-Mbd2 ChIP-seq experiment in WT cells has a much higher peak, implying a much larger (~50%) reduction in occupancy in TKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Similar disparities were observed at other regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). Importantly, when we examined the effect of 5mC loss over all peaks of bio-Mbd2 binding, bio-Mbd2 enrichment was reduced to near background levels in TKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Furthermore, we observed considerable gene-by-gene differences in the binding profiles among WT bio-Mbd2 replicates, where individual locations that are lowly bound in one replicate are highly bound in another replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). Taken together, these analyses demonstrate bio-Mbd3 and bio-Mbd2 strongly depend on cytosine methylation for normal chromatin association. Furthermore, poor concordance between biological replicates was also found for several other MBD proteins profiled in Baubec et al.

To validate our findings in a manner independent of the antibodies targeting the endogenous proteins, we genetically FLAG-tagged endogenous Mbd2 (hereafter <italic>Mbd2-3XFLAG</italic>) or Mbd3 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>]; hereafter <italic>Mbd3abc-3XFLAG</italic>) and performed ChIP-qPCR or ChIP-seq, respectively, in <italic>EGFP</italic> KD, <italic>Dnmt1</italic> KD, and <italic>Tet1</italic> KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). We again observed a reduction in Mbd2-3XFLAG and Mbd3abc-3XFLAG enrichment following knockdown of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> or <italic>Tet1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>), despite lower overall enrichment than we observed with antibodies against the endogenous proteins. FLAG ChIP-seq and ChIP-qPCR for Mbd3abc-3XFLAG in <italic>Mbd3</italic> KD cells and for Mbd2-3XFLAG in <italic>Mbd2</italic> KD cells confirmed the reduced ChIP signals expected in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). Finally, to test whether overexpression of <italic>Mbd3a</italic> (analogous to the bio-Mbd3a ChIP-seq studies in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2013</xref>]) resulted in altered genomic binding relative to endogenously expressed <italic>Mbd3</italic>, and whether chromatin binding by overexpressed Mbd3a was altered upon <italic>Dnmt1</italic> KD or <italic>Tet1</italic> KD, we overexpressed <italic>Mbd3a</italic>-<italic>3XFLAG</italic> in ES cells and performed ChIP-qPCR experiments upon KD of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, <italic>Tet1</italic>, or <italic>EGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Although Mbd3a-3XFLAG enrichment was reduced relative to endogenously expressed Mbd3abc-3XFLAG, there was a decrease in Mbd3a-3XFLAG binding upon <italic>Dnmt1</italic> or <italic>Tet1</italic> depletion at all eight promoter-proximal regions examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate a requirement for <italic>Dnmt1</italic> and <italic>Tet1</italic> for Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding throughout the genome of ES cells. Although the dependence of Mbd3 and Mbd2 on DNA methylation (or <italic>Dnmt1</italic>) and the requirement of Mbd3 for hydroxymethylation (or <italic>Tet1</italic>) were consistent with our previous findings and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chatagnon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Menafra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>), the requirement of Mbd2 for <italic>Tet1</italic> has not been previously observed. We will address this finding below.</p><p>One argument suggesting the data in Yildirim et al. may not be valid was that Mbd3 binding was not observed at enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menafra and Stunnenberg, 2014</xref>). In this study, we used H3K4me1 as a marker for enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>), which is an imperfect marker for putative enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore re-analyzed the Yildirim data at gene-distal DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs), which represent active enhancers and some additional regulatory features, and observed a peak of Mbd3 binding that was strongly reduced upon <italic>Tet1</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Similarly, our new Mbd3 and Mbd2 ChIP-seq datasets exhibit robust enrichment at gene-distal DHSs that is reduced upon <italic>Dnmt1</italic> KD or <italic>Tet1</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>), confirming Mbd3 binds to these regions in a manner dependent on the cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The catalytic activity of Tet1 is required for proper chromatin localization by Mbd3 and Mbd2 in ES cells</title><p>Although our KD studies demonstrated <italic>Tet1</italic> is necessary for chromatin binding by Mbd3 and Mbd2, the Tet1 protein has been shown, in some cases, to regulate gene expression independently of its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). These findings leave open the possibility that Tet1 functions in Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding independently of its roles in DNA hydroxymethylation and demethylation. To test whether the catalytic activity of Tet1 is necessary for Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding in ES cells, we generated homozygous catalytically inactive <italic>Tet1</italic> mutant (<italic>Tet1c.i.</italic>) ES cells.

Here, we sought to address these conflicting data. Several differences in study design may help explain some of the discrepancies between our previous studies and those reported by Baubec et al. First, whereas endogenous Mbd3 was examined in ChIP studies performed in Yildirim et al., the bio-tagged Mbd3 in Baubec et al. was overexpressed [see Figure S1F from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al. (2013)</xref>]. Since overexpression of proteins can promote promiscuous binding as assayed by ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baresic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez et al., 2003</xref>), it is possible some of the peaks of Mbd3 binding identified by this method are non-physiological. Second, all Mbd3 isoforms were immunoprecipitated in the Yildirim study, rather than the single largest isoform examined in Baubec et al. Third, whereas Yildirim et al. examined Mbd3 binding to promoter-proximal regions of genes, Baubec et al. focused mainly on a subset of LMRs and ICPs. Regardless of these differences, comprehensive analysis of the data available from Baubec et al. revealed a strong reduction in Mbd3 binding in TKO cells at the majority of bio-Mbd3 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Similarly, our re-analysis of the bio-Mbd2 ChIP-seq data also revealed a strong reliance on DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p><p>To more thoroughly address the role of DNA methylation in the regulation of Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding in ES cells, we performed a series of ChIP-seq experiments for endogenous Mbd3 and Mbd2 in <italic>Dnmt1</italic> or <italic>Tet1</italic> KD cells. Duplicate ChIP-seq experiments performed with polyclonal antibodies targeting the endogenous MBD proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), independent triplicate ChIP-qPCR experiments performed with the same polyclonal antibodies in <italic>Dnmt1</italic> KD, <italic>Tet1</italic> KD, or <italic>Dnmt1</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and ChIP experiments performed on endogenously C-terminal FLAG-tagged versions of Mbd2 or Mbd3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) all yielded the same result: depletion of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> or <italic>Tet1</italic> results in reduced binding of Mbd3 and Mbd2 throughout the genome. Furthermore, experiments utilizing point mutations that eliminate the catalytic activity of Tet1 demonstrated the DNA demethylase activity of Tet1 is necessary for Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and (along with data from <italic>Dnmt1</italic> KO cells) show that our findings are not an artifact of potential off-target effects from RNAi. These data, together with a re-evaluation of published data, conclusively demonstrates the requirement for DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation for normal chromatin binding by Mbd3 and Mbd2 in ES cells.</p><p>Having confirmed a role for cytosine methylation in Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding to DNA in ES cells, we sought to further investigate the mechanism through which DNA methylation regulates binding of these factors. Previous studies revealed that Mbd3 is required for 5mC at some locations in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Latos et al., 2012</xref>), but may prevent methylation at other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui and Irudayaraj, 2015</xref>). Our data examining 5mC and 5hmC enrichment genome-wide reveals a decrease in global 5mC and 5hmC levels in ES cells depleted of Mbd3 or Mbd2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This decrease is likely due to the reduction in Dnmt1 binding throughout the genome we observed in <italic>Mbd3</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with findings in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morey et al., 2008</xref>), although other mechanisms may also contribute to this phenomenon.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Günther et al., 2013</xref>), we found that Mbd3 and Mbd2 binding overlap at many locations. This observation, along with the fact that <italic>Mbd3</italic> is necessary for normal DNA methylation, suggested <italic>Mbd3</italic> might be indirectly necessary for chromatin binding by Mbd2. We therefore investigated the potential interplay between these factors and found that Mbd2 requires <italic>Mbd3</italic> for binding, and vice versa, throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Together these data support a model in which Mbd3 and Mbd2 rely on DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation for binding, while these factors are also required for DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation. Such a model must be consistent with the following observations: (1) DNA methylation is necessary for proper Mbd2 and Mbd3 localization (as shown by <italic>Dnmt1</italic> KD and KO experiments described in this study). (2) DNA demethylation is required for proper Mbd2 and Mbd3 localization (<italic>Tet1</italic> KD and <italic>Tet1c.i.</italic> studies here, and data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al. (2011)</xref>). (3) Mbd2 binds DNA harboring 5mC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendrich and Bird, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>) and Mbd3 binds DNA binding 5hmC much more strongly than DNA containing 5mC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>). (4) <italic>Mbd2</italic> and <italic>Mbd3</italic> are required for normal levels of both 5mC and 5hmC (MeDIP/hMeDIP, TLC, and other experiments described in this study). (5) Dnmt1 localization depends on <italic>Mbd3</italic> (ChIP studies described in this study). (6) RNAi-mediated depletion of <italic>Mbd2</italic>, <italic>Mbd3</italic>, <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, <italic>Tet1</italic>, or <italic>Chd4</italic> results in misregulation of many of the same genes (expression profiling described in this study). Therefore, we propose that these two MBD proteins and DNA modifications all contribute to a regulatory loop that modulates gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Consequently, upon disruption of any component of this regulatory loop (through depletion, KO, or mutation of the catalytic domain), the gene regulatory outcome is similar in ES cells: binding of both NuRD complexes is reduced, altering gene expression. While the molecular mechanisms underlying these interdependencies are unclear, physical interactions between Mbd3 and DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation proteins have previously been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yildirim et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, predictive studies utilizing published ChIP-seq datasets suggest interdependency between the Mbd2 and Tet1 proteins in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>How widespread are the interdependencies among Mbd2, Mbd3, and the DNA modification machinery? <italic>Mbd2</italic> KO mice are viable and fertile, whereas <italic>Mbd3</italic> KO mice are lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hendrich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaji et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reynolds et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Mbd3</italic> is required for ES cell differentiation, suggesting Mbd3 may be sufficiently functional in the absence of Mbd2 for its essential roles in vivo. Consistent with this possibility, <italic>Mbd3</italic> KD had a stronger effect on some shared Mbd2/Mbd3 target genes than <italic>Mbd2</italic> KD in ES cells. Alternatively, Mbd2/Mbd3 interdependence may be lost during differentiation, or within specific lineages, which may partially account for the different phenotypes of <italic>Mbd2</italic> and <italic>Mbd3</italic> KO mice. Further studies will be required to distinguish between these possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse ES cells were derived from E14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooper et al., 1987</xref> RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_C320">CVCL_C320</ext-link>) and were cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;DNA methylation directs genomic localization of Mbd2 and Mbd3 in ES cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that we cannot publish your manuscript in its present form.</p><p>All reviewers agree that your manuscript addresses an important area of research, that it adds important information to a high-profile controversy, and that the new experiments and re-analysis of older data are a valuable contribution to the field. As such, your study remains of high interest to <italic>eLife</italic> such that a suitably revised manuscript could be reconsidered. There are a number of important technical concerns that we think might take some additional time to address. One of the most important pertains to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, as discussed by the first two reviewers. A more objective and quantitative analysis of the microarray expression profile is necessary to make the strong statements about high correlation. Additionally, we agreed that antibody specificity could be an issue and that this study would add positively to the debate if the authors could confirm their IP data in two ways. First, with FLAG ChIP of tagged MBDs to validate their MBD ChIPseq data. Second, with a parallel approach such as TLC to validate their MeDIP and hMeDIP analysis.

Recent studies show high steady-state levels of 5hmC and effector proteins that preferentially bind to this modification and imply that 5hmC is an abundant form of cytosine modification in mammalian cells. The extent to which Mbd2 and Mbd3 interact with these modifications has been controversial.</p><p>In this study the authors investigate the interdependency of Mbd2 and Mbd3 for chromatin localization through binding to DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation sites respectively; they also study how the levels of these two Mbd proteins impact the stability of these two cytosine modifications. The requirement of Tet1 catalytic activity for the localization of Mbd3 and Mbd2 and effect of Mbd3 depletion on Dnmt1 localization are important and interesting findings. The paper offers an advance by providing a good argument that there is strong interdependence between these two binding proteins and the two covalent modifications that they recognize.</p><p>I found this paper interesting, but have a few points that are mainly related to helping to resolve the controversies in this area.</p><p>1) The interdependence of 5mC and 5hmC levels relative to Mbd2 and Mbd3 was demonstrated with MeDIP and hMeDIP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

The finding that NuRD mediated deacetylation of H3K27 is necessary for PRC2- mediated H3K27 methylation at many loci (Reynolds et al., 2012) complicates use of PRC2 KDs as outgroups.

We have added discussion of these findings in reference to our model in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion and modified our model to remove the arrows between Mbd2/3 and Tet1 to avoid conflating hypothetical functional connections (that are unnecessary for the model) with connections that are established from data in this manuscript and the published literature. Furthermore, we added more discussion regarding the phenotypes observed in mice and ES cells and their implications with regards to our findings (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>LMR terminology should be very explicit at its first mention, subsection “Unbiased analyses of published data reveal methylation-dependent localization of Mbd3 and Mbd2”, second paragraph.

We utilized the same criteria defined by Baubec et al. to generate the LMR subset (remove LMRs smaller than 150bp and those within 3kb of another LMR or a UMR) from the total set of LMRs defined in Stadler et al., 2011 (which we now refer to as “total LMRs”). By the definition of LMRs in Stadler et al., total LMRs have on average 30% methylation, although they range in methylation from 10- 50%. We found that 72% of the LMRs excluded by Baubec et al. (i.e., present within total LMRs but not the LMR subset) were excluded because they are less than 150bp in size, and are therefore smaller than those included in the LMR subset. To address whether these “removed LMRs” are enriched for TF binding sites, we examined the frequencies of 319 known TF motifs in each of the LMR subset, removed LMRs, or total LMR locations. We found on average that the LMR subset had 12.5 motifs per LMR, removed LMRs had 13, and total LMRs had 12.7, suggesting that all three classes of LMRs have similar representation of TF binding sites. Closer examination of the differences between total LMRs and the LMR subset showed that removed LMRs were more highly methylated and hydroxymethylated (compare levels of 5mC and 5hmC in <italic>EGFP</italic> KD for removed LMRs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D</xref> to total LMRs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B</xref> and the LMR subset shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>; we observe a 5mC peak height of 1.48, 0.96, and 2.64 for total, subset, and removed LMRs, respectively and a 5hmC peak height of 1.51, 1.16, and 2.25 for total, subset, and removed LMRs, respectively).

Along with finding that Mbd2 and Mbd3 are necessary for normal chromatin localization by the other, we also found that both factors are necessary for normal levels of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation – a very surprising finding in our opinion, and a finding that will have to be considered when mutants/KDs of MBD proteins are used in future studies.

On the other hand, <italic>Tet1</italic> single KO and <italic>Tet1 Tet2</italic> double KO ESCs are reported to exhibit a skewed differentiation profile (Dawlaty et al., 2011, Dawlaty et al., 2013), although <italic>Tet1 Tet2</italic> double KO mice develop to term and have only modest phenotypes (Dawlaty et al., 2013). Because of these somewhat confusing results and the fact that our ES cell data do not address any of these differentiation or developmental phenotypes, we have confined our conclusions in the revised manuscript to the roles of these factors in gene regulation in ES cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: I found this paper interesting, but have a few points that are mainly related to helping to resolve the controversies in this area.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The interdependence of 5mC and 5hmC levels relative to Mbd2 and Mbd3 was demonstrated with MeDIP and hMeDIP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).
